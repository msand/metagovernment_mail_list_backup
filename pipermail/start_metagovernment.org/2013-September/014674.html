<PRE>I'll try to answer questions about scoping and such, so you understand
the test setup.  Then I'll join you as a participant.

All of us in this thread are participants in the governance test.
Just to speak is enough.  We're an open, topical community defined by
the boundaries of the topic we're discussing.  It's like we're in a
country where the borders, rather than being drawn in a geographic
space, are instead drawn in topical space.  But the topic hasn't been
defined yet.  So we're in a country with no definite borders and no
name.  This is why we have an opportunity for self-governance.  If we
do it right, then we can govern the whole community (whatever we
define it to be) as such.  Here's a device that'll tell us if we're
doing it right: <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/</A>

It's a public mirror.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror</A>
A public mirror shows the total image of a topical community without
respecting any borders aside from those of the chosen topic.  Our
particular mirror assumes that we're discussing that topic right now,
which is why it shows this thread.  Otherwise it knows nothing about
us.  It'll just sit there waiting for further instructions.  It'll
listen to all the participants in the community (initially this
thread) and accept our governance.  The success of that governance
attempt will then be reflected in the image that the mirror shows us.
A public mirror is fairly easy to operate on a small scale, even a
clumsy prototype like this one (with just C and I cranking the gears
at the moment); but still, it cannot reflect a true image of the
community, one that we'll accept and identify with, unless it's well
governed by the community as a whole.  It's technically infeasible
within an open society.

So the mirror is like a canary in a coal mine.  But it's also useful
for other things aside from breaking when it's abused.  It's the only
thing that shows an open, topical community as a whole.  Nothing else
provides that service.  It's ours to provide, or it's nobody's.

No, it's separate to begin with.  But we can redefine the scope at any
time, so it could change.

It needn't stay linear.  My promise that we'll learn the result &quot;right
here in this thread&quot; might be broken if we're successful, because
self-governance cannot be bound by limits.  But even a failure could
be helpful, if only to show that you're right after all; we're not
ready yet.  And to show why.

We live in a civilization that's headed in direction D, where D is
undefined.  This is an unsolved problem.  Meantime we're running a
facility that shows us the total of all open discussions in the world
on the topic of T, where T is undefined.  It's possible that an
attempt to solve the T problem will help us with the D problem.
Although I don't know of a particular solution, I do know that Metagov
is the best place for raising this kind of issue; so I'm throwing it
in the ring as a challenge for all of us.

Mike
