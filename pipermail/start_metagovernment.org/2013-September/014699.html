<PRE>Catching up on my reading and somewhere in this thread I was smacked hard by a wall:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Wall_of_text">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Wall_of_text</A>

I'm not sure what the solution is, but I can't imagine many people are following this thread very closely by this point. What do we do?

</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Participation: Through Proposing
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i>      formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i>      ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)

</I>&gt;<i> But because time moves on, more iterations are possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Good thing is, the &quot;voting shortcut&quot; allows people to act even though they havent

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   5. Decision Rule: No Unresolved Objections
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision rule for group decisions is that a proposal is
</I>&gt;<i>      cleared to be implemented at the point that it faces no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i>      objections. Objections are proposed. Objections are resolved
</I>&gt;<i>      through successive, recursive proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a feeling this is not precise enough.
</I>&gt;<i> If i propose something, it's immediately effective until someone raises an objection.
</I>&gt;<i> Then i could just abandon it, propose something slightly different that then has no objections yet.
</I>&gt;<i> I could go on forever doing so. Sounds exhausting and destructive in behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> What about if i decide to build a house and 5 people join me, then someone raises an objection,
</I>&gt;<i> but just to stop us from building that house, even though he doesnt intend to participate at all.
</I>&gt;<i> ...sucks!
</I>&gt;<i> Next thing, ...whats a valid objections? how do u decide whats valid and whats not?
</I>&gt;<i> This is totally blurry as i have already said in previous emails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So i cannot support the above as long as its that blurry.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   6. What resolves (can resolve) an objection?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      One form of answer might be to accumulate a list of use-case
</I>&gt;<i>      examples, the way that case law accumulates precedent-setting cases.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (We resolve objections routinely, in ordinary conversations.
</I>&gt;<i>      Example: &quot;Now I know what you are going to say, but ... &quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Case Law is often not very coherent and gives the judicative legislative powers.
</I>&gt;<i> Its also very beaurocratic, and that will not make the process FAST,
</I>&gt;<i> which i feel is a requirement if there shall be any chance that people might adopt it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   7. What is a valid objection?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (list of criteria?)
</I>&gt;<i>      (list of types?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: You asked ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I know i asked, and u proposed case law, and i said what i think of it above.
</I>&gt;<i> Currently i have a feeling that this &quot;valid objections&quot; thing is like &quot;travel back in time by going faster than light&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ... doesnt exist :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   8. List of Intersubjective Criteria
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Can we create a list of &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot;, that we use in
</I>&gt;<i>      ordinary discourse to discriminate between valid and invalid
</I>&gt;<i>      proposals (including proposed objections)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: You requested this list.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (I seem to recall reading somewhere that some say three types of
</I>&gt;<i>      criteria are used: logical, true, and authentic.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Somebody with a strong philosophy background might be able to
</I>&gt;<i>      score us this list, or show us that it does not exist.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be interested in more background knowledge, because currently,
</I>&gt;<i> i think it might be possible to grow such a list of intersubjective criteria for various things, but...
</I>&gt;<i> 1. It might become huge and even overwhelming, thus: useless in practice
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It might be very incomplete and rarely usable in practice
</I>&gt;<i> ...so if there should be such a thing, the process and how its maintained and fed back into discussion have to be awesome.
</I>&gt;<i> Dont have a clue how to do that yet. (but there might be a way)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   9. Process To Create Relevant Criteria List
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Can we formulate the general rule/process that generates the
</I>&gt;<i>      criteria list for a specific proposal that is made?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: You asked for this.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> I feel, the easiest way might be, if someone proposes a rule and if &quot;all&quot; others confirm it, its valid amongst them,
</I>&gt;<i> until one raises an objection, thus he withdraws himself from that group.
</I>&gt;<i> That way, all kinds of groups have there rules and they can copy an paste (steal from each other)
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Open Source Github Effect :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some &quot;criteria&quot; might become &quot;battle tested&quot; over time and eventually will turn out to be pretty useful.
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;hard thing&quot; about this is, to track all those criteria and rules and know at every moment to whom they apply and when to update, and so on...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  10. Apply All Relevant Proposal Filters To Each Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Our new decision process must adequately solve the problem of
</I>&gt;<i>      reliably and objectively applying all existing and relevant
</I>&gt;<i>      potential objections (a.k.a. &quot;relevant criteria&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;proposal
</I>&gt;<i>      filters&quot;) to each new proposal. (There may be hundreds of relevant
</I>&gt;<i>      filters for a particular new proposal, that must be drawn from the
</I>&gt;<i>      general filter pool that may contain millions ...) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (The Blinap design addresses this problem. If there are other
</I>&gt;<i>      designs that do, I don't know about them.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I feel, that because those criteria only exist between people who confirmed it, it wont be that many and depending on the group who is discussing stuff, it will differ.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine, that when this process will go on for some time, then some very useful and widely used criteria will emerge and people will manualy apply them (and because they are easy to apply and satisfying most of the time, thats why the criteria emerged as a good one over time)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So when people have manually found out good criteria and applied them often, then one might be able to encode those criteria and try to automate the process of applying those emerged criteria (just mimic or copy the way people apply it manually with an algorithm)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So then some criteria might be applied manually and some new will emerge (because people now have more time, because some criteria is applied automatically, that they find new, more specialised criteria) ...at some point, u will automate those criteria too, and so on...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> AT THAT TIME, it will be possible, like u proposed above, to really automate the application of filters to proposal and so on... but its impossible to do this now, because no one knows how those criteria might look like and how to apply them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you artificially come up with a system that will work IF people create criteria and proposals in a certain form, then it will not be adopted.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats why you have to take another route. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> It has to grow over time, i believe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  11. Objective Interpretation of Proposal Filters
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Our new decision process must adequately solve the problem of
</I>&gt;<i>      making the intrepretation of existing (agreed-upon) &quot;relevant
</I>&gt;<i>      criteria&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;proposal filters&quot;) as objective as possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (There is probably a better way to state this proposal. When
</I>&gt;<i>      judges and juries apply laws made by others, they are doing the
</I>&gt;<i>      same sort of work, which is held to an &quot;objective interpretation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      standard.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most &quot;reliable&quot; way might be, (like described above) to let people come up with criteria, fork/merge/mix&amp;match/steal/copy from each other, until some criteria are &quot;liked&quot; by lots of people. Then let them apply those and at some point, just mimic how people apply those criteria.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  12. Professional Application of Proposal Filters
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Our new decision process must automate/professionalize application
</I>&gt;<i>      of agreed-upon proposal filters, so that general participants can
</I>&gt;<i>      concentrate on edge cases and considerations, where experience is
</I>&gt;<i>      lacking and/or opinions differ.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: this is my attempt to state your proposal.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Interpretation by professionals in tandem with interpretation by
</I>&gt;<i>      general participants can make for a more reliable system. The
</I>&gt;<i>      Blinap design has this, and includes checks on the professionals.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but (again, as said above)
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think its possible from day 1.
</I>&gt;<i> At first its all manually (although you could give people tools like: buttons, autocompletion search, other stuff...) to make it easy to create and agree upon criteria and apply those in discussions, rinse and repeat.
</I>&gt;<i> ...then, over time, some stable criterias might emerge and some standard way of applying those and those can be copied/mimiced by algorithms to automate that stuff (giving people a veto or something)
</I>&gt;<i> ...so in essence, i think this fully automated application of filters is a long term goal and the question is, whats the path that will lead to that goal.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe its possible to have it right from the start.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  13. How many objections can be raised by people?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (No limit to the number or recursive depth of proposed objections?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> +1
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  14. How long will the process of resolving objections take?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Decision made in three days if there are no new objections?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like instant decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> It also depends on who is affected to what degree.
</I>&gt;<i> If i propose something like (i will make 20 situps now), then why should people have the right to raise objections?
</I>&gt;<i> If i propose death penalty, then ok, ...others should have the right to raise objections :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The universe is one and on a very abstract perspective, everything affects everything.
</I>&gt;<i> I hate arbitrary &quot;deadlines&quot;, like &quot;x days&quot;. I like fluid behavior, like, as soon as there is enough support, its ok, as soon as there isnt enough support anymore, then stop it.
</I>&gt;<i> So eventually today, not enough people support death penalty, so it goes away, tomorrow they do, next day, they dont.
</I>&gt;<i> BUT THEN: does it only apply to all those who participate? or to the whole planet? or only the country?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To put it differently, whats the SCOPE of proposals? How will you decide upon it?
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously, the question about death penalty has a larger scope then the question whether i will do 20 situps now or not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  15. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: this is your proposal. I guess you intend that &quot;fairness&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      be a criterion in assessing proposed decision processes. If you
</I>&gt;<i>      could elaborate the proposal a bit -- on its own thread -- that
</I>&gt;<i>      would be great. What constitutes &quot;fair&quot;?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hard question.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope, this question solves itself, if all the others above and below find answers.
</I>&gt;<i> For example: how do u determine the SCOPE of proposals?
</I>&gt;<i> Where do i need to opt-out? Where do i need to opt-in?
</I>&gt;<i> When can i not opt-in, even if i want?
</I>&gt;<i> Where can i not opt-out even if i want?
</I>&gt;<i> ...and whats the reasoning behind the answers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No matter what the process will look like, every question you could ask about the process should have an answer (that means a reasoning behind it, why it was created that way) ...and everyone should be able to agree with this abstract reasoning or propose something better.
</I>&gt;<i> So if people can agree on the abstract reasoning, then it might be considered fair...
</I>&gt;<i> (again, just a shot from the hip :P ...does it make sense?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  16. Structured Decision Process
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      There has to be a structured process, or at least a set of
</I>&gt;<i>      tools/options that each participant could take in order to raise
</I>&gt;<i>      objections or mark objections raised by others as invalid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: again this is your proposal. Is the proposal merely
</I>&gt;<i>      distinguishing between structured and unstructured, or are there
</I>&gt;<i>      more specific criteria that the structuring must satisfy?) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Feel free to consult with Bentley, who is all over the
</I>&gt;<i>      structuring issue.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I prefer &quot;as unstructured as possible&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Create structure only where it is useful and destroy it as soon as its usefulness is questionable.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not have a holistic or complete all issues encompassing list what criteria that process must satisfy, but a few things that i think are important are:
</I>&gt;<i> - be (not) allowed to opt in/out
</I>&gt;<i> - scope of proposal [thats related to the opt in/out thing, if not identical]
</I>&gt;<i> - speed
</I>&gt;<i> - flexibility
</I>&gt;<i> - simplicity
</I>&gt;<i> - reasoning (no matter who the structure looks like, every aspect of it has to have a reasoning, so its possible to question the process structure and evolve it further)
</I>&gt;<i> ... guess theres more to it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  17. Meta Process to Improve Decision System
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      There must (eventually) be a meta process that can improve the
</I>&gt;<i>      rules surrounding that structured process or set of tools/options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: again your proposal. Ready to be put onto its own thread,
</I>&gt;<i>      and elaborated.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (And also, the Blinap design has this as an intrinsic feature.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Think i scrateched that in the previous question.
</I>&gt;<i> A very important aspect is to capture the &quot;reasoning&quot; behind any decision, so you have something to start with when a &quot;system is to be improved&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> A second thing is, u should only be able to change the system for future decisions, not for those already made.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  18. Decision System Must Evolve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      It must be ensured that people can evolve the process on their
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      own, based on their experience.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: Do you have a list of design criteria to propose that can
</I>&gt;<i>      be used in evaluating proposed process designs, and that will
</I>&gt;<i>      ensure that the selected process can evolve?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (And also, the Blinap design has this as an intrinsic feature.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still think, that the easiest way might be, people self select what they opt-into and what not.
</I>&gt;<i> It has to be PUBLIC, so everyone can look it up in what kinds of rules people opt-in
</I>&gt;<i> (So people can copy/streal from others)
</I>&gt;<i> That alone might be able to solve everything.
</I>&gt;<i> Funny thing is, its very structured and very unstructured at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> Its totally unstructured if you approach this kind of proposal from a &quot;waterfall process perspective&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Its very structured if you approach it more from a &quot;statistical perspective&quot; and how those core mechanisms, like:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. criteria might create proposals, 2. criteria might be copied by other people, 3. discussions between people might apply those criteria that people involved in the discussion all agrere upon, 4. all criteria can be looked up by everyone on other peopls &quot;criteria pages&quot; (after all, only those criteria go there, which people opted in free willingly, and they can opt out any time they want), .....
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you have a set of &quot;mechanisms&quot; and then discussion activity, where those mechanisms can be used based on motivations of people, its totally possible to statistically reason about how the overall system might evolve.
</I>&gt;<i> In that way, there is structure, even if its NOT WATERFALL AT ALL :-)
</I>&gt;<i> (There is &quot;Macro Structure&quot;, but there might be no visible &quot;Micro Structure&quot;, as in &quot;Waterfall Processes&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  19. The process must be FAST.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Speed is important, because the faster it is (even if its less
</I>&gt;<i>      perfect), the more objections can be handled. A &quot;perfect process&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>      that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be included in
</I>&gt;<i>      measuring the value of the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: Do you have a list of design criteria to propose that can
</I>&gt;<i>      be used in evaluating proposed process designs, and that will
</I>&gt;<i>      ensure that the selected process is FAST?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;light bulb&quot; was invented in many places in parallel, so where many other inventions or innovations or how to call them.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the same is true for discussions, thus its totally possible to evaluate how much time certain discussions need.
</I>&gt;<i> There might even be discussions that pop up again and again, like: what do we wanna do next week in our free time?
</I>&gt;<i> Or how to plan an event efficiently?
</I>&gt;<i> So its possible to measure discussion speed to result (with and without a certain structuring element), thus its possible to compare.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing would be &quot;time to stable result&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is a long discussion, but then there is a stable result (what stable means i dont know, but guess we can find heuristics)
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there is a fast discussion, with a result thats immediately afterwards questioned again, and therefor there is many iterations until a stable result emerges.
</I>&gt;<i> So its possible to compare both methods.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (For sure, it depends what kind of people discuss and if they are coming from very different backgrounds or have very different points of view)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So yes, its not easy to measure it, but even if the &quot;measuring&quot; is a bit fuzzy, its better than nothing, and  because the process and/or structure itself will evolve through people evolving it, the &quot;speed argument&quot; most likely will feed in as an argument during discussion and is not so much a &quot;hard rule&quot; of whatever initial system we might come up with :P

</I>&gt;<i>  20. System Should Survive Stupid People.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision making process must be able to operate efficiently
</I>&gt;<i>      and effectively even when &quot;stupid people&quot; are participating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: This proposal of yours is laying the groundwork to enable
</I>&gt;<i>      objecting to a proposed process design on the basis that stupid
</I>&gt;<i>      people could gum up the works. This proposal would create a type
</I>&gt;<i>      of valid objection with respect to proposed process designs.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, what i meant with it is, that the system itself and all the tools that support it, should have an educating effect.
</I>&gt;<i> It should educate people during the process on how to use it and somehow reward good usage, maybe even motivate other &quot;not so dumb&quot; participants to educate those who do not know yet.
</I>&gt;<i> If this &quot;education aspect&quot; is somehow incorporated, then i guess thats a pretty good starting point.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  21. No Gaming The System
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision process must adequately solve the problem that rich
</I>&gt;<i>      and powerful special interests will attempt to game the system,
</I>&gt;<i>      and corrupt it, as soon as doing so seems worthwhile to them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: again, this proposal of yours is laying the groundwork to
</I>&gt;<i>      enable objecting to a proposed process design on the basis that
</I>&gt;<i>      special interests could game it. This proposal would create a type
</I>&gt;<i>      of valid objection with respect to proposed process designs.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe i do not understand what you are trying to tell me... :P
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe its possible to make something bullet proof.
</I>&gt;<i> And if it has started once, its out of control and the system will evolve on its own through the participants who use it.
</I>&gt;<i> All we might be able to do is propose the first set of rules and we should have in mind, that we cannot hope for people to use the rules in an ethical way, but i bet we could count on people gaming it :P
</I>&gt;<i> Gaming is fun :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  22. No Veto or Filibuster
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision process must be effectively immune to filibustering
</I>&gt;<i>      and such, and must not give anyone straight veto power.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: This proposal again creates types of valid objections. We
</I>&gt;<i>      may need to sharpen the statement of the proposal, and may need to
</I>&gt;<i>      put in a list that shows what &quot;and such&quot; includes. Our design
</I>&gt;<i>      requirement proposal must be sufficiently clear and detailed to
</I>&gt;<i>      enable &quot;objective&quot; interpretation when applied to new proposals.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> hmm, now i might have a clue what you are trying to say.
</I>&gt;<i> But i do not believe, that those kinds of &quot;hopes&quot; i expressed (like it shouldnt be this or that way)
</I>&gt;<i> are of any use to create a &quot;list of valid objection rules&quot;. They are to fuzzy and i do not see how to make them unfuzzy to a degree that they could make up any useful argument.
</I>&gt;<i> Its more like &quot;empty rethorics&quot;. People know whats implied by them, but its more an emotional statement or something..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To put it differently, its a &quot;killer argument&quot;. It can always be applied and therefor is a &quot;straight veto by itself&quot; :P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  23. Teaching/Training Newcomers
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision system must adequately solve the problem of rapidly
</I>&gt;<i>      and efficiently and inexpensively bringing newcomers up to speed
</I>&gt;<i>      to enable them to begin participating effectively.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Sometimes this proposal will function as a basis for objections,
</I>&gt;<i>      and sometimes it will function as a basis for justifications --
</I>&gt;<i>      that defend against objections.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not so much a proposal. Same is true for the ones you listed above.
</I>&gt;<i> It's more my personal guidelines, when i approach &quot;the search for a good system or process&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  24. Compensation For Work Done
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision system should appropriately compensate workers for
</I>&gt;<i>      valuable work done. It should not depend on people &quot;working for free&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (This requires that there be processes that determine what the
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;appropriate compensation&quot; will be.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Blinap has such processes.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  25. Payment in Money (Not Stock)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision system should pay for work done in the form of money
</I>&gt;<i>      (not stock).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: :^) Since I am writing this draft of the proposal, I get to
</I>&gt;<i>      pick which way it goes. You are free to reverse the preference
</I>&gt;<i>      when you start your new thread, in which the relative pros and
</I>&gt;<i>      cons of the two forms of payment are discussed.) :^)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  26. Payment Through A Bank
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      To enable payment, the decision system needs to be associated with
</I>&gt;<i>      an online bank.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (In the beginning -- as our alpha testing phase -- we can if we
</I>&gt;<i>      wish create our own community money, and have our own private bank
</I>&gt;<i>      that handles that money.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  27. Partnerships &amp; Projects
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      It is proposed that all of the work of the decision system be done
</I>&gt;<i>      by partnerships, working under project contracts. (A partnership
</I>&gt;<i>      may have from 1 to 24 partners.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: this proposal is my agreement with and elaboration of your
</I>&gt;<i>      objection to the existence of the employer/employee relationship.
</I>&gt;<i>      If we say &quot;no&quot; to the employer/employee relation, we must say
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;yes&quot; to some other arrangement.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>  28. Project Contracts
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      Project contracts are proposed into the system library (which
</I>&gt;<i>      makes them available for selection), and then are selected from
</I>&gt;<i>      the library when it is time to initiate a project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: I *DO NOT* want us to create tasks/goals on the fly
</I>&gt;<i>      (without opportunity for all stakeholders to be notified and
</I>&gt;<i>      respond), and I *DO* want the process of initiating a project to
</I>&gt;<i>      be fast and easy. The two-step process above can in many cases
</I>&gt;<i>      accomplish both.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      WHAT NOW?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We now have in hand 28 proposals. A couple of the proposals might even be seen as &quot;bylaw&quot; sorts of things.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For each proposal, our aim (as a &quot;start group&quot; I guess -- not clear who &quot;we&quot; is at this point) is to decide whether to implement the proposal as it stands, or to not implement the proposal as it stands.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (At the scale of large-populations, we must conceptualize that a modified proposal is a new proposal. However, at this informal, community-scale stage of the game -- since we have no need to notify strangers all over the world (who are not on the mailing list) when a modification is made -- we can get away with on-the-fly informal modification of proposals. So &quot;as it stands&quot; becomes &quot;as it stands at the point that there are no more unresolved objections&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking to all readers of this email: When you read a proposal and have a response, the first thing you do is select the venue in which you wish to respond. You can respond by email to the list (create a new thread, for just that proposal), or you can make the proposal a new topic in AllAngles and respond to it there, or you can make the proposal a new topic in Vilfredo, TruthMapping, or any number of other venues, and then respond to it there. If you have selected a venue other than the email list, post a notification email to the list with a link to the proposal topic.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any proposal to which no one responds will be taken to be &quot;good to go&quot;. Since none of the proposals actually do anything so far as direct implementation, those &quot;good to go&quot; proposals will simply be available in the library (if we had a library) to serve as foundations for further proposing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (The &quot;question proposals&quot; are a special case: if no one responds to them, they remain unanswered -- though they will still be &quot;good to go&quot; as questions.)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In setting up such a system, proposals are made concerning

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Any time anybody sees a problem with the existing set of
</I>&gt;<i>     recognized valid objections, the existence of the problem can be
</I>&gt;<i>     proposed, and solutions (new kinds of valid objections, removal of
</I>&gt;<i>     existing valid objections, whatever) can be proposed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe in this.
</I>&gt;<i> Objections can be very specific to each proposal that is made, you cannot list all possible objections that could be made in response to all possible kind of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> That approach seems to be doomed. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;, that might not be perfect all the time but at least might be a good start that could be improved when experience gives one new insights. I think there has to be a structured process, or at least a set of tools/options that each participant could take in order to raise objections or mark objections raised by others as invalid. And eventually a meta process that can improve the rules surrounding that process or tools/options.
</I>&gt;<i> This must be a fair process (at least as fair as possible) and it must be ensured, that people can evolve it on their own, based on their experience.
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, it has to be a FAST PROCESS. Speed is important, because the faster it is (even if its less perfect), the more objections can be handled.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;perfect process&quot; that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be included in measuring the value of the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Any group of people that goes to the trouble of getting together
</I>&gt;<i>     and trying to set up such a system is trying to set up a system
</I>&gt;<i>     that will actually work. From the perspective of such a group, any
</I>&gt;<i>     possible problem that you see is a problem to be solved. You are
</I>&gt;<i>     very good at seeing problems. Just for fun, maybe you could try
</I>&gt;<i>     your hand at also seeing solutions to the problems that you see,
</I>&gt;<i>     so I don't have to do all the work. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, i do not see all the solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> Next thing is, i am not able to wear both hats at the same time (create solutions + see flaws in proposed solutions)
</I>&gt;<i> If someone puts forward solutions or a road to a solution, i can ask questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing is, i could try to propose a solution (like my EMAIL PROPOSAL) and others can ask questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> But i cant do both at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> ...and doing both at the same time is not only difficult but not much fun at all to me. And in the end, the important that stuff we are doing is, without fun, i cant stay motivated anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i>     long
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        as one participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous
</I>&gt;<i>        consent&quot;, right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; A really stupid group might indeed set up the system that
</I>&gt;<i>     way, and it would indeed then be just as bad as using the
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;unanimous consent&quot; decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hehe :-) If the method is only used by a couple of people, then maybe they are smart, maybe they are not so smart.
</I>&gt;<i> But the larger the group gets, the more likely it is, that &quot;stupid people&quot; might join in and therefor the process of how those rules are set up is very important.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not yet sure if that formal approach is any good at all, because right now, i feel like you might just shift the problem to the creation of DISCRIMINATING RULES, which have to be INTERPRETED too :-)
</I>&gt;<i> So you better come up with a process, that is not subject to interpretation or at least gives very little leeway and those process better cannot be abused to discriminate certain people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections from People with overweight are invalid when it comes to nuitrition issues&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections of minority group x are invalid when it comes to issues regarding y&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Thats very trivial and exteme examples, but you can craft examples which use brilliant rethorics and very subtle ways of discrimination, which are hard to detect if you are looking at it from the wrong perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think it might not be possible, all i'm saying is, that that would be a hard problem, and especially, because a FAST PROCESS is important (therefor it has not to be perfect, because you can repeat the process often for very atomic issues, because its fast).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be
</I>&gt;<i>     formalized
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        in a way so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what
</I>&gt;<i>        an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method
</I>&gt;<i>        different from &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Exactly. According to Habermas, such &quot;intersubjective
</I>&gt;<i>     criteria&quot; do exist, and are routinely applied during ordinary
</I>&gt;<i>     discourse. The &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule is tapping
</I>&gt;<i>     into that existing ability to discriminate, that exists in each of us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, that sounds good., but only because Habermas asserts it exists, doesnt mean it really does.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with any details of that issue, so if they do exist, but i dont know about them, then:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. can we create a list that lists all those &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot; (i suppose they will immediately make sense to me)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. can we formulate the general rule/process that generates that list for a specific proposal that is made? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be really interested to learn more about that, because if we would use that &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; thing, then better that list has to be really awesome and easy to use ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; ...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        possible to win something by doing so...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; You are suggesting that if the decision system is such that
</I>&gt;<i>     it rewards going crazy with success, then people will go crazy,
</I>&gt;<i>     and succeed. I agree with this. So, let's not set up a decision
</I>&gt;<i>     system that rewards going crazy with success.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, that would be a good thing, but i was refering to something else.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. + we have a &quot;decision system&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 2. + we have money (are funded)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. + we have success (that means, larger groups of people start to use the software tools)
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; then particular interests will try to game the &quot;decision system&quot; and they will use any imaginable technique (brilliant rethorics, bribes, playing with emotions a lot, and more...)
</I>&gt;<i> If the &quot;decision system&quot; cannot give good guidance, then it will be corrupted and then, not the &quot;decision system&quot; as it was thought up will GOVERN EVERYTHING, but the particular interests that succeeded in gaming the system in ways that were not anticipated by the &quot;decision system&quot; will really govern everything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe its not possible to make a &quot;bullet proof&quot; decision system, but we can try to come up with a good one and bake in a process that allows people to improve it over time, for example: after every time they gained new experience/insights after they have successfully defended the whole against a &quot;unfair move&quot; of a particular interest.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        because as long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can
</I>&gt;<i>        be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; You have again spotted a valid problem, and again lazily
</I>&gt;<i>     handed it over to me to solve. (In certain voting systems, this
</I>&gt;<i>     problem is called a &quot;filibuster&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is a &quot;filibuster&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> I did not lazily handed it over to you.
</I>&gt;<i> I only try to understand your approach. I'm very skeptic about that approach in general.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not say it might not be possible, just i dont see how it might be possible.
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal with setting/creating a mail server which easily allows to make &quot;things persistant&quot; so that they do not repeat in a discussion and move on from there ...one step at a time, because we gain new insights, because WE USE THE TOOL ourselve, because WE COULD NEED such a mechanism :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ...if you remember that in another thread people ask for stuff of the past and we come up with issues that it would be cool if this or that would be on the wiki and be up to date...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So i would like to start with the &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, implement it, use it right here to gain new insights and experience and then broaden our &quot;least/lowest common denominator, implement it, use it right here to gain new insights and experience and then broaden our &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, implement it, use it right here....
</I>&gt;<i> ...you get it :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, you want to start from a much higher level, by thinking the whole system through upfront. I believe it might be possible, but its very hard and exactly those questions i try to come up with is what we have to think through in order to have enough details so that we can really see if a certain approach is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my world, every theorey can be implemented in many ways, but if implemented correctly, then all those implementations are as good as the theory itself, because every implemented instance of that theory itself could be the theory and the theory one has implemented could be the implementation, that means, i believe its isomorphisms (the theory and all possible implementations)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know all the different parts involved in your theory, but if there is one basic element that could be implemented and used right away, while still retaining all the options necessary to implement the full thing, then lets start with that one basic element and implement it right away.
</I>&gt;<i> if we then use it, we can not only discuss things further, but gather experience around that basic elements and can more easily think of all the options that are possible to built on top and that will INCLUDE those options that are necessary for your theory :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     For us (the Metagovernment community), I will suggest that in the
</I>&gt;<i>     beginning the best way to approach finding solutions to this
</I>&gt;<i>     problem will be case-by-case. On each occasion that this problem
</I>&gt;<i>     actually occurs, we look for specific ways to solve the specific
</I>&gt;<i>     problem before us. As we accumulate specific solutions, we may see
</I>&gt;<i>     patterns that will enable us to come up with more general solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Very good, but it all happens inside of our mind. If there is tens or maybe even hundreds of those issues, we will discuss them, come up with a solution, eventually put them on the wiki, rinse and repeat. Every time we talk about a new solution of an issue, we have to bear in mind all those other solutotions we have come up with and also have to think about how they fit together and create synergy effects....
</I>&gt;<i> its a hard thing and if someone new enters the metagovernment space, he first has to study A LOT and might even come up with new issues to old solutions that we havent thought about yet.... that could go on for AGES ....actually it already does to some degree ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So how about teaching new people the ways of metagovernment, because they actually will use the tools and methods without really realizing it.
</I>&gt;<i> SO instead of self study, they will be educated during the process.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats why i think &quot;email&quot; is so important, even if there is other technology with which it would be much easier to craft prototypes.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that
</I>&gt;<i>        it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that things
</I>&gt;<i>     cannot
</I>&gt;<i>        get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; As you have noted in a previous email, we could start
</I>&gt;<i>     creating our own community money right now, and start trying to
</I>&gt;<i>     handle it responsibly. We don't have to wait.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But its not easy. Our community money could be &quot;shares&quot; that could be earned for doing something and will slowly deprecate over time eventually vanishing completely if one leaves the metagovernment community forever, but will start to grow again, as soon as one comes back in.
</I>&gt;<i> But it should not be a beaurocratic process, but a fast one. The issue we have to solve is, how to evaluate how many shares which people get and for what?
</I>&gt;<i> There needs to be a system where people can log in to see their amount of shares and what to do with them.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a huge undertaking and if you can spend those kind of shares or use them to have more votes than someone who just joined and so on...
</I>&gt;<i> ...its essentially some kind of &quot;democratic system&quot; that you design. Spending money itself can be compared to voting on something. It just has its own special set of rules surrounding it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I very much hope, some day we will implement something like that, but it has to start somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For Example:
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Allan has put up some &quot;job vacanccies&quot; around votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a good sign when it comes to shares/money, because Michael Allen creates a employer/employee relationship, that means, Michael Allen PAYS the employee so that the employee DOES what Michael Allen as &quot;the boss&quot; will COME UP with.
</I>&gt;<i> A better approach, but a much more difficult one would be to: SPLIT UP the project into &quot;tasks&quot; or at least &quot;goals&quot; that could be or should be accomplished by someone else + set a reward/bounty on those (a portion of shares or something).
</I>&gt;<i> These shares have to be granted by Michael Allen OR ... if he opens the issue to the community and the community agrees on its importance, it will be granted by several people, not just Michael Allan.
</I>&gt;<i> The one who takes on that &quot;task&quot; or &quot;mission&quot; could himself invite others to help him and give them part of the bounty.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In a perfect world, this bounty will always be SHARES of the Metagovernment Project as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But if you want to be able to create those &quot;tasks/goals&quot; on the fly and if you want it a fast process to determine the bounty (in terms of shares)&quot;, it has to be an easy and fast process.
</I>&gt;<i> the faster and easier it gets, the more often people might use it because the barrier in doing so is lower than anything else.
</I>&gt;<i> If its a difficult process, most simple tasks will not use the mechanism, but only huge tasks will and simple ones will be solved in non-standard ways between people who know each other...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hint: This again is a &quot;snippet&quot; of a solution i imagine that might solve issues but might also have problems i dont see and that should be questioned by you and others, so i can think of those and come up with answers (that way we would have changed HATS) ....

</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; For me, the metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is not about getting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        money to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;<i>        support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;<i>     domains
</I>&gt;<i>        (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out
</I>&gt;<i>        there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
</I>&gt;<i>        evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government
</I>&gt;<i>        form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by
</I>&gt;<i>        all the people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I think that we need all-of-above: we need the meta rules,
</I>&gt;<i>     and we need the right software systems, and we need the right
</I>&gt;<i>     practices, and so on. Everything is connected. Partial solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     generally wind up being no solutions at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, we need all of the above.
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree that &quot;partial solutions&quot; wind up being no solution at all.
</I>&gt;<i> And my reason for this is:
</I>&gt;<i> We already HAVE a complete system that solves all the issues life throws at us, you, me, everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> That solution is the status quo with all its imperfections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;partial solution&quot; that would be no solution at all is to me:
</I>&gt;<i> A transition from one complete solution (status quo) to another complete soltution (status quo COMPOSED/MERGED with feature x), where feature x is what you call partial solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you say with &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; or that we need a complete system means to me:
</I>&gt;<i> Merge the status quo with LOTS OF FEATURES at once.
</I>&gt;<i> Its hard to get that right and even if the theory is sound, its even harder to make lots of people change lots of habits over night, so they wont accept it.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if its perfect, it has to be introduced one feature at a time, so people have time to learn it and change their habits.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone knows that. In school you dont learn everything at once, but some thing after another.
</I>&gt;<i> So not even is it possible to introduce a &quot;partial solution&quot; a.k.a  a single feature x and introduce the next feature later, it is instead very much desirable to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> You start with basic features and bolt on more complex ones.
</I>&gt;<i> The same way you learn math ...not starting with universal sets algebra or category theory or calculus or game theory, but rather with basic stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BUT: If people have to learn basic stuff ANYWAY before they are able to use more advanced features, why not introduce the basic features first (our &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;) implement it, make them use it and learn on the way, so that we not only have our thoughts and theory, but also get feedback from the experience of implementing it and having it used. So chances increase we get feature x and y &quot;more right&quot; than without that practical feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And even if our tools grow to hundreds of features, its still important to only have basic features available at entry level and to not require all those advanced features, because people new to the system, because they joined the usage late, still have to learn the basics first.
</I>&gt;<i> ...and they wont read books, they want immediate results, they want the things to be intuitive and want to hack right away... like with writing an email :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to
</I>&gt;<i>     evolve
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>        over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular
</I>&gt;<i>        interests can corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such
</I>&gt;<i>        has failed. And by this I mean, if its possible for highly
</I>&gt;<i>     motivated
</I>&gt;<i>        particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money
</I>&gt;<i>        is involved and success manifests in one way or another), to
</I>&gt;<i>     corrupt
</I>&gt;<i>        the set of META RULES so that in essence the particular interests
</I>&gt;<i>        will be that thing which governs government, thus be the
</I>&gt;<i>        metagovernment, then we have accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Yes. Exactly. And that is what has happened in the world. We
</I>&gt;<i>     do in fact now have various special-interest &quot;metagovernments&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     that most people don't even know exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what we need to find is a &quot;merge process&quot; :-) that means tools and stuff that helps us to &quot;increase synchronisation&quot; between our thoughts through &quot;constant communication&quot; that is productive. There for we need helpful tools to automate parts of the discussion that can be automated (e.g. instead of someone to manually copy stuff from the email list to our wiki or instead of having someone to look up the email list archive.... and whatever else, maybe the system can do it for us)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe, even though all the &quot;metagovernment parties&quot; co-exist with the same goal, its ONLY because the degree of communication is not dense enough.
</I>&gt;<i> If it were, we could use every imaginable synergy effect and concentrate only about the edge cases where our experience and oppinions differ. we would learn about each others way to think and pull off experiments together to check our assumptions, and so forth...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The process doesnt have to be perfect, it must only be so good, that the &quot;rate of benefits through synchronisation via communication&quot; exceeds the &quot;rate of benefit by doing something on his own&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as thats the case, people will collaborate, because it gives you benefits faster.
</I>&gt;<i> So all we have to do is to lower the barriers and thats why SPEEED is vitally important, no matter what kind of process or system you come up with.

</I>&gt;<i>                         consent of the Metagov group before being
</I>&gt;<i>         implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>                  There
</I>&gt;<i>                         must be no unresolved objections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                         (paraphrased from Ned's response)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 Ned Conner said:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                     Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is
</I>&gt;<i>         to come
</I>&gt;<i>                     up with
</I>&gt;<i>                     good proposals, and to make good decisions with
</I>&gt;<i>         respect to
</I>&gt;<i>                     those
</I>&gt;<i>                     proposals, and to do good work in funding and
</I>&gt;<i>         implementing the
</I>&gt;<i>                     proposals that have successfully passed through
</I>&gt;<i>         the &quot;no
</I>&gt;<i>                     unresolved
</I>&gt;<i>                     objections&quot; gauntlet.  (Note that I have very slyly
</I>&gt;<i>                     slipped in my
</I>&gt;<i>                     preference that we use &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         as our
</I>&gt;<i>                     decision
</I>&gt;<i>                     rule ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                     As a community, we do not have enough resources to
</I>&gt;<i>         support
</I>&gt;<i>                     every
</I>&gt;<i>                     proposed &quot;start effort&quot; (meaning project start?).
</I>&gt;<i>         We must
</I>&gt;<i>                     pick and
</I>&gt;<i>                     choose, carefully. As a practical matter, the
</I>&gt;<i>         openness of the
</I>&gt;<i>                     community must be at the level of receiving any
</I>&gt;<i>         proposal,
</I>&gt;<i>                     not at the
</I>&gt;<i>                     level of indiscriminately supporting every proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 Neither variant (a or b) is actually in force.  The
</I>&gt;<i>         only rule
</I>&gt;<i>                 in force
</I>&gt;<i>                 is the traditional one, which hovers somewhere in between.
</I>&gt;<i>                  It's not
</I>&gt;<i>                 written down anywhere that I know of.  It goes
</I>&gt;<i>         something like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                    IIt) Metagov is open to all sorts of initiatives.
</I>&gt;<i>          But if
</I>&gt;<i>                 you've an
</I>&gt;<i>                         initiative you'd like to undertake here, please
</I>&gt;<i>                 discuss it with
</I>&gt;<i>                         the group first and try to accomodate people's
</I>&gt;<i>                 sensitivities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                         (please correct this characterization if it's
</I>&gt;<i>         wrong)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 I guess I'd prefer (IIa) myself, but I'm almost as
</I>&gt;<i>         happy with
</I>&gt;<i>                 (IIt).
</I>&gt;<i>                 So it was unwise of me to raise this issue in the
</I>&gt;<i>         first place.
</I>&gt;<i>                  Better
</I>&gt;<i>                 to let sleeping dogs lie.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>                 Tip toeing away,
