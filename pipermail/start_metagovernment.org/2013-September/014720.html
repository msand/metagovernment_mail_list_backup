<PRE>Hi,

POI: I have been on this list for a year now, reading the majority of posts.

To begin my response I would like to draw attention to the fact that there
is a reality out there, and there are words that we manipulate here. The
words are not the reality. Language is a useful tool (and it's all we have
right here), but its limitations need to be acknowledged. The most precise
language we have is mathematics, but there accuracy is accompanied by
abstraction. (And G&#246;del showed in any case that even math is incomplete).

If one doesn't think that there can be any shared assumptions or values
that underlie our work here together, then I have to disagree; they are
there, whether stated or unstated. It may well be, though, that as we
clarify them in words, those who do not share them will leave.

The purpose of my post was to try and uncover the values that those of us
already here share; and to focus our efforts in a specific direction, based
upon my fourth assumption that we don't have time to waste since (according
to good evidence) the world is heading for catastrophic collapse.

needsandlimits.org gives a one-page summary of the ideas of contractionism
(revolutionary de-growth, if you like), I don't think I need to repost it
here. There is also a full summary to download as well as the two books
themselves.

Contractionary Revolution contains an ample glossary of terms. For example:

&lt;&lt;
Capitalism: An economic system that arose in Europe around 1500 to rapidly
increase the output rate. Under capitalism a society is divided into two
main classes: the owners of productive assets (capitalists) and those who
sell their labor power to these owners (workers).

Capitalist class (power model): In a capitalist society, the class that
owns the key productive assets and exercises political power; hence, its
ruling class. The capitalist class also acts as an instrument of social
control. It is moderately visible to the populace.

Capitalist logic: An economic logic that rapidly increases the output rate
without rational oversight. It is expressed through the market interactions
of two incentives: profit maximization by firms and the desires of
manipulated consumers. Compare: &quot;logic of sustainable well-being&quot;.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>
And one further point:

&gt;<i> &gt; But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>governance?

&gt;<i>I believe there can be no general answer to this question.
</I>&gt;<i>The only answer might be, to make the process of finding whats best for
</I>&gt;<i>everyone &quot;more fair&quot;???
</I>
Doesn't &quot;what's best for everyone&quot; equate to &quot;human well-being&quot;?
