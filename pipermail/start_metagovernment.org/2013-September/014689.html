<PRE>Welcome Pete,

&gt;<i> All u have said is: &quot;These books are awesome. I've read them and was

</I>&gt;<i> awesome&quot; :-)
</I>
Aren't you being a little unfair, Alex?  He laid out his arguments
rather well.  There's more to it than a book recommendation.

&gt;<i> Why are we here on this list? I assume [1] it's because we want to
</I>&gt;<i> examine governance itself in a radical way (i.e. starting at the
</I>&gt;<i> roots) and to develop new forms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>&gt;<i> governance? I assume [2] that we want to save the Earth and promote
</I>&gt;<i> human well-being, both threatened by the current capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> world-system, and believe this is impossible to achieve without new
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of governance to replace the corrupted forms which support the
</I>&gt;<i> present ecocidal and exploitative system.
</I>
This assumption might be wrong.  My own examination of governance [1]
indicates that we don't actually know what people want.  On the whole,
they have no means of coherent self expression.

&gt;<i> What do you think? I welcome amendments, counter-proposals, personal
</I>&gt;<i> messages, whatever.
</I>
I would amend step [2], making it a discovery of what people actually
want in their own words.  So together people would say, &quot;We want to
save the Earth and promote human well-being.&quot;  Or something else.

Then they'd say what step [3] ought to be.

What do you think?
