<PRE>I do not propose a whole system, but instead a couple of usfule mechanisms
that could help solve real problems.
In the &quot;AG GOuFP&quot; there are a couple of hundreds of people discussing
everything about economics and the financial crisis.
Every day there are around a dozen or more emails send over the list and
automatically synced to a forum too.
This is &quot;stable behavior&quot; for several months, probably more than a year now.

A huge problem is CAPTURING RESULTS, and because they are not captured,
topics often repeat.
Another problem is with new people coming to the list, stuff repeats,
because those new people discuss the same old things again and have to
learn the results.
There is a wiki, that captures manually the results on which consens exists
to some degree.
Some new people read about those results, but some have to be pointed to it
and some even then do not read it.

There's also very active people in the &quot;AG GOuFP&quot; who capture their results
on their own wiki profile pages, because they are not yet consensus within
the &quot;AG GOuFP&quot;, but are valuable to them and maybe shared by a fraction of
the people in &quot;AG GOuFP&quot;. They develop their personal positions and refine
them through general feedback and hope that those can eventually become an
official consensus position of the &quot;AG GOuFP&quot;, what makes it a candidate
for the German Pirate Parties official program.

This all is cumbersome and involves lot of manual work to be done and is
error prone and very confusing to those who join the list as new members.

-----------------------------
So if the process of transfering results from the daily message stream
(which is mailinglist and/or forum) to static pages (which is groups wiki
or personal wiki pages) would be just a button click away, that would help
alot.
If the process of linking such official positions and definitions from the
groups wiki or personal wiki pages would just be a autocomplete search
and/or buttonclick away, that would help a lot too.


The message flow is discussion and happens in real time synchronous and/or
asynchronous and as soon as the current moment is gone, those messages go
into oblivion (sometimes called &quot;the archive&quot; ;-))
If you want something to be remembered, it has to be CAPTURED in some form
or it will be repeated again and again until it sticks in peoples
memories... which will not help new people, because then it will start to
repeat again until they have learned it too.
So it has to somehow be captured on STATIC PAGES (external memory) and
because the place where action happens (thus discussion) is the mailingist,
it must be EASY to link it back into the discussion.

If people agree on something or have the same oppinion on an
issue/proposal/whatever, than they should be able to easiely copy the
content to THEIR Personal Static Wiki Page too.
If enough people have the same opinion on something (thus copied it to
their static wiki page), then one could even imagine that it will
automatically be published to the groups official wiki page (@Michael Allen
- maybe their &quot;MIRROR FRONT&quot;?)...

This is NOT a complete system that will solve everything. It just solves
this usecase, where you have 2 main things
1. near real time message streams  (e.g. mailinglist)
2. static pages (that's memory) (e.g. personal wiki pages OR a groups wiki
page)

What goes to the &quot;STATIC PAGES&quot; is that which is selected from the constant
real time discussion flow to be worth of remembering it and maybe refine it
later on or reference it to not repeat stuff again and again.


What i want to say is, that i believe that such a mechanism is useful for
many projects and its very general, so that i think most projects could use
something like that.
So it does not have to be a complete in order to be useful. It just
automates or semiautomates some common issues that happen during
discussions.
If one had something that would realize this, then discussion would already
become smoother and we would become aware what might be needed in addition
or what kind of feature to implement next in order to make it even smoother
:<i>-)
</I>
Just DO STUFF
Find out what kind of work you have to repeat manually time after time
again in a very similar fashion
AUTOMATE it =&gt; thus, free your time from this repetitive activity
Continue DOING STUFF (with the help of the new feature)
...rinse and repeat

I think using this method we can develop much faster, because:
1. We only have to find consensus about the most common issues and
implement something that solves it
2. We can delay all the thinking about features that might be eventually
needed to a later time (when more information about the issues is available)
=&gt; Resulting in better decisions, which are less speculative nad less
driven by assumptions, but more by actual experience
