<PRE>Perhaps starting from the material in Bentley's Googledocs spreadsheet, 
or perhaps starting from the AllAngles discussion of email-as-platform, 
or starting from other material, would it be possible to work up a 
comparison-example of the two strategies? (weighted wish-list vs. 
directed graph) (You very definitely have my attention and interest ...) 
:<i>-)

</I>&gt;<i> Plarform discussions brought up some personal connections to be

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Typically in a corporate environment you put together a wish list and 
</I>&gt;<i> assign weights.  You then compare candidate platform features to the 
</I>&gt;<i> wish list and end up with a scalar (did I mention my math degree) for 
</I>&gt;<i> each candidate and go from there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the real world the vendors will keep an eye on potential clients 
</I>&gt;<i> wish lists and over time modify their platform to get the maximum 
</I>&gt;<i> check boxes, even if the wish list item is silly or the modification 
</I>&gt;<i> is essentially fake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Understand that the wish list and weighing are where the real choices 
</I>&gt;<i> are made and this is pretty invisible.  Does that somehow feel 
</I>&gt;<i> familiar?  Consider the case where the must have feature is a single 
</I>&gt;<i> source item only available from your golf partner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the transparancy argument is essentially that we thus need to know 
</I>&gt;<i> everything about everyone in order to make good decisions.  And if I 
</I>&gt;<i> do not mention in my SEC filing who my good friends are, then, off 
</I>&gt;<i> with my head.  This seems to work really well here in the US.  Lol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, I think the idea of a wish list is flawed and then the idea 
</I>&gt;<i> of a scalar is even worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider instead of lists,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Directed graphs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Easy examples are heirarchies, flow charts, electronic schematics, 
</I>&gt;<i> computer programs, and the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those of you who are computer programmers will object that computer 
</I>&gt;<i> code can be more complex than a directed graph at execution time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two points here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This stuff is close to off the shelf for prototyping purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People can move through the same graph in different ways, yielding 
</I>&gt;<i> different scalars.  This conceptually yields a scalar that cannot be 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to other scalars and this to me is a Good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The implied political organizing concepts are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  No  laundry lists
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  No global unifying principles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Laundry lists are all there are
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Any list can be truly global and unifying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The dance music got a little odd there, did it not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not particularly interested in criticism at this time.  If 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing else, this presentation is highly truncated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions are at this time welcome.  In return, I ask you: what are 
</I>&gt;<i> the characteristics of a platform that could handle well this platform 
</I>&gt;<i> discussion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it happens I have said to someone local I would do a demo of an 
</I>&gt;<i> off the shelf product that I believe is relevant to the last 
</I>&gt;<i> question.  Afterwards I will share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> blessings,
