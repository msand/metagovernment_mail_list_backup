Whats the process of deciding upon this? How many objections can be raised
by people and how long will that process take in order to decide whether
its a valid objection or not?



&gt;<i> Any time anybody sees a problem with the existing set of recognized valid
</I>&gt;<i> objections, the existence of the problem can be proposed, and solutions

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't believe in this.
Objections can be very specific to each proposal that is made, you cannot
list all possible objections that could be made in response to all possible
kind of proposals.
That approach seems to be doomed. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;, that
might not be perfect all the time but at least might be a good start that
could be improved when experience gives one new insights. I think there has
to be a structured process, or at least a set of tools/options that each
participant could take in order to raise objections or mark objections
raised by others as invalid. And eventually a meta process that can improve
the rules surrounding that process or tools/options.
This must be a fair process (at least as fair as possible) and it must be
ensured, that people can evolve it on their own, based on their experience.
In addition, it has to be a FAST PROCESS. Speed is important, because the
faster it is (even if its less perfect), the more objections can be handled.

A &quot;perfect process&quot; that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be
included in measuring the value of the process.



Any group of people that goes to the trouble of getting together and trying
&gt;<i> to set up such a system is trying to set up a system that will actually
</I>&gt;<i> work. From the perspective of such a group, any possible problem that you
</I>&gt;<i> see is a problem to be solved. You are very good at seeing problems. Just
</I>&gt;<i> for fun, maybe you could try your hand at also seeing solutions to the
</I>&gt;<i> problems that you see, so I don't have to do all the work. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The thing is, i do not see all the solutions.
Next thing is, i am not able to wear both hats at the same time (create
solutions + see flaws in proposed solutions)
If someone puts forward solutions or a road to a solution, i can ask
questions and try to find weaknesses.
The other thing is, i could try to propose a solution (like my EMAIL
PROPOSAL) and others can ask questions and try to find weaknesses.
But i cant do both at the same time.
...and doing both at the same time is not only difficult but not much fun
at all to me. And in the end, the important that stuff we are doing is,
without fun, i cant stay motivated anymore.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as long
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    as one participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous
</I>&gt;<i>    consent&quot;, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; A really stupid group might indeed set up the system that way, and it
</I>&gt;<i> would indeed then be just as bad as using the &quot;unanimous consent&quot; decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hehe :-) If the method is only used by a couple of people, then maybe they
are smart, maybe they are not so smart.
But the larger the group gets, the more likely it is, that &quot;stupid people&quot;
might join in and therefor the process of how those rules are set up is
very important.
I'm not yet sure if that formal approach is any good at all, because right
now, i feel like you might just shift the problem to the creation of
DISCRIMINATING RULES, which have to be INTERPRETED too :-)
So you better come up with a process, that is not subject to interpretation
or at least gives very little leeway and those process better cannot be
abused to discriminate certain people.

What if i propose: &quot;Objections from People with overweight are invalid when
it comes to nuitrition issues&quot;
What if i propose: &quot;Objections of minority group x are invalid when it
comes to issues regarding y&quot;
Thats very trivial and exteme examples, but you can craft examples which
use brilliant rethorics and very subtle ways of discrimination, which are
hard to detect if you are looking at it from the wrong perspective.

I dont think it might not be possible, all i'm saying is, that that would
be a hard problem, and especially, because a FAST PROCESS is important
(therefor it has not to be perfect, because you can repeat the process
often for very atomic issues, because its fast).



------------------------------**------------------------------**------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be formalized
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    in a way so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what
</I>&gt;<i>    an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method
</I>&gt;<i>    different from &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Exactly. According to Habermas, such &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot; do
</I>&gt;<i> exist, and are routinely applied during ordinary discourse. The &quot;no
</I>&gt;<i> unresolved objections&quot; decision rule is tapping into that existing ability
</I>&gt;<i> to discriminate, that exists in each of us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

So, that sounds good., but only because Habermas asserts it exists, doesnt
mean it really does.
I'm not familiar with any details of that issue, so if they do exist, but i
dont know about them, then:
1. can we create a list that lists all those &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot; (i
suppose they will immediately make sense to me)
2. can we formulate the general rule/process that generates that list for a
specific proposal that is made? :-)

I would be really interested to learn more about that, because if we would
use that &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; thing, then better that list has to be
really awesome and easy to use ;-)



------------------------------**------------------------------**------------
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; ...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    possible to win something by doing so...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You are suggesting that if the decision system is such that it
</I>&gt;<i> rewards going crazy with success, then people will go crazy, and succeed. I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with this. So, let's not set up a decision system that rewards going
</I>&gt;<i> crazy with success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Sure, that would be a good thing, but i was refering to something else.
1. + we have a &quot;decision system&quot;
2. + we have money (are funded)
3. + we have success (that means, larger groups of people start to use the
software tools)
=&gt; then particular interests will try to game the &quot;decision system&quot; and
they will use any imaginable technique (brilliant rethorics, bribes,
playing with emotions a lot, and more...)
If the &quot;decision system&quot; cannot give good guidance, then it will be
corrupted and then, not the &quot;decision system&quot; as it was thought up will
GOVERN EVERYTHING, but the particular interests that succeeded in gaming
the system in ways that were not anticipated by the &quot;decision system&quot; will
really govern everything.

I believe its not possible to make a &quot;bullet proof&quot; decision system, but we
can try to come up with a good one and bake in a process that allows people
to improve it over time, for example: after every time they gained new
experience/insights after they have successfully defended the whole against
a &quot;unfair move&quot; of a particular interest.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; And that again will just end in endless debates and talking,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    because as long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can
</I>&gt;<i>    be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You have again spotted a valid problem, and again lazily handed it
</I>&gt;<i> over to me to solve. (In certain voting systems, this problem is called a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;filibuster&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

What is a &quot;filibuster&quot;?
I did not lazily handed it over to you.
I only try to understand your approach. I'm very skeptic about that
approach in general.
I do not say it might not be possible, just i dont see how it might be
possible.
My proposal with setting/creating a mail server which easily allows to make
&quot;things persistant&quot; so that they do not repeat in a discussion and move on
from there ...one step at a time, because we gain new insights, because WE
USE THE TOOL ourselve, because WE COULD NEED such a mechanism :-)
...if you remember that in another thread people ask for stuff of the past
and we come up with issues that it would be cool if this or that would be
on the wiki and be up to date...

So i would like to start with the &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;,
implement it, use it right here to gain new insights and experience and
then broaden our &quot;least/lowest common denominator, implement it, use it
right here to gain new insights and experience and then broaden our
&quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, implement it, use it right here....
...you get it :-)


In contrast, you want to start from a much higher level, by thinking the
whole system through upfront. I believe it might be possible, but its very
hard and exactly those questions i try to come up with is what we have to
think through in order to have enough details so that we can really see if
a certain approach is possible.

In my world, every theorey can be implemented in many ways, but if
implemented correctly, then all those implementations are as good as the
theory itself, because every implemented instance of that theory itself
could be the theory and the theory one has implemented could be the
implementation, that means, i believe its isomorphisms (the theory and all
possible implementations)

I dont know all the different parts involved in your theory, but if there
is one basic element that could be implemented and used right away, while
still retaining all the options necessary to implement the full thing, then
lets start with that one basic element and implement it right away.
if we then use it, we can not only discuss things further, but gather
experience around that basic elements and can more easily think of all the
options that are possible to built on top and that will INCLUDE those
options that are necessary for your theory :-)




&gt;<i> For us (the Metagovernment community), I will suggest that in the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning the best way to approach finding solutions to this problem will
</I>&gt;<i> be case-by-case. On each occasion that this problem actually occurs, we
</I>&gt;<i> look for specific ways to solve the specific problem before us. As we
</I>&gt;<i> accumulate specific solutions, we may see patterns that will enable us to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Very good, but it all happens inside of our mind. If there is tens or maybe
even hundreds of those issues, we will discuss them, come up with a
solution, eventually put them on the wiki, rinse and repeat. Every time we
talk about a new solution of an issue, we have to bear in mind all those
other solutotions we have come up with and also have to think about how
they fit together and create synergy effects....
its a hard thing and if someone new enters the metagovernment space, he
first has to study A LOT and might even come up with new issues to old
solutions that we havent thought about yet.... that could go on for AGES
....actually it already does to some degree ;-)

So how about teaching new people the ways of metagovernment, because they
actually will use the tools and methods without really realizing it.
SO instead of self study, they will be educated during the process.
Thats why i think &quot;email&quot; is so important, even if there is other
technology with which it would be much easier to craft prototypes.







&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that
</I>&gt;<i>    it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that things cannot
</I>&gt;<i>    get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; As you have noted in a previous email, we could start creating our
</I>&gt;<i> own community money right now, and start trying to handle it responsibly.
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have to wait.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

YES :-)
But its not easy. Our community money could be &quot;shares&quot; that could be
earned for doing something and will slowly deprecate over time eventually
vanishing completely if one leaves the metagovernment community forever,
but will start to grow again, as soon as one comes back in.
But it should not be a beaurocratic process, but a fast one. The issue we
have to solve is, how to evaluate how many shares which people get and for
what?
There needs to be a system where people can log in to see their amount of
shares and what to do with them.
It's a huge undertaking and if you can spend those kind of shares or use
them to have more votes than someone who just joined and so on...
...its essentially some kind of &quot;democratic system&quot; that you design.
Spending money itself can be compared to voting on something. It just has
its own special set of rules surrounding it.

I very much hope, some day we will implement something like that, but it
has to start somewhere.

For Example:
Michael Allan has put up some &quot;job vacanccies&quot; around votorola.
This is not a good sign when it comes to shares/money, because Michael
Allen creates a employer/employee relationship, that means, Michael Allen
PAYS the employee so that the employee DOES what Michael Allen as &quot;the
boss&quot; will COME UP with.
A better approach, but a much more difficult one would be to: SPLIT UP the
project into &quot;tasks&quot; or at least &quot;goals&quot; that could be or should be
accomplished by someone else + set a reward/bounty on those (a portion of
shares or something).
These shares have to be granted by Michael Allen OR ... if he opens the
issue to the community and the community agrees on its importance, it will
be granted by several people, not just Michael Allan.
The one who takes on that &quot;task&quot; or &quot;mission&quot; could himself invite others
to help him and give them part of the bounty.

In a perfect world, this bounty will always be SHARES of the Metagovernment
Project as a whole.

But if you want to be able to create those &quot;tasks/goals&quot; on the fly and if
you want it a fast process to determine the bounty (in terms of shares)&quot;,
it has to be an easy and fast process.
the faster and easier it gets, the more often people might use it because
the barrier in doing so is lower than anything else.
If its a difficult process, most simple tasks will not use the mechanism,
but only huge tasks will and simple ones will be solved in non-standard
ways between people who know each other...

Hint: This again is a &quot;snippet&quot; of a solution i imagine that might solve
issues but might also have problems i dont see and that should be
questioned by you and others, so i can think of those and come up with
answers (that way we would have changed HATS) ....




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; For me, the metagovernment.org project is not about getting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    money to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;<i>    support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain domains
</I>&gt;<i>    (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out
</I>&gt;<i>    there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
</I>&gt;<i>    evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government
</I>&gt;<i>    form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by
</I>&gt;<i>    all the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I think that we need all-of-above: we need the meta rules, and we
</I>&gt;<i> need the right software systems, and we need the right practices, and so
</I>&gt;<i> on. Everything is connected. Partial solutions generally wind up being no
</I>&gt;<i> solutions at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I agree, we need all of the above.
I disagree that &quot;partial solutions&quot; wind up being no solution at all.
And my reason for this is:
We already HAVE a complete system that solves all the issues life throws at
us, you, me, everyone else.
That solution is the status quo with all its imperfections.

A &quot;partial solution&quot; that would be no solution at all is to me:
A transition from one complete solution (status quo) to another complete
soltution (status quo COMPOSED/MERGED with feature x), where feature x is
what you call partial solution.

What you say with &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; or that we need a complete system
means to me:
Merge the status quo with LOTS OF FEATURES at once.
Its hard to get that right and even if the theory is sound, its even harder
to make lots of people change lots of habits over night, so they wont
accept it.
Even if its perfect, it has to be introduced one feature at a time, so
people have time to learn it and change their habits.
Everyone knows that. In school you dont learn everything at once, but some
thing after another.
So not even is it possible to introduce a &quot;partial solution&quot; a.k.a  a
single feature x and introduce the next feature later, it is instead very
much desirable to do so.
You start with basic features and bolt on more complex ones.
The same way you learn math ...not starting with universal sets algebra or
category theory or calculus or game theory, but rather with basic stuff.

BUT: If people have to learn basic stuff ANYWAY before they are able to use
more advanced features, why not introduce the basic features first (our
&quot;lowest common denominator&quot;) implement it, make them use it and learn on
the way, so that we not only have our thoughts and theory, but also get
feedback from the experience of implementing it and having it used. So
chances increase we get feature x and y &quot;more right&quot; than without that
practical feedback.

And even if our tools grow to hundreds of features, its still important to
only have basic features available at entry level and to not require all
those advanced features, because people new to the system, because they
joined the usage late, still have to learn the basics first.
...and they wont read books, they want immediate results, they want the
things to be intuitive and want to hack right away... like with writing an
email :-)




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular
</I>&gt;<i>    interests can corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such
</I>&gt;<i>    has failed. And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated
</I>&gt;<i>    particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money
</I>&gt;<i>    is involved and success manifests in one way or another), to corrupt
</I>&gt;<i>    the set of META RULES so that in essence the particular interests
</I>&gt;<i>    will be that thing which governs government, thus be the
</I>&gt;<i>    metagovernment, then we have accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes. Exactly. And that is what has happened in the world. We do in
</I>&gt;<i> fact now have various special-interest &quot;metagovernments&quot;, that most people
</I>&gt;<i> don't even know exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

So what we need to find is a &quot;merge process&quot; :-) that means tools and stuff
that helps us to &quot;increase synchronisation&quot; between our thoughts through
&quot;constant communication&quot; that is productive. There for we need helpful
tools to automate parts of the discussion that can be automated (e.g.
instead of someone to manually copy stuff from the email list to our wiki
or instead of having someone to look up the email list archive.... and
whatever else, maybe the system can do it for us)

I believe, even though all the &quot;metagovernment parties&quot; co-exist with the
same goal, its ONLY because the degree of communication is not dense enough.
If it were, we could use every imaginable synergy effect and concentrate
only about the edge cases where our experience and oppinions differ. we
would learn about each others way to think and pull off experiments
together to check our assumptions, and so forth...


The process doesnt have to be perfect, it must only be so good, that the
&quot;rate of benefits through synchronisation via communication&quot; exceeds the
&quot;rate of benefit by doing something on his own&quot;.
As soon as thats the case, people will collaborate, because it gives you
benefits faster.
So all we have to do is to lower the barriers and thats why SPEEED is
vitally important, no matter what kind of process or system you come up
with.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess several other governing methods, but there is some thing that will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to be subjective and thats: what is a &quot;valid objection&quot; and what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as long as one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous consent&quot;, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be formalized in a way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what an &quot;unresolved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method different from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> win something by doing so...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And that again will just end in endless debates and talking, because as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can be done.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Regarding Principle II formulation: Up to this point, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;support&quot; that Metagovernment has been offering has consisted of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the wiki (in which individuals can create wiki-pages), the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     listserv (to which individuals can subscribe), and special
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     wiki-pages such as the Projects page where projects can be listed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (thereby become famous and such).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Since the marginal cost of these supports (one more wiki-page, one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     more email, one more item on the projects list) is within epsilon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of zero, there has been no need or reason to have any formality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     involved in making these supports available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of rules in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that it's possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually enforce it by law, so that things cannot get out of control as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me, the metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not about getting money to support some projects and build some software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools to support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government form in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by all the people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve over time,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular interests can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such has failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money is involved and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> success manifests in one way or another), to corrupt the set of META RULES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so that in essence the particular interests will be that thing which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governs government, thus be the metagovernment, then we have accomplished
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and become some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of organization within the existing rules and in order to &quot;boost
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> productivity&quot;, its also good to involve money, but we really DO need rock
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solid foundations if we want to minimize the risk or potential that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing laws and money will start to corrupt metagovernment.org &lt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And by this i mean, that it must be ensured, that nobody or no particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group can take over and control the ressources that might start to build up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under the &quot;metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;&quot; banner in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA Foundation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that will apply for grants and such, and will then have serious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     resources to distribute, in service of becoming a useful catalyst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with respect to changes in global governance. (I guess you didn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     get the memo ...) :^)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be adequate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that context?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm on your side here, i do not think, that the current rules could stand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what might emerge as soon as law and money is involved.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             As a community, we do not have enough resources to support
