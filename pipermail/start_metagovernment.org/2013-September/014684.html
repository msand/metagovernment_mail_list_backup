&gt;<i> It's really hard to make sense of what you say :-)
</I>
That's because we got into theory that I don't completely understand.
Also because we have two sub-threads going, which is also my fault.

&gt;<i> whats the &quot;true image&quot; of a community?
</I>
In a public mirror, the true image of a community is the one that
indexes the total of all the open discussions on the community's
chosen topic, and just that total.

&gt;<i> BUT: You say its a technical detail, but its not as soon as the
</I>&gt;<i> picture of the whole depends on that mechanism.  Instead it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> vitaly important. Who controls the picture of the whole, controls
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion to some extend.  Maybe at some places, the
</I>&gt;<i> gatekeepers will not let certain things pass &quot;nak&quot;, while in other
</I>&gt;<i> places of the same &quot;community&quot; it will pass &quot;ack&quot;.
</I>
I agree.  The gates must be &quot;kept&quot; by the community as whole.  We must
be able to govern ourselves, or it won't work.

Some of us must understand the technical details and know when they're
relevant to the crucial task of self governance, and then explain what
we know to others in the community.  I agree about this, too.

I don't think we really disagree about anything.  I'm probably just
replying to your questions with too much detail, which distracts us
from the basic problem of self governance.  I should try to keep more
focused on that goal.  We haven't got there, yet.
