Yes, it probably is a bit &quot;unfair&quot;, but it happens so often, somebody drops
by, posts a couple of links to his/her personal &quot;unifying all fixing theory
of choice&quot; and leaves shortly afterwards.
Maybe i overreacted and was blinded by my current mood at the time of
writing.
Although i read his [1] to [3] arguments, they seemed so general to me and
even worse, so much implicit assumptions, that i really didnt know how to
start to reply without writing so many lines, so that the result would be
tldr (tldr=to long didnt read)
I try again then.... :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why are we here on this list? I assume [1] it's because we want to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; examine governance itself in a radical way (i.e. starting at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; roots) and to develop new forms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes


&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governance?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Whats the purpose of that?
I believe there can be no general answer to this question.
The only answer might be, to make the process of finding whats best for
everyone &quot;more fair&quot;???
This question has so many different levels it could be answered on, so many
different perspectives on it, that its just to hard to answer in just one
sentence.
It might only be possible with another general phrase.

I assume something and that is, that the person who knows whats absolutely
the best for person X is person X itself.
That might NOT be true directly, often persons do not know what is the best
thing for themselves nor for the community, but i believe,
this is always based on incomplete information or false information or an
incomplete perspective on issues or on missunderstandings, and so forth...

BUT: All persons are subject to the same problem here. Some might be more
&quot;well informed&quot; but its totally possible, that they have a very distorted
perspective the same time.
Some people are maybe not very well informed, but possibly they have a good
balance when it comes to the different perspectives they have learned about.

Then again, nobody can possibly know, how well informed others are and how
good their perspectives are. They have to assess this based on their own
perspectives, values and information and so sometimes they might come up
with an appropriate judgement, and sometimes not so much...



&gt;<i> I assume [2] that we want to save the Earth and promote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; human well-being,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
TOOO MANY ASSUPMTIONS!
What about going to mars and inhabiting other planets?
What is &quot;human well-being&quot;? I guess its possible to interpret this in ways
everyone could agree with and the opposite is possible too.

So instead, i pose another question: Why is this question important at all?



&gt;<i> both threatened by the current capitalist
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;Capitalist&quot; is a word, that stands for everything and nothing. If you dont
provide an exact definition in a near mathematical sense, its only going to
divide people into factions.
WHY?
Because every concept that is blurry and not well defined will, like a
&quot;statistical effect&quot;, make somehow some people decide in favour of it and
some against it.
Take a random word, load is with emotions but dont give it a precise
meaning and immediately u get people divided over nothing...



&gt;<i> &gt; world-system, and believe this is impossible to achieve without new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kinds of governance to replace the corrupted forms which support the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present ecocidal and exploitative system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
blablablabla....



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This assumption might be wrong.  My own examination of governance [1]
</I>&gt;<i> indicates that we don't actually know what people want.
</I>


Awesome! :-)
Yes, i believe that too, you do not fucking know and thats what, at least
to me, is one major goal.
Find out what people want. Make it transparent.
I dont care what the fuck it is, i only want to make it transparent.
I believe, its something &quot;good&quot;, i even believe its something &quot;awesome&quot; :-)
...but at the moment, that is irrelevant to me.




&gt;<i> On the whole,
</I>&gt;<i> they have no means of coherent self expression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

sad but true.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think? I welcome amendments, counter-proposals, personal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages, whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would amend step [2], making it a discovery of what people actually
</I>&gt;<i> want in their own words.  So together people would say, &quot;We want to
</I>&gt;<i> save the Earth and promote human well-being.&quot;  Or something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then they'd say what step [3] ought to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
