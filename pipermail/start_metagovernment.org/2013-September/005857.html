<PRE>(branching off from &quot;Reflective start&quot;)

Two possible policies in regard to what's allowed, and what's not:

  IIa) Metagov is open to all start approaches and will do its best to
       support each.  You may do as you please with Metagov resources
       in the way of &quot;start&quot;, provided it's compatible with the equal
       freedom of others in this regard.

       (what I suggested earlier)

  IIb) Metagov is open to all proposals concerning the use of its
       resources, but every proposal must meet with the unanimous
       consent of the Metagov group before being implemented.  There
       must be no unresolved objections.

       (paraphrased from Ned's response)

Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is to come up with
</I>&gt;<i> good proposals, and to make good decisions with respect to those
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, and to do good work in funding and implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals that have successfully passed through the &quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i> objections&quot; gauntlet.  (Note that I have very slyly slipped in my
</I>&gt;<i> preference that we use &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as our decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a community, we do not have enough resources to support every
</I>&gt;<i> proposed &quot;start effort&quot; (meaning project start?). We must pick and
</I>&gt;<i> choose, carefully. As a practical matter, the openness of the
</I>&gt;<i> community must be at the level of receiving any proposal, not at the
</I>&gt;<i> level of indiscriminately supporting every proposal.
</I>
Neither variant (a or b) is actually in force.  The only rule in force
is the traditional one, which hovers somewhere in between.  It's not
written down anywhere that I know of.  It goes something like:

  IIt) Metagov is open to all sorts of initiatives.  But if you've an
       initiative you'd like to undertake here, please discuss it with
       the group first and try to accomodate people's sensitivities.

       (please correct this characterization if it's wrong)

I guess I'd prefer (IIa) myself, but I'm almost as happy with (IIt).
So it was unwise of me to raise this issue in the first place.  Better
to let sleeping dogs lie.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (At this point, I take this thread not to be about making changes to the 
</I>&gt;<i> mission statement or the vision statement or the elevator pitch, but 
</I>&gt;<i> about making a reflective start ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; (II.) Metagov should be open to all start techniques and do
</I>&gt;<i>     its best to support each.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My view (to state it /sans/ nuance and qualification, for clarity) is 
</I>&gt;<i> that adopting either your original or amended *Principle II* will cause 
</I>&gt;<i> us to fail with respect to the mission of becoming able to usefully act 
</I>&gt;<i> as catalyst with respect to the global population.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our openness to supporting any and all tools is not what will lead to 
</I>&gt;<i> that success. Our coming up with a really good set of tools is what will 
</I>&gt;<i> lead to that success.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my alternative proposal for Principle II:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     ANYONE CAN PROPOSE ANYTHING. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there
</I>&gt;<i>     be no distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree
</I>&gt;<i>     with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Mike&gt; No, it shouldn't. If you believe that a particular start
</I>&gt;<i>     effort needs to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you
</I>&gt;<i>     could enforce it within the context of that start effort. But you
</I>&gt;<i>     shouldn't enforce it universally within Metagov if doing so would
</I>&gt;<i>     violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In a community (or population) that makes decisions with respect to 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals through reaching consensus (&quot;no unresolved objections&quot;), there 
</I>&gt;<i> is no &quot;enforcement&quot; at the level of decision making. When (II) is stated 
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;anyone can propose anything&quot;, this is clear. (Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is to come up with good 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, and to make good decisions with respect to those proposals, 
</I>&gt;<i> and to do good work in funding and implementing the proposals that have 
</I>&gt;<i> successfully passed through the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; gauntlet. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Note that I have very slyly slipped in my preference that we use &quot;no

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for replying.  Both of you point to an omission that I want to

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of technicians is the usual one of developing and building facilities,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not ruling a technocracy.  Item (II) is intended rather as a counter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; measure to technocracy, nipping in the bud any technical solution that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would dominate the field, and thence society.  How it might do that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; must wait till I can answer in regard to (III).  (more below)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ned Conner said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... after studying your proposal I have the uneasy feeling that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; through the very abstract and obscurely-defined term &quot;reflector&quot;, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being snuck in through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the side door, with which stance I may or may not agree. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; without [or, as Mike puts it, before] making decisions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Originally I thought of setting Metagov's sights exclusively on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflective start (III), but I agree that would be inconsistent with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the principle of openness (II).  Let me correct myself by saying that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a reflective start is just one start technique; I think Metagov should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be open to all start techniques and do its best to support each.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what I now suggest for principle (II).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I do not quite understand what you mean when you say [II] that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;we're ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that we never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with respect to any ideological or technical matter? ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, that wouldn't be possible.  We still must make decisions and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes they will bear on technical matters.  When they do, however,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I suggest we bracket them in a way that doesn't violate the principle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of openness (II, as revised).  So:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there be no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it shouldn't.  If you believe that a particular start effort needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you could enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within the context of that start effort.  But you shouldn't enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; universally within Metagov if doing so would violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Otherwise message (I) rings hollow.  Only through openness to all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start possibilities can Metagov convincingly back the claim of being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the place where it starts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagov already honours (I) and (II), at least in practice.  There's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no other place we can go to speak together on such an over-arching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic and retain any hope of putting our words into action.  Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already has an advantage here and I think we need to press it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Max said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;High ground&quot; and &quot;command&quot; suggest dominance structures.  This can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; conflict with places I enjoy visiting and puts a rather unhappy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; slant on consensus reaching.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you have a better impression after reading my correction above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Despite my forceful metaphors, I don't propose to push anyone around,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or to raise technicians to anything but a technical elite.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll stop here and give you and Ned a chance to reply.  I haven't yet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answered concerning the specifics of reflective start (III), but only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; items (I) and (II), which I think are the general conditions to obtain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sufficient resources for any kind of start.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
