&gt;<i> Alexander,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me see if I understand your post by rephrasing and adding to
</I>&gt;<i> it. Hopefully it's not too long. Constructive feedback is appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> Previous post:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005937.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005937.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerns:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Topics often repeat with regular users without benefit
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *There is a benefit, because the regular users try to make it stick with
</I>their memory, but it's still annoying for those who have already made it
stick with theirs.*

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - This is compounded when new people come to the list and are not
</I>&gt;<i>    aware of the past discussions
</I>&gt;<i>    - There is no way to measure consensus on a particular topic or
</I>&gt;<i>    proposal
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Yes, only manual polls.*
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current Solutions
</I>&gt;<i> -Manually add items to a wiki(s) and point people there
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Does not happen often because it takes so much energy
</I>&gt;<i>    - What is there is rarely read
</I>&gt;<i>    - It is spread over several several locations
</I>&gt;<i>    - What is there quickly goes stale
</I>&gt;<i>    - There is no feature there to gauge the level of agreement
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes and maybe one could add another bullet point
+ how each document in those static pages is presented differs.



&gt;<i> Future Requirements (in order of priority)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Easily capture a section of an email to a static page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Be able to see the context of the original capture
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Be able to display this text on their personal page
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not understand what this means.
</I>If something is captured to my personal static page, then sure, it should
be displayed when someone visits my personal page.


&gt;<i>    1. Be able to edit and summarize the statements while keeping a link
</I>&gt;<i>    to the history
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone is free to edit entries on his/her personal page. So yes, of
</I>course.
And an &quot;etherpad feature&quot; (e.g.titanpad.com), where every single change is
recorded in a time line, would be useful too.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Be able to tag the capture by topic or subject
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes sure, why not.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Be able to link to the group of tagged items
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes sure, why not.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. (difficult) Have the system automatically suggest relevant items
</I>&gt;<i>    that have been captured in the past.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THIS ONE IS IMPORTANT!!!!!
</I>It's the mechanism that helps people to LINK captured stuff BACK INTO the
discussion (e.g. message stream on a mailinglist)
I don't think its that important, because the system does only need to
suggest stuff which is on my personal static page.
So i can customize those suggestions by adding stuff to my personal static
page.
It's useless to give other suggestions, because people do not want to link
to something they are not familiar with and even worse, are not convinced
of. Dont u think?




&gt;<i> Proposed Implementation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - As an email flows through the system it adds a link at the bottom of
</I>&gt;<i>    each paragraph. If you click on the link you capture that paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> +1
</I>I was thinking about something similar (one could use a &quot;RESTful API&quot; to
make it easy to create such links)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - If multiple people click the link then it will be recorded that
</I>&gt;<i>    several people want to record that part and it is ranked in importance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's added to every persons personal static page and maybe a &quot;counter&quot; is
</I>added too, so on each users static page, they can see how many others
support the statement and if they click, they get a list of all those users.
There should also be a counter for all members in a community and if u
click on it, u get to a list that lists all those users.
If one thing, has support from enough users, then its automatically added
to the &quot;communities website&quot; (that which is maybe called a &quot;mirror front&quot;
by michael allan)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Once on the page you can narrow down the selection to sentences or
</I>&gt;<i>    words or expand to add more paragraphs from the source email
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sure, sounds good.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - On the page you could also summarize or re-word.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>IMPORTANT!
Suppose 6 users have put some text from a message stream to their personal
pages, then everyone could look it up on each of their pages and would also
see a counter saying &quot;6 People share this oppinion&quot; (or something like
that) and if they click on it, they can see who those others are.
BUT: If someone of those 6 changes the wording of a section, it will be
different from the other ones, thus it will reduce the counter from 6 to 5.
In order to prevent this, there could be a &quot;SUBSCRIBE TO CHANGES&quot;
Mechanism, which will inform the other 5 people of the change someone has
made and they are offered to either ACCEPT or REJECT the change.
If they REJECT it, then the counters will show &quot;5&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, making it two
different opinions.
The &quot;1&quot; could now revert his change to make the counter go back up to &quot;6&quot;.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - You can tag the capture for grouping with other captures
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that a &quot;merge feature&quot; you propose?
</I>A &quot;merge feature&quot; is definitly needed.
If it is, then YES, that would be a very important thing.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - You can designate that this capture supersedes previous capture(s)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like it is part of a &quot;merge&quot; feature.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - All the captures are displayed on web pages by tag and popularity
</I>&gt;<i>    and can be linked to in email. (unless superseded)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;unless superseeded&quot; might not be true for everyone.
</I>If i propose a merge of 2 captures, where one capture has 10 supporters and
the other has 8 supporters, then maybe 6 of 10 agree and 5 of 8 agree. As a
result, there will now be the &quot;merge capture&quot; supported by 11 people, the
beforeMerge capture1 supported by 4 people and the beforeMerge capture2
supported by 3 people.

So every capture should be linkable to in emails.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - On each capture on the we page there is also a link to the original
</I>&gt;<i>    source email for context.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - The fact you captured, tagged, refined is sent out to the email list
</I>&gt;<i>    and others can +1 it from a link there adding rank.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think this should be done automatically.
</I>Suppose there is a thing captured by 10 people, then it will send out that
thing 10 times.
Maybe i'm browsing through the archives or maybe i was on holiday and come
back to go through my inbox and capturing a couple of things. The
discussion has already moved on, so it would be rude and &quot;off topic&quot; to
automatically send an email that i captured some things.
This should be done manually when the time is right and i answer to
something on the message stream (mailinglist) and then i link a capture
back in, when i feel its appropriate, so i dont have to rephrase something
from my memory, but instead use the link to my static page, so i can make
sure, what people will read is always the same and those who already know
the content can skip a paragraph of my answer, because they can be sure
that its exactly the stuff they have read in the past.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - (difficult) Have the system add links to potential matching tags or
</I>&gt;<i>    captures to the tops of emails or paragraphs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;tag&quot; feature might be a bit too much for the first version. I see it
</I>might be useful, but it also adds complexity and i would rather suggest to
implement it when there is a real need. Currently, i guess we are only
assuming that tags might be helpful, but there is no real experienced pain
or use case that has to be solved yet, only a theoretical use case.

I guess whats needed is a &quot;custom mailserver software&quot; that supports those
features.
