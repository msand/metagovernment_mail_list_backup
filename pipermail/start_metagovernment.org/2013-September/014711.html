<PRE>Hi Mike,

To paraphrase Harry: The purpose of THIS [Metagovernment] project is NOT 
to figure out HOW to run the lemonade stand. It's to figure out how we 
can collectively DECIDE how to run the lemonade stand.

Would it be possible for us to set the topic of the mirror to that of 
figuring out how we can collectively DECIDE [anything at all]?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> This is the question Alex asked originally, and we never had a chance
</I>&gt;<i> to answer it.  I agree it's a good question.  I'll try to answer it:
</I>&gt;<i> If it were a sales stand of some kind, the next thing we'd probably
</I>&gt;<i> want to know is what kind of stand exactly (take a look).  And who
</I>&gt;<i> exactly are we (look around).  But instead we have a public mirror
</I>&gt;<i> sitting on the sidewalk.  A public mirror won't work till it has a
</I>&gt;<i> topic.  So we need (1) to define what topic our topical community is
</I>&gt;<i> discussing.  That could be our first decision as a (self) government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then (2) the mirror will start projecting all the discussions of that
</I>&gt;<i> topic on the sidewalk for everyone to see.  Looking at them and
</I>&gt;<i> looking in particular at who's participating in them, we'll learn
</I>&gt;<i> who's in our community.  It might be nobody, or everybody, or
</I>&gt;<i> something in between, depending on how &quot;big&quot; a topic we've chosen.
</I>&gt;<i> Having determined ourselves in this way (rather boldly), we then try
</I>&gt;<i> to govern ourselves.  We'll succeed or fail pretty quickly I imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> And if we fail, we'll learn the reason why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, there's no hurry.  Let's imagine Ed is unable to reply till
</I>&gt;<i> next weekend, but we want to make some progress toward self-governance
</I>&gt;<i> before he returns.  Like we're a self-responsible community where
</I>&gt;<i> everyone pitches in a little.  What (briefly) should we do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or how would you answer if you were in Ed's place?
