<PRE>I added a suggested inclusion of my own to our topic, namely (SELF)
broad based self-determination and self-governance.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Topic">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Topic</A>

Alexander Praetorius said:
&gt;<i> Would it be possible to automatically have the list of inclusions
</I>&gt;<i> and exclusions linked into the footer of every email?  So it would
</I>&gt;<i> be much easier to switch from here to that place.
</I>
Good idea.  We should say what we're supposed to *do* with this topic
definition.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Enforcements">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Enforcements</A>

I added your suggestion there.  I assume you mean the footer of every
email in the trunk intake.  Those are the only ones our community
(No7) will be able to govern, at least initially.

I also added my own suggestion to the enforcements section, just to be
explicit about it: the trunk intake rejects each submitted link that
the vetters judge off topic by our agreed definition.  This just means
that we want our mirror to show only the discussions that are on
topic, meaning the discussions of *our* topical community.
