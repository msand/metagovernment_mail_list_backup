<PRE>This is theoretical.  We're talking about various forms of reflector
input, in this case different mechanisms or media by which people talk
to each other.  Alex is interested in a mechanism that makes it easier
for the reflector to do its job.  We're also talking about different
kinds of reflector based on the aspect of the social world to be
reflected: e.g. the thread-structural aspect of communication (public
mirror), or argument-structural aspect (argument mirror).

Alexander Praetorius said:

</I>&gt;<i> yes! :-) in an &quot;ideal world&quot; i would think off people discussing and
</I>&gt;<i> using provided tools and mechanics to self structure the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> and enableing an algorithm or some kind of &quot;simple AI&quot; to decorate
</I>&gt;<i> the mirror front for them.  The only thing that is important is,
</I>&gt;<i> that people understand or at least can easily comprehend how that
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism works, so they can use it appropriately.
</I>
You point to a possible problem.  We'd then have the community who
uses mechanism M, and the community who discusses topic T, and the
four combinations of these:

     Use M Talk T
     ----- ------
  a   yes   yes
  b   yes    no
  c    no   yes    (you hope this one is very small)
  d    no    no

Our current public mirror covers all open discussion of topic T in the
world regardless of mechanism, method or medium of discussion (a, c).
I think we would always need that.

In addition, we might also want an &quot;argument mirror&quot;, something that
shows not the *thread* structure of a topical community (as our mirror
does), but rather the *argument* structure.  You and Marc and crew in
Germany are already developing something close to that in concept.  It
too would have to be well governed by the reflected community as a
whole, or would fail to show the true image of that community.
