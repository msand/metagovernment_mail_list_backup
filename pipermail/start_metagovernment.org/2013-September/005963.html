<PRE>To All,

In what follows, I will use the email that Ed complained about, and its 
thread, as my primary use-case example:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005885.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005885.html</A> 


I am very much in agreement with Daniel that we should *not* want to get 
rid of informal discussion, or even to try very hard to clean it up. Our 
informal discussions (in which anything goes, the emails frequently run 
to enormous size, and there is no such thing as &quot;off-topic&quot;) really are 
the center of the life of the community, and the &quot;soil&quot; that progress 
springs from.

An informal discussion is primarily of value to the active participants 
in the discussion (not to spectators), and its value to participants 
lies generally in the interactive process itself, not in the 
&quot;footprints&quot; (emails, etc.) that the process leaves behind as it moves 
along. (Those footprints are like week-old newspapers -- of interest 
only to historians.)

What we lack are not tools and methods to tame and order and summarize 
and index and mirror our informal discussions, but (as Daniel suggests) 
&quot;a model for transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL (be it ideas, 
statements, arguments, decisions, action plans, etc.)&quot;, and the tools 
and practices to implement that model.

Definition: An &quot;authentic&quot; proposal is a clearly articulated proposal 
that has someone's &quot;I/we want this to happen&quot; energy behind it. Such 
proposals are (I suggest) the proper focus of our efforts to formalize. 
Making decisions and taking action with respect to such proposals is 
where &quot;the rubber meets the road&quot;.

What I attempted in the &quot;Metagovernment Bylaws&quot; thread (in the email 
before the email that Ed complained about) was to effect one form of 
transition from informal to formal by *extracting* more or less clearly 
stated proposals from the foregoing chaotic informal discussion of the 
thread. The intention was that those proposals would then be separated 
out and dealt with individually and more formally, using the various 
tools that we have available, such as AllAngles and Vilfredo.

Someone (such as Ed) who is pressed for time and wants to see only &quot;the 
good stuff&quot; should be able to choose to concentrate on reviewing only 
the *proposals* that are on the table and in process, and should be able 
to choose to skip having to wade through the informal discussions (the 
week-old newspapers) to see whether there is anything of interest in 
them. This is the difference between walking through the rainforest 
versus examining the baskets of items that have been harvested from the 
rainforest.

We have the informal discussions at this point, but we have nothing else 
(that we actually use). When formal proposals are made in emails, they 
are immediately sucked back into the chaos of informal discussion. When 
formal proposals are made in wiki pages, there are no processes that 
lead to decision and action, so that the proposals just sit there.

      PROCESSING PROPOSALS

The links below lead to various proposals (from the Blinap model) for 
formally processing proposals.

Collect Proposal 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/eb761dfb0de58201aa1a54ec45032fcb">http://www.wiser.org/article/eb761dfb0de58201aa1a54ec45032fcb</A>&gt;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, we have the 28 proposals that were in the email that Ed complained 
about, we have the Blinap proposals above, and we have dozens 
(hundreds!) of incipient proposals buried throughout our past informal 
discussions on the list. With respect to all of those proposals, how 
shall we transition from informal to formal? How shall we process those 
proposals, and reach decisions with respect to them?
