&gt;<i> So why not make us all moderators of our own &quot;community&quot;?  We could
</I>&gt;<i> share the work. the first of us to click on the +1 button does the
</I>&gt;<i> job for the rest of us.
</I>
That's how our mirror works by default, except vetting is by rough
consensus.  We can change the defaults by governing ourselves.
  
&gt;<i> To put it in different words.  The &quot;front mirror&quot; is some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;public relations&quot; or &quot;community identity&quot; page.  It's a marketing
</I>&gt;<i> thing of the community to advertise to other people.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> already part of the community in discussing something, then you
</I>&gt;<i> already know whats going on.
</I>
Not quite true.  Even a member of a topical community doesn't know the
community's name, or boundaries, or totality of its discussions around
the world *except* through a public mirror.  But the mirror must be
well governed by the community as a whole.  No such mirrors exist yet,
therefore nobody has this information, not even community members.

&gt;<i> I therefor do not like the idea that some people i might not be
</I>&gt;<i> aware of, define how &quot;my community&quot; is represented to the outside
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>
Neither do I.  That won't work at all.  The mirror must be governed by
the community as a whole or it's no good.
 
&gt;<i> &gt; ...  Would you like to help with the manual vetting practice in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the meantime?  It'll give you a sense of what we'd have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yes, i would like to learn about this.
</I>
Okay, please try your hand at vetting:  vvv

&gt;<i> &gt; If you want, just subscribe to the trunk intake and reply with your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vet commands: <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in</A>
</I>

&gt;<i> &gt; PS, C and I just agreed to change the vet commands from 'ok and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 'no, to 'ack and 'nak.  It sounds more command like.
</I>
&gt;<i> what happens if &quot;ack&quot; and C &quot;nak&quot;'s?
</I>
I guess that's not consensus, so relayer would say 'close.  Link is
not imaged in mirror.  Anyway, this is the default mechanism.

&gt;<i> There is no such thing as &quot;mostly technical&quot;.  Even the technical
</I>&gt;<i> rules of how balance sheets work and how equity and liabilities
</I>&gt;<i> rules are defined is a &quot;value judgement&quot;.  Even if its possible to
</I>&gt;<i> completely automate something. If its not possible to automate
</I>&gt;<i> something, than its even more important to care about something.
</I>
Sure, I agree.

Mike
