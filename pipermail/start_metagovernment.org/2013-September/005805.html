<PRE>Haven't had a chance to catch up with other reaction to Daniels 
proposals and I'm stuck in the wilderness for a week with a very poor 
connection the world so I'm not even going to try to catch up till I get 
home.

I just wanted to put on record that Daniel's proposal is exactly what 
I've been calling for and I wholeheartedly support it.

&gt;<i> Hey folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Name's Daniel. Long time follower on this list though shamingly never
</I>&gt;<i> managed to get involved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I'd like to propose a plan of action that could potentially cover the
</I>&gt;<i> issues that have surfaced lately regarding the mailing list, overall
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making and actually making progress.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  First, I suggest we transition our discussions to a forum-like
</I>&gt;<i> platform. The mailing list would remain active and posts on the forum
</I>&gt;<i> would all be published as individual messages on the ML. The handling
</I>&gt;<i> of posts to the ML is slightly more complicated and depends (initially
</I>&gt;<i> at least) on the set of modules that are available for the forum
</I>&gt;<i> software. Parsing mail content especially when trying to correlate
</I>&gt;<i> with upstream messages and trying to identify and extract user
</I>&gt;<i> content, quotes, formatting, etc. is not an easy feat (I've been
</I>&gt;<i> there). A solution that is much more affordable to start with would be
</I>&gt;<i> to enhance the messages by embedding links for the various actions
</I>&gt;<i> (view details, reply, +1, etc.). That way we can focus on the
</I>&gt;<i> correctness of a reference implementation as a web platform and later
</I>&gt;<i> start pushing features down other channels (email, mobile, voice,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  With almost no extra effort, the forum can at least allow us to
</I>&gt;<i> create some structure by segmenting the conversations across
</I>&gt;<i> categories and topics and by providing a threaded view in the web
</I>&gt;<i> interface.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Second, well ... we'd have what I believe would be a minimally viable
</I>&gt;<i> platform for experimentation. A platform that would actually be *in
</I>&gt;<i> use* since our &quot;real&quot; discussions would be conducted on it. Through
</I>&gt;<i> small increments and iterations, we can move towards a rich discourse
</I>&gt;<i> / debate / collaborative reasoning platform :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Integration with a wiki / publishing platform
</I>&gt;<i>  - Argumentation
</I>&gt;<i>  - Decision formalization
</I>&gt;<i>  - Integration with external e-gov tools and platforms
</I>&gt;<i>  - Integration with a ticket-like system for the delegation of tasks
</I>&gt;<i>  - Identity management (SSO, reward system, karma, membership
</I>&gt;<i> certification - badges, privacy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  All of these things could be done separately but in our case, I
</I>&gt;<i> believe two conditions are necessary to actually set things in motion
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Build and contribute to something that is in *real use*. If we can
</I>&gt;<i> manage to eat our own dog food, not only will it taste sweeter for
</I>&gt;<i> those who produce it but I'm positive we'll have even more success
</I>&gt;<i> selling it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Build a free discussion and informal communication platform and
</I>&gt;<i> make it the foundation for any other system. Collaborative governance
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately is all about building a model for transitioning from
</I>&gt;<i> INFORMAL to FORMAL, be it ideas, statements, arguments, decisions,
</I>&gt;<i> action plans, etc. It all starts with an informal discussion even at
</I>&gt;<i> the highest levels of formalism (how would you go about proposing a
</I>&gt;<i> change in the constitution if not by first expressing your thoughts
</I>&gt;<i> with your own words in an informal context ?).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  Let me know what you think about all this and if we can settle on a
</I>&gt;<i> course of action, I can start working on a migration plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
