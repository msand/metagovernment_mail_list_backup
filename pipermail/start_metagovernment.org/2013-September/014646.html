<PRE>Hi Mike,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an aside: &quot;Unanimous Consent&quot; and &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; are 
fundamentally different decision rules. If you like, I can elaborate. 
(But I have already elaborated that distinction, on several occasions 
and in several venues, and I don't want to bore anyone who has actually 
been paying attention by being repetitious ...) :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding Principle II formulation: Up to this point, the &quot;support&quot; that 
Metagovernment has been offering has consisted of the wiki (in which 
individuals can create wiki-pages), the listserv (to which individuals 
can subscribe), and special wiki-pages such as the Projects page where 
projects can be listed (thereby become famous and such).

Since the marginal cost of these supports (one more wiki-page, one more 
email, one more item on the projects list) is within epsilon of zero, 
there has been no need or reason to have any formality involved in 
making these supports available.

But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA Foundation, that 
will apply for grants and such, and will then have serious resources to 
distribute, in service of becoming a useful catalyst with respect to 
changes in global governance. (I guess you didn't get the memo ...) :^)

Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be adequate in that 
context?
