[&gt;question to:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">alexander.praetorius at serapath.de</A>]
    [&gt;1] Why do you do not implement what you suggest? [1&lt;]
[question&lt;]

[&gt;opinion from:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">marc at merkstduwas.de</A>]
    [&gt;1] Seeing your thoughts implemented would be beneficial to all of us. 
[1&lt;]
    [&gt;2] But, IMHO two things are vital to get one step ahead on formalizing 
an informal process:
       [&gt;2.1] to define some basic rules [2.1&lt;]
       [&gt;2.2] and to keep things short and simple. [2.2&lt;]
[opinion&lt;]

Alexander, I agree that rules and manual steps will not work in the long 
run. The difference here is that we want to be able to try something quickly 
which usually means doing it manually until we are sure it works.


I have seen so many projects over the years and so many prototypes and they 
all had a basic system which somehow did what it was supposed to do.
I also have seen many &quot;alpha testers&quot; and &quot;beta testers&quot; or how you might 
call those people to do some kind of artificial discussion to see how it 
&quot;feels&quot; to use that software.
People here on this mailinglist have a grande vision, they know so much more 
about voting and proposals and discussion methods and tools and ...stuff, 
that all those on the metagovernment mailinglists are EXPERTS compared to 
Jessica and Joe Random.

I have a feeling that its not possible to make progress through theoretical 
tinkering. All is said and even more is known by people on this mailinglist, 
each one with his own special niche of expertise.
Instead of creating more theory and &quot;sandbox systems&quot; we should really try 
to start something serious, something that is easy and eventually all could 
agree that it would be a &quot;useful thing&quot;.

For example:
1. Email itself is far from being a perfect technology for discussion 
systems, but the advantage is that there is virtuallz no person on the 
internet which doesnt know or has never used email, because in order to use 
other services, email is a requirement.
2. What i personally believe is very annoying is: Discussion repeats itself. 
I believe its the mechanism which is used to make important stuff persist 
(in the heads or participants, after they have read it often enough). As 
soon as old participants leave and new participants arrive, its possible 
that it will start all over again.
So making stuff persistent is possible today, by copying it to a wiki or 
some static place and have rules about when and how to update it and using a 
lot of discipline, which normally only a view participants will.
So the &quot;GAP&quot; between email discussion flow and static wiki sites and the 
manual transfer between each of them (1. copy stuff into the wiki, 2. 
linking it back into the discussion) is OHM.
Its difficult/hard/takes time/etc... so because on average, people tend to 
take the course of least resistance, they will NOT use both tools (wiki + 
email) in the way they should use it.
So in order to make people do so, we have to lower the barrier, so that 
putting it into the wiki and linking it back into the discussion must be 
easier or less of a hassle then repeating stuff over and over again.
People are annoyed by discussions which repeat themselves time after time 
and they STILL DO IT, because its even more difficult to manually copy stuff 
to a wiki and linking it back in and its ONLY WORTH IT, if the other people 
do the same and stick to it... whats it worth if someone does it, but all 
the others keep repeating stuff???

So maybe it needs some kind of search/autocomplete, maybe it needs some kind 
of automatic suggestions, maybe it needs buttons for 
persist/link/fork/merge/vote/dontknow/whatever... to make it EASIER :-) ..at 
least easier than repeating stuff over and over again :-D

Question:
Do you know tools within the scope of metagovernment which do NOT have some 
kind of &quot;persistance&quot; mechanism? Basically its nothing else then &quot;creating 
something that could be quoted&quot; and &quot;quoting such things in discussions&quot; :-) 
Thats it.
I could easily create something that is backed by my oppinion, put it on my 
website and link to it in discussions. (Maybe some kind of unwise blabber)
Someone else could do the same, and if he has &quot;the same oppinion&quot; and puts 
the same unwise blabber on his website, then there are at least to people 
who have the same oppinion.
So its backed by two people.

So, i dont know what is the lowest common denominator of such &quot;persistance 
functionality&quot; is, when you look at all those tools we have, but we could 
start to use such a lowest common denominator and try to add it to OUR 
METAGOVERNMENT MAILING LIST :-)










I often prototype in paper. Many lean start ups use many manual steps in the 
initial phases until they have traction. I think putting a document together 
would allow for better discussion in the decision on what we want 
implemented before we start coding. If we have platform for prototyping then 
we might be able to code prototypes fast enough to skip the manual steps all 
together.
