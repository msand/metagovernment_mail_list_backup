<PRE>We're hearing objections on the following suggestions for our topic

&gt;<i> I wonder what the problem is with talking about &quot;how to run specific

Ned, could you clarify this RUN exclusion?  I might have been over-
eager in adding it: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Exclusions">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Exclusions</A>
Suppose five separate discussions are happening, each in turn being
about the following:

 (1) Collectively deciding issues in general.

 (2) Collectively deciding issues in general using Blinap.

 (3) Collectively deciding a particular group's issues in general
     using their instantiation of the Blinap process: &quot;Should our
     group use Blinap in this way or that way?  What's better for us?&quot;

 (4) Collectively deciding a particular issue in a particular group
     using their instantiation of the Blinap process: &quot;Joe, you did a
     rotten job of it during last week's Blinap decision.&quot;

 (5) Running a lemonade stand or something else that (in itself) is
     unrelated to our topic.

Which of these would be off topic (excluded) because of RUN?
Obviously not (5); it would be off topic because it's not *on* topic,
not because it concerns running something.

(4) isn't terribly interesting.  But I feel it's on topic all the
same.  For example, I wouldn't want to see such discussions excluded
from our mirror unless they became a problem and there was no other
solution.  What do you think?

&gt;<i> Another thing is the &quot;enforcement mechanism&quot;.  If i can agree to it
</I>&gt;<i> or not strongly depends on the mechanism the vetters use to decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether something wil make it to the trunk or not. If its consensus
</I>&gt;<i> based, then i do not agree.  Because basing it on consensus will
</I>&gt;<i> mean, single people have a veto to EXCLUDE discussion participants
</I>&gt;<i> from the trunk.  If the excluded participant becomes then a vetter
</I>&gt;<i> himself, he can exclude all messages from that vetter who always
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;veto&quot;s to exclude him. So those two fighting each other exclude
</I>&gt;<i> each other from the trunk all the time and nobody could do a
</I>&gt;<i> thing...
</I>
Right, I agree a veto wouldn't work. 

&gt;<i> Why not put it the other way around? Things by default go to the
</I>&gt;<i> TRUNK and only if its CONSENSUS to EXCLUDE them, will they not go to
</I>&gt;<i> the TRUNK :-) That way, nearly everything will go to the TRUNK and
</I>&gt;<i> only if its really something extreme, will it eventually be
</I>&gt;<i> excluded.
</I>
Currently as trunk relayer, responsible for interpreting what our
vetters say, I allow a discussion to appear on the mirror front if a
majority of the vetters 'ack it after 6 hours, or so; otherwise I drop
it.  This seems to be working okay; no problems to report, yet.

Ofc if we want to specify a rule on trunk relaying, then we just have
to decide it in a separate decision thread.

Mike
