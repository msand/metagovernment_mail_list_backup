<PRE>[I screwed up. I should have put the email below at the start of its own 
new thread, but I put it on the &quot;Fair Decision Process&quot; thread instead. 
So, now I am partially correcting my error by doing what I should have 
done in the first place.

I wish we were using discussion software which enabled me to fully 
correct my error, by deleting the other copy of the email before anyone 
responds to it. Since we aren't, please be kind to me and pretend the 
other copy does not exist ...]

Hi Mark,

    Mark&gt; One thing I feel is essential is basic &quot;truth in advertising&quot;.
    I feel there should be a listing that actually asks questions to
    make sure they understand what they are actually voting on.

        This is an essential need.

        An informed and educated voter is what we want to avoid future
        issues.

        Just a quick survey style questionaire. If they don't understand
        what they are voting on it's not a valid vote as far as I am
        concerned.

Ned&gt; I very much agree with you that we will be better off if we make 
public decisions through a system in which all relevant arguments 
regarding each proposal are known to the deciders, and are appropriately 
vetted and weighted in the process of reaching the decision.

When decisions are made through voting on proposals (as on a ballot, or 
using &quot;like/dislike&quot; buttons or whatever), all of the collecting and 
vetting and weighting of the arguments occurs privately within each 
voter, and only the resulting preference (the vote) is known publicly. 
These individual votes are then aggregated somehow to produce the decision.

Since the quality of the decision then relies on the aggregate decision 
making knowledge and skills of each voter working independently and 
privately, I can understand why you would suggest that the decision 
system should test the knowledge and decision making skill of each 
voter, to vet the voters.

So here is my question: rather than vetting voters through giving them a 
quick survey style questionaire, would it work to make decisions through 
proposing (not voting), with each proposal submitted to criticism and 
systematic examination through discourse? Participation in discourse 
would then accomplish the vetting of the knowledge of participants.
