<PRE>Mike,

I apologize for not yet responding to earlier MG postings from you and
others.

I can put on a critical hat and criticize items 1 and 3 easily.  History of
philosophy suggests item 2 is a sort of technocrat social engineering
item.  Item 1 illustrates that in that it is a neuro linguistic programming
statement (NLP).  In this case there is no predicate.  So I am rather in
that tradition but I am not interested in doing this in that way.

&quot;High ground&quot; and &quot;command&quot; suggest dominance structures.  This can
conflict with places I enjoy visiting and puts a rather unhappy slant on
consensus reaching.

The idea of an external chosing of reflectors seems to be again an exercise
in control.  Actually I am wrong.  But it is elitest.  That gets tricky.
If you want to play with reflectors you should find them yourself and then
break them.  What mirror am I looking in such that I see myself as the
proper predicate of my own shoulds?

Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall
move the world.

Archimedes

Lots of images available.

Lets try to expand that quote with freeform thoughts:

Give to share to make
Long-reference the reach of &quot;building the universal intergalactic network&quot;
(Licklider)
Long-4 million years of homind history
Fulcrum-probably the key item to emphasize- the other pieces are everywhere
but where should the fulcrum be placed and what is the fulcrum made of?
The world does not need saving so mayhaps it does not need moving but we
could set a directionality for ourselves that smart people might look back
on and marvel at what wonder came from this effort.  But there is a wisdom
that the greatest are also generally unknown.

Hmm.  There is also a wisdom that I just made up that the greatest control
the effect of experiences on themselves.  We are getting rather too good at
forcing intense experiences on the unprepared .

So one concept statements of...

Oops.  Both your content and approach seem to not reflect the Vision well.
Nor does where I would go do better.  The mission/vision is short enough.
We are not tweeting.  But a few suggested trys at &quot;closing&quot; would be good.

So I will bail out here in the middle of this post.

Blessings,

Max

I'm looking for ideas on how to present this.  If we decide to take
this approach, then I figure there are three messages to get across:
(I) Metagov is where it's starting; II) we're ideologically and
technically non-partisan; and III) we know what we're doing.

(I) Metagov is where it's starting.  Ideally this is the first message
a newcomer to Metagov gets, and it comes across in under 3 seconds.
But all I have to suggest, for now, is this image (also attached):

  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start#SL">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start#SL</A>
  [SL] Start lever.

I don't know if it can be taken seriously. I lifted it from the image
in the third message, just because it was easy to do.  Does anyone
have suggestions on how to improve it?  Or would there be a more
important first message to get across?

(II) We're ideologically and technically non-partisan.  I didn't
attempt to draw an image for this.  Maybe it only needs to be
understood by those who are active in the field, and therefore it
doesn't need a simple image.  In any case, the meaning comes across
best in conjunction with (I); not only is it all starting here in
Metagov, but nobody is being left behind.  The work each of us
contributes, the time and money, won't be trashed.  No winner will
&quot;take all&quot;.  We're making sure of that.

This is hard to say, but you see the need; we must occupy the high
ground in order to &quot;command&quot; the field, or it'll rightly be taken from
us.  Suggestions for stating this?  Or again, am I wrong about this?

(III) We know what we're doing.  This isn't quite true, but I think we
can make it true.  Meantime we can put a bold face on it.  I have a
rough image for this.

  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start#DS">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start#DS</A>
  [DS] Development stages.

The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that
acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on the right side.
That's what we always pictured for Metagov.  Stage 1 (bottom left) is
the agressively expanded, cross-project/ cross-formal tracking I've
been mooting in the threads &quot;Feature Investigation&quot; and &quot;Our current,
past, and future work&quot;.  It's really the only new thing.  Stage 2 is
where we leverage self-determination and self-governance into
leadership of the field.  Again, this is vintage Metagov, and all
that's really new is the fulcrum in stage 1.  The fulcrum works for
three basic reasons: i) reflectors work at all scales in society; ii)
reflectors must be governed; and iii) we can turn reflectors onto the
field itself.

(i) The class of tool that's needed to support Metagov as a self-
determined community (reflector) is the same class that's needed in
society at large.  Most of the tools we talk about in this field are
reflectors.  They present aggregate views of a social reality in which
people see themselves embedded.  In doing this, they support that
reality.  The reflectors and reflection practices that Metagov
pioneers will be applicable to most communities regardless of scale.
Their reflective needs are essentially the same.

(ii) The reflectors must be governed.  This is what self-determination
means in the first instance, to man and steer the reflectors on which
the community's existence, growth and reproduction depend.

(iii) We can turn our reflectors onto the social reality of the field
itself.  We hold a mirror to the wider field (our larger self) and
watch how the image improves over time: a better social reality within
the field, and better reflectors produced by it.

I put a tentative draft in the wiki, basically just this message:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start</A>
Please feel free to move it around, copy, or improve it.
