</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; So now let us juxtapose what you say here regarding the criteria for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fair process&quot; with what you said in response to another proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Thank you Ned, for helping me to put together what i say, because i'm
really having a hard time to really put all those pieces together.
I knew, that somehow in my head, i know what a &quot;fair process&quot; means to me,
but i'm not able to give you a good definition, because i havent
thought about how to fit all those pieces of the puzzle together :-)
You are much better than me, when it comes to a very structured way of
expressing what you want to say.
And it's NOT only because i'm not a native speaker, but because my thinking
is somehow chaotic, that means associative or more a reflex to stuff that
is thrown at me ;-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Participation: Through Proposing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i>        formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i>        ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;<i>        provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;<i>        making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Alex&gt; Can't support this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        You seem to think in binary mode here (vote vs. proposal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        But voting is a shortcut to get results, even if things are not
</I>&gt;<i>        discussed through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        But because time moves on, more iterations are possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Good thing is, the &quot;voting shortcut&quot; allows people to act even
</I>&gt;<i>        though they havent finished the discussion yet, that means they
</I>&gt;<i>        havent resolved all issues yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Using voting with a majority or super-majority decision rule may or
</I>&gt;<i> may not &quot;speed things up&quot; compared to using proposing with &quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i> objections&quot; as the decision rule. Whether it will depends on the specifics
</I>&gt;<i> of the two specific systems being compared, and is an empirical question to
</I>&gt;<i> be answered through experimentation and observation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, whether or not voting &quot;speeds things up&quot;, using voting with a
</I>&gt;<i> majority or super-majority decision rule will definitely render the
</I>&gt;<i> decision process unfair by the criteria that you have suggested above. Yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I believe it depends on the &quot;chunk&quot; that is voted on.
I will try to illustrate what i mean with a small example.

First i would like to point out, that &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; is a long
term goal for both methods (at least in my oppinion it should be)

*Proposal/Counterproposal/No Unresolved Objections Method:
*(European Example)
*A.* In the future, we want to use renewable energy only, no coal, no
nuclear, no oil. It should be imported from Norway and Sweden and it's done
over the next 10 years, while we stop using nuclear energy right away,
while coal will continue and decline with the growth of reneable energy
sources. We will use a budget  of 2% of the gross domestic product for
supporting that process.

*B.* In the future, we want to use renewable energy and coal/nuclear to
satisfy basic needs, we also want to support electric cars, because there
will be synergy effects. It should be imported from Russia and Africa
(Desert Tech Project) and we should not make us dependent on scandinavia
alone. it's done over the next 20 years,

=&gt; discussion follows, yadda yadda yadda

*C.* .... some sort of compromise + additional new topics + yadda yadda
yadda

=&gt; yadda yadda yadda.... one day, there will be consensus ... eventually :-)

*Comment*: This process normally makes it impossible for &quot;average people&quot;
to participate, because its NON-TRIVIAL to come up with a counter proposal
and make it known by many people.



*Voting on atomic questions/ No Unresolved Objections in the long term
Method:
*(New) A. Abandon Non-Renewable Energy   + [Links to &quot;Mirror Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 15%, No 35%, Dont Know 40%, Rest 10%  +
 [Question+Vote Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(New) B. Use lots of renewable energy sources  + [Links to &quot;Mirror
Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 35%, No 5%, Dont Know 40%, Rest 20% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(New) C. Get energy from Africas Desert Tech Project  + [Links to &quot;Mirror
Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 30%, No 40%, Dont Know 20%, Rest 10% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(New) D. Get energy from Norway  + [Links to &quot;Mirror Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 40%, No 30%, Dont Know 20%, Rest 10% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(New) E. Build and Use more electric low cost cars with high driving
ranges  + [Links to &quot;Mirror Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 50%, No 25%, Dont Know 15%, Rest 10% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(New) F. Build renewable energy projects in germany  + [Links to &quot;Mirror
Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 70%, No 15%, Dont Know 10%, Rest 5% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(MergeReplace C,D,F) F. Build renewable energy ourself and replace
traditional energy import by renewable energy from africa or norway and
others if necessary  + [Links to &quot;Mirror Front(s)&quot;]
=&gt; Vote Results: Yes 55%, No 10%, Dont Know 30%, Rest 5% +  [Question+Vote
Manifestation published to each Voters Profile]
(Split F)
G1. Build renewable energy outself, as long as it is at most 5% more
expensive than traditiona energy
G2. Replace traditional energy import by renewable energy from other
countries, as long as its at most 5% more expensive

... yadda yadda yadda



In Both cases, you AIM for increasing &quot;Yes&quot; towards 100%
The LATTER appraoch enables you to exactly TRACK which people have which
interests and make &quot;atomic proposals&quot; that target specific people.
A (New) Proposal will just be ADDED to &quot;Voter Profiles&quot; if they vote YES
B (MergeReplace) Proposals will replace the listed proposals with the new
one if voted YES by the voter
C (Split) Proposal will replace a proposal with the set of new ones if
voted with YES by the voter


ADDITION:
Instead of using only &quot;YES, NO, DONTKNOW&quot;, one could instead use &quot;Range
Voting&quot; a.k.a &quot;Score Voting&quot; :-)
...or let proposers decide which method to use, but make it CLEAR to VOTERS
at &quot;VOTING TIME&quot;, what effects it will have to their USER PROFILE :-)


IMAGINE THAT :-)
If this will become a reality, you can actually go the you favourite pub,
look at the user/voter profiles of your fellow drinkers and discuss stuff.
If you manage to create a &quot;question&quot; (a SPLIT or MERGEREPLACE) one and they
vote with YES, you change their profile, resulting in a step forward
torwards consent.

Politicians will STOP to discuss on behalf of US, but instead people will
discuss directly and change something and it will be transparent.
It also makes it easy for politicians to target specific groups of people
and craft some very thoughtfully crafted &quot;Questions&quot;, that might eventually
enable huge &quot;oppinion merges&quot; :-)
