&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> POI: I have been on this list for a year now, reading the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To begin my response I would like to draw attention to the fact that there
</I>&gt;<i> is a reality out there, and there are words that we manipulate here. The
</I>&gt;<i> words are not the reality. Language is a useful tool (and it's all we have
</I>&gt;<i> right here), but its limitations need to be acknowledged. The most precise
</I>&gt;<i> language we have is mathematics, but there accuracy is accompanied by
</I>&gt;<i> abstraction. (And G&#246;del showed in any case that even math is incomplete).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one doesn't think that there can be any shared assumptions or values
</I>&gt;<i> that underlie our work here together, then I have to disagree; they are
</I>&gt;<i> there, whether stated or unstated. It may well be, though, that as we
</I>&gt;<i> clarify them in words, those who do not share them will leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The purpose of my post was to try and uncover the values that those of us
</I>&gt;<i> already here share; and to focus our efforts in a specific direction, based
</I>&gt;<i> upon my fourth assumption that we don't have time to waste since (according
</I>&gt;<i> to good evidence) the world is heading for catastrophic collapse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
who knows for sure, but maybe it is :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> needsandlimits.org gives a one-page summary of the ideas of
</I>&gt;<i> contractionism (revolutionary de-growth, if you like), I don't think I need
</I>&gt;<i> to repost it here. There is also a full summary to download as well as the
</I>&gt;<i> two books themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Contractionary Revolution contains an ample glossary of terms. For example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;&lt;
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalism: An economic system that arose in Europe around 1500 to rapidly
</I>&gt;<i> increase the output rate. Under capitalism a society is divided into two
</I>&gt;<i> main classes: the owners of productive assets (capitalists) and those who
</I>&gt;<i> sell their labor power to these owners (workers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
i do not believe in this simplistic summary. &quot;classes&quot; do not exist, even
though there its not a continuous structure, because people can be counted,
you could do a topological sorting on all kinds of properties. Yes i
believe there is a &quot;great divide&quot; on many levels but there are very
different kinds of workers and different kinds of capitalists and people
that fit neither of those categories well.
The history of money is much older than the year 1500 and empires are
always built on some kind of money mechanism and money and other rules are
evolving all the time, so the broad statement above is not helpful in any
way i can imagine.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalist class (power model): In a capitalist society, the class that
</I>&gt;<i> owns the key productive assets and exercises political power; hence, its
</I>&gt;<i> ruling class. The capitalist class also acts as an instrument of social
</I>&gt;<i> control. It is moderately visible to the populace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
i do not believe in classes. PANTA RHEI !!!
We are all cyborgs and our metaphysical extensions as a cyborg can be
listed in a balance sheet ;-)
There are powerful people or influential people, but its not always about
money (e.g. madonna, the beatles, ghandi, einstein, aristoteles, the pope
....)
There are many capitalists who own FAR MORE than those i've listed, but
their power is not as influential.
If those would try to be powerful and use all their resources, than what
would still apply is:
imagine a car from 50 years ago and a car today. the car today can be
superior in every way and needs less ressources to be operated

...but anyway, who cares, because i think such stuff is far off topic :P



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalist logic: An economic logic that rapidly increases the output rate
</I>&gt;<i> without rational oversight. It is expressed through the market interactions
</I>&gt;<i> of two incentives: profit maximization by firms and the desires of
</I>&gt;<i> manipulated consumers. Compare: &quot;logic of sustainable well-being&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;manipulated customers&quot; ... &quot;profit maximization&quot;...
...this is all words that mean everything and nothing.
and whats &quot;sustainable well-being&quot; anyway :-)
How's that helpful to &quot;metagovernment&quot;?


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And one further point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>&gt;<i> governance?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;I believe there can be no general answer to this question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;The only answer might be, to make the process of finding whats best for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;everyone &quot;more fair&quot;???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't &quot;what's best for everyone&quot; equate to &quot;human well-being&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&quot;whats best for everyone&quot; is as blurry as &quot;human well-being&quot;
every human decides for themselves whats best for them.
every human can be influenced by others.
...but thats how the universe works. everything is connected.
There is no easy answer.
Just give the people the ability to find out for themselves and let them
figure it out.
We do not need to think what &quot;human well-being&quot; is and what rules or
whatever derive from from &quot;human well-being&quot; so that it happens.

People will find out for themselves.
Just give them the technology of &quot;nuclear fission&quot; and people will find out
whether they want to use it for nuclear bombs or nuclear energy reactors
Just give them the technology of &quot;internet&quot; and people will find out
whether to use it of &quot;public surveillance&quot; or &quot;e-learning&quot; or &quot;e-commerce&quot;
or whatever...

Just give them a technology to discuss stuff, inform others, make
decisions/laws, whatever... and they will figure out what they wanna do
with it on their own.
Thats why i believe it is not important what &quot;human well-being&quot; is.
Thats what i decide for myself and thats whay i eventually pass on to
friends, relatives and others if i can convince them. Sometimes they
convince me instead to believe something else instead...
