</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just returned home from conducting a three week long study of the future
</I>&gt;<i> of the internet. My client, Mozilla Fire Fox,  a leading open source
</I>&gt;<i> internet search engine is a non-profit agency. Which means unlike other big
</I>&gt;<i> players in the digital industry they are not driven by a motivation to make
</I>&gt;<i> a profit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact the company was found with the purpose of disrupting and
</I>&gt;<i> decentralizing the control mechanisms within the internet and creating a
</I>&gt;<i> genuine open source culture of engaging people in building tools and using
</I>&gt;<i> tools for harnessing the potential of the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was in Thailand and Indonesia for this study. Our next round of study
</I>&gt;<i> will take place in India. I have come back inspired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The purpose of learning from these countries is-  that the client believes
</I>&gt;<i> that they will get an untainted view of opportunities for OPEN SORCE
</I>&gt;<i> evolution of the internet by talking to people in societies that function
</I>&gt;<i> under different circumstances and value systems from the more so called
</I>&gt;<i> technologically advanced countries (such as the US).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the key ideas that are emerging from this study is to make democracy
</I>&gt;<i> work in its true spirit. People in these countries are eager to participate
</I>&gt;<i> more in the democratic process, beyond the role currently allowed in pseudo
</I>&gt;<i> democracies. What does this mean to the designers. I would like to pose
</I>&gt;<i> some questions and would welcome a dialogue or your ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. How can we build tools where people can collaborate to envision a future
</I>&gt;<i> that is not tainted by the rhetoric of politicians but by genuine
</I>&gt;<i> aspirations of people?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A google search reveals, there are already numerous tools, none of them
perfect, but all better than nothing.


&gt;<i> 2. How do we bring internet based tools that allow for greater transparency
</I>&gt;<i> in the institutions that affect people's lives (businesses, governments and
</I>&gt;<i> NGO's).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I dont know. A tool has to solve a specific problem/need they have right
now.
Someone has to introduce the tools to them, so they can solve imminent
problems.
But in order to be able to solve those, we need to get familiar with their
most important problems
and we have to study how using the right tools could bring relief.


&gt;<i> 3. How do we use the internet and mobile technologies to help citizens
</I>&gt;<i> maintain vigil over how public institutions, businesses  and the government
</I>&gt;<i> conduct themselves?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thats a long way to go and i consider it more to be a long term vision,
than a goal that
can be reached in a short time.
To me, that path is not yet illuminated to a degree where i can see
everything that must be done to achieve this.
But by letting that goal pull me, i believe, i know the direction in which
to steer and from the experience
i've gained in the last couple of years, i also believe, i know the first
steps, which after having been taken,
will reveal the next ....all guided by the pulling force that long term
vision creates.



&gt;<i> 4. How do help bring closer monitoring of the information in public domain
</I>&gt;<i> so that people's right to information can be better exercised?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There is already an organisation called &quot;Open Knowledge Foundation&quot;, which,
accross all of europe,
brings &quot;open data&quot; to governments and their institutions. So more and more
data becomes available,



&gt;<i> 5. How do we enhance the government and people interface?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Build it bottom-up. &quot;Government&quot; in general is just something that governs (
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance</A>)
In that context, there are similar problems in all domains of life, (e.g.
at peoples work places too)
So, i believe it has to start small, which means, we have to craft tools
that cater to precisely defined needs and solve problems for the people
we want to use those tools. The experience we get from this can be used to
scale up those tools.
This will not only give us experience, but also give us credibility, which
is vitaly important in order to be considered as a solution,
that might improve that interface. People, which know how to use those
tools in their workplace for &quot;government issues&quot; might
even start to DEMAND those tools for broader government issues and might
even vote for candidates or parties that promote those.



&gt;<i> 6. How do we build communities of people who align with my client's desire
</I>&gt;<i> to use the skills of the geeks in enhancing community life in the real
</I>&gt;<i> world?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Use html/javascript/css to build those tools, make them responsive and make
them available on desktop, tablet and mobile.
Make them not so geeky, but very user friendly. Solve real problems they
encounter in every day life.




&gt;<i> Please feel free to comment or to send me a private email. We are
</I>&gt;<i> conducting next phase of research in India after we have analyzed the data
</I>&gt;<i> from Thailand and Indonesia. We would be particularly interested in
</I>&gt;<i> envisioning communities of geeks connected to communities of socially
</I>&gt;<i> responsible people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I am also interested in conceptualizing Hacker Soaces to empower
</I>&gt;<i> India's democracy, as we approach the next Parliamentary elections early
</I>&gt;<i> next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
