<PRE>Ed,

It seens this group tends to play toward goverance  which is often a code
for doing what your betters want.

Democratic values-- I do not know what those are and just because I want to
slash and burn, does that mean I cannot play?

Democratic process might be better  and from that you can perhaps identify
a certain political progressive part of myself.

So you want a consensus system.  Is this pure or modified.   And how do you
think about elitism?  If I walk through an Occupy meeting my best idea is
to say a few words and pray that the words generate a positive 50 years
out. Some things do need to be done sooner   heirarchies sometimes are
useful.

Finally, I do not favor direct democracy but I do not mind transitive
representation.  I do not see that emphasized.  Instead, some technocrat
invocation of complex tech solves all problems.  I am dismayed as I start
to think about this.  Can we say The Terror?.  Thermidor?

My NSA friends and the magic numbers they put into NIST elliptical curve
encryption comes to mind.  That took forever and Snowden for anyone to
notice and it was FOSS enough.

This is fun but too much fun.
