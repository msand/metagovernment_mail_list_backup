</I>&gt;<i> Alexander, I agree that rules and manual steps will not work in the long

</I>&gt;<i> quickly which usually means doing it manually until we are sure it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have seen so many projects over the years and so many prototypes and they
all had a basic system which somehow did what it was supposed to do.
I also have seen many &quot;alpha testers&quot; and &quot;beta testers&quot; or how you might
call those people to do some kind of artificial discussion to see how it
&quot;feels&quot; to use that software.
People here on this mailinglist have a grande vision, they know so much
more about voting and proposals and discussion methods and tools and
...stuff, that all those on the metagovernment mailinglists are EXPERTS
compared to Jessica and Joe Random.

I have a feeling that its not possible to make progress through theoretical
tinkering. All is said and even more is known by people on this
mailinglist, each one with his own special niche of expertise.
Instead of creating more theory and &quot;sandbox systems&quot; we should really try
to start something serious, something that is easy and eventually all could
agree that it would be a &quot;useful thing&quot;.

For example:
1. Email itself is far from being a perfect technology for discussion
systems, but the advantage is that there is virtuallz no person on the
internet which doesnt know or has never used email, because in order to use
other services, email is a requirement.
2. What i personally believe is very annoying is: Discussion repeats
itself. I believe its the mechanism which is used to make important stuff
persist (in the heads or participants, after they have read it often
enough). As soon as old participants leave and new participants arrive, its
possible that it will start all over again.
So making stuff persistent is possible today, by copying it to a wiki or
some static place and have rules about when and how to update it and using
a lot of discipline, which normally only a view participants will.
So the &quot;GAP&quot; between email discussion flow and static wiki sites and the
manual transfer between each of them (1. copy stuff into the wiki, 2.
linking it back into the discussion) is OHM.
Its difficult/hard/takes time/etc... so because on average, people tend to
take the course of least resistance, they will NOT use both tools (wiki +
email) in the way they should use it.
So in order to make people do so, we have to lower the barrier, so that
putting it into the wiki and linking it back into the discussion must be
easier or less of a hassle then repeating stuff over and over again.
People are annoyed by discussions which repeat themselves time after time
and they STILL DO IT, because its even more difficult to manually copy
stuff to a wiki and linking it back in and its ONLY WORTH IT, if the other
people do the same and stick to it... whats it worth if someone does it,
but all the others keep repeating stuff???

So maybe it needs some kind of search/autocomplete, maybe it needs some
kind of automatic suggestions, maybe it needs buttons for
persist/link/fork/merge/vote/dontknow/whatever... to make it EASIER :-)
..at least easier than repeating stuff over and over again :-D

Question:
Do you know tools within the scope of metagovernment which do NOT have some
kind of &quot;persistance&quot; mechanism? Basically its nothing else then &quot;creating
something that could be quoted&quot; and &quot;quoting such things in discussions&quot;
:<i>-) Thats it.
</I>I could easily create something that is backed by my oppinion, put it on my
website and link to it in discussions. (Maybe some kind of unwise blabber)
Someone else could do the same, and if he has &quot;the same oppinion&quot; and puts
the same unwise blabber on his website, then there are at least to people
who have the same oppinion.
So its backed by two people.

So, i dont know what is the lowest common denominator of such &quot;persistance
functionality&quot; is, when you look at all those tools we have, but we could
start to use such a lowest common denominator and try to add it to OUR
METAGOVERNMENT MAILING LIST :-)










&gt;<i> I often prototype in paper. Many lean start ups use many manual steps in
</I>&gt;<i> the initial phases until they have traction. I think putting a document
</I>&gt;<i> together would allow for better discussion in the decision on what we want
</I>&gt;<i> implemented before we start coding. If we have platform for prototyping
</I>&gt;<i> then we might be able to code prototypes fast enough to skip the manual
</I>&gt;<i> steps all together.
