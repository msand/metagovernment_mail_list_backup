<PRE>In my vernacular, an example of a &quot;partial solution&quot; would be a solution 
that gets you to the asteroid but then fails to bring you back, leaving 
you stranded on the asteroid. (There was a movie about that ...)

An &quot;incremental solution&quot; is a baby-step along an iterative 
design&gt;develop&gt;deploy path, and is the alternative to a &quot;waterfall 
solution&quot; which tries to traverse the path in one giant step.

A famous historical example of a &quot;partial incremental solution&quot; was when 
Microsoft released the first 64-bit version of Windows without printer 
drivers -- oops!

Partial solutions generally wind up being no solutions at all.

    If one does not design a mechanism about how things should work out,
    then things will work out in some ways, but you will not know in
    which ways beforehand.

    The same with power structures. Either you design the mechanisms on
    how they form, or you dont and they will form in one way or another,
    often not to the benefit of the whole. -- Alex

Partial solutions generally wind up being no solutions at all.
