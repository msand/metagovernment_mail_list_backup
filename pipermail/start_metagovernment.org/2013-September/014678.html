</I>

I think that C might be a good &quot;trunk vetter&quot;, but i dont like the concept
of &quot;trunk vetting&quot; at all, and already have problems with &quot;tribulatory
thing&quot;. Any time people take on a role as some kind of &quot;gate keeper&quot;,
things stop to scale well and problems are introduced all over the place.
A good example might be the &quot;wikipedia community&quot; and how hard it can
become to change something in wikipedia or add something new. I heard that
its already a pita with the english wikipedia, but u havent seen whats
going on in the german version of wikipedia.

Instead of having some kind of &quot;moderator roles&quot; as &quot;gate keepers&quot;, i would
hope, that we invent tools, so that people can &quot;self organize&quot; how things
are structured and through the tools they tell the &quot;AI&quot; or some kind of
simple algorithm sitting in the background, how to decorate the &quot;mirror
front&quot;
This might be tags or it might be some kind of voting mechanism (like +1)
or whatever...




&gt;<i> Or add more trunk vetters to help him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or throw away vetting and replace it with something else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes! :-)
in an &quot;ideal world&quot; i would think off people discussing and using provided
tools and mechanics to self structure the discussion and enableing an
algorithm or some kind of &quot;simple AI&quot; to decorate the mirror front for them.
The only thing that is important is, that people understand or at least can
easily comprehend how that mechanism works, so they can use it
appropriately.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting thought: &quot;We had in direction D, where D is undefined&quot; +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;We make all Discussions of topic T visible, where T is undefined&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I'm not yet sure what to make of it, but i can live with it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it sounds useful :P)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But still, i dont know what's next or what to do now.
</I>&gt;<i>
