<PRE>I have no clue, but the topic we are talking about might be best described
with the word &quot;metagovernment&quot;.
I think it fits pretty well, but there might be other communities who use
totally different vocabulary, but are actually talking about something
similar

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has taken).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that the point? Am I supposed to be able to understand this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conversation by viewing a sort of abstract in the form of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mirror?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.  We have been talking about mirrors, but that's not the question.
</I>&gt;<i> The test would be pretty much the same if we were asked to govern a
</I>&gt;<i> popsicle stand, or lemon-aid stand.  Imagine, &quot;Here's a popsicle
</I>&gt;<i> stand, or lemon-aid stand, or some kind of stand.  Anyway the whole
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise is ours if we can manage to govern it.  Ready, set, go!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we actually have is a device that displays on the sidewalk
</I>&gt;<i> (projector-like) the world-wide discussions of our community, where
</I>&gt;<i> our community is a topical community for which the topic is undefined.
</I>&gt;<i> The whole show is ours if we can manage to govern it.  Ready, set, go!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if so, I don't see it now. When I look at these two links
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see mostly nothing. Certainly nothing that gives me depth on where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we are in this process. What's next and/or what am I missing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is the question Alex asked originally, and we never had a chance
</I>&gt;<i> to answer it.  I agree it's a good question.  I'll try to answer it:
</I>&gt;<i> If it were a sales stand of some kind, the next thing we'd probably
</I>&gt;<i> want to know is what kind of stand exactly (take a look).  And who
</I>&gt;<i> exactly are we (look around).  But instead we have a public mirror
</I>&gt;<i> sitting on the sidewalk.  A public mirror won't work till it has a
</I>&gt;<i> topic.  So we need (1) to define what topic our topical community is
</I>&gt;<i> discussing.  That could be our first decision as a (self) government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then (2) the mirror will start projecting all the discussions of that
</I>&gt;<i> topic on the sidewalk for everyone to see.  Looking at them and
</I>&gt;<i> looking in particular at who's participating in them, we'll learn
</I>&gt;<i> who's in our community.  It might be nobody, or everybody, or
</I>&gt;<i> something in between, depending on how &quot;big&quot; a topic we've chosen.
</I>&gt;<i> Having determined ourselves in this way (rather boldly), we then try
</I>&gt;<i> to govern ourselves.  We'll succeed or fail pretty quickly I imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> And if we fail, we'll learn the reason why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, there's no hurry.  Let's imagine Ed is unable to reply till
</I>&gt;<i> next weekend, but we want to make some progress toward self-governance
</I>&gt;<i> before he returns.  Like we're a self-responsible community where
</I>&gt;<i> everyone pitches in a little.  What (briefly) should we do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or how would you answer if you were in Ed's place?
