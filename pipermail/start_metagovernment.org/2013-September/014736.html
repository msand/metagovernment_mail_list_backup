hahaha :-)
In my &quot;world view&quot;, its IMPOSSIBLE that it is something else. I wonder how
anyone could assume there is a different thing at all :-)



&gt;<i> That is quite a lot to ask especially when your choice of words draw a
</I>&gt;<i> different picture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok, i will just add it to my signature then, but i still find it somewhat
funny, that some people seem to believe that its even possible for me to
say something thats not my personal opinion/experience. I dont see how such
a thing can be possible at all.



&gt;<i> Using infinitives like 'always' and 'cannot' and phrases like 'waste of
</I>&gt;<i> time' evokes feelings in your readers regardless of the content and
</I>&gt;<i> personal history with you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I know this can happen. &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;cannot&quot; or &quot;waste of time&quot; just means
i very very strongly believe in those things and currently cannot imagine
that there might be another way.
Some people believe it is mandatory for others to use such strong words or
otherwise they wont even listen to you because they think you dont know
what you are talking about. Some other people find it quite rude if one
uses such language at all.

I'm totally open to arguments why it might not be a &quot;waste of time&quot; or why
it CAN work or is not ALWAYS the case :-)


It makes you sound childish and maniacal. That tone is contagious and
&gt;<i> lowers the quality of the discussion and community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
sry then. i try to avoid it, but i admit, i sometimes have emotions that
make me say such things :-)



&gt;<i> I simply ask people to take a moment and attempt to make sure their heart
</I>&gt;<i> felt intent is obvious in their text. I am not very good at this myself.
</I>&gt;<i> This email list is not a conversation with a close friend. This is speaking
</I>&gt;<i> to a wide variety of cultures and many new people only have one email or
</I>&gt;<i> two to decide how they spend their time. I would prefer they spend it with
</I>&gt;<i> us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yeah, i know :-)
some might judge me rude for writing the way i do. some might stop reading
what i say, because of my grammar or spelling, some consider it
unscientific sometimes, or whatever... i'm ok with not everybody having to
like what i say.
I tried it before, but it did not help much and so now i just write what i
think/believe/feel and try to be not unfair.
Sometimes i am and i do not realize it, but when i understand that i was,
then i do apologize and try to fix things.
Sometimes i feel that i shouldnt fix things, because i still believe that
what i said is right even though the other person feels its wrong and might
even feel offended.

At least i will put it into my signature from now on :-)
