<PRE>Hi Alex and All,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; There must (eventually) be a meta process that can improve the
    rules surrounding that structured process or set of tools/options.

    Ned&gt; (Alex: again your proposal. Ready to be put onto its own
    thread, and elaborated.)

        (And also, the Blinap design has this as an intrinsic feature.)

    Alex&gt; A very important aspect is to capture the &quot;reasoning&quot; behind
    any decision, so you have something to start with when a &quot;system is
    to be improved&quot;

Ned&gt; When voting is used to make decisions, the reasoning of the 
individual voter is unknown, and the reasoning of the majority or 
super-majority that makes the decision is unknown.

When all participation in decision making is through proposing, with 
each proposal submitted to criticism and systematic examination through 
discourse, the reasoning of each participant and the reasoning 
underlying the final decision is as fully exposed as it can be and needs 
to be (according to those participating).

If (as you say) we need a meta process, and if (as you say) the meta 
process will need for the reasoning behind decisions to be publicly 
exposed, then decision making through proposing will work (from the 
perspective of these requirements), and decision making through voting 
will not work. Yes?
