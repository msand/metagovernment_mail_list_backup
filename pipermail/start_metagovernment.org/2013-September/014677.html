&gt;<i> I read the reddit link, i read the public mirror link.  Not yet
</I>&gt;<i> convinced about the intermediate roles who define what goes into the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mirror front&quot; and what might not end up there.  Those &quot;intermediate
</I>&gt;<i> roles&quot; will create a distorted mirror fronts and eventually they
</I>&gt;<i> even will do this on purpose if they are motivated extrinsically or
</I>&gt;<i> intrinsically. ...
</I>
Yes, you understand the technical setup, and the need for governance.

&gt;<i> ..but so be it, for the moment (right now, there is no &quot;tributary
</I>&gt;<i> intake&quot;, only the &quot;trunk intake&quot; which publishes to that &quot;reddit
</I>&gt;<i> thread&quot; thing)
</I>
To the &quot;mirror front&quot;.  Yes.
 
&gt;<i> Maybe its possible to somehow automate those &quot;intermediate roles
</I>&gt;<i> later on&quot;, using some kind of agreed upon rules, or maybe make it
</I>&gt;<i> easy to replace those &quot;persons in charge&quot; or maybe have some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> voting mechanism or veto mechanism to opt-out stuff. ...i think
</I>&gt;<i> there will be ways to improve this somehow.
</I>
We have a default mechanism in place called &quot;trunk vetting&quot;.  Incoming
thread links are quickly approved or rejected by the trunk vetters.
This determines the image that appears on the mirror front.  Currently
our only trunk vetter is C, who's fallen asleep on the job.  We can
fire him if we want to.  (cc C)

Or add more trunk vetters to help him.

Or throw away vetting and replace it with something else.

&gt;<i> Interesting thought: &quot;We had in direction D, where D is undefined&quot; +
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We make all Discussions of topic T visible, where T is undefined&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not yet sure what to make of it, but i can live with it,
</I>&gt;<i> because it sounds useful :P)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But still, i dont know what's next or what to do now.
</I>
You've made a good start.  I'm following you.  :^)

Mike
