<PRE>(oops, sent it to early)

I use those guidelines in order to think hard and try to come up with the
best process i can imagine.
It will be still imperfect. :-)
Maybe those &quot;proposals&quot; can be put or used as &quot;REASONS&quot; for different parts
of the real process/system or mechanisms we use.
So every time someone wants to change part of the mechanics, he can compare
the current one and the new one against those &quot;REASONS&quot; :-)



     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>  24. Compensation For Work Done
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision system should appropriately compensate workers for
</I>&gt;<i>      valuable work done. It should not depend on people &quot;working for free&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (This requires that there be processes that determine what the
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;appropriate compensation&quot; will be.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (Blinap has such processes.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Yes, this is a hard problem.
But maybe a very central one, even though we do normally not speak about it.
But if there would be a solution to this one, then others might be easily
solvable :-)

Still the best thing i currently can imagine is two mechanisms:
1. the one who comes up with work to be done should pay for it [between
entities]
2. Wideband Delphi Method (e.g. Planning Poker) [within entities, such es
teams] <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_delphi">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wideband_delphi</A>



     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>  25. Payment in Money (Not Stock)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      The decision system should pay for work done in the form of money
</I>&gt;<i>      (not stock).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: :^) Since I am writing this draft of the proposal, I get to
</I>&gt;<i>      pick which way it goes. You are free to reverse the preference
</I>&gt;<i>      when you start your new thread, in which the relative pros and
</I>&gt;<i>      cons of the two forms of payment are discussed.) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

No, i believe you might confuse the spirit of money and stock.
Stock means, those who participate decide amongst each other what their
work is worth.
With money, the decision is external to the subsystem.

Beside that, the decision between &quot;who gets how much stock&quot; is in essence
the same as &quot;who gets how much money&quot;, because:
1. After it has been decided upon who gets how much stock, then the
&quot;incoming money will be distributed according to the distribution of shares.
2. If participants would directly argue who gets how much money, then you
would be able to DERIVE what that would have meant in stocks,

...so in essence its about the &quot;distribution key&quot; that is decided on, and
thats what SHARES or STOCK is :-)









     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>  26. Payment Through A Bank
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      To enable payment, the decision system needs to be associated with
</I>&gt;<i>      an online bank.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (In the beginning -- as our alpha testing phase -- we can if we
</I>&gt;<i>      wish create our own community money, and have our own private bank
</I>&gt;<i>      that handles that money.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The &quot;bank account&quot; will hold all the revenue.
The &quot;stocks a.k.a shares a.k.a distribution key&quot; will decide how the money
is distributed upon participants.
Therefor, its never about money in the first place, but about shares.
You can avoid the word and not give the process a name, but its what
happens.

Everyone who is paid money leaves the circle of participants, thus,
he explicitly or implicitly sells his &quot;shares&quot; to the others :-)
It's totally ok if someone wants to do that, but this should not be a
default mechanism. What if i dont want to sell my shares to a subgroup of
participants which for some random obscure reasons have &quot;the right&quot; to get
all the shares, while some other participants may ask them to buy some
shares from them, but wont get any if those random few do not want to sell.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>  27. Partnerships &amp; Projects
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      It is proposed that all of the work of the decision system be done
</I>&gt;<i>      by partnerships, working under project contracts. (A partnership
</I>&gt;<i>      may have from 1 to 24 partners.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: this proposal is my agreement with and elaboration of your
</I>&gt;<i>      objection to the existence of the employer/employee relationship.
</I>&gt;<i>      If we say &quot;no&quot; to the employer/employee relation, we must say
</I>&gt;<i>      &quot;yes&quot; to some other arrangement.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

shareholders.
As i tried to explain above, the &quot;distribution key&quot; for money/revenue shall
be called &quot;shares&quot; or &quot;stocks&quot;
all participants get shares and therefor money through their shares.
all participants can sell their shares if they want to, thus effectively
get &quot;a wage&quot; (makeing him something very similar to an employee)
I do not like this 1 to 24 random number of partners.
why not make it 500 or even 7 billion? :-)
if u want to restrict it, you should give a reason why :P





&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>  28. Project Contracts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Project contracts are proposed into the system library (which
</I>&gt;<i>      makes them available for selection), and then are selected from
</I>&gt;<i>      the library when it is time to initiate a project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      (Alex: I *DO NOT* want us to create tasks/goals on the fly
</I>&gt;<i>      (without opportunity for all stakeholders to be notified and
</I>&gt;<i>      respond), and I *DO* want the process of initiating a project to
</I>&gt;<i>      be fast and easy. The two-step process above can in many cases
</I>&gt;<i>      accomplish both.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Awesome, yes, so i propose a similar &quot;Open Source Github Mechanism&quot;, where
people can fork/share/copy/steal ;-)/ etc... all kinds of &quot;contracts&quot;.
There might soon evolve standard contracts for different kind of
partner/team activities.
They could be used similar to how open source licences are used today.







&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      WHAT NOW?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We now have in hand 28 proposals. A couple of the proposals might even be
</I>&gt;<i> seen as &quot;bylaw&quot; sorts of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For each proposal, our aim (as a &quot;start group&quot; I guess -- not clear who
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we&quot; is at this point) is to decide whether to implement the proposal as it
</I>&gt;<i> stands, or to not implement the proposal as it stands.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (At the scale of large-populations, we must conceptualize that a modified
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is a new proposal. However, at this informal, community-scale
</I>&gt;<i> stage of the game -- since we have no need to notify strangers all over the
</I>&gt;<i> world (who are not on the mailing list) when a modification is made -- we
</I>&gt;<i> can get away with on-the-fly informal modification of proposals. So &quot;as it
</I>&gt;<i> stands&quot; becomes &quot;as it stands at the point that there are no more
</I>&gt;<i> unresolved objections&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking to all readers of this email: When you read a proposal and have a
</I>&gt;<i> response, the first thing you do is select the venue in which you wish to
</I>&gt;<i> respond. You can respond by email to the list (create a new thread, for
</I>&gt;<i> just that proposal), or you can make the proposal a new topic in AllAngles
</I>&gt;<i> and respond to it there, or you can make the proposal a new topic in
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, TruthMapping, or any number of other venues, and then respond to
</I>&gt;<i> it there. If you have selected a venue other than the email list, post a
</I>&gt;<i> notification email to the list with a link to the proposal topic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any proposal to which no one responds will be taken to be &quot;good to go&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Since none of the proposals actually do anything so far as direct
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, those &quot;good to go&quot; proposals will simply be available in
</I>&gt;<i> the library (if we had a library) to serve as foundations for further
</I>&gt;<i> proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The &quot;question proposals&quot; are a special case: if no one responds to them,
</I>&gt;<i> they remain unanswered -- though they will still be &quot;good to go&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> questions.)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In setting up such a system, proposals are made concerning

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     then define the sorts of objections that will be recognized by the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     existing valid objections, whatever) can be proposed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't believe in this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Objections can be very specific to each proposal that is made, you cannot

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That approach seems to be doomed. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might not be perfect all the time but at least might be a good start that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be improved when experience gives one new insights. I think there has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be a structured process, or at least a set of tools/options that each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participant could take in order to raise objections or mark objections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raised by others as invalid. And eventually a meta process that can improve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rules surrounding that process or tools/options.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This must be a fair process (at least as fair as possible) and it must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensured, that people can evolve it on their own, based on their experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In addition, it has to be a FAST PROCESS. Speed is important, because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster it is (even if its less perfect), the more objections can be handled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A &quot;perfect process&quot; that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> included in measuring the value of the process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Any group of people that goes to the trouble of getting together
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and trying to set up such a system is trying to set up a system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that will actually work. From the perspective of such a group, any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     possible problem that you see is a problem to be solved. You are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     very good at seeing problems. Just for fun, maybe you could try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     your hand at also seeing solutions to the problems that you see,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     so I don't have to do all the work. :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The thing is, i do not see all the solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Next thing is, i am not able to wear both hats at the same time (create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions + see flaws in proposed solutions)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If someone puts forward solutions or a road to a solution, i can ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The other thing is, i could try to propose a solution (like my EMAIL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PROPOSAL) and others can ask questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But i cant do both at the same time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...and doing both at the same time is not only difficult but not much fun

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        as one participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        consent&quot;, right?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; A really stupid group might indeed set up the system that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     way, and it would indeed then be just as bad as using the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;unanimous consent&quot; decision rule.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hehe :-) If the method is only used by a couple of people, then maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are smart, maybe they are not so smart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the larger the group gets, the more likely it is, that &quot;stupid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people&quot; might join in and therefor the process of how those rules are set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up is very important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not yet sure if that formal approach is any good at all, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right now, i feel like you might just shift the problem to the creation of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DISCRIMINATING RULES, which have to be INTERPRETED too :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you better come up with a process, that is not subject to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpretation or at least gives very little leeway and those process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better cannot be abused to discriminate certain people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections from People with overweight are invalid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when it comes to nuitrition issues&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections of minority group x are invalid when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comes to issues regarding y&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thats very trivial and exteme examples, but you can craft examples which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use brilliant rethorics and very subtle ways of discrimination, which are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard to detect if you are looking at it from the wrong perspective.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I dont think it might not be possible, all i'm saying is, that that would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a hard problem, and especially, because a FAST PROCESS is important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (therefor it has not to be perfect, because you can repeat the process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often for very atomic issues, because its fast).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     formalized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        in a way so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        different from &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Exactly. According to Habermas, such &quot;intersubjective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     criteria&quot; do exist, and are routinely applied during ordinary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     discourse. The &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule is tapping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     into that existing ability to discriminate, that exists in each of us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, that sounds good., but only because Habermas asserts it exists,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesnt mean it really does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with any details of that issue, so if they do exist, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i dont know about them, then:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. can we create a list that lists all those &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (i suppose they will immediately make sense to me)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. can we formulate the general rule/process that generates that list for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a specific proposal that is made? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would be really interested to learn more about that, because if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would use that &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; thing, then better that list has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be really awesome and easy to use ;-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; You are suggesting that if the decision system is such that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and succeed. I agree with this. So, let's not set up a decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system that rewards going crazy with success.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because WE USE THE TOOL ourselve, because WE COULD NEED such a mechanism :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...if you remember that in another thread people ask for stuff of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> past and we come up with issues that it would be cool if this or that would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be on the wiki and be up to date...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So i would like to start with the &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implement it, use it right here to gain new insights and experience and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then broaden our &quot;least/lowest common denominator, implement it, use it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right here to gain new insights and experience and then broaden our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, implement it, use it right here....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...you get it :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In contrast, you want to start from a much higher level, by thinking the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whole system through upfront. I believe it might be possible, but its very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard and exactly those questions i try to come up with is what we have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think through in order to have enough details so that we can really see if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a certain approach is possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my world, every theorey can be implemented in many ways, but if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented correctly, then all those implementations are as good as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theory itself, because every implemented instance of that theory itself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be the theory and the theory one has implemented could be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation, that means, i believe its isomorphisms (the theory and all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible implementations)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I dont know all the different parts involved in your theory, but if there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is one basic element that could be implemented and used right away, while
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still retaining all the options necessary to implement the full thing, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lets start with that one basic element and implement it right away.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if we then use it, we can not only discuss things further, but gather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience around that basic elements and can more easily think of all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options that are possible to built on top and that will INCLUDE those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options that are necessary for your theory :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     For us (the Metagovernment community), I will suggest that in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     beginning the best way to approach finding solutions to this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     problem will be case-by-case. On each occasion that this problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     actually occurs, we look for specific ways to solve the specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     problem before us. As we accumulate specific solutions, we may see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     patterns that will enable us to come up with more general solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very good, but it all happens inside of our mind. If there is tens or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe even hundreds of those issues, we will discuss them, come up with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution, eventually put them on the wiki, rinse and repeat. Every time we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> talk about a new solution of an issue, we have to bear in mind all those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other solutotions we have come up with and also have to think about how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they fit together and create synergy effects....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its a hard thing and if someone new enters the metagovernment space, he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first has to study A LOT and might even come up with new issues to old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solutions that we havent thought about yet.... that could go on for AGES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ....actually it already does to some degree ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So how about teaching new people the ways of metagovernment, because they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually will use the tools and methods without really realizing it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SO instead of self study, they will be educated during the process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thats why i think &quot;email&quot; is so important, even if there is other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technology with which it would be much easier to craft prototypes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; As you have noted in a previous email, we could start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     creating our own community money right now, and start trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     handle it responsibly. We don't have to wait.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> YES :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But its not easy. Our community money could be &quot;shares&quot; that could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> earned for doing something and will slowly deprecate over time eventually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vanishing completely if one leaves the metagovernment community forever,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but will start to grow again, as soon as one comes back in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it should not be a beaurocratic process, but a fast one. The issue we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to solve is, how to evaluate how many shares which people get and for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There needs to be a system where people can log in to see their amount of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shares and what to do with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a huge undertaking and if you can spend those kind of shares or use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them to have more votes than someone who just joined and so on...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...its essentially some kind of &quot;democratic system&quot; that you design.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Spending money itself can be compared to voting on something. It just has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its own special set of rules surrounding it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I very much hope, some day we will implement something like that, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has to start somewhere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For Example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Michael Allan has put up some &quot;job vacanccies&quot; around votorola.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not a good sign when it comes to shares/money, because Michael
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Allen creates a employer/employee relationship, that means, Michael Allen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PAYS the employee so that the employee DOES what Michael Allen as &quot;the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boss&quot; will COME UP with.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A better approach, but a much more difficult one would be to: SPLIT UP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project into &quot;tasks&quot; or at least &quot;goals&quot; that could be or should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accomplished by someone else + set a reward/bounty on those (a portion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shares or something).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These shares have to be granted by Michael Allen OR ... if he opens the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue to the community and the community agrees on its importance, it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be granted by several people, not just Michael Allan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The one who takes on that &quot;task&quot; or &quot;mission&quot; could himself invite others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to help him and give them part of the bounty.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In a perfect world, this bounty will always be SHARES of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment Project as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But if you want to be able to create those &quot;tasks/goals&quot; on the fly and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if you want it a fast process to determine the bounty (in terms of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shares)&quot;, it has to be an easy and fast process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the faster and easier it gets, the more often people might use it because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the barrier in doing so is lower than anything else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If its a difficult process, most simple tasks will not use the mechanism,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but only huge tasks will and simple ones will be solved in non-standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways between people who know each other...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hint: This again is a &quot;snippet&quot; of a solution i imagine that might solve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues but might also have problems i dont see and that should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questioned by you and others, so i can think of those and come up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answers (that way we would have changed HATS) ....

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; For me, the metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is not about getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        money to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     domains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        all the people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I think that we need all-of-above: we need the meta rules,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and we need the right software systems, and we need the right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     practices, and so on. Everything is connected. Partial solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     generally wind up being no solutions at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree, we need all of the above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I disagree that &quot;partial solutions&quot; wind up being no solution at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And my reason for this is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We already HAVE a complete system that solves all the issues life throws
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at us, you, me, everyone else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That solution is the status quo with all its imperfections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A &quot;partial solution&quot; that would be no solution at all is to me:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A transition from one complete solution (status quo) to another complete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soltution (status quo COMPOSED/MERGED with feature x), where feature x is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what you call partial solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you say with &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; or that we need a complete system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means to me:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Merge the status quo with LOTS OF FEATURES at once.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Its hard to get that right and even if the theory is sound, its even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harder to make lots of people change lots of habits over night, so they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wont accept it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if its perfect, it has to be introduced one feature at a time, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people have time to learn it and change their habits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone knows that. In school you dont learn everything at once, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some thing after another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So not even is it possible to introduce a &quot;partial solution&quot; a.k.a  a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> single feature x and introduce the next feature later, it is instead very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much desirable to do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You start with basic features and bolt on more complex ones.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The same way you learn math ...not starting with universal sets algebra
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or category theory or calculus or game theory, but rather with basic stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BUT: If people have to learn basic stuff ANYWAY before they are able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use more advanced features, why not introduce the basic features first (our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;) implement it, make them use it and learn on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the way, so that we not only have our thoughts and theory, but also get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feedback from the experience of implementing it and having it used. So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chances increase we get feature x and y &quot;more right&quot; than without that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practical feedback.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And even if our tools grow to hundreds of features, its still important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to only have basic features available at entry level and to not require all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those advanced features, because people new to the system, because they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> joined the usage late, still have to learn the basics first.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...and they wont read books, they want immediate results, they want the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things to be intuitive and want to hack right away... like with writing an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> email :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------**------------------------------**
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     evolve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        interests can corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        has failed. And by this I mean, if its possible for highly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     motivated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        is involved and success manifests in one way or another), to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     corrupt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        the set of META RULES so that in essence the particular interests
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        will be that thing which governs government, thus be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        metagovernment, then we have accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Yes. Exactly. And that is what has happened in the world. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     do in fact now have various special-interest &quot;metagovernments&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that most people don't even know exist.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what we need to find is a &quot;merge process&quot; :-) that means tools and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff that helps us to &quot;increase synchronisation&quot; between our thoughts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through &quot;constant communication&quot; that is productive. There for we need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helpful tools to automate parts of the discussion that can be automated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g. instead of someone to manually copy stuff from the email list to our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wiki or instead of having someone to look up the email list archive.... and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever else, maybe the system can do it for us)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I believe, even though all the &quot;metagovernment parties&quot; co-exist with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> same goal, its ONLY because the degree of communication is not dense enough.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it were, we could use every imaginable synergy effect and concentrate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only about the edge cases where our experience and oppinions differ. we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would learn about each others way to think and pull off experiments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together to check our assumptions, and so forth...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The process doesnt have to be perfect, it must only be so good, that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;rate of benefits through synchronisation via communication&quot; exceeds the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;rate of benefit by doing something on his own&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As soon as thats the case, people will collaborate, because it gives you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> benefits faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So all we have to do is to lower the barriers and thats why SPEEED is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vitally important, no matter what kind of process or system you come up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        become some kind of organization within the existing rules and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        order to &quot;boost productivity&quot;, its also good to involve money, but

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         things cannot get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         For me, the metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is not about getting money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         domains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         out there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         (eventually evolving in organized way), that can govern any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         form of government form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         stays as: of, for and by all the people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         particular interests can corrupt the whole system, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         metagovernment as such has failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         money is involved and success manifests in one way or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         another), to corrupt the set of META RULES so that in essence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the particular interests will be that thing which governs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         government, thus be the metagovernment, then we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         become some kind of organization within the existing rules and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in order to &quot;boost productivity&quot;, its also good to involve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         money, but we really DO need rock solid foundations if we want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to minimize the risk or potential that existing laws and money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         will start to corrupt metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And by this i mean, that it must be ensured, that nobody or no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         particular group can take over and control the ressources that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         might start to build up under the &quot;metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         banner in the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Foundation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that will apply for grants and such, and will then have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         serious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             resources to distribute, in service of becoming a useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         catalyst
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             with respect to changes in global governance. (I guess you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         didn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             get the memo ...) :^)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         adequate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that context?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I'm on your side here, i do not think, that the current rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         could stand what might emerge as soon as law and money is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         involved.
