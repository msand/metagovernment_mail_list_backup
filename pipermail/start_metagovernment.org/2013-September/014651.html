<PRE>Hi Alex,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; is used in &quot;Sociocracy&quot; or
    &quot;Holacracy&quot; and i guess several other governing methods, but there
    is some thing that will continue to be subjective and thats: what is
    a &quot;valid objection&quot; and what is not?

Ned&gt; In setting up such a system, proposals are made concerning what 
sorts of objections the group will recognize as valid. The proposals 
that survive the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; gauntlet then define the 
sorts of objections that will be recognized by the group as valid.

Any time anybody sees a problem with the existing set of recognized 
valid objections, the existence of the problem can be proposed, and 
solutions (new kinds of valid objections, removal of existing valid 
objections, whatever) can be proposed.

Any group of people that goes to the trouble of getting together and 
trying to set up such a system is trying to set up a system that will 
actually work. From the perspective of such a group, any possible 
problem that you see is a problem to be solved. You are very good at 
seeing problems. Just for fun, maybe you could try your hand at also 
seeing solutions to the problems that you see, so I don't have to do all 
the work. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as long
    as one participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous
    consent&quot;, right?

Ned&gt; A really stupid group might indeed set up the system that way, and 
it would indeed then be just as bad as using the &quot;unanimous consent&quot; 
decision rule.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be formalized
    in a way so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what
    an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method
    different from &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.

Ned&gt; Exactly. According to Habermas, such &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot; do 
exist, and are routinely applied during ordinary discourse. The &quot;no 
unresolved objections&quot; decision rule is tapping into that existing 
ability to discriminate, that exists in each of us.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; ...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its
    possible to win something by doing so...

Ned&gt; You are suggesting that if the decision system is such that it 
rewards going crazy with success, then people will go crazy, and 
succeed. I agree with this. So, let's not set up a decision system that 
rewards going crazy with success.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; And that again will just end in endless debates and talking,
    because as long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can
    be done.

Ned&gt; You have again spotted a valid problem, and again lazily handed it 
over to me to solve. (In certain voting systems, this problem is called 
a &quot;filibuster&quot;.)

For us (the Metagovernment community), I will suggest that in the 
beginning the best way to approach finding solutions to this problem 
will be case-by-case. On each occasion that this problem actually 
occurs, we look for specific ways to solve the specific problem before 
us. As we accumulate specific solutions, we may see patterns that will 
enable us to come up with more general solutions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
    rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that
    it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that things cannot
    get out of control as soon as money is involved.

Ned&gt; As you have noted in a previous email, we could start creating our 
own community money right now, and start trying to handle it 
responsibly. We don't have to wait.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; For me, the metagovernment.org project is not about getting
    money to support some projects and build some software tools to
    support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain domains
    (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out
    there that essentially do the same thing)

    As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
    evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government
    form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by
    all the people.

Ned&gt; I think that we need all-of-above: we need the meta rules, and we 
need the right software systems, and we need the right practices, and so 
on. Everything is connected. Partial solutions generally wind up being 
no solutions at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve
    over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular
    interests can corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such
    has failed. And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated
    particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money
    is involved and success manifests in one way or another), to corrupt
    the set of META RULES so that in essence the particular interests
    will be that thing which governs government, thus be the
    metagovernment, then we have accomplished nothing.

Ned&gt; Yes. Exactly. And that is what has happened in the world. We do in 
fact now have various special-interest &quot;metagovernments&quot;, that most 
people don't even know exist.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and
    become some kind of organization within the existing rules and in
    order to &quot;boost productivity&quot;, its also good to involve money, but
    we really DO need rock solid foundations if we want to minimize the
    risk or potential that existing laws and money will start to corrupt
    metagovernment.org. And by this i mean, that it must be ensured,
    that nobody or no particular group can take over and control the
    ressources that might start to build up under the
    &quot;metagovernment.org&quot; banner in the future.

Ned&gt; Yes. +1

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; I'm on your side here, i do not think, that the current rules
    could stand what might emerge as soon as law and money is involved.

Ned&gt; And I am on your side. And I agree that, as a community, we have a 
lot of work to do to become ready for responsibility.
