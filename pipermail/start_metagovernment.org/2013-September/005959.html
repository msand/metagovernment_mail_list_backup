<PRE>People,

I got by some client issues I was having and got traction on mediathread.
My early goal is to update some of the spreadsheets around this group.

Let me give the name of the SaaS host vendor: appsembler.

We have here a multimedia essay concept built around audio and video
inputs.  There are criticism tools, discussion tools, collaboration tools,
privacy tools and ontology tools.

This is courseware and to get to the instructor panel I have to create a
course.  None of this costs anything for a two user set up. For what I am
doing, I have no immediate participation requirements from the readers
here, but more eyes and so forth.

Thus I will open up  here three items to volunteer upon.

I.  Volunteers to help write an interesting course description instead of
my default stub.  This would be worked on in Start.  If so, I would
describe the widgets fields for people to discuss.

2. Volunteers who intend to get their own mediathread instance to look
around in.  If so, I would help them do that.

3. Volunteers who would want to be the other user in my instance.  If so,
and just one volunteer,  this should be straight forward.

This software has many virtues but is outside of any of the use cases you
talk about on Start

Blessings,

Max
