<PRE>Alexander,

Let me see if I understand your post by rephrasing and adding to
it. Hopefully it's not too long. Constructive feedback is appreciated.
Previous post:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005937.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-September/005937.html</A>

Concerns:

   - Topics often repeat with regular users without benefit
   - This is compounded when new people come to the list and are not aware
   of the past discussions
   - There is no way to measure consensus on a particular topic or proposal

Current Solutions
-Manually add items to a wiki(s) and point people there

   - Does not happen often because it takes so much energy
   - What is there is rarely read
   - It is spread over several several locations
   - What is there quickly goes stale
   - There is no feature there to gauge the level of agreement

Future Requirements (in order of priority)

   1. Easily capture a section of an email to a static page
   2. Be able to see the context of the original capture
   3. Be able to display this text on their personal page
   4. Be able to edit and summarize the statements while keeping a link to
   the history
   5. Be able to tag the capture by topic or subject
   6. Be able to link to the group of tagged items
   7. (difficult) Have the system automatically suggest relevant items that
   have been captured in the past.

Proposed Implementation

   - As an email flows through the system it adds a link at the bottom of
   each paragraph. If you click on the link you capture that paragraph.
   - If multiple people click the link then it will be recorded that
   several people want to record that part and it is ranked in importance
   - Once on the page you can narrow down the selection to sentences or
   words or expand to add more paragraphs from the source email
   - On the page you could also summarize or re-word.
   - You can tag the capture for grouping with other captures
   - You can designate that this capture supersedes previous capture(s)
   - All the captures are displayed on web pages by tag and popularity and
   can be linked to in email. (unless superseded)
   - On each capture on the we page there is also a link to the original
   source email for context.
   - The fact you captured, tagged, refined is sent out to the email list
   and others can +1 it from a link there adding rank.
   - (difficult) Have the system add links to potential matching tags or
   captures to the tops of emails or paragraphs.
