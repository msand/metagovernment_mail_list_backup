<PRE>Hi,

A long-time lurker, I am moved now to make a proposal to this group, the
active members of which I thank for their commitment and perseverance in
addressing the important issue of governance, even if at times the
discussion here gets mired in intricate abstractions. I'll be brief.

My (radical) proposal starts with some assumptions, so if these are wrong,
then it'll probably go nowhere, but I hope you can agree that the subject
is an important one, even if this turns out not be the right venue for it.
So here goes&#8230;

Why are we here on this list? I assume [1] it's because we want to examine
governance itself in a radical way (i.e. starting at the roots) and to
develop new forms.

But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
governance? I assume [2] that we want to save the Earth and promote human
well-being, both threatened by the current capitalist world-system, and
believe this is impossible to achieve without new kinds of governance to
replace the corrupted forms which support the present ecocidal and
exploitative system.

But beyond even that, what could such new forms of governance achieve if
successful? Would full and direct participatory decision-making (for
example) be sufficient by itself to ensure ecological sustainability and
avert collapse? I assume [3] it would not, and that there also needs to be
a new and rigorous guiding framework for the use and allocation of
resources to meet human needs sustainably, i.e. a new economic logic to
replace capitalism.

Lastly, I assume [4] that a rational appraisal of our present predicament
reveals the certainty, accelerating approach and probable imminence of
global collapse, and hence the urgency of the task at hand and the awesome
responsibility which falls upon the shoulders of the able and willing of
the present generation.

If you follow my assumptions, then I urge you to take the time to read
these two vital books by Frank Rotering, outlining the economic and
political approach needed to achieve these purposes, which forms the basis
of my proposal to this group. Both books are free to download in pdf at the
website needandlimits.org:

Contractionary Revolution&lt;<A HREF="http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/Contractionary_Revolution_1st_Edition.pdf">http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/Contractionary_Revolution_1st_Edition.pdf</A>&gt;

The Economics of Needs and
Limits&lt;<A HREF="http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/The_Economics_of_Needs_and_Limits_1st_Edition.pdf">http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/The_Economics_of_Needs_and_Limits_1st_Edition.pdf</A>&gt;

PROPOSAL:

   - That this group recognizes that the main purpose of governance is to
   ensure sustainable well-being for all, such purpose providing a
   non-negotiable framework for economic guidance which must necessarily
   inform and constrain any particular form of governance adopted to implement
   it.
   - That this group broadly adopts the analysis and strategy outlined in
   the books mentioned, as the most effective approach yet conceived of to
   understand and deal with the present global predicament and to guide future
   economic relations toward sustainable well-being.
   - That this group's purpose therefore be directed to the revolutionary
   project outlined therein, and specifically to creating forms of governance
   suitable to this approach, before, during and after the necessary period of
   transition to a post-capitalist system.

I realize that this all stated very baldly and may be regarded as an
impertinent intrusion into your ongoing discussions&#8212;not to mention the
improbability of any of you actually reading the books mentioned to inform
your responses&#8212;but I feel the uniqueness and urgency of the present
predicament makes unusual demands of us all, and I respect the seriousness
with the folks here approach the olympian task you have assumed, or I
wouldn't ask.

What do you think? I welcome amendments, counter-proposals, personal
messages, whatever.

Regards,

Pete
