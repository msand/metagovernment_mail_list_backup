Again, true in a lab, but not so much true in reality.
If people craft proposals, there might be a sheer endless amount of
&quot;implicit assumptions&quot; and stuff, so that u really cannot understand what
drives the people to come up with a specific proposal at all, maybe in the
end its only because it was proposed by team green instead of team yellow
:<i>-)
</I>Maybe they use false flag reasons, and so on....

On the other hand, with just voting, its often easy to do representative
surveys, which will tell you peoples reasons and if you are clever, you
might be able to derive the reasoning fomr the overall economic or personal
situations of many people and their answer to just a simple question.
Its easy to reason about a &quot;one liner question&quot; if the question is very
specific, but its very hard to reason about a complex proposal.

No matter if you use &quot;HUGE PROPOSALS&quot; or &quot;SMALL VOTING&quot; :-), there will be
discussions anyway, where all the &quot;arguments&quot; pro/contra will come up.
...so you probably will know, or if you do not, then just create a &quot;SMALL
VOTING&quot; Question and put forward your hypothesis regarding reasons and see
how people will respond to it.
Its just fast feedback on simple information chunks every time :-)


I have tried a lot in the past. I am very very happy, that on this
metagovernment.org list, people are usually capable of &quot;systematic
examination&quot;, but i believe thats not so much because people are so
genuinly rational, but because people can &quot;step beyond their own shadow&quot;,
can admit if they were wrong, are very polite in general and even if they
&quot;fight sometimes&quot;, they return to respectfully treating each other every
time :-)
I am too guilty at sometimes putting in a bit too many emotions, but if
people tell me about it or i realize it myself, not only do i &quot;not have a
problem with saying sorry&quot;, but i feel the urge to do so and correct my
behavior.
I guess thats much more important than &quot;rationality&quot;, because often its not
about &quot;logic problems&quot;, but about &quot;assumptions&quot; which distort reality






&gt;<i> If (as you say) we need a meta process, and if (as you say) the meta
</I>&gt;<i> process will need for the reasoning behind decisions to be publicly
</I>&gt;<i> exposed, then decision making through proposing will work (from the
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of these requirements), and decision making through voting will
</I>&gt;<i> not work. Yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Actually, you pointed me towards a &quot;contradiction&quot; in my thinking.
I do believe, that for all parts of all rules or things that are made valid
through (voting/consensus/whatever), there should be REASONS published in a
way, so that you know where to start arguing about it.
This &quot;idea&quot; is not existant within the &quot;Atomic Voting Example&quot; i tried to
describe with the renewable energy thing.


But anyway, the &quot;atomic voting&quot; with &quot;voter profiles&quot; which make all
personal results public, is not a &quot;holistic solution&quot;, but only part of a
potential solution.
So is the element of &quot;publish reasons for all decisions&quot; (so you have
something to measure a new proposal for whether it can better fullfill the
reasoning or not)


I have a feeling, that both &quot;techniques&quot; ahve their use cases and
eventually are just two pieces of the puzzle that we try to put together :-)
