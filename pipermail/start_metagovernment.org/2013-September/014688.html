&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A long-time lurker, I am moved now to make a proposal to this group, the
</I>&gt;<i> active members of which I thank for their commitment and perseverance in
</I>&gt;<i> addressing the important issue of governance, even if at times the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion here gets mired in intricate abstractions. I'll be brief.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My (radical) proposal starts with some assumptions, so if these are wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> then it'll probably go nowhere, but I hope you can agree that the subject
</I>&gt;<i> is an important one, even if this turns out not be the right venue for it.
</I>&gt;<i> So here goes&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are we here on this list? I assume [1] it's because we want to examine
</I>&gt;<i> governance itself in a radical way (i.e. starting at the roots) and to
</I>&gt;<i> develop new forms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>&gt;<i> governance? I assume [2] that we want to save the Earth and promote human
</I>&gt;<i> well-being, both threatened by the current capitalist world-system, and
</I>&gt;<i> believe this is impossible to achieve without new kinds of governance to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the corrupted forms which support the present ecocidal and
</I>&gt;<i> exploitative system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond even that, what could such new forms of governance achieve if
</I>&gt;<i> successful? Would full and direct participatory decision-making (for
</I>&gt;<i> example) be sufficient by itself to ensure ecological sustainability and
</I>&gt;<i> avert collapse? I assume [3] it would not, and that there also needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> a new and rigorous guiding framework for the use and allocation of
</I>&gt;<i> resources to meet human needs sustainably, i.e. a new economic logic to
</I>&gt;<i> replace capitalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, I assume [4] that a rational appraisal of our present predicament
</I>&gt;<i> reveals the certainty, accelerating approach and probable imminence of
</I>&gt;<i> global collapse, and hence the urgency of the task at hand and the awesome
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility which falls upon the shoulders of the able and willing of
</I>&gt;<i> the present generation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you follow my assumptions, then I urge you to take the time to read
</I>&gt;<i> these two vital books by Frank Rotering, outlining the economic and
</I>&gt;<i> political approach needed to achieve these purposes, which forms the basis
</I>&gt;<i> of my proposal to this group. Both books are free to download in pdf at the
</I>&gt;<i> website needandlimits.org:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Contractionary Revolution&lt;<A HREF="http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/Contractionary_Revolution_1st_Edition.pdf">http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/Contractionary_Revolution_1st_Edition.pdf</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Economics of Needs and Limits&lt;<A HREF="http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/The_Economics_of_Needs_and_Limits_1st_Edition.pdf">http://needsandlimits.org/PDFs/The_Economics_of_Needs_and_Limits_1st_Edition.pdf</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSAL:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - That this group recognizes that the main purpose of governance is to
</I>&gt;<i>    ensure sustainable well-being for all, such purpose providing a
</I>&gt;<i>    non-negotiable framework for economic guidance which must necessarily
</I>&gt;<i>    inform and constrain any particular form of governance adopted to implement
</I>&gt;<i>    it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds illogic to my ears. Somehow contradictionary :-) As if there
</I>was some &quot;universal truth&quot; that would be known by someone who will come up
with this &quot;perfect framework&quot;.
I prefer specific proposals and not vague general concepts without any
substance that one could respond to.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - That this group broadly adopts the analysis and strategy outlined in
</I>&gt;<i>    the books mentioned, as the most effective approach yet conceived of to
</I>&gt;<i>    understand and deal with the present global predicament and to guide future
</I>&gt;<i>    economic relations toward sustainable well-being.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tell me about those ideas, one by one and i will reply.
</I>I wont read two entire books only to tell you with what i do agree and with
what not.
Lazy you :-) If you like those ideas and have already done the work to read
them, then you should become the proponent and tell us about those ideas
and why u like them.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - That this group's purpose therefore be directed to the revolutionary
</I>&gt;<i>    project outlined therein, and specifically to creating forms of governance
</I>&gt;<i>    suitable to this approach, before, during and after the necessary period of
</I>&gt;<i>    transition to a post-capitalist system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All those who have thought about that stuff a lot, should step down from
</I>their throne and tell people about their concepts and make them understand.
People wont buy-in into someone who believes he knows the way, because
there have been many people trying to trick people into something and even
more people who truly believed they knew it all, but it was only self
delusion :-) If its good stuff, then the ideas and arguments can stand for
themselves and because we all have limited time and attention spans, its a
bit cheap to ask people to read entire books just to eventually find out
that it wasnt worth the time.
So if u believe in what is written in those books, than take the time and
tell people about it in a way, that they understand and become curious and
eventually they will read the book if they agree with all that you tell
them, which is based on those books.



I realize that this all stated very baldly and may be regarded as an
&gt;<i> impertinent intrusion into your ongoing discussions&#8212;not to mention the
</I>&gt;<i> improbability of any of you actually reading the books mentioned to inform
</I>&gt;<i> your responses
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes :-) thats why i tried to tell you what would be a better approach.



&gt;<i> &#8212;but I feel the uniqueness and urgency of the present predicament makes
</I>&gt;<i> unusual demands of us all, and I respect the seriousness with the folks
</I>&gt;<i> here approach the olympian task you have assumed, or I wouldn't ask.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? I welcome amendments, counter-proposals, personal
</I>&gt;<i> messages, whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

All u have said is: &quot;These books are awesome. I've read them and was
overwhelmed. Please people, you have to read this, because they are
awesome&quot; :-)

The thing is, the hard thing about all of this is to put it as short as
possible, because only then will people be able to follow through.
Everyone is able to do unstructured or semi-structured brain-dumps, like i
do right now and its common in every day discussions.

Some people, e.g. actors... practice weeks or months, just to perform on
stage for 1 minute.
Some scientists spend their entire life to produce just a couple or even
only one formula that fits within one line.

The hard thing is, to break stuff down into very conscise but
understandable ways, so that its possible for others to follow through,
without being overwhelmed by a lot of information.
Actually all the information we need to change the world are already
available, but the problem is &quot;INFORMATION OVERFLOW&quot; :-)


Why on earth would we need &quot;discussion tools&quot; which try to somehow give an
overview about what people want and what they are talking about if people
had no &quot;Information Processing Bottleneck&quot;? :-)
