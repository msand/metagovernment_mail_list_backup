<PRE>[&gt;agreement from:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">marc at merkstduwas.de</A> ]
   [&gt;quote of:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">alexander.praetorius at serapath.de</A> ]
      [&gt;1] I think what we need is:
         A. Discussion Flow where everyone could participate (=&gt; 
email/forum)
         B. Citable Sources where all the stuff goes that more than 1 person 
has agreed upon, to make it referencable in future emails. (=&gt; 
wiki/etherpad)
         C. a mechanism that enables putting stuff from A into B (and make 
transparent how many and which persons support a statement
         D. a mechanism to reference B stuff in discussions.
         E. a fork and a merge mechanism (forking and merging of stuff thats 
in B)

     [&gt;1] I believe this kind of sturcutring breaks how people are used to 
write. [1&lt;]
  [quote&lt;]
  [&gt;1] That's true, but it is JUST prototyping! Do you remember the times 
where no WYSIWYG HTML editors were available? We were forced to write HTML! 
[1&lt;]
  [&gt;2] We need to overcome typing those brackets, of course! BUT first we 
need to learn how discussion tagging could look like. [2&lt;]
  [&gt;3] In terms of e-democracy and discussion tools, we are like babies 
learning to speak. Until now, our outcome is just 'bababa' and 'lululu' - 
that's it! [3&lt;]
[opinion&lt;]


I still do write html by hand :-)
although i dont use html but jade templating language instead.

You approach this from the wrong direction.
Its useless to differntiate between &quot;oppinions&quot;, &quot;questions&quot;, &quot;proposals&quot;, 
....

ex.
1. The use of range-voting would be awesome
2. Wouldnt it be better to use range voting?
3. I suggest we use range voting
4. The use of rangevoting is better because auf x
5. ....


People can discuss endlessly and what kind of style or rethorics they use is 
up to them.
They will use questions, justifications, whatever, just to have their way.
Sure, why not support features for all those different styles, but this is 
details....

I think what we need is:
A. Discussion Flow where everyone could participate (=&gt; email/forum)
B. Citable Sources where all the stuff goes that more than 1 person has 
agreed upon, to make it referencable in future emails. (=&gt; wiki/etherpad)
C. a mechanism that enables putting stuff from A into B (and make 
transparent how many and which persons support a statement
D. a mechanism to reference B stuff in discussions.
E. a fork and a merge mechanism (forking and merging of stuff thats in B)

Let the rest be free style text.
Those A to E things are so much more important than details like 
(question/justification/oppinion/...), because this is more a matter of 
personal style.
You can communicate the same content by chaining justification after 
justification or by asking a series of related questions or by stating 
oppionions.
And it depends on the person involved in a discussion wether they like to 
follow a certain style or not.
Then again, people will start to argue if something is a question or a 
justification that looks like a question.
Then again some will say this or that is oppinion, while something else is 
not.
Why do you want to open new ground for endless discussions?








[proposal&lt;]
  [&gt;1] Let's find out what is necessary to formalize discussion. [1&lt;]
  [&gt;2] Let's find ways to make this usable and accessible by email. [2&lt;]
[proposal&lt;]

I believe this kind of sturcutring breaks how people are used to write.
Someone makes a suggestion, the second persons coments and justificates its 
comments and eventually mashes it with a counter proposal. The next person 
puts in some facts combined with questions and a meta suggestion, and so 
forth....

I think you need &quot;buttons&quot; or &quot;autocomplete&quot; or other kind of interaction 
methods to get where you want to go without breaking peoples flow.

I see the value in the proposed structure, but if you do not &quot;design&quot; the 
system in a way that gently picks people up, they wont use it, because it 
needs to much discipline
