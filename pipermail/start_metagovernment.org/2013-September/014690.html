<PRE>Alex,

To keep my promise, I first need to understand how your questions
below relate to the goal of self governance.  How could my answers
bring our community closer to that goal, so we can pass the test?

I promised to stay focused on that.


We're also on freenode #metagov.  Please join us (anyone) if you have
questions about technical details.  Or if you just want to chat.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So why not make us all moderators of our own &quot;community&quot;?  We could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; share the work. the first of us to click on the +1 button does the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; job for the rest of us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's how our mirror works by default, except vetting is by rough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus.  We can change the defaults by governing ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; To put it in different words.  The &quot;front mirror&quot; is some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;public relations&quot; or &quot;community identity&quot; page.  It's a marketing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing of the community to advertise to other people.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; already part of the community in discussing something, then you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; already know whats going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not quite true.  Even a member of a topical community doesn't know the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community's name, or boundaries, or totality of its discussions around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the world *except* through a public mirror.  But the mirror must be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well governed by the community as a whole.  No such mirrors exist yet,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore nobody has this information, not even community members.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it possible, that some &quot;messages&quot; of a discussion end up in different
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;topical public mirrors&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those &quot;gate keepers&quot; that sit between the actual discussion and are able to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ack&quot; or &quot;nak&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> can decide which image is created in a &quot;public mirror&quot;, which again will be
</I>&gt;<i> reflected in further discussions
</I>&gt;<i> and therefor influence how discussions might evolve.
</I>&gt;<i> So the mechanism is a very important one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I therefor do not like the idea that some people i might not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; aware of, define how &quot;my community&quot; is represented to the outside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Neither do I.  That won't work at all.  The mirror must be governed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the community as a whole or it's no good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, i do not yet comprehend, how &quot;public mirrors&quot; pop into
</I>&gt;<i> existance,
</I>&gt;<i> how many &quot;public mirrors&quot; can exist for one community,
</I>&gt;<i> whether a message in a discussion can be part of multiple &quot;public mirrors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> whether it can even be part of different &quot;topical public mirrors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and what all the other mechanisms might be...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...as soon as i grasp all the mechanisms involved, then i can try to do
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;monte carlo simulation&quot; in my head, with all the rules involved, to find
</I>&gt;<i> out
</I>&gt;<i> how such a &quot;system&quot; might behave :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; PS, C and I just agreed to change the vet commands from 'ok and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; 'no, to 'ack and 'nak.  It sounds more command like.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what happens if &quot;ack&quot; and C &quot;nak&quot;'s?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess that's not consensus, so relayer would say 'close.  Link is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not imaged in mirror.  Anyway, this is the default mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> i dont know whether thats a good thing or a bad thing,
</I>&gt;<i> have no oppinion on it yet.
