<PRE>Max and Ned,

Thanks for replying.  Both of you point to an omission that I want to
correct before answering further.

Max said:
&gt;<i> ...  History of philosophy suggests item 2 [we're ideologically and
</I>&gt;<i> technically non-partisan] is a sort of technocrat social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> item.  Item 1 [Metagov is where it's starting] illustrates that in
</I>&gt;<i> that it is a neuro linguistic programming statement (NLP). ...  So I
</I>&gt;<i> am rather in that tradition but I am not interested in doing this in
</I>&gt;<i> that way.
</I>
Neither am I; sorry to give the wrong impression.  My lever image (SL)
is partly to blame.  It implies force, but I intended none.  The role
of technicians is the usual one of developing and building facilities,
not ruling a technocracy.  Item (II) is intended rather as a counter
measure to technocracy, nipping in the bud any technical solution that
would dominate the field, and thence society.  How it might do that
must wait till I can answer in regard to (III).  (more below)


Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> ... after studying your proposal I have the uneasy feeling that,
</I>&gt;<i> through the very abstract and obscurely-defined term &quot;reflector&quot;, a
</I>&gt;<i> particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being snuck in through
</I>&gt;<i> the side door, with which stance I may or may not agree. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching consensus
</I>&gt;<i> without [or, as Mike puts it, before] making decisions?
</I>
Originally I thought of setting Metagov's sights exclusively on a
reflective start (III), but I agree that would be inconsistent with
the principle of openness (II).  Let me correct myself by saying that
a reflective start is just one start technique; I think Metagov should
be open to all start techniques and do its best to support each.  This
what I now suggest for principle (II).

&gt;<i> I do not quite understand what you mean when you say [II] that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;we're ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean
</I>&gt;<i> that we never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to any ideological or technical matter? ...
</I>
No, that wouldn't be possible.  We still must make decisions and
sometimes they will bear on technical matters.  When they do, however,
I suggest we bracket them in a way that doesn't violate the principle
of openness (II, as revised).  So:

&gt;<i> ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there be no
</I>&gt;<i> distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree with
</I>&gt;<i> that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>
No, it shouldn't.  If you believe that a particular start effort needs
to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you could enforce it
within the context of that start effort.  But you shouldn't enforce it
universally within Metagov if doing so would violate (II).

Otherwise message (I) rings hollow.  Only through openness to all
start possibilities can Metagov convincingly back the claim of being
the place where it starts.

Metagov already honours (I) and (II), at least in practice.  There's
no other place we can go to speak together on such an over-arching
topic and retain any hope of putting our words into action.  Metagov
already has an advantage here and I think we need to press it.

&gt;<i> &quot;High ground&quot; and &quot;command&quot; suggest dominance structures.  This can

</I>&gt;<i> slant on consensus reaching.
</I>
I hope you have a better impression after reading my correction above.
Despite my forceful metaphors, I don't propose to push anyone around,
or to raise technicians to anything but a technical elite.

I'll stop here and give you and Ned a chance to reply.  I haven't yet
answered concerning the specifics of reflective start (III), but only
items (I) and (II), which I think are the general conditions to obtain
sufficient resources for any kind of start.

&gt;<i> Mike,

</I>&gt;<i> I apologize for not yet responding to earlier MG postings from you and

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can put on a critical hat and criticize items 1 and 3 easily.  History of
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy suggests item 2 is a sort of technocrat social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> item.  Item 1 illustrates that in that it is a neuro linguistic programming
</I>&gt;<i> statement (NLP).  In this case there is no predicate.  So I am rather in

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of an external chosing of reflectors seems to be again an exercise
</I>&gt;<i> in control.  Actually I am wrong.  But it is elitest.  That gets tricky.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to play with reflectors you should find them yourself and then
</I>&gt;<i> break them.  What mirror am I looking in such that I see myself as the
</I>&gt;<i> proper predicate of my own shoulds?

</I>&gt;<i> Fulcrum-probably the key item to emphasize- the other pieces are everywhere
</I>&gt;<i> but where should the fulcrum be placed and what is the fulcrum made of?
</I>&gt;<i> The world does not need saving so mayhaps it does not need moving but we
</I>&gt;<i> could set a directionality for ourselves that smart people might look back
</I>&gt;<i> on and marvel at what wonder came from this effort.  But there is a wisdom
</I>&gt;<i> that the greatest are also generally unknown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  There is also a wisdom that I just made up that the greatest control

Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First, I very much applaud and appreciate the audacity of your proposal. 
</I>&gt;<i> It does a great job of presenting a mission/vision that the 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment community might adopt.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that
</I>&gt;<i>     acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on the right side.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES!!!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As the &quot;it starts here&quot; beginning, the decision-making solution that we 
</I>&gt;<i> prototype and then use ourselves and then propose to the world must take 
</I>&gt;<i> into account what the actual situation in the world is, and must take 
</I>&gt;<i> into account what history has to teach us about what has worked and what 
</I>&gt;<i> has not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of our &quot;reflective start&quot; within the Metagovernment community, I 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest that it might be helpful for us to seek consensus regarding 
</I>&gt;<i> these matters. Without that community consensus regarding the world 
</I>&gt;<i> situation and the relevant teachings of history to build upon, we will 
</I>&gt;<i> probably not be able to agree upon a design that will enable us to 
</I>&gt;<i> function as catalyst with respect to the larger society.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To initiate that foundational consensus-seeking discussion, and to 
</I>&gt;<i> provide concrete &quot;use-case context&quot; for your abstract depiction of our 
</I>&gt;<i> mission/vision, here are some (to me) well-presented bits of history, 
</I>&gt;<i> including presentation of some (to me) profoundly bad social system 
</I>&gt;<i> designs that are actual parts of that history:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The History of Banking:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#">http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (The good stuff is in slides 1-79. Our mission, should we choose, would 
</I>&gt;<i> be to prototype a decision system design that is capable of rendering 
</I>&gt;<i> the described existing decision system designs obsolete ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not quite understand what you mean when you say that &quot;we're 
</I>&gt;<i> ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean that we 
</I>&gt;<i> never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions with respect 
</I>&gt;<i> to any ideological or technical matter? (Example: Ed proposes that, in 
</I>&gt;<i> our decision systems, there be no distinctions between governors and 
</I>&gt;<i> governed. I heartily agree with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me 
</I>&gt;<i> partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I read the 
</I>&gt;<i> words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print written in legalese.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo a &quot;reflector&quot;? 
</I>&gt;<i> Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a native speaker of 
</I>&gt;<i> english, I would say no, and no.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reaching consensus is hard work, which is actively and creatively 
</I>&gt;<i> performed by the participants. I see Vilfredo as enabling and 
</I>&gt;<i> facilitating that work, not reflecting it. And I see Vilfredo as in need 
</I>&gt;<i> of improvement and enhancement and such, not governance. Legalese takes 
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary words and redefines them, thereby confusing and misleading 
</I>&gt;<i> general readers who don't know the special definitions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of society. Vilfredo 
</I>&gt;<i> currently redlines at 35 participants. When you say &quot;reflectors work at 
</I>&gt;<i> all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the definition of &quot;reflector&quot;? 
</I>&gt;<i> (That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector works at all scales of society ...&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I confess that I do not understand what a &quot;reflective need&quot; is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So far as needs, my view is that we (the Metagovernment community, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the e-democracy field, and the global population) &quot;need&quot; to reliably 
</I>&gt;<i> make decisions regarding public matters that are valid by the Discourse 
</I>&gt;<i> Principle, and that produce implementation outcomes that make things 
</I>&gt;<i> better. (Example: Bombing the hell out of Syria will probably not make 
</I>&gt;<i> things better, and is definitely not valid by the Discourse Principle. 
</I>&gt;<i> We -- the Metagovernment community -- &quot;need&quot; to agree upon a decision 
</I>&gt;<i> system design that can scale to the global level that will reliably not 
</I>&gt;<i> make decisions such as that.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     [Reflectors] present aggregate views of a social reality in which
</I>&gt;<i>     people see themselves embedded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To return to the &quot;legalese&quot; theme, after studying your proposal I have 
</I>&gt;<i> the uneasy feeling that, through the very abstract and obscurely-defined 
</I>&gt;<i> term &quot;reflector&quot;, a particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being 
</I>&gt;<i> snuck in through the side door, with which stance I may or may not 
</I>&gt;<i> agree. Are you still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus without making decisions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that we make it our business to design and develop the 
</I>&gt;<i> best decision making system that we can put our heads together and imagine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
