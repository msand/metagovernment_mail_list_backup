&gt;<i> I read the reddit link, i read the public mirror link.
</I>&gt;<i> Not yet convinced about the intermediate roles who define what goes into the &quot;mirror front&quot; and what might not end up there.
</I>&gt;<i> Those &quot;intermediate roles&quot; will create a distorted mirror fronts and eventually they even will do this on purpose if they are motivated extrinsically or intrinsically.
</I>&gt;<i> ..but so be it, for the moment (right now, there is no &quot;tributary intake&quot;, only the &quot;trunk intake&quot; which publishes to that &quot;reddit thread&quot; thing)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe its possible to somehow automate those &quot;intermediate roles later on&quot;, using some kind of agreed upon rules, or maybe make it easy to replace those &quot;persons in charge&quot; or maybe have some kind of voting mechanism or veto mechanism to opt-out stuff. ...i think there will be ways to improve this somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting thought: &quot;We had in direction D, where D is undefined&quot; + &quot;We make all Discussions of topic T visible, where T is undefined&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm not yet sure what to make of it, but i can live with it, because it sounds useful :P)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But still, i dont know what's next or what to do now.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of us in this thread are participants in the governance test.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just to speak is enough.  We're an open, topical community defined by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the boundaries of the topic we're discussing.  It's like we're in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> country where the borders, rather than being drawn in a geographic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space, are instead drawn in topical space.  But the topic hasn't been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined yet.  So we're in a country with no definite borders and no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> name.  This is why we have an opportunity for self-governance.  If we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do it right, then we can govern the whole community (whatever we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> define it to be) as such.  Here's a device that'll tell us if we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing it right: <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a public mirror.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A public mirror shows the total image of a topical community without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respecting any borders aside from those of the chosen topic.  Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular mirror assumes that we're discussing that topic right now,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is why it shows this thread.  Otherwise it knows nothing about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us.  It'll just sit there waiting for further instructions.  It'll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> listen to all the participants in the community (initially this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread) and accept our governance.  The success of that governance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempt will then be reflected in the image that the mirror shows us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A public mirror is fairly easy to operate on a small scale, even a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clumsy prototype like this one (with just C and I cranking the gears
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at the moment); but still, it cannot reflect a true image of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, one that we'll accept and identify with, unless it's well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governed by the community as a whole.  It's technically infeasible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> within an open society.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the mirror is like a canary in a coal mine.  But it's also useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for other things aside from breaking when it's abused.  It's the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing that shows an open, topical community as a whole.  Nothing else
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides that service.  It's ours to provide, or it's nobody's.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Is this the bylaws project?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, it's separate to begin with.  But we can redefine the scope at any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, so it could change.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthony Dunn said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ... I would like to think there could be a better suited platform
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for people to work through their differences, rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; determining all hope is nought because a failed attempt to do so,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with, what I believe is essentially, inadequate technology for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; task.  Really though, tell me how many linear processes really work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; out that great in the end?  Successful deliberation amongst many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; people is just too multi-directional to handle the harder stuff.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It needn't stay linear.  My promise that we'll learn the result &quot;right
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here in this thread&quot; might be broken if we're successful, because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-governance cannot be bound by limits.  But even a failure could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be helpful, if only to show that you're right after all; we're not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ready yet.  And to show why.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We live in a civilization that's headed in direction D, where D is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> undefined.  This is an unsolved problem.  Meantime we're running a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> facility that shows us the total of all open discussions in the world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the topic of T, where T is undefined.  It's possible that an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attempt to solve the T problem will help us with the D problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although I don't know of a particular solution, I do know that Metagov
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the best place for raising this kind of issue; so I'm throwing it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the ring as a challenge for all of us.
