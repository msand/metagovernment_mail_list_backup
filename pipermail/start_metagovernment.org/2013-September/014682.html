<PRE>It's really hard to make sense of what you say :-)

whats the &quot;true image&quot; of a community?
either you show everything thats said (auto &quot;ack&quot;) =&gt; information overflow

in order to create an image with a smaller resolution that still does not
distort the original discussion, that takes place across different media,
one would have to come up with a very good technique.
i do not believe such a thing does exist yet. i believe people have to
start discussing things and have some basic tools to support their
discussion, then people might adapt those tools and that will lead to a
more structured discussion allowing more precise tools, which might lead to
even more precise discussions, rinse and repeat...
Some stuff might occur often (e.g. finding date's/time's, express
ressources in quantities, link to buildings, places, persons, ...and so
on... facebook and others have already started this kind of thing)
So after discussion takes place for some time and gets more structured, its
easy to borrow stuff that was invented by &quot;SEMANTIC WEB&quot; People and put it
into action.

If the degree of structure is high enough, then eventually its possible to
create different kinds of abstractions, that will create a &quot;picture of the
whole&quot; based on different criteria, ...which doesnt include all the
information, but gives an image with a lower resolution without distortion
or at least with a kind of distortion that people can understand.

For example: a balance sheet is a picture with a lesser resolution than
reality which includes 2 kinds of distortions.
1. (easy to understand) it shows reality only through the lense of
claim-liability contracts and other kinds of inventory
2. (hard to understand) it includes the assessment of assets which can very
much distort reality without people understanding to what degree the
distortion is effective.


BUT: You say its a technical detail, but its not as soon as the picture of
the whole depends on that mechanism.
Instead it becomes vitaly important. Who controls the picture of the whole,
controls the discussion to some extend.
Maybe at some places, the gatekeepers will not let certain things pass
&quot;nak&quot;, while in other places of the same &quot;community&quot; it will pass &quot;ack&quot;.

If one does not design a mechanism about how things should work out, then
things will work out in some ways, but you will not know in which ways
beforehand :-)
The same with power structures. Either you design the mechanisms on how
they form, or you dont and they will form in one way or another, often not
to the benefit of the whole.

</I>&gt;<i> Alexander Praetorius said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Or throw away vetting and replace it with something else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes! :-) in an &quot;ideal world&quot; i would think off people discussing and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using provided tools and mechanics to self structure the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and enableing an algorithm or some kind of &quot;simple AI&quot; to decorate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the mirror front for them.  The only thing that is important is,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that people understand or at least can easily comprehend how that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism works, so they can use it appropriately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You point to a possible problem.  We'd then have the community who
</I>&gt;<i> uses mechanism M, and the community who discusses topic T, and the
</I>&gt;<i> four combinations of these:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Use M Talk T
</I>&gt;<i>      ----- ------
</I>&gt;<i>   a   yes   yes
</I>&gt;<i>   b   yes    no
</I>&gt;<i>   c    no   yes    (you hope this one is very small)
</I>&gt;<i>   d    no    no
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our current public mirror covers all open discussion of topic T in the
</I>&gt;<i> world regardless of mechanism, method or medium of discussion (a, c).
</I>&gt;<i> I think we would always need that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, we might also want an &quot;argument mirror&quot;, something that
</I>&gt;<i> shows not the *thread* structure of a topical community (as our mirror
</I>&gt;<i> does), but rather the *argument* structure.  You and Marc and crew in
</I>&gt;<i> Germany are already developing something close to that in concept.  It
</I>&gt;<i> too would have to be well governed by the reflected community as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole, or would fail to show the true image of that community.
