<PRE>This is mostly technical.  It's about human roles in the internal
operation of our public mirror, and how some might later be automated.

Alexander Praetorius said:
&gt;<i> Instead of having some kind of &quot;moderator roles&quot; as &quot;gate keepers&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> i would hope, that we invent tools, so that people can &quot;self
</I>&gt;<i> organize&quot; how things are structured and through the tools they tell
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;AI&quot; or some kind of simple algorithm sitting in the background,
</I>&gt;<i> how to decorate the &quot;mirror front&quot; This might be tags or it might be
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of voting mechanism (like +1) or whatever...

Yes, it's a little like that already.  C just woke up and did an 'ok
(+1) command on a submitted link, meaning he thinks the linked
discussion is on topic T, and open to participation.  See here:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/no7-in/FRkxmS_OynQ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/no7-in/FRkxmS_OynQ</A>

The trunk relayer (currently me) now waits a while for the other trunk
vetters (currently none) to enter their commands.  Then he calculates
and enters the decisive command: either to relay the link to the
mirror front ('relay), or drop it ('close).  This is the current
behind-the-mirror machine that produces our community's image.

When it comes time to automate this, we already have two experienced
programmers on hand waiting for instructions.  Would you like to help
with the manual vetting practice in the meantime?  It'll give you a
sense of what we'd have to automate.

We have no rules on who's empowered to vet, so I guess it's anyone in
the community.

If you want, just subscribe to the trunk intake and reply with your
vet commands: <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in</A>

PS, C and I just agreed to change the vet commands from 'ok and 'no,
to 'ack and 'nak.  It sounds more command like.
