<PRE>Mike,

1.  I am not comfortable with the idea of my spending much time on changing
mission/vision.
2. Writing an elevator speech does not involve changing mission/vision.
3. In my world there are two main approaches to the idea of non-violent
speech.  I have not taken either of those training.  But IMO your speech is
violent.  Abuse is everywhere.  The main responses are withdrawal or anger
and hostility.  Think fight or flight or paralysis.  Hey.  The last study I
saw mentioned some simple stresses will knock the IQ down by up to 40%.  I
do not think reducing the average intelligence of a set of electors
generates better decisions.  I am NOT a pure democrat.
4  I thought the lever idea had merit.
5. The reflector idea was to me the best part.  But my approach there is
through 13th and I4th century mysticism which would be Plato nosie stuff
and yours is very oxfordy Aristotlian.  So what I have is a curiosity about
how close they might come to meeting.  But that is a very abstract
inquiry.  Since I write this a few hours after the highest Jewish holy day,
perhaps the Kabbalist treatment of Deity...oops, G-d, double oops, g-d, for
the occasion, might be a way for you to reflect on a different view of
reflectors.
6.  Mosaics is good way to organize thoughts in broad projects.  There need
be no start, no end, no plan, no control, and ownership is not material
ownership but community pride in the their and your efforts toward a
directionality that brings a revolutionary enhancement of potentialities.
7.  The two stones I wish to place in the mosaic matrix is a discussion
format and a  document creation process that makes everyone more
thoughtful.  Doing this with respect to public policy discussions is no
more urgent than with respect to many other areas.  But I believe if we
cannot get more thoughtfulness we all will continue as we have been in
terms of results.

I think I need to concentrate on updating some of Kenneth's spreadsheets
rather than continuing participating in these many interesting discussion
threads.

Blessings,

Max

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... after studying your proposal I have the uneasy feeling that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the very abstract and obscurely-defined term &quot;reflector&quot;, a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being snuck in through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the side door, with which stance I may or may not agree. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching consensus
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without [or, as Mike puts it, before] making decisions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Originally I thought of setting Metagov's sights exclusively on a
</I>&gt;<i> reflective start (III), but I agree that would be inconsistent with
</I>&gt;<i> the principle of openness (II).  Let me correct myself by saying that
</I>&gt;<i> a reflective start is just one start technique; I think Metagov should
</I>&gt;<i> be open to all start techniques and do its best to support each.  This
</I>&gt;<i> what I now suggest for principle (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not quite understand what you mean when you say [II] that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;we're ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with respect to any ideological or technical matter? ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, that wouldn't be possible.  We still must make decisions and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes they will bear on technical matters.  When they do, however,
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest we bracket them in a way that doesn't violate the principle
</I>&gt;<i> of openness (II, as revised).  So:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there be no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it shouldn't.  If you believe that a particular start effort needs
</I>&gt;<i> to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you could enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> within the context of that start effort.  But you shouldn't enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> universally within Metagov if doing so would violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise message (I) rings hollow.  Only through openness to all
</I>&gt;<i> start possibilities can Metagov convincingly back the claim of being
</I>&gt;<i> the place where it starts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov already honours (I) and (II), at least in practice.  There's
</I>&gt;<i> no other place we can go to speak together on such an over-arching
</I>&gt;<i> topic and retain any hope of putting our words into action.  Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> already has an advantage here and I think we need to press it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you have a better impression after reading my correction above.
</I>&gt;<i> Despite my forceful metaphors, I don't propose to push anyone around,
</I>&gt;<i> or to raise technicians to anything but a technical elite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll stop here and give you and Ned a chance to reply.  I haven't yet
</I>&gt;<i> answered concerning the specifics of reflective start (III), but only
</I>&gt;<i> items (I) and (II), which I think are the general conditions to obtain

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I apologize for not yet responding to earlier MG postings from you and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can put on a critical hat and criticize items 1 and 3 easily.  History
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; philosophy suggests item 2 is a sort of technocrat social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; item.  Item 1 illustrates that in that it is a neuro linguistic
</I>&gt;<i> programming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statement (NLP).  In this case there is no predicate.  So I am rather in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that tradition but I am not interested in doing this in that way.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The idea of an external chosing of reflectors seems to be again an
</I>&gt;<i> exercise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in control.  Actually I am wrong.  But it is elitest.  That gets tricky.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you want to play with reflectors you should find them yourself and
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; break them.  What mirror am I looking in such that I see myself as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proper predicate of my own shoulds?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; move the world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lots of images available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Lets try to expand that quote with freeform thoughts:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Give to share to make

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Long-4 million years of homind history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fulcrum-probably the key item to emphasize- the other pieces are
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but where should the fulcrum be placed and what is the fulcrum made of?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The world does not need saving so mayhaps it does not need moving but we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could set a directionality for ourselves that smart people might look
</I>&gt;<i> back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on and marvel at what wonder came from this effort.  But there is a
</I>&gt;<i> wisdom
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the greatest are also generally unknown.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm.  There is also a wisdom that I just made up that the greatest
</I>&gt;<i> control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the effect of experiences on themselves.  We are getting rather too good

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nor does where I would go do better.  The mission/vision is short enough.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We are not tweeting.  But a few suggested trys at &quot;closing&quot; would be
</I>&gt;<i> good.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First, I very much applaud and appreciate the audacity of your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It does a great job of presenting a mission/vision that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment community might adopt.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on the right side.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; YES!!!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As the &quot;it starts here&quot; beginning, the decision-making solution that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prototype and then use ourselves and then propose to the world must take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into account what the actual situation in the world is, and must take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into account what history has to teach us about what has worked and what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has not.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As part of our &quot;reflective start&quot; within the Metagovernment community, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggest that it might be helpful for us to seek consensus regarding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these matters. Without that community consensus regarding the world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation and the relevant teachings of history to build upon, we will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably not be able to agree upon a design that will enable us to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; function as catalyst with respect to the larger society.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To initiate that foundational consensus-seeking discussion, and to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide concrete &quot;use-case context&quot; for your abstract depiction of our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mission/vision, here are some (to me) well-presented bits of history,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including presentation of some (to me) profoundly bad social system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; designs that are actual parts of that history:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The History of Banking:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#">http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (The good stuff is in slides 1-79. Our mission, should we choose, would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be to prototype a decision system design that is capable of rendering
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the described existing decision system designs obsolete ...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not quite understand what you mean when you say that &quot;we're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions with respect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to any ideological or technical matter? (Example: Ed proposes that, in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our decision systems, there be no distinctions between governors and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governed. I heartily agree with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I read the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print written in legalese.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo a &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a native speaker of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; english, I would say no, and no.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reaching consensus is hard work, which is actively and creatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; performed by the participants. I see Vilfredo as enabling and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facilitating that work, not reflecting it. And I see Vilfredo as in need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of improvement and enhancement and such, not governance. Legalese takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ordinary words and redefines them, thereby confusing and misleading
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general readers who don't know the special definitions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of society. Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; currently redlines at 35 participants. When you say &quot;reflectors work at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the definition of &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector works at all scales of society
</I>&gt;<i> ...&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I confess that I do not understand what a &quot;reflective need&quot; is.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So far as needs, my view is that we (the Metagovernment community, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the e-democracy field, and the global population) &quot;need&quot; to reliably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make decisions regarding public matters that are valid by the Discourse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Principle, and that produce implementation outcomes that make things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; better. (Example: Bombing the hell out of Syria will probably not make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; things better, and is definitely not valid by the Discourse Principle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We -- the Metagovernment community -- &quot;need&quot; to agree upon a decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system design that can scale to the global level that will reliably not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make decisions such as that.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     [Reflectors] present aggregate views of a social reality in which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     people see themselves embedded.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To return to the &quot;legalese&quot; theme, after studying your proposal I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the uneasy feeling that, through the very abstract and obscurely-defined
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; term &quot;reflector&quot;, a particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; snuck in through the side door, with which stance I may or may not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree. Are you still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus without making decisions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would suggest that we make it our business to design and develop the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; best decision making system that we can put our heads together and
</I>&gt;<i> imagine.
