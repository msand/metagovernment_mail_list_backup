<PRE>People,

Is this the bylaws project?

I will pass too.  I might join enough to ask destructive questions if you
get to a product.  But the idea of doing bylaws is by itself silly.

Pretending a waterfall model:

1.  Who are the incorporators?
2.  Problem statement.
3.  Maybe mission/vision.
4.  What state?
5.  What corporation type--which makes the bad assumption that a
corporation is the right solution--and requires we define what a
corporation is--and by statute a coop is a corporation but my lawyers say
otherwise.
5.5. Profit or not for profit
5.5.1. Irs status
6. Articles of incorporation
7.  Sometimes a constitution
8.  Bylaws
9.  Name

Rewashing-- embed in a business plan before doing anything

Somewhere in there is agreement on funding registration fees and such.

It turns out profit vs non-profit is one of those no agreement is possible
items and this has nothing to do with the IRS?

It also turns out that Ed's public motivation is unsupportable.

And when you get all  that done and have an understanding of everyone's
considerations, then a consultant or lawyer makes sense so you can do the
refactoring.

You can imagine I might have very detressing questions if you simply come
up with bylaws.  And you can see I do not think you are exactly thinking
very well.  But you now have what I think is a bit of structure proposed.
I am not interested in arguing for the structure and no one reasonable
really does linear waterfalls, but I will be interested in eventually
learning what happens.

And Ned, I stuck this up as a concretization of a recent comment I made to
you off list.  Think about people trying to deal with this within your
flowcharts.   Here we have the goal of bylaws.  What did I just do in terms
of the flowcharts and what should happen next therein.

Notice this is very responsive to the experiment statement.

Blessings,

Max
