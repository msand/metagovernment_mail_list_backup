&gt;<i> I admit I'm having some trouble following what this is and where

</I>&gt;<i> Is that the point? Am I supposed to be able to understand this

No.  We have been talking about mirrors, but that's not the question.
The test would be pretty much the same if we were asked to govern a
popsicle stand, or lemon-aid stand.  Imagine, &quot;Here's a popsicle
stand, or lemon-aid stand, or some kind of stand.  Anyway the whole
enterprise is ours if we can manage to govern it.  Ready, set, go!&quot;

What we actually have is a device that displays on the sidewalk
(projector-like) the world-wide discussions of our community, where
our community is a topical community for which the topic is undefined.
The whole show is ours if we can manage to govern it.  Ready, set, go!

&gt;<i> And if so, I don't see it now. When I look at these two links

</I>&gt;<i> I see mostly nothing. Certainly nothing that gives me depth on where
</I>&gt;<i> we are in this process. What's next and/or what am I missing?

This is the question Alex asked originally, and we never had a chance
to answer it.  I agree it's a good question.  I'll try to answer it:
If it were a sales stand of some kind, the next thing we'd probably
want to know is what kind of stand exactly (take a look).  And who
exactly are we (look around).  But instead we have a public mirror
sitting on the sidewalk.  A public mirror won't work till it has a
topic.  So we need (1) to define what topic our topical community is
discussing.  That could be our first decision as a (self) government.

Then (2) the mirror will start projecting all the discussions of that
topic on the sidewalk for everyone to see.  Looking at them and
looking in particular at who's participating in them, we'll learn
who's in our community.  It might be nobody, or everybody, or
something in between, depending on how &quot;big&quot; a topic we've chosen.
Having determined ourselves in this way (rather boldly), we then try
to govern ourselves.  We'll succeed or fail pretty quickly I imagine.
And if we fail, we'll learn the reason why.

Still, there's no hurry.  Let's imagine Ed is unable to reply till
next weekend, but we want to make some progress toward self-governance
before he returns.  Like we're a self-responsible community where
everyone pitches in a little.  What (briefly) should we do?

Or how would you answer if you were in Ed's place?

Mike
