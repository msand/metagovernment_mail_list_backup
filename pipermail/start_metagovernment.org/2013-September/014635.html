<PRE>Hi Mike,

First, I very much applaud and appreciate the audacity of your proposal. 
It does a great job of presenting a mission/vision that the 
Metagovernment community might adopt.

    The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that
    acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on the right side.

YES!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the &quot;it starts here&quot; beginning, the decision-making solution that we 
prototype and then use ourselves and then propose to the world must take 
into account what the actual situation in the world is, and must take 
into account what history has to teach us about what has worked and what 
has not.

As part of our &quot;reflective start&quot; within the Metagovernment community, I 
suggest that it might be helpful for us to seek consensus regarding 
these matters. Without that community consensus regarding the world 
situation and the relevant teachings of history to build upon, we will 
probably not be able to agree upon a design that will enable us to 
function as catalyst with respect to the larger society.

To initiate that foundational consensus-seeking discussion, and to 
provide concrete &quot;use-case context&quot; for your abstract depiction of our 
mission/vision, here are some (to me) well-presented bits of history, 
including presentation of some (to me) profoundly bad social system 
designs that are actual parts of that history:

The History of Banking:
<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#">http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#</A>
(The good stuff is in slides 1-79. Our mission, should we choose, would 
be to prototype a decision system design that is capable of rendering 
the described existing decision system designs obsolete ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I do not quite understand what you mean when you say that &quot;we're 
ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean that we 
never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions with respect 
to any ideological or technical matter? (Example: Ed proposes that, in 
our decision systems, there be no distinctions between governors and 
governed. I heartily agree with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me 
partisans?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I read the 
words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print written in legalese.

Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo a &quot;reflector&quot;? 
Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a native speaker of 
english, I would say no, and no.

Reaching consensus is hard work, which is actively and creatively 
performed by the participants. I see Vilfredo as enabling and 
facilitating that work, not reflecting it. And I see Vilfredo as in need 
of improvement and enhancement and such, not governance. Legalese takes 
ordinary words and redefines them, thereby confusing and misleading 
general readers who don't know the special definitions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of society. Vilfredo 
currently redlines at 35 participants. When you say &quot;reflectors work at 
all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the definition of &quot;reflector&quot;? 
(That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector works at all scales of society ...&quot;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I confess that I do not understand what a &quot;reflective need&quot; is.

So far as needs, my view is that we (the Metagovernment community, and 
the e-democracy field, and the global population) &quot;need&quot; to reliably 
make decisions regarding public matters that are valid by the Discourse 
Principle, and that produce implementation outcomes that make things 
better. (Example: Bombing the hell out of Syria will probably not make 
things better, and is definitely not valid by the Discourse Principle. 
We -- the Metagovernment community -- &quot;need&quot; to agree upon a decision 
system design that can scale to the global level that will reliably not 
make decisions such as that.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    [Reflectors] present aggregate views of a social reality in which
    people see themselves embedded.

To return to the &quot;legalese&quot; theme, after studying your proposal I have 
the uneasy feeling that, through the very abstract and obscurely-defined 
term &quot;reflector&quot;, a particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being 
snuck in through the side door, with which stance I may or may not 
agree. Are you still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching 
consensus without making decisions?

I would suggest that we make it our business to design and develop the 
best decision making system that we can put our heads together and imagine.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (II) We're ideologically and technically non-partisan.  I didn't

</I>&gt;<i> This is hard to say, but you see the need; we must occupy the high

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (III) We know what we're doing.  This isn't quite true, but I think we

</I>&gt;<i> The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that

</I>&gt;<i> That's what we always pictured for Metagov.  Stage 1 (bottom left) is
</I>&gt;<i> the agressively expanded, cross-project/ cross-formal tracking I've
</I>&gt;<i> been mooting in the threads &quot;Feature Investigation&quot; and &quot;Our current,
</I>&gt;<i> past, and future work&quot;.  It's really the only new thing.  Stage 2 is
</I>&gt;<i> where we leverage self-determination and self-governance into
</I>&gt;<i> leadership of the field.  Again, this is vintage Metagov, and all
</I>&gt;<i> that's really new is the fulcrum in stage 1.  The fulcrum works for
</I>&gt;<i> three basic reasons: i) reflectors work at all scales in society; ii)
</I>&gt;<i> reflectors must be governed; and iii) we can turn reflectors onto the
</I>&gt;<i> field itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (i) The class of tool that's needed to support Metagov as a self-
</I>&gt;<i> determined community (reflector) is the same class that's needed in
</I>&gt;<i> society at large.  Most of the tools we talk about in this field are
</I>&gt;<i> reflectors.  They present aggregate views of a social reality in which
</I>&gt;<i> people see themselves embedded.  In doing this, they support that
</I>&gt;<i> reality.  The reflectors and reflection practices that Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> pioneers will be applicable to most communities regardless of scale.
</I>&gt;<i> Their reflective needs are essentially the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (ii) The reflectors must be governed.  This is what self-determination
</I>&gt;<i> means in the first instance, to man and steer the reflectors on which
</I>&gt;<i> the community's existence, growth and reproduction depend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (iii) We can turn our reflectors onto the social reality of the field
</I>&gt;<i> itself.  We hold a mirror to the wider field (our larger self) and
</I>&gt;<i> watch how the image improves over time: a better social reality within
</I>&gt;<i> the field, and better reflectors produced by it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I put a tentative draft in the wiki, basically just this message:
