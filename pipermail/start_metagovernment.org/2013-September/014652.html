<PRE>Hi Ned,

&gt;<i> But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA Foundation,
</I>&gt;<i> that will apply for grants and such, and will then have serious
</I>&gt;<i> resources to distribute, in service of becoming a useful catalyst
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to changes in global governance. (I guess you didn't
</I>&gt;<i> get the memo ...) :^)
</I>
No I didn't.  Where can I find it?

&gt;<i> Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be adequate in that 
</I>&gt;<i> context?
</I>
I like the freedom and openness in Metagov's traditional approach.
I hope we can keep it.  I don't think rolling it back would bring in
resources.  This is all I'm thinking.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> As an aside: &quot;Unanimous Consent&quot; and &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; are

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding Principle II formulation: Up to this point, the &quot;support&quot; that 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment has been offering has consisted of the wiki (in which 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals can create wiki-pages), the listserv (to which individuals 
</I>&gt;<i> can subscribe), and special wiki-pages such as the Projects page where 
</I>&gt;<i> projects can be listed (thereby become famous and such).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since the marginal cost of these supports (one more wiki-page, one more 
</I>&gt;<i> email, one more item on the projects list) is within epsilon of zero, 
</I>&gt;<i> there has been no need or reason to have any formality involved in 
</I>&gt;<i> making these supports available.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         (what I suggested earlier)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    IIb) Metagov is open to all proposals concerning the use of its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         resources, but every proposal must meet with the unanimous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         consent of the Metagov group before being implemented.  There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         must be no unresolved objections.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is to come up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; good proposals, and to make good decisions with respect to those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposals, and to do good work in funding and implementing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposals that have successfully passed through the &quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; objections&quot; gauntlet.  (Note that I have very slyly slipped in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; preference that we use &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as our decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rule ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As a community, we do not have enough resources to support every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposed &quot;start effort&quot; (meaning project start?). We must pick and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; choose, carefully. As a practical matter, the openness of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; community must be at the level of receiving any proposal, not at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; level of indiscriminately supporting every proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;      
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Neither variant (a or b) is actually in force.  The only rule in force
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is the traditional one, which hovers somewhere in between.  It's not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; written down anywhere that I know of.  It goes something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    IIt) Metagov is open to all sorts of initiatives.  But if you've an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         initiative you'd like to undertake here, please discuss it with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         the group first and try to accomodate people's sensitivities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         (please correct this characterization if it's wrong)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I'd prefer (IIa) myself, but I'm almost as happy with (IIt).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So it was unwise of me to raise this issue in the first place.  Better
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to let sleeping dogs lie.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
