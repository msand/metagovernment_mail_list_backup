<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Hi Alex,

I went through your email and &quot;mined&quot; it for proposals that might be 
ready for formal consideration. Here is the list. (The list includes 
questions, which are one particular type of proposal.)

(Anyone/Everyone: feel free to edit the way that I have stated each 
proposal and to extend the list. Also feel free to start a whole new 
alternative list, that includes yucky things that I have left out, such 
as voting and polyarchy and being mean to babies.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   1. Membership: Uncoerced

      Any sentient being of the world (or elsewhere) may freely choose
      to become a member of [the start group named Freetimea?]. Any
      member may freely choose to cease to be a member of the group.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   2. Decision Making: Direct Democracy

      Each member of [the group] is free to participate in making any
      decision that the group makes. Each member participates in
      decision making on equal footing.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   3. Participation: Through Proposing

      Members participate in decision making exclusively through
      formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
      ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
      provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
      making.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   4. Participation Scope: Anyone Can Propose Anything

      This rule is intended to provide to each individual the greatest
      possible amount of public autonomy while maintaining equal public
      autonomy across all individuals.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   5. Decision Rule: No Unresolved Objections

      The decision rule for group decisions is that a proposal is
      cleared to be implemented at the point that it faces no unresolved
      objections. Objections are proposed. Objections are resolved
      through successive, recursive proposing.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   6. What resolves (can resolve) an objection?

      One form of answer might be to accumulate a list of use-case
      examples, the way that case law accumulates precedent-setting cases.

      (We resolve objections routinely, in ordinary conversations.
      Example: &quot;Now I know what you are going to say, but ... &quot;)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   7. What is a valid objection?

      (list of criteria?)
      (list of types?)

      (Alex: You asked ...)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   8. List of Intersubjective Criteria

      Can we create a list of &quot;intersubjective criteria&quot;, that we use in
      ordinary discourse to discriminate between valid and invalid
      proposals (including proposed objections)?

      (Alex: You requested this list.)

      (I seem to recall reading somewhere that some say three types of
      criteria are used: logical, true, and authentic.)

      (Somebody with a strong philosophy background might be able to
      score us this list, or show us that it does not exist.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   9. Process To Create Relevant Criteria List

      Can we formulate the general rule/process that generates the
      criteria list for a specific proposal that is made?

      (Alex: You asked for this.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  10. Apply All Relevant Proposal Filters To Each Proposal

      Our new decision process must adequately solve the problem of
      reliably and objectively applying all existing and relevant
      potential objections (a.k.a. &quot;relevant criteria&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;proposal
      filters&quot;) to each new proposal. (There may be hundreds of relevant
      filters for a particular new proposal, that must be drawn from the
      general filter pool that may contain millions ...)

      (The Blinap design addresses this problem. If there are other
      designs that do, I don't know about them.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  11. Objective Interpretation of Proposal Filters

      Our new decision process must adequately solve the problem of
      making the intrepretation of existing (agreed-upon) &quot;relevant
      criteria&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;proposal filters&quot;) as objective as possible.

      (There is probably a better way to state this proposal. When
      judges and juries apply laws made by others, they are doing the
      same sort of work, which is held to an &quot;objective interpretation&quot;
      standard.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  12. Professional Application of Proposal Filters

      Our new decision process must automate/professionalize application
      of agreed-upon proposal filters, so that general participants can
      concentrate on edge cases and considerations, where experience is
      lacking and/or opinions differ.

      (Alex: this is my attempt to state your proposal.)

      (Interpretation by professionals in tandem with interpretation by
      general participants can make for a more reliable system. The
      Blinap design has this, and includes checks on the professionals.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  13. How many objections can be raised by people?

      (No limit to the number or recursive depth of proposed objections?)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  14. How long will the process of resolving objections take?

      (Decision made in three days if there are no new objections?)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  15. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;.

      (Alex: this is your proposal. I guess you intend that &quot;fairness&quot;
      be a criterion in assessing proposed decision processes. If you
      could elaborate the proposal a bit -- on its own thread -- that
      would be great. What constitutes &quot;fair&quot;?)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  16. Structured Decision Process

      There has to be a structured process, or at least a set of
      tools/options that each participant could take in order to raise
      objections or mark objections raised by others as invalid.

      (Alex: again this is your proposal. Is the proposal merely
      distinguishing between structured and unstructured, or are there
      more specific criteria that the structuring must satisfy?)

      (Feel free to consult with Bentley, who is all over the
      structuring issue.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  17. Meta Process to Improve Decision System

      There must (eventually) be a meta process that can improve the
      rules surrounding that structured process or set of tools/options.

      (Alex: again your proposal. Ready to be put onto its own thread,
      and elaborated.)

      (And also, the Blinap design has this as an intrinsic feature.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  18. Decision System Must Evolve.

      It must be ensured that people can evolve the process on their
      own, based on their experience.

      (Alex: Do you have a list of design criteria to propose that can
      be used in evaluating proposed process designs, and that will
      ensure that the selected process can evolve?)

      (And also, the Blinap design has this as an intrinsic feature.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  19. The process must be FAST.

      Speed is important, because the faster it is (even if its less
      perfect), the more objections can be handled. A &quot;perfect process&quot;
      that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be included in
      measuring the value of the process.

      (Alex: Do you have a list of design criteria to propose that can
      be used in evaluating proposed process designs, and that will
      ensure that the selected process is FAST?)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  20. System Should Survive Stupid People.

      The decision making process must be able to operate efficiently
      and effectively even when &quot;stupid people&quot; are participating.

      (Alex: This proposal of yours is laying the groundwork to enable
      objecting to a proposed process design on the basis that stupid
      people could gum up the works. This proposal would create a type
      of valid objection with respect to proposed process designs.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  21. No Gaming The System

      The decision process must adequately solve the problem that rich
      and powerful special interests will attempt to game the system,
      and corrupt it, as soon as doing so seems worthwhile to them.

      (Alex: again, this proposal of yours is laying the groundwork to
      enable objecting to a proposed process design on the basis that
      special interests could game it. This proposal would create a type
      of valid objection with respect to proposed process designs.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  22. No Veto or Filibuster

      The decision process must be effectively immune to filibustering
      and such, and must not give anyone straight veto power.

      (Alex: This proposal again creates types of valid objections. We
      may need to sharpen the statement of the proposal, and may need to
      put in a list that shows what &quot;and such&quot; includes. Our design
      requirement proposal must be sufficiently clear and detailed to
      enable &quot;objective&quot; interpretation when applied to new proposals.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  23. Teaching/Training Newcomers

      The decision system must adequately solve the problem of rapidly
      and efficiently and inexpensively bringing newcomers up to speed
      to enable them to begin participating effectively.

      (Sometimes this proposal will function as a basis for objections,
      and sometimes it will function as a basis for justifications --
      that defend against objections.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  24. Compensation For Work Done

      The decision system should appropriately compensate workers for
      valuable work done. It should not depend on people &quot;working for free&quot;.

      (This requires that there be processes that determine what the
      &quot;appropriate compensation&quot; will be.)

      (Blinap has such processes.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  25. Payment in Money (Not Stock)

      The decision system should pay for work done in the form of money
      (not stock).

      (Alex: :^) Since I am writing this draft of the proposal, I get to
      pick which way it goes. You are free to reverse the preference
      when you start your new thread, in which the relative pros and
      cons of the two forms of payment are discussed.) :^)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  26. Payment Through A Bank

      To enable payment, the decision system needs to be associated with
      an online bank.

      (In the beginning -- as our alpha testing phase -- we can if we
      wish create our own community money, and have our own private bank
      that handles that money.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  27. Partnerships &amp; Projects

      It is proposed that all of the work of the decision system be done
      by partnerships, working under project contracts. (A partnership
      may have from 1 to 24 partners.)

      (Alex: this proposal is my agreement with and elaboration of your
      objection to the existence of the employer/employee relationship.
      If we say &quot;no&quot; to the employer/employee relation, we must say
      &quot;yes&quot; to some other arrangement.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  28. Project Contracts

      Project contracts are proposed into the system library (which
      makes them available for selection), and then are selected from
      the library when it is time to initiate a project.

      (Alex: I *DO NOT* want us to create tasks/goals on the fly
      (without opportunity for all stakeholders to be notified and
      respond), and I *DO* want the process of initiating a project to
      be fast and easy. The two-step process above can in many cases
      accomplish both.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      WHAT NOW?

We now have in hand 28 proposals. A couple of the proposals might even 
be seen as &quot;bylaw&quot; sorts of things.

For each proposal, our aim (as a &quot;start group&quot; I guess -- not clear who 
&quot;we&quot; is at this point) is to decide whether to implement the proposal as 
it stands, or to not implement the proposal as it stands.

(At the scale of large-populations, we must conceptualize that a 
modified proposal is a new proposal. However, at this informal, 
community-scale stage of the game -- since we have no need to notify 
strangers all over the world (who are not on the mailing list) when a 
modification is made -- we can get away with on-the-fly informal 
modification of proposals. So &quot;as it stands&quot; becomes &quot;as it stands at 
the point that there are no more unresolved objections&quot;.)

Speaking to all readers of this email: When you read a proposal and have 
a response, the first thing you do is select the venue in which you wish 
to respond. You can respond by email to the list (create a new thread, 
for just that proposal), or you can make the proposal a new topic in 
AllAngles and respond to it there, or you can make the proposal a new 
topic in Vilfredo, TruthMapping, or any number of other venues, and then 
respond to it there. If you have selected a venue other than the email 
list, post a notification email to the list with a link to the proposal 
topic.

Any proposal to which no one responds will be taken to be &quot;good to go&quot;. 
Since none of the proposals actually do anything so far as direct 
implementation, those &quot;good to go&quot; proposals will simply be available in 
the library (if we had a library) to serve as foundations for further 
proposing.

(The &quot;question proposals&quot; are a special case: if no one responds to 
them, they remain unanswered -- though they will still be &quot;good to go&quot; 
as questions.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Any time anybody sees a problem with the existing set of

</I>&gt;<i>     proposed, and solutions (new kinds of valid objections, removal of
</I>&gt;<i>     existing valid objections, whatever) can be proposed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't believe in this.
</I>&gt;<i> Objections can be very specific to each proposal that is made, you 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot list all possible objections that could be made in response to 
</I>&gt;<i> all possible kind of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> That approach seems to be doomed. There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> that might not be perfect all the time but at least might be a good 
</I>&gt;<i> start that could be improved when experience gives one new insights. I 
</I>&gt;<i> think there has to be a structured process, or at least a set of 
</I>&gt;<i> tools/options that each participant could take in order to raise 
</I>&gt;<i> objections or mark objections raised by others as invalid. And 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually a meta process that can improve the rules surrounding that 
</I>&gt;<i> process or tools/options.
</I>&gt;<i> This must be a fair process (at least as fair as possible) and it must 
</I>&gt;<i> be ensured, that people can evolve it on their own, based on their 
</I>&gt;<i> experience.
</I>&gt;<i> In addition, it has to be a FAST PROCESS. Speed is important, because 
</I>&gt;<i> the faster it is (even if its less perfect), the more objections can 
</I>&gt;<i> be handled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;perfect process&quot; that takes forever is not perfect. Speed has to be 
</I>&gt;<i> included in measuring the value of the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Any group of people that goes to the trouble of getting together
</I>&gt;<i>     and trying to set up such a system is trying to set up a system
</I>&gt;<i>     that will actually work. From the perspective of such a group, any
</I>&gt;<i>     possible problem that you see is a problem to be solved. You are
</I>&gt;<i>     very good at seeing problems. Just for fun, maybe you could try
</I>&gt;<i>     your hand at also seeing solutions to the problems that you see,
</I>&gt;<i>     so I don't have to do all the work. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, i do not see all the solutions.
</I>&gt;<i> Next thing is, i am not able to wear both hats at the same time 
</I>&gt;<i> (create solutions + see flaws in proposed solutions)
</I>&gt;<i> If someone puts forward solutions or a road to a solution, i can ask 
</I>&gt;<i> questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing is, i could try to propose a solution (like my EMAIL 
</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSAL) and others can ask questions and try to find weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> But i cant do both at the same time.
</I>&gt;<i> ...and doing both at the same time is not only difficult but not much 
</I>&gt;<i> fun at all to me. And in the end, the important that stuff we are 
</I>&gt;<i> doing is, without fun, i cant stay motivated anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i>     long
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        as one participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous
</I>&gt;<i>        consent&quot;, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; A really stupid group might indeed set up the system that
</I>&gt;<i>     way, and it would indeed then be just as bad as using the
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;unanimous consent&quot; decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hehe :-) If the method is only used by a couple of people, then maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> they are smart, maybe they are not so smart.
</I>&gt;<i> But the larger the group gets, the more likely it is, that &quot;stupid 
</I>&gt;<i> people&quot; might join in and therefor the process of how those rules are 
</I>&gt;<i> set up is very important.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not yet sure if that formal approach is any good at all, because 
</I>&gt;<i> right now, i feel like you might just shift the problem to the 
</I>&gt;<i> creation of DISCRIMINATING RULES, which have to be INTERPRETED too :-)
</I>&gt;<i> So you better come up with a process, that is not subject to 
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation or at least gives very little leeway and those process 
</I>&gt;<i> better cannot be abused to discriminate certain people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections from People with overweight are invalid 
</I>&gt;<i> when it comes to nuitrition issues&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> What if i propose: &quot;Objections of minority group x are invalid when it 
</I>&gt;<i> comes to issues regarding y&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Thats very trivial and exteme examples, but you can craft examples 
</I>&gt;<i> which use brilliant rethorics and very subtle ways of discrimination, 
</I>&gt;<i> which are hard to detect if you are looking at it from the wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think it might not be possible, all i'm saying is, that that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be a hard problem, and especially, because a FAST PROCESS is 
</I>&gt;<i> important (therefor it has not to be perfect, because you can repeat 
</I>&gt;<i> the process often for very atomic issues, because its fast).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be
</I>&gt;<i>     formalized
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        in a way so that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what
</I>&gt;<i>        an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method
</I>&gt;<i>        different from &quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Exactly. According to Habermas, such &quot;intersubjective
</I>&gt;<i>     criteria&quot; do exist, and are routinely applied during ordinary
</I>&gt;<i>     discourse. The &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule is tapping
</I>&gt;<i>     into that existing ability to discriminate, that exists in each of us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, that sounds good., but only because Habermas asserts it exists, 
</I>&gt;<i> doesnt mean it really does.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with any details of that issue, so if they do exist, 
</I>&gt;<i> but i dont know about them, then:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. can we create a list that lists all those &quot;intersubjective 
</I>&gt;<i> criteria&quot; (i suppose they will immediately make sense to me)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. can we formulate the general rule/process that generates that list 
</I>&gt;<i> for a specific proposal that is made? :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would be really interested to learn more about that, because if we 
</I>&gt;<i> would use that &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; thing, then better that list 
</I>&gt;<i> has to be really awesome and easy to use ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; ...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        possible to win something by doing so...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; You are suggesting that if the decision system is such that
</I>&gt;<i>     it rewards going crazy with success, then people will go crazy,
</I>&gt;<i>     and succeed. I agree with this. So, let's not set up a decision
</I>&gt;<i>     system that rewards going crazy with success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> gaming the system in ways that were not anticipated by the &quot;decision 
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; will really govern everything.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; And that again will just end in endless debates and talking,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        because as long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can
</I>&gt;<i>        be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; You have again spotted a valid problem, and again lazily
</I>&gt;<i>     handed it over to me to solve. (In certain voting systems, this
</I>&gt;<i>     problem is called a &quot;filibuster&quot;.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is a &quot;filibuster&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> I did not lazily handed it over to you.
</I>&gt;<i> I only try to understand your approach. I'm very skeptic about that 
</I>&gt;<i> approach in general.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not say it might not be possible, just i dont see how it might be 
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal with setting/creating a mail server which easily allows to 
</I>&gt;<i> make &quot;things persistant&quot; so that they do not repeat in a discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> and move on from there ...one step at a time, because we gain new 
</I>&gt;<i> insights, because WE USE THE TOOL ourselve, because WE COULD NEED such 
</I>&gt;<i> a mechanism :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ...if you remember that in another thread people ask for stuff of the 
</I>&gt;<i> past and we come up with issues that it would be cool if this or that 
</I>&gt;<i> would be on the wiki and be up to date...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So i would like to start with the &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> implement it, use it right here to gain new insights and experience 
</I>&gt;<i> and then broaden our &quot;least/lowest common denominator, implement it, 
</I>&gt;<i> use it right here to gain new insights and experience and then broaden 
</I>&gt;<i> our &quot;least/lowest common denominator&quot;, implement it, use it right here....
</I>&gt;<i> ...you get it :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, you want to start from a much higher level, by thinking 
</I>&gt;<i> the whole system through upfront. I believe it might be possible, but 
</I>&gt;<i> its very hard and exactly those questions i try to come up with is 
</I>&gt;<i> what we have to think through in order to have enough details so that 
</I>&gt;<i> we can really see if a certain approach is possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my world, every theorey can be implemented in many ways, but if 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented correctly, then all those implementations are as good as 
</I>&gt;<i> the theory itself, because every implemented instance of that theory 
</I>&gt;<i> itself could be the theory and the theory one has implemented could be 
</I>&gt;<i> the implementation, that means, i believe its isomorphisms (the theory 
</I>&gt;<i> and all possible implementations)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I dont know all the different parts involved in your theory, but if 
</I>&gt;<i> there is one basic element that could be implemented and used right 
</I>&gt;<i> away, while still retaining all the options necessary to implement the 
</I>&gt;<i> full thing, then lets start with that one basic element and implement 
</I>&gt;<i> it right away.
</I>&gt;<i> if we then use it, we can not only discuss things further, but gather 
</I>&gt;<i> experience around that basic elements and can more easily think of all 
</I>&gt;<i> the options that are possible to built on top and that will INCLUDE 
</I>&gt;<i> those options that are necessary for your theory :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     For us (the Metagovernment community), I will suggest that in the
</I>&gt;<i>     beginning the best way to approach finding solutions to this
</I>&gt;<i>     problem will be case-by-case. On each occasion that this problem
</I>&gt;<i>     actually occurs, we look for specific ways to solve the specific
</I>&gt;<i>     problem before us. As we accumulate specific solutions, we may see
</I>&gt;<i>     patterns that will enable us to come up with more general solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very good, but it all happens inside of our mind. If there is tens or 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe even hundreds of those issues, we will discuss them, come up 
</I>&gt;<i> with a solution, eventually put them on the wiki, rinse and repeat. 
</I>&gt;<i> Every time we talk about a new solution of an issue, we have to bear 
</I>&gt;<i> in mind all those other solutotions we have come up with and also have 
</I>&gt;<i> to think about how they fit together and create synergy effects....
</I>&gt;<i> its a hard thing and if someone new enters the metagovernment space, 
</I>&gt;<i> he first has to study A LOT and might even come up with new issues to 
</I>&gt;<i> old solutions that we havent thought about yet.... that could go on 
</I>&gt;<i> for AGES ....actually it already does to some degree ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how about teaching new people the ways of metagovernment, because 
</I>&gt;<i> they actually will use the tools and methods without really realizing it.
</I>&gt;<i> SO instead of self study, they will be educated during the process.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats why i think &quot;email&quot; is so important, even if there is other 
</I>&gt;<i> technology with which it would be much easier to craft prototypes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that
</I>&gt;<i>        it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that things
</I>&gt;<i>     cannot
</I>&gt;<i>        get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; As you have noted in a previous email, we could start
</I>&gt;<i>     creating our own community money right now, and start trying to
</I>&gt;<i>     handle it responsibly. We don't have to wait.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But its not easy. Our community money could be &quot;shares&quot; that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> earned for doing something and will slowly deprecate over time 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually vanishing completely if one leaves the metagovernment 
</I>&gt;<i> community forever, but will start to grow again, as soon as one comes 
</I>&gt;<i> back in.
</I>&gt;<i> But it should not be a beaurocratic process, but a fast one. The issue 
</I>&gt;<i> we have to solve is, how to evaluate how many shares which people get 
</I>&gt;<i> and for what?
</I>&gt;<i> There needs to be a system where people can log in to see their amount 
</I>&gt;<i> of shares and what to do with them.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a huge undertaking and if you can spend those kind of shares or 
</I>&gt;<i> use them to have more votes than someone who just joined and so on...
</I>&gt;<i> ...its essentially some kind of &quot;democratic system&quot; that you design. 
</I>&gt;<i> Spending money itself can be compared to voting on something. It just 
</I>&gt;<i> has its own special set of rules surrounding it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I very much hope, some day we will implement something like that, but 
</I>&gt;<i> it has to start somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Example:
</I>&gt;<i> Michael Allan has put up some &quot;job vacanccies&quot; around votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a good sign when it comes to shares/money, because Michael 
</I>&gt;<i> Allen creates a employer/employee relationship, that means, Michael 
</I>&gt;<i> Allen PAYS the employee so that the employee DOES what Michael Allen 
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;the boss&quot; will COME UP with.
</I>&gt;<i> A better approach, but a much more difficult one would be to: SPLIT UP 
</I>&gt;<i> the project into &quot;tasks&quot; or at least &quot;goals&quot; that could be or should 
</I>&gt;<i> be accomplished by someone else + set a reward/bounty on those (a 
</I>&gt;<i> portion of shares or something).
</I>&gt;<i> These shares have to be granted by Michael Allen OR ... if he opens 
</I>&gt;<i> the issue to the community and the community agrees on its importance, 
</I>&gt;<i> it will be granted by several people, not just Michael Allan.
</I>&gt;<i> The one who takes on that &quot;task&quot; or &quot;mission&quot; could himself invite 
</I>&gt;<i> others to help him and give them part of the bounty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a perfect world, this bounty will always be SHARES of the 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment Project as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you want to be able to create those &quot;tasks/goals&quot; on the fly 
</I>&gt;<i> and if you want it a fast process to determine the bounty (in terms of 
</I>&gt;<i> shares)&quot;, it has to be an easy and fast process.
</I>&gt;<i> the faster and easier it gets, the more often people might use it 
</I>&gt;<i> because the barrier in doing so is lower than anything else.
</I>&gt;<i> If its a difficult process, most simple tasks will not use the 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism, but only huge tasks will and simple ones will be solved in 
</I>&gt;<i> non-standard ways between people who know each other...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hint: This again is a &quot;snippet&quot; of a solution i imagine that might 
</I>&gt;<i> solve issues but might also have problems i dont see and that should 
</I>&gt;<i> be questioned by you and others, so i can think of those and come up 
</I>&gt;<i> with answers (that way we would have changed HATS) ....

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; For me, the metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;<i>     &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is not about getting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        money to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;<i>        support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;<i>     domains
</I>&gt;<i>        (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out
</I>&gt;<i>        there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually
</I>&gt;<i>        evolving in organized way), that can govern any form of government
</I>&gt;<i>        form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by
</I>&gt;<i>        all the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I think that we need all-of-above: we need the meta rules,
</I>&gt;<i>     and we need the right software systems, and we need the right
</I>&gt;<i>     practices, and so on. Everything is connected. Partial solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     generally wind up being no solutions at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, we need all of the above.
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree that &quot;partial solutions&quot; wind up being no solution at all.
</I>&gt;<i> And my reason for this is:
</I>&gt;<i> We already HAVE a complete system that solves all the issues life 
</I>&gt;<i> throws at us, you, me, everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> That solution is the status quo with all its imperfections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;partial solution&quot; that would be no solution at all is to me:
</I>&gt;<i> A transition from one complete solution (status quo) to another 
</I>&gt;<i> complete soltution (status quo COMPOSED/MERGED with feature x), where 
</I>&gt;<i> feature x is what you call partial solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you say with &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; or that we need a complete system 
</I>&gt;<i> means to me:
</I>&gt;<i> Merge the status quo with LOTS OF FEATURES at once.
</I>&gt;<i> Its hard to get that right and even if the theory is sound, its even 
</I>&gt;<i> harder to make lots of people change lots of habits over night, so 
</I>&gt;<i> they wont accept it.
</I>&gt;<i> Even if its perfect, it has to be introduced one feature at a time, so 
</I>&gt;<i> people have time to learn it and change their habits.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone knows that. In school you dont learn everything at once, but 
</I>&gt;<i> some thing after another.
</I>&gt;<i> So not even is it possible to introduce a &quot;partial solution&quot; a.k.a  a 
</I>&gt;<i> single feature x and introduce the next feature later, it is instead 
</I>&gt;<i> very much desirable to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> You start with basic features and bolt on more complex ones.
</I>&gt;<i> The same way you learn math ...not starting with universal sets 
</I>&gt;<i> algebra or category theory or calculus or game theory, but rather with 
</I>&gt;<i> basic stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BUT: If people have to learn basic stuff ANYWAY before they are able 
</I>&gt;<i> to use more advanced features, why not introduce the basic features 
</I>&gt;<i> first (our &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;) implement it, make them use it 
</I>&gt;<i> and learn on the way, so that we not only have our thoughts and 
</I>&gt;<i> theory, but also get feedback from the experience of implementing it 
</I>&gt;<i> and having it used. So chances increase we get feature x and y &quot;more 
</I>&gt;<i> right&quot; than without that practical feedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And even if our tools grow to hundreds of features, its still 
</I>&gt;<i> important to only have basic features available at entry level and to 
</I>&gt;<i> not require all those advanced features, because people new to the 
</I>&gt;<i> system, because they joined the usage late, still have to learn the 
</I>&gt;<i> basics first.
</I>&gt;<i> ...and they wont read books, they want immediate results, they want 
</I>&gt;<i> the things to be intuitive and want to hack right away... like with 
</I>&gt;<i> writing an email :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to
</I>&gt;<i>     evolve
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular
</I>&gt;<i>        interests can corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such
</I>&gt;<i>        has failed. And by this I mean, if its possible for highly
</I>&gt;<i>     motivated
</I>&gt;<i>        particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money
</I>&gt;<i>        is involved and success manifests in one way or another), to
</I>&gt;<i>     corrupt
</I>&gt;<i>        the set of META RULES so that in essence the particular interests
</I>&gt;<i>        will be that thing which governs government, thus be the
</I>&gt;<i>        metagovernment, then we have accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Yes. Exactly. And that is what has happened in the world. We
</I>&gt;<i>     do in fact now have various special-interest &quot;metagovernments&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     that most people don't even know exist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what we need to find is a &quot;merge process&quot; :-) that means tools and 
</I>&gt;<i> stuff that helps us to &quot;increase synchronisation&quot; between our thoughts 
</I>&gt;<i> through &quot;constant communication&quot; that is productive. There for we need 
</I>&gt;<i> helpful tools to automate parts of the discussion that can be 
</I>&gt;<i> automated (e.g. instead of someone to manually copy stuff from the 
</I>&gt;<i> email list to our wiki or instead of having someone to look up the 
</I>&gt;<i> email list archive.... and whatever else, maybe the system can do it 
</I>&gt;<i> for us)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe, even though all the &quot;metagovernment parties&quot; co-exist with 
</I>&gt;<i> the same goal, its ONLY because the degree of communication is not 
</I>&gt;<i> dense enough.
</I>&gt;<i> If it were, we could use every imaginable synergy effect and 
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate only about the edge cases where our experience and 
</I>&gt;<i> oppinions differ. we would learn about each others way to think and 
</I>&gt;<i> pull off experiments together to check our assumptions, and so forth...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The process doesnt have to be perfect, it must only be so good, that 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;rate of benefits through synchronisation via communication&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> exceeds the &quot;rate of benefit by doing something on his own&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as thats the case, people will collaborate, because it gives 
</I>&gt;<i> you benefits faster.
</I>&gt;<i> So all we have to do is to lower the barriers and thats why SPEEED is 
</I>&gt;<i> vitally important, no matter what kind of process or system you come 
</I>&gt;<i> up with.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        become some kind of organization within the existing rules and in
</I>&gt;<i>        order to &quot;boost productivity&quot;, its also good to involve money, but
</I>&gt;<i>        we really DO need rock solid foundations if we want to minimize the
</I>&gt;<i>        risk or potential that existing laws and money will start to
</I>&gt;<i>     corrupt
</I>&gt;<i>     metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;. And by this i

</I>&gt;<i>             involved in making these supports available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         +1
</I>&gt;<i>         i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of
</I>&gt;<i>         rules in place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way,
</I>&gt;<i>         that it's possible to eventually enforce it by law, so that
</I>&gt;<i>         things cannot get out of control as soon as money is involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         For me, the metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; project is not about getting money
</I>&gt;<i>         to support some projects and build some software tools to
</I>&gt;<i>         support some use cases and solve peoples problems in certain
</I>&gt;<i>         domains
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         (of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups
</I>&gt;<i>         out there that essentially do the same thing)
</I>&gt;<i>         As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES
</I>&gt;<i>         (eventually evolving in organized way), that can govern any
</I>&gt;<i>         form of government form in a way, so that &quot;government&quot; itself
</I>&gt;<i>         stays as: of, for and by all the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve
</I>&gt;<i>         over time, but, if we get them wrong to a degree where
</I>&gt;<i>         particular interests can corrupt the whole system, then
</I>&gt;<i>         metagovernment as such has failed.
</I>&gt;<i>         And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated
</I>&gt;<i>         particular interests (they eventually will appear as soon as
</I>&gt;<i>         money is involved and success manifests in one way or
</I>&gt;<i>         another), to corrupt the set of META RULES so that in essence
</I>&gt;<i>         the particular interests will be that thing which governs
</I>&gt;<i>         government, thus be the metagovernment, then we have
</I>&gt;<i>         accomplished nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and
</I>&gt;<i>         become some kind of organization within the existing rules and
</I>&gt;<i>         in order to &quot;boost productivity&quot;, its also good to involve
</I>&gt;<i>         money, but we really DO need rock solid foundations if we want
</I>&gt;<i>         to minimize the risk or potential that existing laws and money
</I>&gt;<i>         will start to corrupt metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>         And by this i mean, that it must be ensured, that nobody or no
</I>&gt;<i>         particular group can take over and control the ressources that
</I>&gt;<i>         might start to build up under the &quot;metagovernment.org
</I>&gt;<i>         &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>             But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA
</I>&gt;<i>         Foundation,
</I>&gt;<i>             that will apply for grants and such, and will then have
</I>&gt;<i>         serious
</I>&gt;<i>             resources to distribute, in service of becoming a useful
</I>&gt;<i>         catalyst
</I>&gt;<i>             with respect to changes in global governance. (I guess you
</I>&gt;<i>         didn't
</I>&gt;<i>             get the memo ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be
</I>&gt;<i>         adequate in
</I>&gt;<i>             that context?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I'm on your side here, i do not think, that the current rules
</I>&gt;<i>         could stand what might emerge as soon as law and money is
