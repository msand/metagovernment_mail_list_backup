<PRE>I can promote <A HREF="http://webchat.freenode.net/">http://webchat.freenode.net/</A>
So i'll join, but i feel that currently, most people do not read the
&quot;mirror front&quot;, but the &quot;mailinglist&quot;, therefor, i will reply here.

I didnt intend to skip a test.
I'm not even sure what kind of question it is that should be related to
self governance and why :-)

Do you mean this one: &quot;Is it possible, that some &quot;messages&quot; of a discussion
end up in different &quot;topical public mirrors&quot;?&quot;
(Because its the only thing ending on a questionmark in my previous message)


What really makes everything hard for me, and eventually for others, is the
&quot;predefined vocabulary&quot; you have built around all of that which you are
doing :-)
So, if you don't care how things are &quot;named&quot;, then eventually we can change
the &quot;names&quot; which are used or maybe you can help out with the definition of
things...


My current understanding tells me:
1. There is many *&quot;discussion mediums&quot;* (forum, mailinglist, facebook,
twitter, googlePlus, blogs, list_goes_on_forever....)
2. *&quot;People&quot;* write *&quot;Messages&quot;* on those mediums (chat messages, blog
postings, blog comments, short messages, emails, forum postings,
list_goes_on_forever....)
=&gt; creating a feed of messages
3. Every time, someone writes a message, all *&quot;Owners of a Tributary
Node&quot;*decide upon messages they believe are in scope of the
*&quot;Topical Community&quot;* they wanna build.
(they use 'ack' and 'nak' and might even choose a different mechanism,
apart from consensus)
=&gt; creating a filtered feed of messages
4. Multiple owners of tributary node's can negotiate with *&quot;Owners of a
Trunk Node&quot;* to forward their input to them, which will again...
=&gt; create a filtered feed of messages


For me, it's totally possible to imagine another &quot;trunk node&quot; after the
current &quot;trunk node&quot;, thus, building a tree like structure.



I do not believe, that its possible to create &quot;many trunks&quot; within
metagovernment.org itself.
I think, its possible to create at least &quot;one tributary node&quot; and provide a
very very nice interface to the
=&gt; feed of messages that come out of it
(one that makes people curious and which people like to read and &quot;subscribe
to&quot;

EVENTUALLY, it might be possible to create &quot;many tribulatory nodes&quot; for all
metagovernment projects and PERHAPS, there will be a chance to create a
&quot;TRUNK NODE&quot; that gathers all the inputs from all those projects....

...in essence, there will be a &quot;twitter like structure&quot;
...but metagovernment.org will only be a small part of it
There is different communities in the world, trying to achieve the same
thing as metagovernment.org does and they might be &quot;tributary nodes too&quot; or
&quot;trunk nodes&quot; for their associated projects, which are the &quot;tributary
nodes&quot;.

So then again, assume metagovernment can build some kind of &quot;trunk node&quot;,
and those other communities, that might even come from slightly different
backgrounds, so that they currently do not appear as &quot;potential partners&quot;,
will have &quot;trunk nodes&quot; too and then again, we could create a NEW &quot;trunk
node&quot; that gets all the input from the metagovernment.org &quot;trunk node&quot; and
their &quot;trunk nodes&quot;.


So my current oppinion about what we should do is:

Try to come up with a SIMPLE SOLUTION (simple is hard), to create an
absolutely awesome mechanism and easy to use tools, so that we can somehow
decide as a small fraction of the overall community (thats us, talking
right here) upon WHAT kind of stuff goes to OUR &quot;trunk&quot; or lets just call
it &quot;tributary node&quot;.

Our &quot;tributary node&quot; will become a &quot;trunk node&quot;, as soon as we get input
from other communities...


If those tools are nice and our mechanism to decide what content we want to
&quot;publish&quot;, so to speak, are awesome, then there might be a chance, that
others will FORK our approach and it might go VIRAL :-)


------------------
In essence, this whole thing will still build up a &quot;pyramid&quot;, but at least
it might be a very flexible pyramid where &quot;coalitions&quot; can constantly
change, because the &quot;switching costs&quot; are very small ....eventually, but
this is another thing we might need to discuss :-)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; So why not make us all moderators of our own &quot;community&quot;?  We could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; share the work. the first of us to click on the +1 button does the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; job for the rest of us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's how our mirror works by default, except vetting is by rough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; consensus.  We can change the defaults by governing ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; To put it in different words.  The &quot;front mirror&quot; is some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;public relations&quot; or &quot;community identity&quot; page.  It's a marketing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; thing of the community to advertise to other people.  If you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; already part of the community in discussing something, then you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; already know whats going on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not quite true.  Even a member of a topical community doesn't know the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; community's name, or boundaries, or totality of its discussions around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the world *except* through a public mirror.  But the mirror must be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; well governed by the community as a whole.  No such mirrors exist yet,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; therefore nobody has this information, not even community members.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible, that some &quot;messages&quot; of a discussion end up in different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;topical public mirrors&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Those &quot;gate keepers&quot; that sit between the actual discussion and are able
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;ack&quot; or &quot;nak&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can decide which image is created in a &quot;public mirror&quot;, which again will
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reflected in further discussions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and therefor influence how discussions might evolve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So the mechanism is a very important one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I therefor do not like the idea that some people i might not be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; aware of, define how &quot;my community&quot; is represented to the outside
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; world.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Neither do I.  That won't work at all.  The mirror must be governed by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the community as a whole or it's no good.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The thing is, i do not yet comprehend, how &quot;public mirrors&quot; pop into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existance,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how many &quot;public mirrors&quot; can exist for one community,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether a message in a discussion can be part of multiple &quot;public
</I>&gt;<i> mirrors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether it can even be part of different &quot;topical public mirrors&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and what all the other mechanisms might be...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...as soon as i grasp all the mechanisms involved, then i can try to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;monte carlo simulation&quot; in my head, with all the rules involved, to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how such a &quot;system&quot; might behave :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS, C and I just agreed to change the vet commands from 'ok and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'no, to 'ack and 'nak.  It sounds more command like.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; what happens if &quot;ack&quot; and C &quot;nak&quot;'s?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I guess that's not consensus, so relayer would say 'close.  Link is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; not imaged in mirror.  Anyway, this is the default mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i dont know whether thats a good thing or a bad thing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have no oppinion on it yet.
