</I>
Yes.  And maybe how their doings interrelate.  Not just tech projects,
but all groups in the field ofc; organizations, institutions, etc.
Maybe individuals, too.

&gt;<i> ... I'd also like to have a better idea of what is considered the
</I>&gt;<i> work of this group. Maybe that's an irrelevant distinction since
</I>&gt;<i> we're an open group ...
</I>
No, I think it's crucial.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects</A>
We'd be pulling together these tasks:

  * Updated list of related projects [etc, and everything about them]
  * Crossforum theater [obsolete name]

Into an over-arching aggregate view of the field.  It would be the
umbrella approach, but we'd force the umbrella open aggressively.
Rather than wait for projects (etc) to come together, we'd &quot;put&quot; them
together in a kind of friendly &quot;take over&quot; of the field.  That would
our work, or part of it.

We'd have to be very clear about it, just as you say.  I'm not sure
how we'd do that for this particular task; but it's crucial people get
the message or it won't work.  I'll float some ideas in a separate
thread shortly, and ask for suggestions.

Mike
