&quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; is used in &quot;Sociocracy&quot; or &quot;Holacracy&quot; and i
guess several other governing methods, but there is some thing that will
continue to be subjective and thats: what is a &quot;valid objection&quot; and what
is not?
If everything can be seen as an &quot;unresolved objection&quot; as long as one
participant says so, then its not different from &quot;unanimous consent&quot;, right?
If there is intersubjective criteria, that could be formalized in a way so
that from the rules alone, its possible to derive what an &quot;unresolved
objection&quot; is, then yes, it would make that method different from
&quot;Unanimous consent&quot;.

...but all i do see is starting rethorics to go crazy if its possible to
win something by doing so...
And that again will just end in endless debates and talking, because as
long as it goes on, its like a veto, because nothing can be done.

i agree, that its vitally important to have a good system of rules in
place, which can evolve and which is stable in a way, that it's possible to
eventually enforce it by law, so that things cannot get out of control as
soon as money is involved.

For me, the metagovernment.org project is not about getting money to
support some projects and build some software tools to support some use
cases and solve peoples problems in certain domains
(of course thats what we want too, but theres many startups out there that
essentially do the same thing)
As i see it, we are searching for a set of META RULES (eventually evolving
in organized way), that can govern any form of government form in a way, so
that &quot;government&quot; itself stays as: of, for and by all the people.

If we get those meta rules wrong, it's ok, they have to evolve over time,
but, if we get them wrong to a degree where particular interests can
corrupt the whole system, then metagovernment as such has failed.
And by this I mean, if its possible for highly motivated particular
interests (they eventually will appear as soon as money is involved and
success manifests in one way or another), to corrupt the set of META RULES
so that in essence the particular interests will be that thing which
governs government, thus be the metagovernment, then we have accomplished
nothing.


I believe its a good thing to engage/challenge the law and become some kind
of organization within the existing rules and in order to &quot;boost
productivity&quot;, its also good to involve money, but we really DO need rock
solid foundations if we want to minimize the risk or potential that
existing laws and money will start to corrupt metagovernment.org
And by this i mean, that it must be ensured, that nobody or no particular
group can take over and control the ressources that might start to build up
under the &quot;metagovernment.org&quot; banner in the future.




&gt;<i> But, Ed is now embarked on the project to set up a USA Foundation, that
</I>&gt;<i> will apply for grants and such, and will then have serious resources to
</I>&gt;<i> distribute, in service of becoming a useful catalyst with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> changes in global governance. (I guess you didn't get the memo ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really think that (IIt) is going to still be adequate in that
</I>&gt;<i> context?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm on your side here, i do not think, that the current rules could stand
what might emerge as soon as law and money is involved.
