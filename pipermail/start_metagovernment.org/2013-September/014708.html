<PRE>Hi Mark,

    Mark&gt; One thing I feel is essential is basic &quot;truth in advertising&quot;.
    I feel there should be a listing that actually asks questions to
    make sure they understand what they are actually voting on.

        This is an essential need.

        An informed and educated voter is what we want to avoid future
        issues.

        Just a quick survey style questionaire. If they don't understand
        what they are voting on it's not a valid vote as far as I am
        concerned.

Ned&gt; I very much agree with you that we will be better off if we make 
public decisions through a system in which all relevant arguments 
regarding each proposal are known to the deciders, and are appropriately 
vetted and weighted in the process of reaching the decision.

When decisions are made through voting on proposals (as on a ballot, or 
using &quot;like/dislike&quot; buttons or whatever), all of the collecting and 
vetting and weighting of the arguments occurs privately within each 
voter, and only the resulting preference (the vote) is known publicly. 
These individual votes are then aggregated somehow to produce the decision.

Since the quality of the decision relies on the aggregate decision 
making knowledge and skills of each voter working independently and 
privately, I can understand why you would suggest that the decision 
system should test the knowledge and decision making skill of each 
voter, to vet the voters.

So here is my question: rather than vetting voters through giving them a 
quick survey style questionaire, would it work to make decisions through 
proposing (not voting), with each proposal submitted to criticism and 
systematic examination through discourse? Participation in discourse 
would then accomplish the vetting of the knowledge of participants.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Alex and All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ned&gt; (Alex: this is your proposal. I guess you intend that
</I>&gt;<i>        &quot;fairness&quot; be a criterion in assessing proposed decision processes.
</I>&gt;<i>        If you could elaborate the proposal a bit -- on its own thread --
</I>&gt;<i>        that would be great. What constitutes &quot;fair&quot;?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; No matter what the process will look like, every question you
</I>&gt;<i>        could ask about the process should have an answer (that means a
</I>&gt;<i>        reasoning behind it, why it was created that way) ...and everyone
</I>&gt;<i>        should be able to agree with this abstract reasoning or propose
</I>&gt;<i>        something better. So if people can agree on the abstract reasoning,
</I>&gt;<i>        then it might be considered fair...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; So now let us juxtapose what you say here regarding the
</I>&gt;<i>     criteria for &quot;fair process&quot; with what you said in response to
</I>&gt;<i>     another proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ned&gt; Participation: Through Proposing
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            Members participate in decision making exclusively through
</I>&gt;<i>            formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
</I>&gt;<i>            ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
</I>&gt;<i>            provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
</I>&gt;<i>            making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Alex&gt; Can't support this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            You seem to think in binary mode here (vote vs. proposal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            But voting is a shortcut to get results, even if things are not
</I>&gt;<i>            discussed through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            But because time moves on, more iterations are possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            Good thing is, the &quot;voting shortcut&quot; allows people to act even
</I>&gt;<i>            though they havent finished the discussion yet, that means they
</I>&gt;<i>            havent resolved all issues yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Using voting with a majority or super-majority decision rule
</I>&gt;<i>     may or may not &quot;speed things up&quot; compared to using proposing with
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as the decision rule. Whether it will
</I>&gt;<i>     depends on the specifics of the two specific systems being
</I>&gt;<i>     compared, and is an empirical question to be answered through
</I>&gt;<i>     experimentation and observation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But, whether or not voting &quot;speeds things up&quot;, using voting with a
</I>&gt;<i>     majority or super-majority decision rule will definitely render
</I>&gt;<i>     the decision process unfair by the criteria that you have
</I>&gt;<i>     suggested above. Yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
