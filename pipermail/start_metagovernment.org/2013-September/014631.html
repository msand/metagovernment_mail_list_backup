<PRE>Hi Max,

The AllAngles structured discussion of email-as-platform is at 
<A HREF="http://allangles.co/14">http://allangles.co/14</A>

The concurrent informal discussion of email-as-platform (here on the 
email list) spread itself across at least half a dozen different threads 
-- it was a classic email mess. To me, the AllAngles version of the 
discussion was/is vastly more supportive of potentially reaching 
consensus and a decision. But, at this point, neither version of the 
discussion has led to reaching consensus and a decision.

If you have available-to-propose a directed graph for a &quot;reach consensus 
and reach decision&quot; process, that could use the material in Bentley's 
spreadsheet and/or the material in the AllAngles discussion as &quot;grist 
for its decision mill&quot;, that would be of considerable interest. (There 
are several projects in the community -- e.g., Vilfredo, Votorola, 
Blinap -- that feature such decision system graphs.)

Decisions are made routinely within the teams of individual projects. 
But decisions made by the community are very few and far between.

</I>&gt;<i>         People,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Plarform discussions brought up some personal connections to
</I>&gt;<i>         be mentioned and elaborated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Typically in a corporate environment you put together a wish
</I>&gt;<i>         list and assign weights.  You then compare candidate platform
</I>&gt;<i>         features to the wish list and end up with a scalar (did I
</I>&gt;<i>         mention my math degree) for each candidate and go from there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         In the real world the vendors will keep an eye on potential
</I>&gt;<i>         clients wish lists and over time modify their platform to get
</I>&gt;<i>         the maximum check boxes, even if the wish list item is silly
</I>&gt;<i>         or the modification is essentially fake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Understand that the wish list and weighing are where the real
</I>&gt;<i>         choices are made and this is pretty invisible.  Does that
</I>&gt;<i>         somehow feel familiar?  Consider the case where the must have
</I>&gt;<i>         feature is a single source item only available from your golf
</I>&gt;<i>         partner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Now the transparancy argument is essentially that we thus need
</I>&gt;<i>         to know everything about everyone in order to make good
</I>&gt;<i>         decisions.  And if I do not mention in my SEC filing who my
</I>&gt;<i>         good friends are, then, off with my head.  This seems to work
</I>&gt;<i>         really well here in the US.  Lol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Instead, I think the idea of a wish list is flawed and then
</I>&gt;<i>         the idea of a scalar is even worse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Consider instead of lists,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Directed graphs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Easy examples are heirarchies, flow charts, electronic
</I>&gt;<i>         schematics, computer programs, and the internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Those of you who are computer programmers will object that
</I>&gt;<i>         computer code can be more complex than a directed graph at
</I>&gt;<i>         execution time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         There are two points here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         This stuff is close to off the shelf for prototyping purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         People can move through the same graph in different ways,
</I>&gt;<i>         yielding different scalars.  This conceptually yields a scalar
</I>&gt;<i>         that cannot be compared to other scalars and this to me is a Good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The implied political organizing concepts are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         1.  No  laundry lists
</I>&gt;<i>         2.  No global unifying principles
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         1.  Laundry lists are all there are
</I>&gt;<i>         2.  Any list can be truly global and unifying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         The dance music got a little odd there, did it not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I am not particularly interested in criticism at this time.
</I>&gt;<i>          If nothing else, this presentation is highly truncated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Questions are at this time welcome.  In return, I ask you:
</I>&gt;<i>         what are the characteristics of a platform that could handle
</I>&gt;<i>         well this platform discussion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Now it happens I have said to someone local I would do a demo
</I>&gt;<i>         of an off the shelf product that I believe is relevant to the
</I>&gt;<i>         last question.  Afterwards I will share.
</I>&gt;<i>
