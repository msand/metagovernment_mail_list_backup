<PRE>I read the reddit link, i read the public mirror link.
Not yet convinced about the intermediate roles who define what goes into
the &quot;mirror front&quot; and what might not end up there.
Those &quot;intermediate roles&quot; will create a distorted mirror fronts and
eventually they even will do this on purpose if they are motivated
extrinsically or intrinsically.
..but so be it, for the moment (right now, there is no &quot;tributary intake&quot;,
only the &quot;trunk intake&quot; which publishes to that &quot;reddit thread&quot; thing)

Maybe its possible to somehow automate those &quot;intermediate roles later on&quot;,
using some kind of agreed upon rules, or maybe make it easy to replace
those &quot;persons in charge&quot; or maybe have some kind of voting mechanism or
veto mechanism to opt-out stuff. ...i think there will be ways to improve
this somehow.

Interesting thought: &quot;We had in direction D, where D is undefined&quot; + &quot;We
make all Discussions of topic T visible, where T is undefined&quot;
(I'm not yet sure what to make of it, but i can live with it, because it
sounds useful :P)

But still, i dont know what's next or what to do now.

</I>&gt;<i> All of us in this thread are participants in the governance test.
</I>&gt;<i> Just to speak is enough.  We're an open, topical community defined by
</I>&gt;<i> the boundaries of the topic we're discussing.  It's like we're in a
</I>&gt;<i> country where the borders, rather than being drawn in a geographic
</I>&gt;<i> space, are instead drawn in topical space.  But the topic hasn't been
</I>&gt;<i> defined yet.  So we're in a country with no definite borders and no
</I>&gt;<i> name.  This is why we have an opportunity for self-governance.  If we
</I>&gt;<i> do it right, then we can govern the whole community (whatever we
</I>&gt;<i> define it to be) as such.  Here's a device that'll tell us if we're
</I>&gt;<i> doing it right: <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a public mirror.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Public_mirror</A>
</I>&gt;<i> A public mirror shows the total image of a topical community without
</I>&gt;<i> respecting any borders aside from those of the chosen topic.  Our
</I>&gt;<i> particular mirror assumes that we're discussing that topic right now,
</I>&gt;<i> which is why it shows this thread.  Otherwise it knows nothing about
</I>&gt;<i> us.  It'll just sit there waiting for further instructions.  It'll
</I>&gt;<i> listen to all the participants in the community (initially this
</I>&gt;<i> thread) and accept our governance.  The success of that governance
</I>&gt;<i> attempt will then be reflected in the image that the mirror shows us.
</I>&gt;<i> A public mirror is fairly easy to operate on a small scale, even a
</I>&gt;<i> clumsy prototype like this one (with just C and I cranking the gears
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment); but still, it cannot reflect a true image of the
</I>&gt;<i> community, one that we'll accept and identify with, unless it's well
</I>&gt;<i> governed by the community as a whole.  It's technically infeasible
</I>&gt;<i> within an open society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the mirror is like a canary in a coal mine.  But it's also useful
</I>&gt;<i> for other things aside from breaking when it's abused.  It's the only
</I>&gt;<i> thing that shows an open, topical community as a whole.  Nothing else
</I>&gt;<i> provides that service.  It's ours to provide, or it's nobody's.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is this the bylaws project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it's separate to begin with.  But we can redefine the scope at any
</I>&gt;<i> time, so it could change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anthony Dunn said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... I would like to think there could be a better suited platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for people to work through their differences, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determining all hope is nought because a failed attempt to do so,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with, what I believe is essentially, inadequate technology for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; task.  Really though, tell me how many linear processes really work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out that great in the end?  Successful deliberation amongst many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people is just too multi-directional to handle the harder stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It needn't stay linear.  My promise that we'll learn the result &quot;right
</I>&gt;<i> here in this thread&quot; might be broken if we're successful, because
</I>&gt;<i> self-governance cannot be bound by limits.  But even a failure could
</I>&gt;<i> be helpful, if only to show that you're right after all; we're not
</I>&gt;<i> ready yet.  And to show why.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We live in a civilization that's headed in direction D, where D is
</I>&gt;<i> undefined.  This is an unsolved problem.  Meantime we're running a
</I>&gt;<i> facility that shows us the total of all open discussions in the world
</I>&gt;<i> on the topic of T, where T is undefined.  It's possible that an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt to solve the T problem will help us with the D problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Although I don't know of a particular solution, I do know that Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> is the best place for raising this kind of issue; so I'm throwing it
</I>&gt;<i> in the ring as a challenge for all of us.
