<PRE>Hi Mike,

(At this point, I take this thread not to be about making changes to the 
mission statement or the vision statement or the elevator pitch, but 
about making a reflective start ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Mike&gt; (II.) Metagov should be open to all start techniques and do
    its best to support each.

My view (to state it /sans/ nuance and qualification, for clarity) is 
that adopting either your original or amended *Principle II* will cause 
us to fail with respect to the mission of becoming able to usefully act 
as catalyst with respect to the global population.

Our openness to supporting any and all tools is not what will lead to 
that success. Our coming up with a really good set of tools is what will 
lead to that success.

Here is my alternative proposal for Principle II:

    ANYONE CAN PROPOSE ANYTHING. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there
    be no distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree
    with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)

    Mike&gt; No, it shouldn't. If you believe that a particular start
    effort needs to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you
    could enforce it within the context of that start effort. But you
    shouldn't enforce it universally within Metagov if doing so would
    violate (II).

Ned&gt; In a community (or population) that makes decisions with respect to 
proposals through reaching consensus (&quot;no unresolved objections&quot;), there 
is no &quot;enforcement&quot; at the level of decision making. When (II) is stated 
as &quot;anyone can propose anything&quot;, this is clear. (Yes?)

Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is to come up with good 
proposals, and to make good decisions with respect to those proposals, 
and to do good work in funding and implementing the proposals that have 
successfully passed through the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; gauntlet. 
(Note that I have very slyly slipped in my preference that we use &quot;no 
unresolved objections&quot; as our decision rule ...) :^)

As a community, we do not have enough resources to support every 
proposed &quot;start effort&quot; (meaning project start?). We must pick and 
choose, carefully. As a practical matter, the openness of the community 
must be at the level of receiving any proposal, not at the level of 
indiscriminately supporting every proposal.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching consensus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without [or, as Mike puts it, before] making decisions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> Originally I thought of setting Metagov's sights exclusively on a
</I>&gt;<i> reflective start (III), but I agree that would be inconsistent with
</I>&gt;<i> the principle of openness (II).  Let me correct myself by saying that
</I>&gt;<i> a reflective start is just one start technique; I think Metagov should
</I>&gt;<i> be open to all start techniques and do its best to support each.  This
</I>&gt;<i> what I now suggest for principle (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not quite understand what you mean when you say [II] that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;we're ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with respect to any ideological or technical matter? ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> No, that wouldn't be possible.  We still must make decisions and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes they will bear on technical matters.  When they do, however,
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest we bracket them in a way that doesn't violate the principle
</I>&gt;<i> of openness (II, as revised).  So:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems, there be no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> No, it shouldn't.  If you believe that a particular start effort needs
</I>&gt;<i> to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you could enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> within the context of that start effort.  But you shouldn't enforce it
</I>&gt;<i> universally within Metagov if doing so would violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise message (I) rings hollow.  Only through openness to all
</I>&gt;<i> start possibilities can Metagov convincingly back the claim of being
</I>&gt;<i> the place where it starts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov already honours (I) and (II), at least in practice.  There's
</I>&gt;<i> no other place we can go to speak together on such an over-arching
</I>&gt;<i> topic and retain any hope of putting our words into action.  Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> already has an advantage here and I think we need to press it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> I hope you have a better impression after reading my correction above.
</I>&gt;<i> Despite my forceful metaphors, I don't propose to push anyone around,
</I>&gt;<i> or to raise technicians to anything but a technical elite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll stop here and give you and Ned a chance to reply.  I haven't yet
</I>&gt;<i> answered concerning the specifics of reflective start (III), but only
</I>&gt;<i> items (I) and (II), which I think are the general conditions to obtain

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, I very much applaud and appreciate the audacity of your proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It does a great job of presenting a mission/vision that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment community might adopt.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      The left side is a relatively small, self-governing community that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on the right side.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> YES!!!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As the &quot;it starts here&quot; beginning, the decision-making solution that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prototype and then use ourselves and then propose to the world must take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into account what the actual situation in the world is, and must take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into account what history has to teach us about what has worked and what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As part of our &quot;reflective start&quot; within the Metagovernment community, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggest that it might be helpful for us to seek consensus regarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these matters. Without that community consensus regarding the world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situation and the relevant teachings of history to build upon, we will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably not be able to agree upon a design that will enable us to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function as catalyst with respect to the larger society.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To initiate that foundational consensus-seeking discussion, and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide concrete &quot;use-case context&quot; for your abstract depiction of our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mission/vision, here are some (to me) well-presented bits of history,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> including presentation of some (to me) profoundly bad social system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designs that are actual parts of that history:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The History of Banking:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#">http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (The good stuff is in slides 1-79. Our mission, should we choose, would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be to prototype a decision system design that is capable of rendering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the described existing decision system designs obsolete ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not quite understand what you mean when you say that &quot;we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that mean that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions with respect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to any ideological or technical matter? (Example: Ed proposes that, in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our decision systems, there be no distinctions between governors and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I read the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print written in legalese.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo a &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a native speaker of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> english, I would say no, and no.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Reaching consensus is hard work, which is actively and creatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> performed by the participants. I see Vilfredo as enabling and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> facilitating that work, not reflecting it. And I see Vilfredo as in need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of improvement and enhancement and such, not governance. Legalese takes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ordinary words and redefines them, thereby confusing and misleading
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general readers who don't know the special definitions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of society. Vilfredo
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently redlines at 35 participants. When you say &quot;reflectors work at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the definition of &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector works at all scales of society ...&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I confess that I do not understand what a &quot;reflective need&quot; is.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So far as needs, my view is that we (the Metagovernment community, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the e-democracy field, and the global population) &quot;need&quot; to reliably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make decisions regarding public matters that are valid by the Discourse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Principle, and that produce implementation outcomes that make things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better. (Example: Bombing the hell out of Syria will probably not make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things better, and is definitely not valid by the Discourse Principle.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We -- the Metagovernment community -- &quot;need&quot; to agree upon a decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system design that can scale to the global level that will reliably not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make decisions such as that.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      [Reflectors] present aggregate views of a social reality in which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      people see themselves embedded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To return to the &quot;legalese&quot; theme, after studying your proposal I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the uneasy feeling that, through the very abstract and obscurely-defined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> term &quot;reflector&quot;, a particular ideological stance is (perhaps) being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snuck in through the side door, with which stance I may or may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree. Are you still trying to set our community aim as that of reaching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus without making decisions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would suggest that we make it our business to design and develop the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best decision making system that we can put our heads together and imagine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
