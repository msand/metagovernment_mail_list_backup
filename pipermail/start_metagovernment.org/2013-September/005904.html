<PRE>Hi Alex and All,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Alex&gt; There has to be a &quot;fair process&quot;.

    Ned&gt; (Alex: this is your proposal. I guess you intend that
    &quot;fairness&quot; be a criterion in assessing proposed decision processes.
    If you could elaborate the proposal a bit -- on its own thread --
    that would be great. What constitutes &quot;fair&quot;?)

    Alex&gt; No matter what the process will look like, every question you
    could ask about the process should have an answer (that means a
    reasoning behind it, why it was created that way) ...and everyone
    should be able to agree with this abstract reasoning or propose
    something better. So if people can agree on the abstract reasoning,
    then it might be considered fair...

Ned&gt; So now let us juxtapose what you say here regarding the criteria 
for &quot;fair process&quot; with what you said in response to another proposal.

    Ned&gt; Participation: Through Proposing

        Members participate in decision making exclusively through
        formally proposing. Votes cast apart from proposing (through
        ballots, polling, &quot;like buttons&quot;, &quot;dislike buttons&quot; and such)
        provide information only, and have no formal effect on decision
        making.

    Alex&gt; Can't support this.

        You seem to think in binary mode here (vote vs. proposal).

        But voting is a shortcut to get results, even if things are not
        discussed through.

        But because time moves on, more iterations are possible.

        Good thing is, the &quot;voting shortcut&quot; allows people to act even
        though they havent finished the discussion yet, that means they
        havent resolved all issues yet.

Ned&gt; Using voting with a majority or super-majority decision rule may or 
may not &quot;speed things up&quot; compared to using proposing with &quot;no 
unresolved objections&quot; as the decision rule. Whether it will depends on 
the specifics of the two specific systems being compared, and is an 
empirical question to be answered through experimentation and observation.

But, whether or not voting &quot;speeds things up&quot;, using voting with a 
majority or super-majority decision rule will definitely render the 
decision process unfair by the criteria that you have suggested above. Yes?
