<PRE>Hi Alex,

    Mike&gt; Principle II, amended: Metagov should be open to all start
    techniques and do its best to support each.

    Ned&gt; My view (to state it /sans/ nuance and qualification, for
    clarity) is that adopting either your original or amended *Principle
    II* will cause us to fail with respect to the mission of becoming
    able to usefully act as catalyst with respect to the global population.

    Ned&gt; Our openness to supporting any and all tools is not what will
    lead to that success. Our coming up with a really good set of tools
    is what will lead to that success.

    Alex&gt; Why?

Ned&gt; Alex, I cannot begin to tell you just how *RIGHT ON!* I take your 
question to be. Your question is in my view precisely the sort of 
question we need to be asking at this point, as a community (as we 
prepare to handle money). Our decisions (such as whether to support all 
tools, projects, and &quot;start techniques&quot;, or only the agreed-upon best) 
will have practical consequences.

The first general step toward answering your question is this: We (the 
community) need to figure out and agree upon what will constitute 
success, and how we will measure the degrees to which we are succeeding 
in the various dimensions of success.

The straightforward way to begin the work of taking this step is to open 
the floor to relevant proposals: what will constitute success, and how 
will success be measured?

There are various pages in the wiki that contain material responsive to 
this &quot;request for proposals&quot;, and if we searched through the list 
archive, we would find lots of material responsive to the request.

All those &quot;buried&quot; proposals, together with new proposals, need to be 
codified and considered. We need to reach agreement, and then bring the 
agreed upon definitions and measures of success systematically to bear 
upon our decision making. (Easy to say, hard to do ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having applauded your question generally, I will now turn to responding 
to it specifically.

In Mike's (II), he is talking specifically about &quot;start techniques&quot;. As 
a preliminary step, we need to ask Mike to explain to us what he means 
by the term &quot;start technique&quot;, and maybe give us some examples. Then we 
can go from there. :^)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Here is my alternative proposal for Principle II:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        ANYONE CAN PROPOSE ANYTHING.
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Ned&gt; ... (Example: Ed proposes that, in our decision systems,
</I>&gt;<i>     there
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        be no distinctions between governors and governed. I heartily agree
</I>&gt;<i>        with that proposal. Does that make Ed and me partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Mike&gt; No, it shouldn't. If you believe that a particular start
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        effort needs to enforce a policy of &quot;no distinctions&quot;, then you
</I>&gt;<i>        could enforce it within the context of that start effort. But you
</I>&gt;<i>        shouldn't enforce it universally within Metagov if doing so would
</I>&gt;<i>        violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; In a community (or population) that makes decisions with
</I>&gt;<i>     respect to proposals through reaching consensus (&quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i>     objections&quot;), there is no &quot;enforcement&quot; at the level of decision
</I>&gt;<i>     making. When (II) is stated as &quot;anyone can propose anything&quot;, this
</I>&gt;<i>     is clear. (Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but &quot;consensus&quot; is always present, only its scope varies, thus, 
</I>&gt;<i> how many people are included.
</I>&gt;<i> If i propose something and am the only proponent, then &quot;consensus&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> does only include me.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as someone else joins me, &quot;consensus&quot; exists between me and 
</I>&gt;<i> that other person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if i propose something, like go and play tennis, consensus between 
</I>&gt;<i> me and that other guy is enough in order to make it happen.
</I>&gt;<i> There are other issues, where it needs more than a 2-person-consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me it sounds, as if you want nothing to be done as long as 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus is not reached and people HAVE to discuss stuff, until 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus IS reached. That could render lots of people inactive and 
</I>&gt;<i> unhappy with the situation.
</I>&gt;<i> To me it sounds, as if Mike wants everyone to do as they please and 
</I>&gt;<i> work for themselves and with those who want to followa certain 
</I>&gt;<i> approach, and listen occassionally on whats happening &quot;in the 
</I>&gt;<i> community&quot; and if there is &quot;room&quot; for cooperation, then cooperation 
</I>&gt;<i> might happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So basically, those two different perspectives will converge at the 
</I>&gt;<i> same thing, but come from opposite directions.
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposal to me sounds a bit to beaurocratic and people will soon 
</I>&gt;<i> start to turn away or at least complain that nothing gets done beside 
</I>&gt;<i> all the talking, while Mikes proposal might tend to prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation, because if it doesnt perfectly fit their values or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever, they rather mind their own business and do their stuff 
</I>&gt;<i> rather than trying to build consensus or cooperate on things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how can the situation be improved? (and as soon as real resources 
</I>&gt;<i> will be involved, its necessary to have working mechanisms)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Our opportunity/responsibility as a community is to come up with
</I>&gt;<i>     good proposals, and to make good decisions with respect to those
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals, and to do good work in funding and implementing the
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals that have successfully passed through the &quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;<i>     objections&quot; gauntlet. (Note that I have very slyly slipped in my
</I>&gt;<i>     preference that we use &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as our decision
</I>&gt;<i>     rule ...) :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thing is, things that pass through the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> gauntlet are by no means guaranteed to stay there for long.
</I>&gt;<i> As time moves on, people learn, new &quot;facts&quot; occur and eventually 
</I>&gt;<i> people change their mind.
</I>&gt;<i> So i would like all of this to be formulated as an iterative process 
</I>&gt;<i> loop or something, rather than as a one time thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As a community, we do not have enough resources to support every
</I>&gt;<i>     proposed &quot;start effort&quot; (meaning project start?). We must pick and
</I>&gt;<i>     choose, carefully. As a practical matter, the openness of the
</I>&gt;<i>     community must be at the level of receiving any proposal, not at
</I>&gt;<i>     the level of indiscriminately supporting every proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No - again - everyone can use his/her own ressources and those who are 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to follow a certain approach, to move something forward and 
</I>&gt;<i> through this, it might be possible to show some results and eventually 
</I>&gt;<i> that will convince skeptics, because sometimes its not possible to 
</I>&gt;<i> argue things through, because at the end of the day, there is 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;assumptions&quot; (like axioms) in every discussion and those are based on 
</I>&gt;<i> personal experience or believes and those can never be challenged by 
</I>&gt;<i> just discussing them. sometimes it is necessary to provide a new 
</I>&gt;<i> experience which might be able to shift certain believes or 
</I>&gt;<i> assumptions and only then can discussion move forward.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Originally I thought of setting Metagov's sights exclusively on a

</I>&gt;<i>         the principle of openness (II).  Let me correct myself by
</I>&gt;<i>         saying that
</I>&gt;<i>         a reflective start is just one start technique; I think
</I>&gt;<i>         Metagov should
</I>&gt;<i>         be open to all start techniques and do its best to support

</I>&gt;<i>         what I now suggest for principle (II).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I do not quite understand what you mean when you say [II] that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         No, that wouldn't be possible.  We still must make decisions and
</I>&gt;<i>         sometimes they will bear on technical matters.  When they do,
</I>&gt;<i>         however,
</I>&gt;<i>         I suggest we bracket them in a way that doesn't violate the
</I>&gt;<i>         principle
</I>&gt;<i>         of openness (II, as revised).  So:

</I>&gt;<i>         within the context of that start effort.  But you shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i>         enforce it
</I>&gt;<i>         universally within Metagov if doing so would violate (II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Otherwise message (I) rings hollow.  Only through openness to all
</I>&gt;<i>         start possibilities can Metagov convincingly back the claim of
</I>&gt;<i>         being
</I>&gt;<i>         the place where it starts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Metagov already honours (I) and (II), at least in practice.
</I>&gt;<i>          There's
</I>&gt;<i>         no other place we can go to speak together on such an over-arching

</I>&gt;<i>             on and marvel at what wonder came from this effort.  But

</I>&gt;<i>             Hmm.  There is also a wisdom that I just made up that the

</I>&gt;<i>             the effect of experiences on themselves.  We are getting
</I>&gt;<i>             rather too good at

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>             So I will bail out here in the middle of this post.

</I>&gt;<i>             Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             First, I very much applaud and appreciate the audacity of
</I>&gt;<i>             your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>             It does a great job of presenting a mission/vision that the
</I>&gt;<i>             Metagovernment community might adopt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                  The left side is a relatively small, self-governing
</I>&gt;<i>             community that
</I>&gt;<i>                  acts as a lever or catalyst vs. the larger society on
</I>&gt;<i>             the right side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             YES!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             As the &quot;it starts here&quot; beginning, the decision-making
</I>&gt;<i>             solution that we
</I>&gt;<i>             prototype and then use ourselves and then propose to the
</I>&gt;<i>             world must take
</I>&gt;<i>             into account what the actual situation in the world is,
</I>&gt;<i>             and must take
</I>&gt;<i>             into account what history has to teach us about what has
</I>&gt;<i>             worked and what
</I>&gt;<i>             has not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             As part of our &quot;reflective start&quot; within the
</I>&gt;<i>             Metagovernment community, I
</I>&gt;<i>             suggest that it might be helpful for us to seek consensus
</I>&gt;<i>             regarding
</I>&gt;<i>             these matters. Without that community consensus regarding
</I>&gt;<i>             the world
</I>&gt;<i>             situation and the relevant teachings of history to build
</I>&gt;<i>             upon, we will
</I>&gt;<i>             probably not be able to agree upon a design that will
</I>&gt;<i>             enable us to
</I>&gt;<i>             function as catalyst with respect to the larger society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             To initiate that foundational consensus-seeking
</I>&gt;<i>             discussion, and to
</I>&gt;<i>             provide concrete &quot;use-case context&quot; for your abstract
</I>&gt;<i>             depiction of our
</I>&gt;<i>             mission/vision, here are some (to me) well-presented bits
</I>&gt;<i>             of history,
</I>&gt;<i>             including presentation of some (to me) profoundly bad
</I>&gt;<i>             social system
</I>&gt;<i>             designs that are actual parts of that history:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             The History of Banking:
</I>&gt;<i>             <A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#">http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9210260#</A>
</I>&gt;<i>             (The good stuff is in slides 1-79. Our mission, should we
</I>&gt;<i>             choose, would
</I>&gt;<i>             be to prototype a decision system design that is capable
</I>&gt;<i>             of rendering
</I>&gt;<i>             the described existing decision system designs obsolete ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I do not quite understand what you mean when you say that
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;we're
</I>&gt;<i>             ideologically and technically non-partisan&quot;. Does that
</I>&gt;<i>             mean that we
</I>&gt;<i>             never do and never will reach consensus or make decisions
</I>&gt;<i>             with respect
</I>&gt;<i>             to any ideological or technical matter? (Example: Ed
</I>&gt;<i>             proposes that, in
</I>&gt;<i>             our decision systems, there be no distinctions between
</I>&gt;<i>             governors and
</I>&gt;<i>             governed. I heartily agree with that proposal. Does that
</I>&gt;<i>             make Ed and me
</I>&gt;<i>             partisans?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I
</I>&gt;<i>             read the
</I>&gt;<i>             words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print
</I>&gt;<i>             written in legalese.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo a
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>             Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a native
</I>&gt;<i>             speaker of
</I>&gt;<i>             english, I would say no, and no.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Reaching consensus is hard work, which is actively and
</I>&gt;<i>             creatively
</I>&gt;<i>             performed by the participants. I see Vilfredo as enabling and
</I>&gt;<i>             facilitating that work, not reflecting it. And I see
</I>&gt;<i>             Vilfredo as in need
</I>&gt;<i>             of improvement and enhancement and such, not governance.
</I>&gt;<i>             Legalese takes
</I>&gt;<i>             ordinary words and redefines them, thereby confusing and
</I>&gt;<i>             misleading
</I>&gt;<i>             general readers who don't know the special definitions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of
</I>&gt;<i>             society. Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i>             currently redlines at 35 participants. When you say
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;reflectors work at
</I>&gt;<i>             all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the definition of
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;reflector&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>             (That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector works at all scales
</I>&gt;<i>             of society ...&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I confess that I do not understand what a &quot;reflective
</I>&gt;<i>             need&quot; is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             So far as needs, my view is that we (the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i>             community, and
</I>&gt;<i>             the e-democracy field, and the global population) &quot;need&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>             to reliably
</I>&gt;<i>             make decisions regarding public matters that are valid by
</I>&gt;<i>             the Discourse
</I>&gt;<i>             Principle, and that produce implementation outcomes that
</I>&gt;<i>             make things
</I>&gt;<i>             better. (Example: Bombing the hell out of Syria will
</I>&gt;<i>             probably not make
</I>&gt;<i>             things better, and is definitely not valid by the
</I>&gt;<i>             Discourse Principle.
</I>&gt;<i>             We -- the Metagovernment community -- &quot;need&quot; to agree upon
</I>&gt;<i>             a decision
</I>&gt;<i>             system design that can scale to the global level that will
</I>&gt;<i>             reliably not
</I>&gt;<i>             make decisions such as that.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                  [Reflectors] present aggregate views of a social
</I>&gt;<i>             reality in which
</I>&gt;<i>                  people see themselves embedded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             To return to the &quot;legalese&quot; theme, after studying your
</I>&gt;<i>             proposal I have
</I>&gt;<i>             the uneasy feeling that, through the very abstract and
</I>&gt;<i>             obscurely-defined
</I>&gt;<i>             term &quot;reflector&quot;, a particular ideological stance is
</I>&gt;<i>             (perhaps) being
</I>&gt;<i>             snuck in through the side door, with which stance I may or
</I>&gt;<i>             may not
</I>&gt;<i>             agree. Are you still trying to set our community aim as
</I>&gt;<i>             that of reaching
</I>&gt;<i>             consensus without making decisions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I would suggest that we make it our business to design and
</I>&gt;<i>             develop the
</I>&gt;<i>             best decision making system that we can put our heads
</I>&gt;<i>             together and imagine.
