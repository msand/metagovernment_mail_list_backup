<PRE>Our topic is undefined.  We need a topic in order to learn who's in
our community.  I volunteer to be secretary for this decision if
nobody objects.  Please see: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Topic">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/No7#Topic</A>

We have several suggestions already, from Alex and Ned.

Alexander Praetorius said:
&gt;<i> I have no clue, but the topic we are talking about might be best
</I>&gt;<i> described with the word &quot;metagovernment&quot;.  I think it fits pretty
</I>&gt;<i> well, but there might be other communities who use totally different
</I>&gt;<i> vocabulary, but are actually talking about something similar
</I>
I think so, too.  I take it you mean &quot;metagovernment&quot; as a concept,
not &quot;Metagovernment&quot; our host project.  I suggest we use the word
&quot;metagovernance&quot; for clarity.  Is this okay, Alex?


Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> To paraphrase Harry: The purpose of THIS [Metagovernment] project is
</I>&gt;<i> NOT to figure out HOW to run the lemonade stand. It's to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> how we can collectively DECIDE how to run the lemonade stand.
</I>
Good idea; we should say what our topic is *not*.  I added an
&quot;exclusions&quot; section to the wiki page.
 
&gt;<i> Would it be possible for us to set the topic of the mirror to that
</I>&gt;<i> of figuring out how we can collectively DECIDE [anything at all]?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  I added this to our proposed inclusions.  Please
feel free to make corrections and such there.

Maybe others have suggestions.  What should we include in our topic?
What should we exclude?
