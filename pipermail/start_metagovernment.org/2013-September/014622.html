<PRE>Welcome Max,

I echo Ed's wish; please don't feel obliged to just lurk.

&gt;<i> Max's post points out that we haven't been tracking our current (or
</I>&gt;<i> past or future) work in any easily-approachable way. I have made a
</I>&gt;<i> page that provides a basic outline of some of our current projects:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects</A>
</I>
Maybe we can expand on this to track the work of the broader field?
Raise the stakes.

I see an on-going shift away from championing particulars (projects,
ideologies) and toward an over-arching, cross-cutting inclusiveness.
I'm not sure how to phrase it...  but it seems a natural progression,
because Metagov was always exceedingly open and outward looking.

&gt;<i> People,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a note somewhere that I should introduce myself before lurking.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have some techie and political credentials.  On the other hand I try not
</I>&gt;<i> to do much, especially urgently, because I find the effects on the world a
</I>&gt;<i> bit difficult to anticipate.  .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Techie-wise, I do have a masters in software engineering.  I am an old
</I>&gt;<i> guy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Politically, I am all over the options.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am curious as to what happened in your community over the past few years
</I>&gt;<i> and what you wish to expect over the next few years
</I>&gt;<i>
