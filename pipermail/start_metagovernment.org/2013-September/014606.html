<PRE>Alexander,

I can not think of a way to implement your suggestion beyond manually
adding it to the wiki and linking to it in the email. Until someone comes
up with a more specific solution I suggest that anyone that is annoyed with
repeating discussions can either do the hard work of point out where the
conversation took place previously (like the email archives links) or
ignore the conversation and allow the participants to learn the same
lessons.

I have been looking at a lot of systems and even though they appear to be
similar I see enough unique in each attempt that I am still glad to see
each one. It's hard to know what will catch on. I would find it helpful if
you would share what you know instead of just indicating that someone has
already tried something similar.

On thing I might like to do to help out is to start working on documenting
some of the more common attempts and create a primer for new people to
catch up quickly. That may be a result of the feature list I have already
have begun. If it's broken down to small enough chunks it could be liked to
by the experienced email list participants when things repeat. Has this
already been done? I don't want to repeat too much.

I have seen so many projects over the years and so many prototypes and they
&gt;<i> all had a basic system which somehow did what it was supposed to do.
</I>&gt;<i> I also have seen many &quot;alpha testers&quot; and &quot;beta testers&quot; or how you might
</I>&gt;<i> call those people to do some kind of artificial discussion to see how it
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;feels&quot; to use that software.
</I>&gt;<i> People here on this mailinglist have a grande vision, they know so much
</I>&gt;<i> more about voting and proposals and discussion methods and tools and
</I>&gt;<i> ...stuff, that all those on the metagovernment mailinglists are EXPERTS
</I>&gt;<i> compared to Jessica and Joe Random.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a feeling that its not possible to make progress through
</I>&gt;<i> theoretical tinkering. All is said and even more is known by people on this
</I>&gt;<i> mailinglist, each one with his own special niche of expertise.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of creating more theory and &quot;sandbox systems&quot; we should really try
</I>&gt;<i> to start something serious, something that is easy and eventually all could
</I>&gt;<i> agree that it would be a &quot;useful thing&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Email itself is far from being a perfect technology for discussion
</I>&gt;<i> systems, but the advantage is that there is virtuallz no person on the
</I>&gt;<i> internet which doesnt know or has never used email, because in order to use
</I>&gt;<i> other services, email is a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. What i personally believe is very annoying is: Discussion repeats
</I>&gt;<i> itself. I believe its the mechanism which is used to make important stuff
</I>&gt;<i> persist (in the heads or participants, after they have read it often
</I>&gt;<i> enough). As soon as old participants leave and new participants arrive, its
</I>&gt;<i> possible that it will start all over again.
</I>&gt;<i> So making stuff persistent is possible today, by copying it to a wiki or
</I>&gt;<i> some static place and have rules about when and how to update it and using
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of discipline, which normally only a view participants will.
</I>&gt;<i> So the &quot;GAP&quot; between email discussion flow and static wiki sites and the
</I>&gt;<i> manual transfer between each of them (1. copy stuff into the wiki, 2.
</I>&gt;<i> linking it back into the discussion) is OHM.
</I>&gt;<i> Its difficult/hard/takes time/etc... so because on average, people tend to
</I>&gt;<i> take the course of least resistance, they will NOT use both tools (wiki +
</I>&gt;<i> email) in the way they should use it.
</I>&gt;<i> So in order to make people do so, we have to lower the barrier, so that
</I>&gt;<i> putting it into the wiki and linking it back into the discussion must be
</I>&gt;<i> easier or less of a hassle then repeating stuff over and over again.
</I>&gt;<i> People are annoyed by discussions which repeat themselves time after time
</I>&gt;<i> and they STILL DO IT, because its even more difficult to manually copy
</I>&gt;<i> stuff to a wiki and linking it back in and its ONLY WORTH IT, if the other
</I>&gt;<i> people do the same and stick to it... whats it worth if someone does it,
</I>&gt;<i> but all the others keep repeating stuff???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe it needs some kind of search/autocomplete, maybe it needs some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of automatic suggestions, maybe it needs buttons for
</I>&gt;<i> persist/link/fork/merge/vote/dontknow/whatever... to make it EASIER :-)
</I>&gt;<i> ..at least easier than repeating stuff over and over again :-D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question:
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know tools within the scope of metagovernment which do NOT have
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of &quot;persistance&quot; mechanism? Basically its nothing else then
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;creating something that could be quoted&quot; and &quot;quoting such things in
</I>&gt;<i> discussions&quot; :-) Thats it.
</I>&gt;<i> I could easily create something that is backed by my oppinion, put it on
</I>&gt;<i> my website and link to it in discussions. (Maybe some kind of unwise
</I>&gt;<i> blabber)
</I>&gt;<i> Someone else could do the same, and if he has &quot;the same oppinion&quot; and puts
</I>&gt;<i> the same unwise blabber on his website, then there are at least to people
</I>&gt;<i> who have the same oppinion.
</I>&gt;<i> So its backed by two people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, i dont know what is the lowest common denominator of such &quot;persistance
</I>&gt;<i> functionality&quot; is, when you look at all those tools we have, but we could
</I>&gt;<i> start to use such a lowest common denominator and try to add it to OUR
</I>&gt;<i> METAGOVERNMENT MAILING LIST :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
