<PRE>People,

Plarform discussions brought up some personal connections to be mentioned
and elaborated.

Typically in a corporate environment you put together a wish list and
assign weights.  You then compare candidate platform features to the wish
list and end up with a scalar (did I mention my math degree) for each
candidate and go from there.

In the real world the vendors will keep an eye on potential clients wish
lists and over time modify their platform to get the maximum check boxes,
even if the wish list item is silly or the modification is essentially
fake.

Understand that the wish list and weighing are where the real choices are
made and this is pretty invisible.  Does that somehow feel familiar?
Consider the case where the must have feature is a single source item only
available from your golf partner.

Now the transparancy argument is essentially that we thus need to know
everything about everyone in order to make good decisions.  And if I do not
mention in my SEC filing who my good friends are, then, off with my head.
This seems to work really well here in the US.  Lol.

Instead, I think the idea of a wish list is flawed and then the idea of a
scalar is even worse.

Consider instead of lists,

Directed graphs

Easy examples are heirarchies, flow charts, electronic schematics, computer
programs, and the internet.

Those of you who are computer programmers will object that computer code
can be more complex than a directed graph at execution time.

There are two points here:

This stuff is close to off the shelf for prototyping purposes.

People can move through the same graph in different ways, yielding
different scalars.  This conceptually yields a scalar that cannot be
compared to other scalars and this to me is a Good.

The implied political organizing concepts are:

1.  No  laundry lists
2.  No global unifying principles

Or

1.  Laundry lists are all there are
2.  Any list can be truly global and unifying.

The dance music got a little odd there, did it not?

I am not particularly interested in criticism at this time.  If nothing
else, this presentation is highly truncated.

Questions are at this time welcome.  In return, I ask you: what are the
characteristics of a platform that could handle well this platform
discussion?

Now it happens I have said to someone local I would do a demo of an off the
shelf product that I believe is relevant to the last question.  Afterwards
I will share.

blessings,

Max
