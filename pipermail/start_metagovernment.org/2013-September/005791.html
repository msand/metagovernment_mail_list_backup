&gt;<i> Also, I believe the Votorola Difference Bridge serves a somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> similar purpose (and again, is wiki-style... I think, though perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> it can work on email archives). It allows two proposals (etc.) to be
</I>&gt;<i> compared, and then for people to accept individual parts of
</I>&gt;<i> them. Not sure if commenting is in there though. Michael or conseo
</I>&gt;<i> could speak more on that, if they happen to be listening. Ah, I did
</I>&gt;<i> find Michael's documentation on it:

The difference bridge might not fit here, in practice.  Votorola's
approach to argument modeling differs from what these folks are
attempting.  Although our trees/forests can be seen as formalizations
of argument, they're not in *discussion* form.  We take the argument
from discussion media where it's happening (actual argument) and we
reflect it in drafting and voting media.  The resulting image is
tree-like, as shown here: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.html</A>

That's a view of a living argument as resolved through the &quot;compound
lense&quot; of text and dis/agreement.  It depends on a rule similar to
&quot;one concept&quot; that I call &quot;atomic variation&quot;, illustrated here: *
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/position_space_rationalization">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/position_space_rationalization</A>
Atomic variation relates to difference bridging (as you mention) and
to various broader practices associated with patch flow. **

To be sure, these two forms of argument model (discursive form vs.
textual-dis/consensual) can be used in parallel; they're non-rival.
Which is cool, because I think we can benefit from both.


  * We used to have a &quot;keep it short&quot; rule too (laconic rule of thumb)
    for use on special occaisions (getting started), but we've
    replaced it with a pattern of basal abstraction.  You can see it
    here in the skeletal consensus texts (Aa, Ai) at the tree roots.

 ** All of what I'm describing in this post depends on Thomas von der
    Elbe's concept of pipe positions, which was his last contribution
    before heading on sabbatical.
