<PRE>I admit I'm having some trouble following what this is and where it's going (which is not helped by the deep dive the conversation has taken).

Is that the point? Am I supposed to be able to understand this conversation by viewing a sort of abstract in the form of the mirror?

And if so, I don't see it now. When I look at these two links
<A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/No7Mir/</A>
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in</A>
I see mostly nothing. Certainly nothing that gives me depth on where we are in this process. What's next and/or what am I missing?
