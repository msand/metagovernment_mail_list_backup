There is no such thing as &quot;mostly technical&quot;.
Even the technical rules of how balance sheets work and how equity and
liabilities rules are defined is a &quot;value judgement&quot;.
Even if its possible to completely automate something. If its not possible
to automate something, than its even more important to
care about something.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it's a little like that already.  C just woke up and did an 'ok
</I>&gt;<i> (+1) command on a submitted link, meaning he thinks the linked
</I>&gt;<i> discussion is on topic T, and open to participation.  See here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/no7-in/FRkxmS_OynQ">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/no7-in/FRkxmS_OynQ</A>
</I>

So why not make us all moderators of our own &quot;community&quot;?
We could share the work. the first of us to click on the +1 button does the
job for the rest of us.



The trunk relayer (currently me) now waits a while for the other trunk
&gt;<i> vetters (currently none) to enter their commands.  Then he calculates
</I>&gt;<i> and enters the decisive command: either to relay the link to the
</I>&gt;<i> mirror front ('relay), or drop it ('close).  This is the current
</I>&gt;<i> behind-the-mirror machine that produces our community's image.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

To put it in different words.
The &quot;front mirror&quot; is some kind of &quot;public relations&quot; or &quot;community
identity&quot; page.
It's a marketing thing of the community to advertise to other people.
If you are already part of the community in discussing something, then you
already know whats going on.
If you are not part, you only learn about that community through the front
mirror.

I therefor do not like the idea that some people i might not be aware of,
define how &quot;my community&quot; is represented to the outside world.



When it comes time to automate this, we already have two experienced
&gt;<i> programmers on hand waiting for instructions.  Would you like to help
</I>&gt;<i> with the manual vetting practice in the meantime?  It'll give you a
</I>&gt;<i> sense of what we'd have to automate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i would like to learn about this.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have no rules on who's empowered to vet, so I guess it's anyone in
</I>&gt;<i> the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

sounds good.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want, just subscribe to the trunk intake and reply with your
</I>&gt;<i> vet commands: <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/no7-in</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS, C and I just agreed to change the vet commands from 'ok and 'no,
</I>&gt;<i> to 'ack and 'nak.  It sounds more command like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
what happens if &quot;ack&quot; and C &quot;nak&quot;'s?
