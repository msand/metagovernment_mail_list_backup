&gt;<i> Questions are at this time welcome. ...
</I>
I think you propose a solution of some kind in a field where you have
expertise.  To clarify, can you state in layman's terms the problem it
would solve?

&gt;<i> ... In return, I ask you: what are the characteristics of a platform
</I>&gt;<i> that could handle well this platform discussion?
</I>
Roughly those that would suit any discussion.  I mean to suggest that
(if I understand) the topic doesn't make much difference.

&gt;<i> People,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plarform discussions brought up some personal connections to be mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> and elaborated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Typically in a corporate environment you put together a wish list and
</I>&gt;<i> assign weights.  You then compare candidate platform features to the wish
</I>&gt;<i> list and end up with a scalar (did I mention my math degree) for each
</I>&gt;<i> candidate and go from there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the real world the vendors will keep an eye on potential clients wish
</I>&gt;<i> lists and over time modify their platform to get the maximum check boxes,
</I>&gt;<i> even if the wish list item is silly or the modification is essentially
</I>&gt;<i> fake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Understand that the wish list and weighing are where the real choices are
</I>&gt;<i> made and this is pretty invisible.  Does that somehow feel familiar?
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the case where the must have feature is a single source item only
</I>&gt;<i> available from your golf partner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now the transparancy argument is essentially that we thus need to know
</I>&gt;<i> everything about everyone in order to make good decisions.  And if I do not
</I>&gt;<i> mention in my SEC filing who my good friends are, then, off with my head.
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to work really well here in the US.  Lol.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, I think the idea of a wish list is flawed and then the idea of a
</I>&gt;<i> scalar is even worse.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Consider instead of lists,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Directed graphs
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Easy examples are heirarchies, flow charts, electronic schematics, computer
</I>&gt;<i> programs, and the internet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those of you who are computer programmers will object that computer code
</I>&gt;<i> can be more complex than a directed graph at execution time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are two points here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This stuff is close to off the shelf for prototyping purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People can move through the same graph in different ways, yielding
</I>&gt;<i> different scalars.  This conceptually yields a scalar that cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> compared to other scalars and this to me is a Good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The implied political organizing concepts are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  No  laundry lists
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  No global unifying principles
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  Laundry lists are all there are
</I>&gt;<i> 2.  Any list can be truly global and unifying.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The dance music got a little odd there, did it not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am not particularly interested in criticism at this time.  If nothing
</I>&gt;<i> else, this presentation is highly truncated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Questions are at this time welcome.  In return, I ask you: what are the
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics of a platform that could handle well this platform
</I>&gt;<i> discussion?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now it happens I have said to someone local I would do a demo of an off the
</I>&gt;<i> shelf product that I believe is relevant to the last question.  Afterwards
</I>&gt;<i> I will share.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> blessings,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Max
