</I>in this thread, so setting that aside, the only response I can see that you
provided relevant to my point is quoted above. You appear to expect your
readers to remember that your comments are always your opinion and
experience. That is quite a lot to ask especially when your choice of words
draw a different picture. Using infinitives like 'always' and 'cannot' and
phrases like 'waste of time' evokes feelings in your readers regardless of
the content and personal history with you. It makes you sound childish and
maniacal. That tone is contagious and lowers the quality of the discussion
and community.

I simply ask people to take a moment and attempt to make sure their heart
felt intent is obvious in their text. I am not very good at this myself.
This email list is not a conversation with a close friend. This is speaking
to a wide variety of cultures and many new people only have one email or
two to decide how they spend their time. I would prefer they spend it with
us.
