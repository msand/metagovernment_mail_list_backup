<PRE>As i understand the &quot;mirror front&quot;, it is:
1. Just a &quot;News Feed&quot;, which lists all the &quot;stuff/messages&quot; that belong to
a certain &quot;topic&quot;, no matter if the source medium of a message is a forum,
email, twitter, blog or whatever
2. This &quot;News Feed&quot; does not include ALL &quot;stuff/messages&quot; written on these
different kind of mediums, but instead,
3. it's the people who discuss, who somehow themselves or if they choose,
then elected representatives, use &quot;FILTERS&quot;, to filter out all those
messages on the source medium, which do not belong to the chosen &quot;topic&quot;.
4. For multiple &quot;source mediums&quot; (e.g. a forum about drugs, a mailinglist
about drugs, tweets about drugs, blogs about drugs...) there can be
multiple &quot;News Feeds&quot;, maybe because of the first &quot;News Feed&quot; and their
representatives did not allow all messages in, so some people of the same
&quot;topic community&quot; creates another one.
5. They can FORWARD their &quot;news feeds&quot; to other &quot;News feeds&quot;, and as soon
as they aggregated to only ONE &quot;NEWS FEED&quot;, this is called a &quot;MIRROR FRONT&quot;

Currently, there exists at least two &quot;source mediums&quot;, thats the
metagovernment mailinglist and the megatovernment IRC channel.
They produce &quot;stuff/messages&quot; and Conseo and Mike and now Me, can press
&quot;ack&quot; or &quot;nak&quot; to vote on whether the message will go into the &quot;News Feed&quot;
(the REDDIT PAGE), which will represent the whole community and thus be the
&quot;MIRROR FRONT&quot;.


I guess it's called &quot;MIRROR FRONT&quot;
FRONT: because its what the general public sees as an image of the topical
community (a community which is a community because they discuss certain
ideas, even if they do not know each other in person and use different
&quot;source mediums&quot;)
MIRROR: because it reflects that which is written as &quot;stuff/messages&quot; back
to the general public, but also the topical community, so they can reflect
themselves and improve their discussion to produce a next iteration of the
&quot;MIRROR FRONT&quot;

So thats my guessing on what the name does stand for, but all i'm writing
is guessing in the wild and Michael Allan might provide some feedback ;-)
