<PRE>(an update, plus answers to Ned and Alex)

I think we can get this going in a few days, or so.  It'll be a little
easier to understand once you see it.  I've updated the projects page
under the assumption we'll be adopting this approach (among others),
though it's really only a trial balloon at this stage:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects#Reflective_start">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Projects#Reflective_start</A>

The initial reflector types will be a public mirror, and encyclopedia
indeces.  Christian has offered to code a mirror front to replace the
old Reddit one.  We should have a basic mirror running in a few days
that shows the total of all open discussions that are happening in the
field.  That's the purpose of this type of reflector.  It won't be
pretty at first, but it should be functional.  You should be able to
participate in its operation and governance almost immediately.

The other initial type of reflector will be encyclopedic, for lack of
a better name.  It'll index all the designs, groups, people, etc. and
show comparisons and relations amongst them.  This one is fuzzier and
I don't exactly know how to approach it yet.  But we'll ensure the
first cut shows at least something like Metagov's old project list.
Then if we think of a cross-project comparison we'd like to see, one
that gives lots of bang for the research buck, we can add that too.
It's scalable that way.  We can begin building it up in my dev wiki
till Metagov's wiki is upgraded.

&gt;<i> In Mike's (II), he is talking specifically about &quot;start techniques&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> As a preliminary step, we need to ask Mike to explain to us what he
</I>&gt;<i> means by the term &quot;start technique&quot;, and maybe give us some
</I>&gt;<i> examples.  Then we can go from there. :^)
</I>
I mean the creation of proto-publics that will develop into mature
publics and a public sphere.  In other words, starting the development
of a substansive democracy (as we understand the term); or a state of
self-determination/governance; or public autonomy.  These are all
roughly equivalent terms.

&gt;<i> I like your &quot;Developmental Stages&quot; figure. However, when I read the
</I>&gt;<i> words, it makes me feel like I am reading fine print written in
</I>&gt;<i> legalese.  Example: Vilfredo is a decision making tool. Is Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;reflector&quot;?  Must Vilfredo (as a reflector) be &quot;governed&quot;? As a
</I>&gt;<i> native speaker of english, I would say no, and no.
</I>
Yes, I agree.
 
&gt;<i> ... I see Vilfredo as enabling and facilitating [reaching
</I>&gt;<i> consensus], not reflecting it.  And I see Vilfredo as in need of
</I>&gt;<i> improvement and enhancement and such, not governance. ...
</I>
Right, it's not a reflector; only part of a reflector.  See below.

&gt;<i> It is not true that Vilfredo works at all scales of
</I>&gt;<i> society. Vilfredo currently redlines at 35 participants. When you
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;reflectors work at all scales of society&quot; are you adding to the
</I>&gt;<i> definition of &quot;reflector&quot;?  (That is, &quot;by definition, a reflector
</I>&gt;<i> works at all scales of society ...&quot;)
</I>
Yes.  Maybe the full term will be &quot;total reflector&quot;.  I added a quick
and dirty definition to the wiki.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Michael_Allan/Reflective_start</A>

   A total reflector presents a totalized view of an aspect of social
   actuality wherein people may thereby see themselves embedded.
   Total reflectors do not respect formal boundaries, but instead
   aggressively aggregate data of all known forms to construct the
   totalized view.  They also extend to cover newly discovered forms.
   Examples are encyclopedic indeces (total of knowledge), other
   directories and compendia (total of participants, groups, etc.),
   public mirrors (total of discussion), argument mirrors (total of
   argumentive structure) and vote mirrors together with linguistic/
   textual translation bridges (total of consensus and dissensus).

The last type of reflector is what I figure Vilfredo is a part of.
Vilfredo formalizes consensus/dissensus among a number of people (you
say 35 max), which is only part of the population.  The consensus
reflector will take all such formalizations, including Vilfredo's, and
sum them to yield a total across the population, which it presents as
the best possible image of actuality.  This type of reflector won't be
available immediately, but is part of the overall reflective start.

This is a tiny public mirror (discussion reflector) on the topic of
mirrors: <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/MirMir/">http://www.reddit.com/r/MirMir/</A>
Mark and his German crew are working on something close to an argument
mirror I believe.  Tim Bonneman's PartipateDB hints at an encyclopedic
reflector.  These are the only examples I know in this field.

&gt;<i> ... To me it sounds, as if Mike wants everyone to do as they please

</I>&gt;<i> community&quot; and if there is &quot;room&quot; for cooperation, then cooperation
</I>&gt;<i> might happen.
</I>
Yes, and the same with reflectors specifically.  We hope they'll
foster cooperation by revealing the space in which cooperation can
happen, the in between spaces where the fragments of the total picture
are suspended.  Also by showing the whole, which might then occupy
people's attention a little more, instead of just the pieces.
