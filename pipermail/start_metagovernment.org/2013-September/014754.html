</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very much in agreement with Daniel that we should *not* want to get
</I>&gt;<i> rid of informal discussion, or even to try very hard to clean it up. Our
</I>&gt;<i> informal discussions (in which anything goes, the emails frequently run to
</I>&gt;<i> enormous size, and there is no such thing as &quot;off-topic&quot;) really are the
</I>&gt;<i> center of the life of the community, and the &quot;soil&quot; that progress springs
</I>&gt;<i> from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i agree.


An informal discussion is primarily of value to the active participants in
&gt;<i> the discussion (not to spectators), and its value to participants lies
</I>&gt;<i> generally in the interactive process itself, not in the &quot;footprints&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (emails, etc.) that the process leaves behind as it moves along. (Those
</I>&gt;<i> footprints are like week-old newspapers -- of interest only to historians.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i agree.


What we lack are not tools and methods to tame and order and summarize and
&gt;<i> index and mirror our informal discussions, but (as Daniel suggests) &quot;a
</I>&gt;<i> model for transitioning from INFORMAL to FORMAL (be it ideas, statements,
</I>&gt;<i> arguments, decisions, action plans, etc.)&quot;, and the tools and practices to
</I>&gt;<i> implement that model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i agree.
I propose a mechanism to transition content from the informal
discussion (*=message
stream*) to a formal model/tool/.. (*=static pages*) and be able to link it
back into the informal discussion, thus, into the message stream.



&gt;<i> Definition: An &quot;authentic&quot; proposal is a clearly articulated proposal that
</I>&gt;<i> has someone's &quot;I/we want this to happen&quot; energy behind it. Such proposals
</I>&gt;<i> are (I suggest) the proper focus of our efforts to formalize. Making
</I>&gt;<i> decisions and taking action with respect to such proposals is where &quot;the
</I>&gt;<i> rubber meets the road&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sometimes i feel, that s simple &quot;definition&quot; of something that we as a
community agree upon is worth to stick on a static page. Even if it's only
a definition that you and me agree on, its worth to stick with us. It's
even worth if its only a definition i, myself, agree to stick to, so that i
can more clearly interact with my future self and use consistent language.
So i would like to publish a &quot;text&quot; (may it be a definition, a proposal, a
question or whatever). I want it to be possible to either create this
&quot;text&quot; and put it on my *personal static page*
or if i informally discuss on the mailingist (*=message stream*) and
something comes along that enlightens me, i want to make it stick on my
&quot;personal static page&quot;.
I want other to follow my personal static pages and all changes that occur
and if they want, they shall be allowed to copy those &quot;texts&quot; they like
(e.g. proposals) and put them on THEIR personal static page too.
If an identical text is put on multiple personal static pages, then its
possible to count how many &quot;followers&quot; a &quot;text&quot; has :-)



What I attempted in the &quot;Metagovernment Bylaws&quot; thread (in the email before
&gt;<i> the email that Ed complained about) was to effect one form of transition
</I>&gt;<i> from informal to formal by *extracting* more or less clearly stated
</I>&gt;<i> proposals from the foregoing chaotic informal discussion of the thread. The
</I>&gt;<i> intention was that those proposals would then be separated out and dealt
</I>&gt;<i> with individually and more formally, using the various tools that we have
</I>&gt;<i> available, such as AllAngles and Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can we make that more interesting?
For example, everyone only extracts what he thinks is &quot;awesome&quot; and
publishes it to his personal static profile page and refines it.
I would like to sure other peoples static pages and look what they find
interesting and steal the cool stuff from them and put it on my static page
too.
If someone has a similar text that i have, i might even be willing to write
him a message, trying to convince him that we should make minor adjustments
to our texts so that they end up being identical. The motivation behind
this is, that the system can then count our specific text to be a text,
that not only i am behind, but 2 people are behind it already. Maybe in the
future there will be 5 or 10 or 100 people that each have one identical
text on their &quot;personal static page&quot;.



Someone (such as Ed) who is pressed for time and wants to see only &quot;the
&gt;<i> good stuff&quot; should be able to choose to concentrate on reviewing only the
</I>&gt;<i> *proposals* that are on the table and in process, and should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> choose to skip having to wade through the informal discussions (the
</I>&gt;<i> week-old newspapers) to see whether there is anything of interest in them.
</I>

What i described above will just do it.
He could subscribe to &quot;texts&quot; he likes, he could subscribe to people which
have lots of &quot;texts&quot; he likes or he could just use some kind of &quot;static
pages crawler&quot; to inform him about texts that have many &quot;followers&quot;. If a
new text pops up that has many followers or if a text pops into existance
which gains lots of followers fast, then he might be informed about that :-)



&gt;<i> This is the difference between walking through the rainforest versus
</I>&gt;<i> examining the baskets of items that have been harvested from the rainforest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes.




&gt;<i> We have the informal discussions at this point, but we have nothing else
</I>&gt;<i> (that we actually use). When formal proposals are made in emails, they are
</I>&gt;<i> immediately sucked back into the chaos of informal discussion.
</I>

Yes. Thats why i feel the strong need to have a mechanism that makes it
very very very easy to extract something of &quot;value&quot; from the never ending
stream of messages and save it for myself on my personal static page.
Others might do the same or they might subscribe to my personal static page
to see what kind of changes occur and copy them too if they want.
Then there need be a second mechanism to link those texts on static
personal pages back into the message stream (informal discussion).

I have a feeling, that the informal discussion will be much more focused,
if its possible to link texts from personal static pages back into the
discussion, because if thats possible, then every &quot;solved issue&quot; in the
informal discussion process might lead to changes in texts on personal
static pages towards consensus.
The nice thing is, that progress will be visible from then on.
You dont have to guess what others might think or what their positions are,
you just visit their personal pages and target exactly what they have put
on their page to try to find some kind of compromise or consensus or
whatever.
All participants of a discussion will win, if they manage to get consensus,
because then, their &quot;proposals&quot; will have more followers then before, what
makes them stand above others who dont have supporters yet and do not care
or only fight for themselves. :-)




&gt;<i> When formal proposals are made in wiki pages, there are no processes that
</I>&gt;<i> lead to decision and action, so that the proposals just sit there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Thats why its vital to make it easy to not only one-click-copy it from
discussions to personal static pages, but also to
autocomplete-search-link-it-back into the discussion.
If its easy enough, people will do it all the time, because they will
follow the way of least resistance :-)
Discussion could then be more focused.
If two or more participants both put the same text on their pages (or copy
from each other), then that text has 2 supporters already.
If two or more participants agree upon something and merge their different
texts into one and copy that new text to their pages, then that text will
have multiple supporters.
A weekly summary or a community page can give a ranking of all texts and
the amount of followers it has.
Thats a good motivation to keep discussion going and the goal is to reach
consensus on all kind of texts (may it be questions, statistical data,
definitions, values, proposals, whatever text it might be....)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, we have the 28 proposals that were in the email that Ed complained
</I>&gt;<i> about, we have the Blinap proposals above, and we have dozens (hundreds!)
</I>&gt;<i> of incipient proposals buried throughout our past informal discussions on
</I>&gt;<i> the list. With respect to all of those proposals, how shall we transition
</I>&gt;<i> from informal to formal? How shall we process those proposals, and reach
</I>&gt;<i> decisions with respect to them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

1. Make it possible to create &quot;texts&quot; on users personal static pages (e.g.
wiki page)
2. Make it possible to copy &quot;texts&quot; to my personal static page with the
click of a button
3. Make it possible to use autocompletion search to link texts from my
personal static page back into the discussion
4. Allow others to subscribe to changes on the texts of my personal static
page or even changes to anything on my personal static page
5. Have a &quot;personal static page crawler&quot; which constantly updates a
community page with all texts that exist and the amount of followers they
have and post it to the informal discussion from time to time.


I think thats a good start. Do not formalize it more than that. I think
this proposal will already bring a lot of value to us and if we use it for
some time, we will find out what kind of problems will occur and what
additional features we might need.
