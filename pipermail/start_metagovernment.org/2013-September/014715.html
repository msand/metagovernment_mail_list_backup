Well, that's pretty much my point. A proposal that occurs after inline responses to 28 other proposals is a little difficult to notice. Could you perhaps present it as a standalone thread? Or perhaps present it on the wiki with an email pointing to it? Or perhaps this would be a good topic of discussion for Mike's No7 thread? I'm open to suggestion.

And apologies if you have already re-posted it and I didn't notice; I continue to struggle with the volume of messages, the size of the messages, the multiple threads, and my own sparse time. This is in itself an incredibly crucial issue. Good decision-making can't be done in sound-bytes -- but also, it can't be inclusive when it is overwhelming. I think unwinding this problem is key to our progress.

Can this be done manually for now? The wiki has served well as a focal point / summary of complex discussions. Can't we just manually work on summaries of complex threads there, so others can orient themselves quickly to the discussion, regardless of where it has moved?
