<PRE>Greetings Pete

I'm a serial lurker on the project. I dip in and out when something 
triggers my attention as your post just did.

I can tell from your brief description that you and I would probably 
agree about the purpose of this project (to save humanity from itself) 
and I suspect I would strongly agree with the content of the books. I 
personally spend quite a lot of time writing about how capitalism has 
passed its sell by date.

Nevertheless, you're wrong! You're making the mistake of trying to 
preconfigure the debate we need to have in the terms you prefer. It 
would be just as wrong, for example, to start from the position that 
Religion is a major cause of all our conflicts (which I strongly 
believe) and thus to conclude that our democratic model must start from 
the position that Religion needs to be eliminated (which I also 
believe). All such an approach ensures is that none of those who wish to 
retain the status quo regarding Religion (or Capitalism as per your own 
recommendations) will engage in any of our debates and that would get us 
precisely nowhere.

In fact the greatest challenge for this project (which we haven't even 
begun to address yet) is how we'll cajole people who have no 
understanding of, and often considerable hostility towards democracy, to 
even consider participation in it.

The purpose of THIS project is NOT to figure out HOW to save the world. 
It's to figure out how we can collectively DECIDE how to save the world 
and that is a fundamental difference.

You and I and millions of others have millions of brilliant and not so 
brilliant ideas about what needs to be done. What the species has 
spectacularly failed (to date) to achieve is a sensible way we can all 
agree on about how to conduct the necessary debates, how to weight the 
relevant arguments; when and whether to vote on propositions, key 
developments in the debate and conclusions; what level of compliance is 
implied by various propositions and when and whether coercion is ever 
necessary or justifiable to achieve such compliance. We need to consider 
how to define &quot;watch-warning&quot; algorithms that monitor whether either 
disasters or positive outcomes predicted within the debate are actually 
happening so we can adjust parameters or revisit the issues as the world 
moves forward. And so on and so on...

In other words, however passionate we may be about our particular 
proposed cures for the world's ills, we're not interested, in this 
context, about what the solutions may or may not be. They're matters for 
the actual decision making process once we've figured out how to conduct 
it...

</I>&gt;<i> A long-time lurker, I am moved now to make a proposal to this group,
</I>&gt;<i> the active members of which I thank for their commitment and
</I>&gt;<i> perseverance in addressing the important issue of governance, even if
</I>&gt;<i> at times the discussion here gets mired in intricate abstractions.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be brief.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My (radical) proposal starts with some assumptions, so if these are
</I>&gt;<i> wrong, then it'll probably go nowhere, but I hope you can agree that
</I>&gt;<i> the subject is an important one, even if this turns out not be the
</I>&gt;<i> right venue for it. So here goes&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why are we here on this list? I assume [1] it's because we want to
</I>&gt;<i> examine governance itself in a radical way (i.e. starting at the
</I>&gt;<i> roots) and to develop new forms.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond that, what's the purpose of trying to find new forms of
</I>&gt;<i> governance? I assume [2] that we want to save the Earth and promote
</I>&gt;<i> human well-being, both threatened by the current capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> world-system, and believe this is impossible to achieve without new
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of governance to replace the corrupted forms which support the
</I>&gt;<i> present ecocidal and exploitative system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But beyond even that, what could such new forms of governance
</I>&gt;<i> achieve&#160;if successful? Would full and direct participatory
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making (for example) be sufficient by itself to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> ecological sustainability and avert collapse? I assume [3] it would
</I>&gt;<i> not, and that there also needs to be a new and rigorous guiding
</I>&gt;<i> framework for the use and allocation of resources to meet human needs
</I>&gt;<i> sustainably, i.e. a new economic logic to replace capitalism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly, I assume [4] that a rational appraisal of our present
</I>&gt;<i> predicament reveals the certainty, accelerating approach and probable
</I>&gt;<i> imminence of global collapse, and hence the urgency of the task at
</I>&gt;<i> hand and the awesome responsibility which falls upon the shoulders of
</I>&gt;<i> the able and willing of the present generation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you follow my assumptions, then I urge you to take the time to read
</I>&gt;<i> these two vital books&#160;by Frank Rotering, outlining the economic and
</I>&gt;<i> political approach needed to achieve these purposes, which forms the
</I>&gt;<i> basis of my proposal to this group. Both books are free to download in
</I>&gt;<i> pdf at the website needandlimits.org [1]:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Contractionary Revolution [2]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Economics of Needs and Limits [3]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSAL:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* That this group recognizes that the&#160;main&#160;purpose of governance is
</I>&gt;<i> to ensure&#160;sustainable well-being for all, such purpose providing a
</I>&gt;<i> non-negotiable framework for&#160;economic guidance which must necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> inform and constrain&#160;any particular form of governance adopted to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it.
</I>&gt;<i>  	* That this group broadly adopts the analysis and strategy outlined
</I>&gt;<i> in the books mentioned, as the most effective approach yet conceived
</I>&gt;<i> of to understand and deal with the present global predicament and to
</I>&gt;<i> guide future economic relations toward sustainable well-being.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	* That this group's purpose therefore be directed to the
</I>&gt;<i> revolutionary project outlined therein, and specifically to creating
</I>&gt;<i> forms of governance suitable to this approach, before, during and
</I>&gt;<i> after the necessary period of transition to a post-capitalist system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I realize that this all stated very baldly and may be regarded as an
</I>&gt;<i> impertinent intrusion into your ongoing discussions&#8212;not to mention
</I>&gt;<i> the improbability of any of you actually reading the books mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> to inform your responses&#8212;but I feel the uniqueness and urgency of
</I>&gt;<i> the present predicament makes unusual demands of us all, and I respect
</I>&gt;<i> the seriousness with the folks here approach the olympian task you
</I>&gt;<i> have assumed, or I wouldn't ask.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? I welcome amendments, counter-proposals, personal
</I>&gt;<i> messages, whatever.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
