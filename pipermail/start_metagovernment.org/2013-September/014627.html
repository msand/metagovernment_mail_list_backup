Yes, there's no reason not to put it there. I think it would also be great if you had a moment to update the list on Vilfrdo's rcent progress as well.

Yes, please do add it! I had put in a subhead entitled &quot;Platform expansion&quot; but would prefer you wrote the content. If it gets too involved, you could write just a summary on this page, and make another page which goes into the full details. That would help a lot for when anyone wants to reference it, instead of having to dig through multiple emails.

I love the idea, though I'd also like to have a better idea of what is considered the work of this group. Maybe that's an irrelevant distinction since we're an open group, but many projects are coordinated, thought-through, etc. here and it would be great to keep an eye on what those are. Perhaps your suggestion is more of an expansion on the first item on the linked page: updating the list of related projects. So it's not just about what the projects are, but also what they are doing?

</I>&gt;<i> there was also a &quot;forgot password&quot; mechanism and then of course a &quot;user profil&quot; site, where a user could change all those settings...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, i guess it's not that hard to use javascript/nodejs to host a website that allows users to create ne mailing lists.
</I>&gt;<i> The hard thing will then be, how to structure the discussion content by adding additional html/css to the email and if possible maybe even javascript.
