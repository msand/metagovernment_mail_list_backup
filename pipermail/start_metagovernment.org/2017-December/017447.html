<PRE>Hi Scott,

Thanks for responding again. 

I just visited proxyfor.me after your suggestion to Ed. I&#8217;ve been out of the [MG] loop for a while and didn&#8217;t know you had put this out. I read a lot of your material on Matchism a while back but I guess it didn&#8217;t all sink in. I do remember feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all. 

I think proxyfor.me &lt;<A HREF="http://proxyfor.me/">http://proxyfor.me/</A>&gt; conveys the essence of your model in a more succinct and understandable manner. Very interesting. I&#8217;m looking forward to digging in a little deeper. It will likely take a while for me to fully grok it, but in the meantime, I have some more questions. My apologies if you&#8217;ve been over this already.

- Given the # of statements in the questionnaire, how many different personality types or proxy iterations could be generated? I'm asking this because that would to some degree, it seems, determine how many proxies would be required for any given population of voters. (This is assuming every voter would be matched identically to a proxy of the same result.) And I&#8217;m curious about the degree of finesse pf.m would provide. E.g., would it know that I like a coconut chai latte with a dusting of cinnamon and cocoa? :)

- What is the incentive for proxies, and what are the requirements? How would we know they actually thoroughly research and understand any given proposal before voting on it...for us?  And is there some redundancy built in? (I had a difficult time navigating back to the page where you talked about proxies.) 

- How would this platform scale? Would there be multiple independent iterations (or instances) and, if so, based on what? E.g., would there be one for global proposals, a multitude of them for regional bodies, and so on? Or would there be just one platform that would manage votes and proposals based on location, or some other template for constituency?

- Who can present a proposal?

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more questions after I play around and ponder it all for a bit. Great work!

Steve

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m coming at it from a very different angle Scott. I think the only way for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process* of our governance systems. To do this well (imo) we'll need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leverage the active creativity and ingenuity of as many people as we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technologically accommodate&#8230;millions, if not hundreds of millions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ordinary citizens.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All agreed!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would be a lot of deliberation and decision-making.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You went into the weeds here: What evidence do you have that &quot;a lot&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> of either of these things is required? The problem with our existing
</I>&gt;<i> governments has absolutely nothing to do with the *number* of
</I>&gt;<i> decisions being made, merely that the *wrong* decisions are being
</I>&gt;<i> made. 99.99% of the public policy decisions that need to be made could
</I>&gt;<i> probably be made by a true benevolent dictator as long as we retain
</I>&gt;<i> the 0.01% ability to remove or override him (thereby ensuring the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;benevolent&quot; part). Your proposal to burden millions or billions of
</I>&gt;<i> people with an obligation that they don't want and are probably
</I>&gt;<i> incapable of meeting seems to me not only an example of incompetent
</I>&gt;<i> social engineering, but just kind of heartless in addition...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, regardless of how incompetent you think *regular* people may be, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would want to be a part of the process; including choosing my own proxy. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly you aren't. But 88% of the German population apparently
</I>&gt;<i> wanted Hitler to be dictator in 1934 and so voted for that and by your
</I>&gt;<i> logic that worked out exactly as it should have. I'll admit that
</I>&gt;<i> getting people to accept their incompetence and act rationally in
</I>&gt;<i> response is an extremely difficult thing to do, but unfortunately it's
</I>&gt;<i> going to be required as part of the reform process. I'd like to start
</I>&gt;<i> with you: What is *your* justification for continuing to insist on
</I>&gt;<i> something that has clearly been shown to be based on a false belief?
</I>&gt;<i> To ensure that you've actually provided one, please note that you need
</I>&gt;<i> to deal with both the Hitler example and the lack of correlation in
</I>&gt;<i> delegate voting that was reported in the LQFB system in Kling
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, and exactly what proxyfor.me does, and does automatically,
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically reducing the incidence of human error in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Surely availability of good information is a necessary requirement for
</I>&gt;<i> good decisionmaking. But what does that have to do with proxies? Why
</I>&gt;<i> can't the information be provided (and judged) by people who aren't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily likely to vote like you would? Certainly vastly reduces
</I>&gt;<i> the number of people required to run the system: Imagine if every
</I>&gt;<i> cluster in the 5-dimensional FFM space needed their own investigators:
</I>&gt;<i> You'd increase the number of &quot;journalists&quot; required by orders of
</I>&gt;<i> magnitude, and for no good reason.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, citizens would just push their *proxy* button and all would be well?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They could go back to watching Reality TV?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, except that they don't even have to push a button (proxy matching
</I>&gt;<i> is opt-out, not opt-in). And I don't get the sarcasm: You say that
</I>&gt;<i> like it's some sort of problem. Or are you a follower of Ed's
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy: The people that decided to watch Reality TV didn't
</I>&gt;<i> participate and so their preferences not only *can* be ignored, but
</I>&gt;<i> indeed must be.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words, we can&#8217;t trust the individual to choose for themselves, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> educate themselves about a situation, or a candidate, or to know what they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want in terms of say, transportation infrastructure, educational systems, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regarding policy for prison systems?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, merely that we can't *expect* them to do this. I believe that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone is capable of doing these things, which are much simpler
</I>&gt;<i> problems than choosing appropriate proxies, but also that it's
</I>&gt;<i> delusional (incompetent social engineering) to design a system that
</I>&gt;<i> *requires* all them to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a non-starter: People are not competent to choose their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proxies/representatives/delegates, something that has been clearly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> demonstrated by the failure of misrepresentative democracies in general,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to implement anything even vaguely resembling &quot;The Willl of the People&#8221;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would say that&#8217;s an absurd generalization if it weren&#8217;t such a cynical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one. I&#8217;m curious, would you include yourself in that characterization?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely. A man's got to know his limitations. See above: Do you
</I>&gt;<i> know yours? Or are you one of the above average drivers? (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there any decision *We the People* are capable of making for ourselves in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this regard? Like maybe whether or not to adopt Matchism?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately for the world-view of extremists, the world is not black
</I>&gt;<i> and white: Just because you're incompetent at choosing proxies doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily mean that you're incompetent at making every other
</I>&gt;<i> decision that affects you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hmmmm&#8230;.I think you&#8217;ve been watching to too much Stefan Molyneux.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, hadn't heard of him, actually. But a little research clearly
</I>&gt;<i> shows that he's like Ed (and indeed like most other extremists on both
</I>&gt;<i> the right *and* the left): They're not interested in building a
</I>&gt;<i> democratic or egalitarian society, or indeed even one that works, but
</I>&gt;<i> merely one where the &quot;right people&quot; get to make the decisions. The
</I>&gt;<i> flaw with their proposals is their failure to recognize that it's the
</I>&gt;<i> inequality in participation rates that's our main problem, and that it
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with the process the &quot;right people&quot; (the active
</I>&gt;<i> participants) use to come to a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
