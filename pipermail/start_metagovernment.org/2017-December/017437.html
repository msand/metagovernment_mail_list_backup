<PRE>Hi, Steve.

This is something like what I had originally envisioned for this project: that we would have governance systems for each natural unit of humanity. The two easiest units to define are civilization centers (metro areas, small cities, towns, etc.) and ecoregions: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion</A>&gt; That&#8217;s one layer for where people aggregate and another layer for regional natural environments.

However, the group had a better idea, which was to not try to cram governance systems into pre-defined categories. Instead, they could be organic: a governance system applies to any group of people trying to make a decision together.

If a company wants permission to build a nuclear reactor in a community; the decision should be made by a consensus of the local community, the power company and its shareholders, the people in the surrounding climates who may be affected by it, and anyone else in the world who has a concern about it one way or another. There&#8217;s no good reason to restrict a decision like that to only the people of one local community (who, for example, can be bought off).

In an open system where any interested party can participate, things only happen when all those people reach the best decision together. The nuclear power company can&#8217;t bully itself into a community; but it can work with everyone who has a concern and find a great way to build their facility that everyone&#8217;s happy with. It may take longer, but the result will be worth the wait.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Scott, et al,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any decentralized online governance system that provides access to local, regional, international and global referendums will likely have more proposals scheduled for deliberation and a vote, at any given time, than any individual or small group of individuals could rationally and practically respond to in a timely and reliable manner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy. Personally, I don&#8217;t yet see a problem with this...but I&#8217;m wondering how others might imagine this playing out.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of involvement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One might employ a proxy for local issues (with perhaps a backup should their first choice be unavailable) and several more for regional (environmental, political, scientific, social, technological, etc) issues and concerns. Ones proxy choice for environmental issues may be unconcerned with educational issues, or be so involved in the environmental arena that they just don&#8217;t have time to track anything else in a reasonable or acceptable manner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts?
