<PRE>Ok, so let me see how far along I am in understanding your proposal Scott.

Your basic objective is to develop and implement a system (or platform) that provides *the electorate* with an ability to attain full, representative participation, in virtually any jurisdiction or locale, by providing a means of selecting proxies for individuals who are unwilling or unable, for whatever reason, to make governance related decisions for themselves. 

Proxy selection would be based on an algorithm that determines an individual&#8217;s personal characteristics or *value traits* though testing or some other artificially intelligent mechanism. Proxy selection would be mandatory and automatic, but could be overridden by the individual at each voting instant by simply changing their proxy&#8217;s vote to one more befitting their individual preference. 

The proxy/voter association would be reconfigured weekly and the platform would provide some degree of redundancy in order to more accurately secure a homogenous representation between the individual and their proxy(ies) in the voting process.

Anyone can submit a proposal, but all submissions will be reviewed, or vetted, by some central authority for their compliance with some set of rational prerequisites before allowing them to move into deliberation, and then on to a vote.

Once proposals are reviewed and deemed to be appropriately constructed, all individuals potentially affected by the proposal, should it pass, would be notified of the impeding vote in time for them to fully research it before it goes to a weekend vote. You&#8217;ve calculated that there would likely be an average of one or two votes to consider each week&#8230;(for each region, instance, or locale?).

Pf.m would create a quorum nearing 100% which, if it accurately predicts *value/voting* similarities between citizens and their proxies, would yield a very reliable and representative democracy.

I&#8217;m guessing it's a fairly crude, nutshell apprehension of your proposal&#8230;.but I thought I better start there. 

Also, I have a another question for you: What (or who) determines the % of votes necessary for passage of any given proposal?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just visited proxyfor.me after your suggestion to Ed. I&#8217;ve been out of the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your material on Matchism a while back but I guess it didn&#8217;t all sink in. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do remember feeling a bit overwhelmed with it all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A nearly universal reaction. Simplifying and/or extracting out parts

</I>&gt;<i> far) to that is to create an Executive Summary, which I still kind of
</I>&gt;<i> believe was a mistake because unless you read far enough to understand
</I>&gt;<i> the history and motivations the Executive Summary I think it maybe
</I>&gt;<i> sounds kind of crackpot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my defense, though, I note that if you ask a million people if
</I>&gt;<i> they've read the foundational documents of our civilizations (the
</I>&gt;<i> Bible, the Federalist Papers, Mein Kampf, the Communist Manifesto,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) you'll find maybe a handful who has read even one in its
</I>&gt;<i> entirety, and probably zero who has read all of them (present company
</I>&gt;<i> excluded, of course). Social Engineering is hard work and IMHO not
</I>&gt;<i> something armchair dabblers are going to be any good at. But we got
</I>&gt;<i> where we are without most people knowing this stuff, so it's not
</I>&gt;<i> discouraging to me that they won't have read the design documents for
</I>&gt;<i> the next system either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think proxyfor.me conveys the essence of your model in a more succinct and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understandable manner. Very interesting. I&#8217;m looking forward to digging in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little deeper. It will likely take a while for me to fully grok it, but in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the meantime, I have some more questions. My apologies if you&#8217;ve been over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No problem. Note that proxyfor.me is up, but that the weekly automatic
</I>&gt;<i> advancement has been turned off so you won't get the full experience
</I>&gt;<i> now (in particular you won't get the emails telling you what your
</I>&gt;<i> calculated and the recorded votes were). After I finish the next round
</I>&gt;<i> of upgrades and put together a real marketing plan I'll turn it back
</I>&gt;<i> on, but that's looking to be at least a few months off. I've also got
</I>&gt;<i> to build a budgeting system (which is mostly designed), but that'll
</I>&gt;<i> have to wait until the version after.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Given the # of statements in the questionnaire, how many different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personality types or proxy iterations could be generated?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 13,348,388,671,875 (i.e. 75^7). But that doesn't consider correlations
</I>&gt;<i> between items. But it's important to keep in mind that there are no
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;types&quot; (a term that makes psychologists cringe, eg. read the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;criticism&quot; section of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> because all of these traits are continuous dimensions. Your matched
</I>&gt;<i> proxies come from a 75 dimensional space that of course no human can
</I>&gt;<i> even hope to conceive of, let alone function in. And yet the math is
</I>&gt;<i> actually quite simple (a few dozen lines of code that any competent
</I>&gt;<i> programmer could easily verify the operation of).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm asking this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because that would to some degree, it seems, determine how many proxies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be required for any given population of voters. (This is assuming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every voter would be matched identically to a proxy of the same result.) And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m curious about the degree of finesse pf.m would provide. E.g., would it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know that I like a coconut chai latte with a dusting of cinnamon and cocoa?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All I have is my bot data so far (and they don't drink ;-) but the
</I>&gt;<i> number of proxies necessary to get pretty good matches was
</I>&gt;<i> surprisingly small: Diminishing returns sets in big time once you get
</I>&gt;<i> up to a few thousand direct votes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As to correlations between these dimensions and how you act (or indeed
</I>&gt;<i> even what you look like) in &quot;meat world&quot;, that whole field is just in
</I>&gt;<i> its infancy. But there are some tantalizing hints that we could indeed
</I>&gt;<i> predict many of these things. A good example of this is the
</I>&gt;<i> correlation between body type and political orientation:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236740731_The_Ancestral_Logic_of_Politics">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236740731_The_Ancestral_Logic_of_Politics</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's similar data having to do with facial characteristics and who
</I>&gt;<i> gets elected in misrepresentative democracies. The thing to keep in
</I>&gt;<i> mind is that the operation of the system is independent of the exact
</I>&gt;<i> set of criteria used to do the matching. It may turn out that it's
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient to ask people what their favorite drink is, or even just
</I>&gt;<i> have a picture of their face, to find appropriate proxies for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - What is the incentive for proxies, and what are the requirements?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping a desire for &quot;good government&quot; is a sufficient motivator.
</I>&gt;<i> There are no requirements for casting a direct vote and at this point
</I>&gt;<i> am unsure whether we'll need to encourage or discourage certain kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of people from doing so. That's a bridge we'll have to cross if/when
</I>&gt;<i> we come to it. For example, my prediction is that we'll have no
</I>&gt;<i> trouble getting enough conservatives voting because the studies have
</I>&gt;<i> all shown that they are *much* more likely to participate in our
</I>&gt;<i> existing systems (yet another problem with Ed's &quot;The people who care
</I>&gt;<i> should participate&quot; philosophy, which to me just means that
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians run the world, as they largely do now). But getting
</I>&gt;<i> enough low-conscientiousness individuals to vote could very well turn
</I>&gt;<i> out to be a problem that we'll need to address by offering them some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of incentive (if only doing something like telling them in
</I>&gt;<i> advance that if they cast a direct vote it will be multiplied by
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds or thousands because so few other people in their particular
</I>&gt;<i> region of the 75-dimensional space will do so).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would we know they actually thoroughly research and understand any given
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal before voting on it...for us?  And is there some redundancy built
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in? (I had a difficult time navigating back to the page where you talked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about proxies.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You don't know that they didn't just make a snap judgement or just
</I>&gt;<i> voted like Steve Bannon told them to. But you do have access to their
</I>&gt;<i> posts and cites and so can probably fairly easily identify and block
</I>&gt;<i> the crackpots and those trying to game the system. And there are (at
</I>&gt;<i> least currently) 5 proxy matches calculated for each proxy vote, which
</I>&gt;<i> is at least somewhat resistant to corruption by outliers. After the
</I>&gt;<i> system has been running for awhile my prediction (and hope) is that
</I>&gt;<i> people will start to recognize the people most commonly matched to
</I>&gt;<i> them and learn to trust them. That'll give people a feeling that they
</I>&gt;<i> have &quot;chosen&quot; their proxies (a perception you in particular seemed to
</I>&gt;<i> desire), when in fact all they've really done is chosen not to reject
</I>&gt;<i> them. Where we decide to take that WRT social-media in general also
</I>&gt;<i> remains to be decided (e.g., Do we provide a button that will
</I>&gt;<i> friend/follow a matched proxy on FB or Twitter? What happens when
</I>&gt;<i> someone does a cluster analysis and decides to form a political party,
</I>&gt;<i> or even just a social organization, based on having identified a
</I>&gt;<i> cohesive &quot;group&quot;?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - How would this platform scale? Would there be multiple independent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> iterations (or instances) and, if so, based on what? E.g., would there be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one for global proposals, a multitude of them for regional bodies, and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on? Or would there be just one platform that would manage votes and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals based on location, or some other template for constituency?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From an engineering sense it'll be straightforward to scale to
</I>&gt;<i> billions of people: It's built on MongoDB and AWS which have pretty
</I>&gt;<i> amazing distributed processing features (multiple servers all over the
</I>&gt;<i> world, with high reliability and failover capabilities, all built for
</I>&gt;<i> e-commerce). And it's easily portable to any other cloud platform for
</I>&gt;<i> when we decide that it's not really a good idea to be completely
</I>&gt;<i> dependent on Amazon for servers. But the design pretty much requires
</I>&gt;<i> centralization (albeit distributed centralization).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How the regional/local boundaries are drawn I think is hard to predict
</I>&gt;<i> at this point. Certainly the &quot;global&quot; scale is the most important and
</I>&gt;<i> all I've built so far. Overlapping jurisdictions (county/state/region)
</I>&gt;<i> are a real PITA, both from an implementation and social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> perspective and if I could just wave my magic wand I'd get rid of them
</I>&gt;<i> (vast amounts of government resources are simply wasted dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> interjurisdictional redundancy and conflict), but I fear we're going
</I>&gt;<i> to have to develop some sort of architecture for dealing with it...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Who can present a proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone, but it has to go through the executive branch (which at this
</I>&gt;<i> point is me ;-) Quality of content is going to be key at all stages of
</I>&gt;<i> the adoption process: Equally bad are the kind of wacko proposals I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen on LQFB and other public-facing decisionmaking systems and the
</I>&gt;<i> legal mumbo-jumbo you see in the average bill posed at the state and
</I>&gt;<i> federal levels. The executive should have no incentive to restrict
</I>&gt;<i> anyone proposing anything other than ensuring that it's both
</I>&gt;<i> intelligible and legally defensible (which unfortunately rules out
</I>&gt;<i> probably 95% of what we see in existing systems).  If there's
</I>&gt;<i> something you'd like to see, by all means send it in. Otherwise  I've
</I>&gt;<i> got a queue of several dozen more proposals that need to be polished
</I>&gt;<i> up and put into the queue if you lack for something to do ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have more questions after I play around and ponder it all for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a bit. Great work!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks: I look forward to getting your report.
