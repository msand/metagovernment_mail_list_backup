I don&#8217;t think I'm getting this. Do you mean that the more I use the platform the more likely I&#8217;ll have a good proxy match because it uses my voting history, in addition to my MMPI test result, to select a proxy for me???

&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone can submit a proposal, but all submissions will be reviewed, or vetted, by some central authority for their compliance with some set of rational prerequisites before allowing them to move into deliberation, and then on to a vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Correct, and I was assuming the gatekeeper would be the executive

</I>&gt;<i> be one of the proposals in the queue. If that one passes the next in
</I>&gt;<i> line would automatically assume the role of Manager, the line of
</I>&gt;<i> succession being defined ahead of time (e.g., the global manager line
</I>&gt;<i> of succession would be based on some objective assessment criteria
</I>&gt;<i> applied to all of the locality managers).
</I>
I like this. 

The system or platform I&#8217;m working on has a crowdsourced, ranked choice *Priority Stack* that would inform the &#8220;executive council&quot; to assist them in managing the position of proposals in the queue. Not the only criteria...but useful information.


&gt;&gt;<i> Once proposals are reviewed and deemed to be appropriately constructed, all individuals potentially affected by the proposal, should it pass, would be notified of the impeding vote in time for them to fully research it before it goes to a weekend vote. You&#8217;ve calculated that there would likely be an average of one or two votes to consider each week&#8230;(for each region, instance, or locale?).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right. Again, the number proposals voted on in a given week and how
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal queues are presented and sorted remains to be determined,
</I>&gt;<i> based in large part on how many overlapping jurisdictions the system
</I>&gt;<i> needs to support.
</I>
Seems to me it would be incumbent on the individual(s) developing the proposal to list the jurisdictions their proposal would impact&#8230;.and then the agency vetting the proposal would certify the accuracy of their delineation. I think the deliberation or *public discourse* phase would also be check on the accuracy of the proposals stated influence. Tricky business nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;<i> What (or who) determines the % of votes necessary for passage of any given proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I just have it set at 50% + 1 now, but my prediction is that it won't
</I>&gt;<i> matter in the long run because proposals will pass by such large
</I>&gt;<i> supermajorities that no one will even bother to ask if we need to
</I>&gt;<i> impose a higher standard. There are two features that will ensure
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The proposal queue(s) are sorted by the ratio of yes to no votes,
</I>&gt;<i> so those with the highest approval ratings will get voted on first.
</I>
So there would be some mechanism for determining 'popularity' before an actual *official* vote?  

In my mind, the related comments (for and against) would be ranked in terms of popularity (a thumbs up/thumbs down kind of thing). This would be data for those introducing the proposal as well as for the executive council to determine the *ripeness* of the proposal for a vote.

&gt;<i> 2) The system supports versioning which will enable the proposer to
</I>&gt;<i> tweak a proposal to address criticism and hopefully boost its approval
</I>&gt;<i> rating. 
</I>
This seems crucial as a type of crowdsourcing feedback loop.

&gt;<i>  I would expect (and hope) these &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> engineers&quot; to become the &quot;rock stars&quot; of the new system because they
</I>&gt;<i> will actually have power on the same level as the Managers&#8230;.
</I>
I agree. I think designing kickass proposals and projects for better systems of human *livingry* (as Bucky called it) will be the new groovy.

Rock on rock star.  :)
