You're evading the question.

&gt;<i> A global platform with several million, or possibly several hundred million
</I>&gt;<i> users would need extensive, qualified oversight.
</I>
So this is some sort of &quot;two heads are better than one&quot; appeal? How
many corporations work this way, where a CEO hires 5 or 7 people to
run a department? Nothing would ever get done...

&gt;<i> It would mean management, for sure. But other than maybe county
</I>&gt;<i> governments (and the aforementioned juntas and politburos) what other
</I>&gt;<i> organization even has an &quot;executive council&quot;? And you can't count
</I>&gt;<i> corporate boards, since their primary (and indeed in many cases sole)
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility is merely to choose the executive. Same with HOA
</I>&gt;<i> boards, though many of them do tend to micromanage the executive
</I>&gt;<i> (usually a contracted HOA management company), to basically everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> detriment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you&#8217;re conflating an elected oversight body with an installed (by
</I>&gt;<i> force) ruling body.
</I>
No, the source of their power is irrelevant. I'm concerned purely with
the mechanics of the operation of the organization. You seem to be
saying that organizations run by committees somehow function better
than those run by individuals. The research (and my own experience)
shows that this is almost never the case. Therefore the only
justification for a group-format executive branch might be where there
*is* no &quot;legislative branch&quot; to handle the high level decisionmaking
and supervision of the executive (i.e., the
council/committee/junta/politburo combines the executive and
legislative functions).

&gt;<i> I&#8217;m talking about building a Process and a Structure that can encompass the
</I>&gt;<i> Meta level as an Executive Function, in and of itself. Again, the take away
</I>&gt;<i> is that the users will always be in charge. That&#8217;s embedded in the design of
</I>&gt;<i> the Process and the Structure. If they give that up&#8230;then so be it. There is
</I>&gt;<i> no safeguard against that other that to make it as inclusive as possible
</I>&gt;<i> (large quorum) as quickly as possible&#8230;.imo.
</I>
You might have to write a book on this to explain this proposal, but
I'd start with the &quot;executive summary&quot; of how it compares with the
day-to-day operation of existing organizations.

&gt;<i> And, in my mind, people will only want to vote on proposals that have been
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly researched by real people or institutions that they can *visibly*
</I>&gt;<i> locate and easily track (read trust). I&#8217;m sure some people right from the
</I>&gt;<i> get-go would be comfortable delegating their decisions to proxies operating
</I>&gt;<i> behind a wall of algorithms run by bots. And I would bet that as time
</I>&gt;<i> passes, more and more people would be comfortable with that set up&#8230;.if they
</I>&gt;<i> found it was reliable and trustworthy.
</I>
It's an empirical question, but my sense (based on my experience on
forums and to a lesser extent on the research (e.g., Keil 2010)) is
that people can judge the quality of the argument *independent* of
knowing the individual organization that produced it, and that this is
actually an important feature in a decisionmaking system. For example
the &quot;peer review&quot; process is exactly the opposite of what you propose,
and for good reason: You don't want people making decisions based on
the status of the individual/group making a particular argument.

&gt;<i> The ultimate expression of this, again, being a single trustworthy and
</I>&gt;<i> yet easily replaceable executive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly, &quot;a single trustworthy and yet easily replaceable executive&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *Council* ..&#8230;to build, manage, facilitate, and oversee.
</I>
So you propose replacing the entire council, rather than individual
members, when it repeatedly fails to make good decisions? If not, how
do you propose to identify the malfunctioning components?

&gt;<i> The Index is a ranked stack (prioritized) list of the Collective (User&#8217;s)
</I>&gt;<i> concerns and desires for focus. Each registered User can advocate a list (10
</I>&gt;<i> maybe) of their own priorities and/or select ones already inventoried. The
</I>&gt;<i> Index is a compilation of all Users individual lists. I imagine it might
</I>&gt;<i> look something like this:
</I>
There's something like this (Goals of The People) in the Matchism
Manifesto, but I'm actually moving away from that lately. Sure, the
executive (and/or the proposal writers) will sometimes need to do
polls to assess The People's preferences and priorities, but I'm
lately thinking that this doesn't need to be a separate component of
the system as it's already going to be accounted for in the profile
data (assuming one does proxy matching) and in the output of the
budgeting process. For training and operational efficiency reasons we
should strive to eliminate &quot;bells and whistles&quot; from the design of the
decisionmaking system, especially when we're not absolutely sure
they're really needed.

    Scott
