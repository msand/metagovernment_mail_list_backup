</I>
I&#8217;m coming at it from a very different angle Scott. I think the only way for humanity to turn things around is to radically redesign the *structure and process* of our governance systems. To do this well (imo) we'll need to leverage the active creativity and ingenuity of as many people as we can technologically accommodate&#8230;millions, if not hundreds of millions of ordinary citizens. That would be a lot of deliberation and decision-making. And, regardless of how incompetent you think *regular* people may be, I would want to be a part of the process; including choosing my own proxy. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in that. 


&gt;&gt;<i> It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's what they do now: They're usually called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;representatives&quot;, even though they are not &#8220;representative&#8221;&#8230;.
</I>
I&#8217;m not talking about representative government where we elect some *politician* every few years and then in the process turn over our entire decision-making/legislative ability to this &#8220;representative&quot;. In my mind, a proxy would be a very personalized *civic device* with a lot more flexibility. One could turn it off and on at will, or fire the proxy without notice and select another more suitable option. In the system I&#8217;m imagining, proxies would be more like investigative journalists and would be required to keep their *constituents* informed of the issues under deliberation, as well as the their process for arriving at the decision they did. You could put it in the category of 'educating the electorate'. 


&gt;&gt;<i> I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of involvement.
</I>
&gt;<i> Any time you allow people to pick and choose what level or even what issue to participate in, you end up
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;Tyranny of the Active Participants&#8221;...
</I>
So, citizens would just push their *proxy* button and all would be well? They could go back to watching Reality TV? 

&gt;<i> Proxy selection must be automatic, and the proxies must not
</I>&gt;<i> be preselected by the individual or (as in the case of juries) by some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of government appointment. Otherwise all you've done is re-create
</I>&gt;<i> misrepresentative government.
</I>
In other words, we can&#8217;t trust the individual to choose for themselves, to educate themselves about a situation, or a candidate, or to know what they want in terms of say, transportation infrastructure, educational systems, or regarding policy for prison systems?


&gt;&gt;<i> One might employ a proxy for local issues (with perhaps a backup should their first choice be unavailable) and several more for regional (environmental, political, scientific, social, technological, etc) issues and concerns. Ones proxy choice for environmental issues may be unconcerned with educational issues, or be so involved in the environmental arena that they just don&#8217;t have time to track anything else in a reasonable or acceptable manner.
</I>
&gt;<i> It's a non-starter: People are not competent to choose their
</I>&gt;<i> proxies/representatives/delegates, something that has been clearly
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated by the failure of misrepresentative democracies in general,
</I>&gt;<i> to implement anything even vaguely resembling &quot;The Willl of the People&#8221;.
</I>
I would say that&#8217;s an absurd generalization if it weren&#8217;t such a cynical one. I&#8217;m curious, would you include yourself in that characterization?


&gt;<i> My point is that it's simply not necessary or even desirable that each person
</I>&gt;<i> actively participate in every decision or at every level or even to
</I>&gt;<i> have the knowledge and skill to choose a true representative.
</I>
Is there any decision *We the People* are capable of making for ourselves in this regard? Like maybe whether or not to adopt Matchism?


&gt;<i> All we have to do is to make sure that the ultimate vote cast for each person
</I>&gt;<i> is the same as what they would have cast if they *did* actively
</I>&gt;<i> participate in each decision. Fortunately this is a *much* simpler
</I>&gt;<i> problem to solve than to try to somehow make sure that the active
</I>&gt;<i> participants are actually representative of The People.
</I>
Hmmmm&#8230;.I think you&#8217;ve been watching to too much Stefan Molyneux.  :)
