Yes, a single Executive Council.

&gt;&gt;<i> A global platform with several million, or possibly several hundred million

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would mean management, for sure. But other than maybe county

</I>&gt;<i> boards, though many of them do tend to micromanage the executive
</I>&gt;<i> (usually a contracted HOA management company), to basically everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> detriment.
</I>
I think you&#8217;re conflating an elected oversight body with an installed (by force) ruling body.

Politburo - the principal policymaking committee of a Communist Party.

Junta - a military or political group that rules a country after taking power by force.

Executive Oversight Council (as I see it) - an elected body, with a narrow crowdsourced mandate. Any Councilor can be fired...at any point in their term...with one simple vote by the electorate. The criteria for firing a councilor is crowdsourced as well and can be changed or amended...at any time...by a proposal and a vote of the electorate.

The take away is this: You can&#8217;t have a global platform of this scope with out some kind of management. In my mind, this is not a problem as long as the managers are being managed by the users of the platform. 


&gt;&gt;<i> But let&#8217;s say that only a few dozen proposals arrive each day. Some may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> short like the ones currently on pf.m&#8230;but more likely, they will be lengthly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documents that cover items like staffing requirements, budget outlines,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> design criteria, and detailed, long-term projections of the benefit any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> given proposal would provide those who would be voting on it. So many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals&#8230;so many details&#8230;.unbelievable numbers of details. (So many that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vetting proposals would likely become an Agency of it&#8217;s own.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sure: Which is a nearly perfect fit for a strictly hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> organization, which is why nearly all state and federal
</I>&gt;<i> governments and corporations are structured this way&#8230;
</I>
Hierarchy - Pecking order, ranking, chain of command, grading scale, range. 
Here's another way of looking at it:

The human being was once thought to be organized entirely by it's grey matter. Executive Function = brain. CEO of the body. Now we know that our mind is made up of glial cells in the heart and in the gut as well. In fact, the entire body is in on the symphony. Cells everywhere within unbelievably complex networks regulating the &#8220;being&#8221; of the body. Who&#8217;s organizing this? Where is the Executive Function here? 

And, the human mind has imagined into being the computer which is both a Structure and a Process, hardware and software. You need both to access the Internet. Where&#8217;s the Executive Function here? Is it with the engineer who&#8217;s designed the hard drive...the programmer who's written the code&#8230;or the user sitting in front of the computer? And when you step out to the meta level, who&#8217;s managing things there? Who's creating the internet? Is it Google or Amazon? Is it the FCC or ICAAN? Maybe it&#8217;s the porn industry&#8230;.or those who pay for it. Or is it Microsoft and Apple? 

I&#8217;m talking about building a Process and a Structure that can encompass the Meta level as an Executive Function, in and of itself. Again, the take away is that the users will always be in charge. That&#8217;s embedded in the design of the Process and the Structure. If they give that up&#8230;then so be it. There is no safeguard against that other that to make it as inclusive as possible (large quorum) as quickly as possible&#8230;.imo.


&gt;&gt;<i> And, in my mind, people will only want to vote on proposals that have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoroughly researched by real people or institutions that they can *visibly*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locate and easily track (read trust). I&#8217;m sure some people right from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get-go would be comfortable delegating their decisions to proxies operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind a wall of algorithms run by bots. And I would bet that as time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passes, more and more people would be comfortable with that set up&#8230;.if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found it was reliable and trustworthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ultimate expression of this, again, being a single trustworthy and
</I>&gt;<i> yet easily replaceable executive.
</I>
Exactly, &quot;a single trustworthy and yet easily replaceable executive&quot; *Council* ..&#8230;to build, manage, facilitate, and oversee.


&gt;&gt;<i> What better way to incentivize proposers than to make the process simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with clear guidelines and a staff to facilitate and encourage proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely. But that's not what you're proposing, at least as far as I
</I>&gt;<i> understand it. Your proposal was to create a junta that had the power
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;move the goalposts&quot; as it were, which IMHO is exactly the opposite
</I>&gt;<i> of what I'm proposing. The rules should be clear and fixed and any
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;adjustments&quot; should be components of the proposals themselves, not
</I>&gt;<i> something decided by some oligarchs looking over the proposer's
</I>&gt;<i> shoulders.
</I>
All powers given to the EC to &#8220;move goal posts&#8221; are strictly defined, and can be changed by the electorate through the exercise of their inalienable power to vote on anything they choose. If the EC misinterprets the Mandate of the Electorate, they can be fired, in whole or in part. All responsibility for the successful operation of the Organization rests in the hands of The People. 


&gt;&gt;<i> 2. The Index - a crowdsourced continuously evolving indicator of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Networks *Priority* in a ranked stack format with various descriptors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How does this work? Does it prioritize individual proposals, or
</I>&gt;<i> classes of them? Is it just a simple list that The People are
</I>&gt;<i> continually re-sorting? If so, why not work on the proposals directly?
</I>
The Index is a ranked stack (prioritized) list of the Collective (User&#8217;s) concerns and desires for focus. Each registered User can advocate a list (10 maybe) of their own priorities and/or select ones already inventoried. The Index is a compilation of all Users individual lists. I imagine it might look something like this:

Clean Water
Shelter
Peace 
Oceans - Over fishing - Drag nets - Illegal - Policy - Enforcement
Forests
World Hunger
Education
Women's rights
Energy
Agriculture
Space Exploration
Transportation
Pollution 
Banking and Finance
Shelter
Extinction
Governance
Global Warming
Disclosure
Human Rights
Child Abduction and Prostitution
Israel/Palestine
Imperialism
Clean Water


If you click on any single item (like Oceans above) it would define the concern further and ultimately develop into a mind-map format. There would be numerous indicators and stacked functions to make this index extremely informative. Eventually, it would be tied to Google Earth in order to locate jurisdictions, pinpoint various proposals and projects, and then link to their stats, etc, etc. Basically it&#8217;s a vary complex mechanism of human self-reflection. A big mirror of not only the current priority and concern of our species, but the enormity of our response as well.


&gt;&gt;<i> 5. The Scales - This Agency would manage the Public Discourse platform. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would also function as a Magistrate for the Network...and ultimately as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Global Tribunal as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is the junta?
</I>
As together we choose&#8230;..
