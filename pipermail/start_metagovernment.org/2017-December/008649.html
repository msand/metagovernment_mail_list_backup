<PRE>Hi Scott, et al,

Any decentralized online governance system that provides access to local, regional, international and global referendums will likely have more proposals scheduled for deliberation and a vote, at any given time, than any individual or small group of individuals could rationally and practically respond to in a timely and reliable manner.

It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy. Personally, I don&#8217;t yet see a problem with this...but I&#8217;m wondering how others might imagine this playing out.

I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of involvement.

One might employ a proxy for local issues (with perhaps a backup should their first choice be unavailable) and several more for regional (environmental, political, scientific, social, technological, etc) issues and concerns. Ones proxy choice for environmental issues may be unconcerned with educational issues, or be so involved in the environmental arena that they just don&#8217;t have time to track anything else in a reasonable or acceptable manner.

Your thoughts?

Steve
