Argh: Really? Going back to your preference for using (or at least
exposing) expertise and credentials in decisionmaking, is this really
the kind of &quot;expert&quot; you're going to bring to bear on the issue of how
to structure an organization? Did you even spend FSOG before deciding
this Qigong expert is just wasting your time?

&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.infoq.com/articles/how-self-organization-happens">https://www.infoq.com/articles/how-self-organization-happens</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;People often think there is just one specific outcome that results from
</I>&gt;<i> self-organizing processes. For example, people have long argued that
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy is the predominant outcome of social processes in nature. But this
</I>&gt;<i> has proven to be untenable.
</I>
I call BS: This is still the dominant view in ethology, despite the
best efforts of feminists and post modernists to argue that actual
power is more distributed than it appears to be...

&gt;<i> Nature self-organizes in complex, multi-valent
</I>&gt;<i> patterns. What we see, depends on the way we investigate the patterns. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, we used to illustrate the food web in a simple hierarchical
</I>&gt;<i> pyramid, or linear food chain. Now we use computers to visualize the complex
</I>&gt;<i> food web that represents energy exchange in ecological systems. It is the
</I>&gt;<i> same with horses. We used to think that the herd was dominated by the
</I>&gt;<i> stallion, at the top of a simple hierarchy. Now we understand herd dynamics
</I>&gt;<i> as much more sophisticated, overlapping and complex.
</I>
Perhaps, but does this mean that the stallion is *not* actually at the top?

(lots of handwaving by someone who apparently has no training or
experience in social engineering or organizational psychology snipped)

&gt;<i> &quot;Now imagine an organization as overlapping fields of the trust networks
</I>&gt;<i> emanating out from all the participants. Certain individuals occupy highly
</I>&gt;<i> significant nodes of this trust network, and as such, are crucial
</I>&gt;<i> accelerators of trust across the network. If you really want to visualize
</I>&gt;<i> how your organization works, you would start identifying all these trust
</I>&gt;<i> networks.&quot;
</I>
Now try to imagine how this paragraph would have been written by a
social engineer, who is concerned with how something *actually works*
rather than what it appears to some people to look like, instead of a
handwaving pseudo-scientist...
