&gt;<i> Your basic objective is to develop and implement a system (or platform) that provides *the electorate* with an ability to attain full, representative participation, in virtually any jurisdiction or locale, by providing a means of selecting proxies for individuals who are unwilling or unable, for whatever reason, to make governance related decisions for themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good so far...

&gt;<i> Proxy selection would be based on an algorithm that determines an individual&#8217;s personal characteristics or *value traits* though testing or some other artificially intelligent mechanism. Proxy selection would be mandatory and automatic, but could be overridden by the individual at each voting instant by simply changing their proxy&#8217;s vote to one more befitting their individual preference.
</I>&gt;<i>

I've been trying to avoid calling it AI for marketing reasons, but
you're basically right that that's what it is. I must confess, though,
that I consider &quot;AI&quot; to be a misnomer, at least as it has ever been
implemented so far: All we've ever built so far (especially anything
using neural networks) is just a fancy term for automated statistical
analysis, which is exactly what proxyfor.me does. True, the vast
majority of what &quot;intelligent&quot; human behavior is probably based on
that sort of pattern matching as well, but humans have additional
capabilities, many of which are hard-wired rather than learned, that
are orders of magnitude more complex and capable than any current AI
system.

&gt;<i> The proxy/voter association would be reconfigured weekly and the platform would provide some degree of redundancy in order to more accurately secure a homogenous representation between the individual and their proxy(ies) in the voting process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not exactly: The proxy matching is done based on the direct votes
available at the time. That is, the results you get will depend on
when you open the site/app/etc. up until the batch calculation done on
Friday night. This is actually a feature under the presumption that
more votes means closer proxy matches and indeed better quality votes
because more information is available to later voters than to earlier
ones.

&gt;<i> Anyone can submit a proposal, but all submissions will be reviewed, or vetted, by some central authority for their compliance with some set of rational prerequisites before allowing them to move into deliberation, and then on to a vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Correct, and I was assuming the gatekeeper would be the executive
branch. While there could be some sort of petition/initiative process
whereby a proposal that gets enough votes will be entered directly, my
firm belief is that not only is that not necessary, but will just
result in wasting *everyone's* time, something you'll clearly see if
you look at any of the petition-oriented (slacktivism) sites like
change.org, avaaz.org, and petitions.whitehouse.gov. The only
social-engineering fix I'd pre-apply to prevent tyrannical behavior
from the executive branch would be to have &quot;Remove the Manager&quot; always
be one of the proposals in the queue. If that one passes the next in
line would automatically assume the role of Manager, the line of
succession being defined ahead of time (e.g., the global manager line
of succession would be based on some objective assessment criteria
applied to all of the locality managers).

&gt;<i> Once proposals are reviewed and deemed to be appropriately constructed, all individuals potentially affected by the proposal, should it pass, would be notified of the impeding vote in time for them to fully research it before it goes to a weekend vote. You&#8217;ve calculated that there would likely be an average of one or two votes to consider each week&#8230;(for each region, instance, or locale?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right. Again, the number proposals voted on in a given week and how
the proposal queues are presented and sorted remains to be determined,
based in large part on how many overlapping jurisdictions the system
needs to support.

&gt;<i> Pf.m would create a quorum nearing 100% which, if it accurately predicts *value/voting* similarities between citizens and their proxies, would yield a very reliable and representative democracy.
</I>
Right, and this is key: Because there are currently vast differences
in participation rates as a function of personality types this is the
*only* practical way to have a truly egalitarian society. And that's
just the theoretical/philosophical justification: In addition there's
the practical (social engineering) benefit that the kinds of people
who currently participate at the highest rates are exactly those
people who are most inclined to engage in aggressive and
discriminatory behavior that renders our current systems even less
egalitarian than they'd superficially appear to be.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m guessing it's a fairly crude, nutshell apprehension of your proposal&#8230;.but I thought I better start there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have a another question for you: What (or who) determines the % of votes necessary for passage of any given proposal?
</I>
I just have it set at 50% + 1 now, but my prediction is that it won't
matter in the long run because proposals will pass by such large
supermajorities that no one will even bother to ask if we need to
impose a higher standard. There are two features that will ensure
this:
1) The proposal queue(s) are sorted by the ratio of yes to no votes,
so those with the highest approval ratings will get voted on first.
2) The system supports versioning which will enable the proposer to
tweak a proposal to address criticism and hopefully boost its approval
rating. This is analogous to the kind of back-room dealing (like log
rolling) that goes on in existing misrepresentative democracies, but
it will all be done out in the open albeit with a single focal point
(the proposal author). I would expect (and hope) these &quot;social
engineers&quot; to become the &quot;rock stars&quot; of the new system because they
will actually have power on the same level as the Managers and will
actually have more interaction with The People than Managers (who,
unlike mayors/governors/presidents won't have to run for office and so
won't have to have pretty faces and glib personalities).
  Regards,
    Scott
