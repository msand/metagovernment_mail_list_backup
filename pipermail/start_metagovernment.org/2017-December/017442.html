I am not saying that at all. You are assuming that decision-making is quick and final. I am describing a system where it is slow and flexible. If a group of interested people are starting to decide to build a nuclear power plant and then someone else notices and decides that they don&#8217;t want it to happen, they can join in and break the consensus. The people who care about an issue are not a static, small group, when you look at a long-term consensus-building process.

It&#8217;s not authoritarian, it&#8217;s good governance. If people in Portugal want to build a dangerous nuclear power plant that could sent radiation all over Spain&#8230; you&#8217;re saying the people of Spain should have no say in that decision? What if the people of Chicago want to enslave the people of Indiana? Good governance has to be distributed to all people who care about any decision. 

&gt;&gt;<i> In an open system where any interested party can participate, things only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen when all those people reach the best decision together. The nuclear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power company can&#8217;t bully itself into a community; but it can work with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone who has a concern and find a great way to build their facility that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone&#8217;s happy with. It may take longer, but the result will be worth the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wait.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: What you're (again) proposing is dictatorship: When The People
</I>&gt;<i> are forced to try to live within a system that doesn't work (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't render decisions that benefit them) they inevitably end up
</I>&gt;<i> electing Hitler or Trump or some other authoritarian who promises to
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;drain the swamp&quot; or whatever will get them out of their current rut.
</I>
Well, I am arguing that deliberative consensus-building by all interested parties inherently renders good decisions. It has to. I am not saying compromise, I am saying consensus: something that is a win for everyone.

&gt;<i> While I try to give the proponents of &quot;consensus&quot; like Ed the benefit
</I>&gt;<i> of the doubt, I often find it hard to believe that anyone could be
</I>&gt;<i> that ignorant and naive. I inevitably end up entertaining the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that deep down they really are just authoritarians and
</I>&gt;<i> *want* the system to fail so that some &quot;Great Leader&quot; can come along
</I>&gt;<i> and tell them what to do. This post combined with his last post (his
</I>&gt;<i> characterization that automatically calculating proxies is &quot;forcing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> people to vote) is just another example of that: Ed doesn't want a
</I>&gt;<i> system that gives equal weight to each individual's preferences, he
</I>&gt;<i> wants a system where the best and the brightest (the &quot;active
</I>&gt;<i> participants&quot;) make all the decisions, and to hell with the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> us.
</I>
Please try to be more civil. I am respectful of you. Even though I disagree with you, I don&#8217;t think you are evil or ignorant (both words you used in reference to me). I think we just haven&#8217;t learned how to properly communicate with each other. Let&#8217;s get there, please.

You are asserting that everyone has an interest in every decision that may affect them. Frankly, I don&#8217;t care if the road outside my home has more parking on it or less.I don&#8217;t have a car and  I don&#8217;t want to have to spend one moment of thought on the issue, and am very happy to cede that decision to people who care. If however, I learn that my neighbors are starting to propose that garbage trucks should park outside my house all night every night, well then I might decide to jump into the conversation and sway the consensus away from that action. That paradigm gives me complete power in things I care about, and doesn&#8217;t bother me with things that I don&#8217;t care about at all. There are billions of public decisions that affect my community. No way can I participate in all of them; nor can I choose a proxy who will think like I do in all of them.
