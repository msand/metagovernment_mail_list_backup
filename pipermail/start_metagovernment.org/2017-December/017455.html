The nuclear power company can&#8217;t bully itself into a community; but it can work with everyone who has a concern and find a great way to build their facility that everyone&#8217;s happy with. It may take longer, but the result will be worth the wait.

Hi Ed, 

I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I&#8217;ve been a bit distracted by my conversation with Scott.

Determining the % required to pass a proposal has been a difficult thing for me to come to terms with. I&#8217;ve gone round and round with this in my own mind.  Ultimately, it seems to me that given the degree of polarity that exists in our country (or world) today, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine that we would ever be able to pass (all but a very few) proposals by unanimous consent. 

That said, I think that in some cases, a lengthly deliberative process would have multiple benefits for individuals and society at large. As I see it, these benefits would include: deliberation is inherently educational on a number of fronts; it can encourage some people to become more involved in their community and more connected to each other; and is likely to produce better decisions overall.

I say &quot;likely&quot; because, if you start out with a majority already signed on to pass the proposal, and yet it takes days, or weeks, or even months of discussion and deal-making to bring the rest of the community on board, one could argue that the community just wasted a lot of time in the process with essentially the same result, or even a less optimal one. One could also argue that some proposals which have great value for the community would never come to a vote because the process died due to the frustration and resignation of those involved in the effort to bring the remaining naysayers on board.

I was involved in the anti-nuclear movement many years ago with thousands of people working together to stop the Diablo Canyon nuclear facility from going online...and then again at the Yucca Flats nuclear test site in Nevada. We used a consensus model for our decision-making. It was often tedious, frustrating, slow, and at times resulted in people giving up and walking away from the *table*. I found it was also incredibly empowering when we were finally able to arrive at consensus together. 

But could we govern ourselves in that manner at scale...with the myriad of vested interests present in even the smallest of sectors of today's society? Personally, I very much doubt it.  

Here&#8217;s a hypothetical example in case you care to discuss this further: Let&#8217;s say a community of 30,000 residents is faced with having to upgrade their electrical infrastructure in order to accommodate an increase in the number of hybrid vehicles now being charged within their community. The electrical department&#8217;s projected increase in power usage estimates that demand is likely to treble in the next decade as a result. Let&#8217;s say that 8% of voters are old, crotchety, conservative luddites who believe climate change is a hoax. They are quite happy with their gasoline powered vehicles and don&#8217;t see themselves purchasing a hybrid anytime within their remaining years. They think that an increase in taxes to pay for the upgrade would be unreasonably unfair and have declared that they will do whatever they can to stop what they see as an expensive *liberal* project promoted by Agenda 21. Should the community *majority* go the extra 9 miles (read months) to *maybe* bring the luddites on board? What if doing so might prevent the community from being able to take advantage of State and Federal tax credits for the proposed system upgrade?

I&#8217;m inclined to think that we need to design a system that has some degree of *regulated* flexibility. In my mind, giving an elected Executive Council the power to determine the requisite quorum, the % of the vote necessary to pass a proposal, as well as the length of time a proposal would remain in the public discourse phase, may be the answer. The regulatory adjustments of the Exec. Council would be based on the *Priority* the community has established in attending to the situation the proposal was constructed to address. If they felt the advantage to the community at large outweighed the resistance of the naysayers, they would be empowered to adjust the three above *indexes*&#8230;..within certain parameters predetermined by the community at large. 

Your thoughts&#8230;

Steve
