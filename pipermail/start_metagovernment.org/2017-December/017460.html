</I>
Why? Why not just have a single executive, like we do now in most
levels of government and in corporations?

&gt;<i> A global platform with several million, or possibly several hundred million
</I>&gt;<i> users would need extensive, qualified oversight.
</I>
It would mean management, for sure. But other than maybe county
governments (and the aforementioned juntas and politburos) what other
organization even has an &quot;executive council&quot;? And you can't count
corporate boards, since their primary (and indeed in many cases sole)
responsibility is merely to choose the executive. Same with HOA
boards, though many of them do tend to micromanage the executive
(usually a contracted HOA management company), to basically everyone's
detriment.

&gt;<i> At that scale, I imagine dozens if not hundreds of proposals would arrive
</I>&gt;<i> daily. Ok, I admit this is an unsubstantiated guess, but I&#8217;m just not sure
</I>&gt;<i> where to get data on a self-organizing-global-network of human beings
</I>&gt;<i> creating, deliberating, and voting on proposals together. I may be
</I>&gt;<i> overestimating how active a Network of that size and scope would be, but I&#8217;m
</I>&gt;<i> quite sure we&#8217;re not talking about what might be on the docket for a weekly
</I>&gt;<i> City Council or HOA meeting.
</I>
Probably comparable to the former (which in most cases is an order of
magnitude more than what an HOA or corporate board handles directly).
But note that even in most mid-to-large cities &quot;staff&quot; does at least
95% of the work.

&gt;<i> But let&#8217;s say that only a few dozen proposals arrive each day. Some may be
</I>&gt;<i> short like the ones currently on pf.m&#8230;but more likely, they will be lengthly
</I>&gt;<i> documents that cover items like staffing requirements, budget outlines,
</I>&gt;<i> design criteria, and detailed, long-term projections of the benefit any
</I>&gt;<i> given proposal would provide those who would be voting on it. So many
</I>&gt;<i> proposals&#8230;so many details&#8230;.unbelievable numbers of details. (So many that
</I>&gt;<i> vetting proposals would likely become an Agency of it&#8217;s own.)
</I>
Sure: Which is a nearly perfect fit for a strictly hierarchical
organization, which is why is why nearly all state and federal
governments and corporations are structured this way...

&gt;<i> And, in my mind, people will only want to vote on proposals that have been
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly researched by real people or institutions that they can *visibly*
</I>&gt;<i> locate and easily track (read trust). I&#8217;m sure some people right from the
</I>&gt;<i> get-go would be comfortable delegating their decisions to proxies operating
</I>&gt;<i> behind a wall of algorithms run by bots. And I would bet that as time
</I>&gt;<i> passes, more and more people would be comfortable with that set up&#8230;.if they
</I>&gt;<i> found it was reliable and trustworthy.
</I>
The ultimate expression of this, again, being a single trustworthy and
yet easily replaceable executive.

(big snip)

&gt;<i> As I see it, a Template *Agency* would be staffed in order to provide
</I>&gt;<i> individuals and groups with assistance in the proposal development process
</I>&gt;<i> because proposals would be the main drivers of the Organization and
</I>&gt;<i> augmenting their successful formulation and submission would be key. And&#8230;.if
</I>&gt;<i> the Executive Oversight Council were an elected body, with a very strict
</I>&gt;<i> mandate, and we had the ability to fire them, at any point in their term,
</I>&gt;<i> with one simple vote&#8230;.I would trust them to vet proposals according to the
</I>&gt;<i> crowdsourced Values and Priority of the collective Global Body.
</I>
None of this explains why a &quot;council&quot; is required rather than a single
executive with a strictly hierarchical organization below them.
Certainly history has shown when you have a junta a lot of stuff that
should be decided by the legislative branch ends up being decided by
the junta itself. And unlike an executive, replacing all of the
politburo is a nightmare. Just ask the Soviets. Or anyone who's had a
difference of opinion with an HOA board (voice of experience here): In
most cases it's impossible to make any significant change in either of
those environments because the system in most cases is *designed* to
prevent radical change in leadership, usually in the name of
&quot;continuity&quot; but with the inevitable result that preserving the status
quo becomes the management's primary goal.

&gt;<i> 2) While I don't see the need for this type of monkeying around with
</I>&gt;<i> thresholds (much better, as I've said, to incentivize the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> authors to seek high supermajorities), if it *does* turn out to be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary or even desirable, is there some other way we could
</I>&gt;<i> implement this feature? Could it be automated? Could the
</I>&gt;<i> variable/threshold choice be included in the proposal itself, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> as a sort of progressive-implementation plan? For example, larger
</I>&gt;<i> supermajorities cause either an acceleration of the implementation, or
</I>&gt;<i> cause additional features to be automatically added to the to-do
</I>&gt;<i> list&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What better way to incentivize proposers than to make the process simple
</I>&gt;<i> with clear guidelines and a staff to facilitate and encourage proposal
</I>&gt;<i> development?
</I>
Definitely. But that's not what you're proposing, at least as far as I
understand it. Your proposal was to create a junta that had the power
to &quot;move the goalposts&quot; as it were, which IMHO is exactly the opposite
of what I'm proposing. The rules should be clear and fixed and any
&quot;adjustments&quot; should be components of the proposals themselves, not
something decided by some oligarchs looking over the proposer's
shoulders.

&gt;<i> Oh, and a global crowd-funded Foundation to support projects born from their
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>
I've no problem with us collectively funding for projects like this
(maybe run like grant proposals for scientific research or the arts
are now), and in fact believe that nearly *all* projects currently
handled by &quot;charities&quot; should be funded this way (which is why it's
specified to work this way in the Matchism Manifesto ;-)

&gt;<i> I see six Agencies necessary to manage a global *organism* of this mandate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The Template - as described above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The Index - a crowdsourced continuously evolving indicator of the
</I>&gt;<i> Networks *Priority* in a ranked stack format with various descriptors.
</I>
How does this work? Does it prioritize individual proposals, or
classes of them? Is it just a simple list that The People are
continually re-sorting? If so, why not work on the proposals directly?

&gt;<i> 3. The Ballot - This is where proxyfor.me would set up shop. The Ballot
</I>&gt;<i> would have a voting as well as a pledging function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The Foundation - To manage the currency of the Network as well as it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> investments, donations, endowments, and profits. And, as mentioned above, to
</I>&gt;<i> provide project financial support.
</I>
I call this &quot;the government&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> 5. The Scales - This Agency would manage the Public Discourse platform. It
</I>&gt;<i> would also function as a Magistrate for the Network...and ultimately as a
</I>&gt;<i> Global  Tribunal as well.
</I>
This is the junta?

&gt;<i> 6. The  Database - Multiple tasks here. Records of all proceedings,
</I>&gt;<i> contracts, and agreements, minutes from meetings, copies of proposals, and
</I>&gt;<i> so on would be stored here. It would also be the Proposal Vetting Agency,
</I>&gt;<i> and it would have a Journalistic Branch to keep the Network abreast of the
</I>&gt;<i> Real News. and so on&#8230;.
</I>
This would be part of proxyfor.me too (i.e., the UI to *all*
government operations ought to be uniform to cut down on training time
and maximize utilization).

&gt;<i> Then there&#8217;s just two Oversight Councils (one for the Structure and one for
</I>&gt;<i> the Process), a Declaration of Values, a Mandate&#8230;..and a mass of creative,
</I>&gt;<i> newly empowered human beings.  That&#8217;s it.  :)
</I>
I'd still like hear more about what benefits a junta provides vs a
single hierarchical organization with an executive at the top...

     Scott
