<PRE>From an interview with Bonnitta Roy

<A HREF="https://www.infoq.com/articles/how-self-organization-happens">https://www.infoq.com/articles/how-self-organization-happens</A>



&quot;People often think there is just one specific outcome that results from self-organizing processes. For example, people have long argued that hierarchy is the predominant outcome of social processes in nature. But this has proven to be untenable. Nature self-organizes in complex, multi-valent patterns. What we see, depends on the way we investigate the patterns. For example, we used to illustrate the food web in a simple hierarchical pyramid, or linear food chain. Now we use computers to visualize the complex food web that represents energy exchange in ecological systems. It is the same with horses. We used to think that the herd was dominated by the stallion, at the top of a simple hierarchy. Now we understand herd dynamics as much more sophisticated, overlapping and complex.

&quot;On the other hand, in the agile community, the notion of self-organization has come to mean &#8220;non-hierarchical&#8221; or &#8220;egalitarian&#8221; or &#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221; outcomes. In fact, it is possible for self-organizing dynamics to create any of these patterns, and other patterns as well. What pattern emerges is dependent upon a host of factors in the environment&#8211; conditions, constraints, and circumstances. What pattern emerges is also dependent on key features of the agents themselves -- how they express their autonomy, relationality, and agency. This is as true for animals and plants as it is for people.

&quot;People who are critical of self-organization are critical of one or more of the patterns that might emerge. People on both sides of the argument &#8211; those who admire hierarchies and those who are allergic to them&#8212;want only a single outcome that appeals to them. They want rules that will control the patterns of human relating. At the end of the day, this is not possible. People merely self-organize in unofficial ways despite the official rules that say &#8220;we must be a hierarchy&#8221; or &#8220;we must be egalitarian.&#8221; The actual complex processes of human relating cannot be reduced to fit into one or the other of those forms. 

&quot;People who believe that self-organization is an important theme in organizational life, understand that self-organization is the source of creative novelty and coherence in complex systems. We believe that understanding self-organization means we can become more conscious in how we face organizational challenges. We believe that by designing with these dynamics, we can design for potentials that are just now emerging in collaborative teams.&quot;


and


 &quot;I do a workshop on developing trust networks, and it is always a surprise to discover how little we agree on what trust is, and how it operates in our lives. You can try a simple exercise for yourself. Put a dot in the middle of a paper. The dot represents you. Draw a series of concentric circles around the dot. Think of the people you trust most, and put them in the inner circle. You will sense a boundary or threshold where a few people you trust most qualify for this inner trust sanctum, while others feel they belong in the circle further out. When you feel into this notion of a trust network, other people you know from personal or work life will not make it into the inner circles at all. They will belong further out, until the relationships fall into the categories of &#8220;casual acquaintance.&#8221; You might even have some people black-listed as &#8220;not trustworthy at all!&#8221;

&quot;The question to ask yourself is, what are the threads that are measuring this feeling of trust? Some people think trust is a matter of &#8220;predictability&#8221;, while other people think it is a matter of &#8220;responsibility.&#8221; Some people build trust on the bases of intention and purpose, while others see it more about the skills necessary to act reliably in a given situation. People discover that trust is not something that is &#8220;on&#8221; or &#8220;off&#8221; &#8211; but more like a measure of who is proximate (close to us) and those who are more distal (further out) in our trust network.

&quot;Now to answer your question. I wouldn&#8217;t say that trust is a pre-requisite for self-organization. I would say that we self-organize our trust network, through continuous participation in complex processes of human relating. Trust is the felt-sense of the pattern that emerges&#8212;the implicit pattern of with whom we extend a great deal of trust, and with whom we reserve our trust, to various degrees.

&quot;Now imagine an organization as overlapping fields of the trust networks emanating out from all the participants. Certain individuals occupy highly significant nodes of this trust network, and as such, are crucial accelerators of trust across the network. If you really want to visualize how your organization works, you would start identifying all these trust networks.&quot;
