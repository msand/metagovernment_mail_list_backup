</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why? Why not just have a single executive, like we do now in most

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, a single Executive Council.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're evading the question.
</I>
A single figurehead, at the top of a global organization of the aforementioned scope, would place way too much power (and far too much responsibility) into the hands of a single individual&#8230;.imo. 

That said, if the a majority of the electorate felt that a single figurehead/executive was a better way to do business, then that would become the new Executive Structure. I just wouldn&#8217;t want to front load it with that because of the reasons stated above.

&gt;&gt;<i> A global platform with several million, or possibly several hundred million
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users would need extensive, qualified oversight.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So this is some sort of &quot;two heads are better than one&quot; appeal? How
</I>&gt;<i> many corporations work this way, where a CEO hires 5 or 7 people to
</I>&gt;<i> run a department? Nothing would ever get done&#8230;
</I>
There would be enough Councilors for there to be an effective delegation of functions. This of course would depend entirely on the demands placed on this body. (Actually there are two bodies that perform the Executive function as I mentioned previously: one for the Process and one for the Structure). 

Corporations are a different animal with a different mandate and a different set of priorities. What I&#8217;m talking about is a self-organizing decision-making platform whose sole purpose is to support the *Proposal* of a sovereign People.


&gt;&gt;<i> I think you&#8217;re conflating an elected oversight body with an installed (by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> force) ruling body.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, the source of their power is irrelevant. I'm concerned purely with
</I>&gt;<i> the mechanics of the operation of the organization. You seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> saying that organizations run by committees somehow function better
</I>&gt;<i> than those run by individuals. The research (and my own experience)
</I>&gt;<i> shows that this is almost never the case. Therefore the only
</I>&gt;<i> justification for a group-format executive branch might be where there
</I>&gt;<i> *is* no &quot;legislative branch&quot; to handle the high level decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> and supervision of the executive (i.e., the
</I>&gt;<i> council/committee/junta/politburo combines the executive and
</I>&gt;<i> legislative functions).
</I>
The People are the legislators. They make the proposals, and decide on them as well. The Executive Oversight Council exists strictly to administer the decisions of the People. (Maybe it would be less confusing if they were called the *Administrative* Oversight Council?)

&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m talking about building a Process and a Structure that can encompass the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Meta level as an Executive Function, in and of itself. Again, the take away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that the users will always be in charge. That&#8217;s embedded in the design of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Process and the Structure. If they give that up&#8230;then so be it. There is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no safeguard against that other that to make it as inclusive as possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (large quorum) as quickly as possible&#8230;.imo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You might have to write a book on this to explain this proposal, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'd start with the &quot;executive summary&quot; of how it compares with the
</I>&gt;<i> day-to-day operation of existing organizations.
</I>
I have absolutely no interest in comparing this to something that&#8217;s currently existing. I&#8217;ll leave that to others to whom that matters. Again, this is a novel way of organizing humanity and, as the adage says, &quot;You can&#8217;t put new wine into old skins.&#8221; 

&gt;&gt;<i> And, in my mind, people will only want to vote on proposals that have been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoroughly researched by real people or institutions that they can *visibly*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locate and easily track (read trust). I&#8217;m sure some people right from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get-go would be comfortable delegating their decisions to proxies operating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behind a wall of algorithms run by bots. And I would bet that as time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passes, more and more people would be comfortable with that set up&#8230;.if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found it was reliable and trustworthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's an empirical question, but my sense (based on my experience on
</I>&gt;<i> forums and to a lesser extent on the research (e.g., Keil 2010)) is
</I>&gt;<i> that people can judge the quality of the argument *independent* of
</I>&gt;<i> knowing the individual organization that produced it, and that this is
</I>&gt;<i> actually an important feature in a decisionmaking system. For example
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;peer review&quot; process is exactly the opposite of what you propose,
</I>&gt;<i> and for good reason: You don't want people making decisions based on
</I>&gt;<i> the status of the individual/group making a particular argument.
</I>
From Wikipedia, &quot;Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.&#8221;

And one could argue that if there were more transparency, we wouldn&#8217;t have so much corruption in the current peer review process.

Also, even within traditional peer review, an individual or group that submits a paper to a journal or institution knows something about the reviewers background and level of competence. Otherwise the journal or institution wouldn&#8217;t be trusted.


&gt;&gt;<i> The ultimate expression of this, again, being a single trustworthy and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet easily replaceable executive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exactly, &quot;a single trustworthy and yet easily replaceable executive&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Council* ..&#8230;to build, manage, facilitate, and oversee.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So you propose replacing the entire council, rather than individual
</I>&gt;<i> members, when it repeatedly fails to make good decisions? If not, how
</I>&gt;<i> do you propose to identify the malfunctioning components?
</I>
As I said earlier, I&#8217;m proposing that the electorate have the option to replace the Council, &quot;in whole, or in part&quot;, if they deem it appropriate and have the votes to do so. My guess is that replacing the entire Council would happen only under a very extreme circumstance, if ever.


&gt;&gt;<i> The Index is a ranked stack (prioritized) list of the Collective (User&#8217;s)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerns and desires for focus. Each registered User can advocate a list (10
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe) of their own priorities and/or select ones already inventoried. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Index is a compilation of all Users individual lists. I imagine it might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> look something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's something like this (Goals of The People) in the Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> Manifesto, but I'm actually moving away from that lately. Sure, the
</I>&gt;<i> executive (and/or the proposal writers) will sometimes need to do
</I>&gt;<i> polls to assess The People's preferences and priorities, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> lately thinking that this doesn't need to be a separate component of
</I>&gt;<i> the system as it's already going to be accounted for in the profile
</I>&gt;<i> data (assuming one does proxy matching) and in the output of the
</I>&gt;<i> budgeting process. For training and operational efficiency reasons we
</I>&gt;<i> should strive to eliminate &quot;bells and whistles&quot; from the design of the
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking system, especially when we're not absolutely sure
</I>&gt;<i> they're really needed.
</I>
I&#8217;m talking about designing the next iteration of our *Social Medium*. A place where a global People can gather online to connect and co-create our collaborative human endeavor, together. As I see it, it will need to be interesting, informative, empowering, and coherent if it&#8217;s going to be at all successful. As designed, the above &quot;Index&quot; would be a large part of the sensory-response-feedback-complex of this new Social Medium.

All the best,
Steve
