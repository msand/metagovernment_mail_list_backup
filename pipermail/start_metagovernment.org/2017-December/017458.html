In my mind, giving an elected Executive Council the power to determine the requisite quorum, the % of the vote necessary to pass a proposal, as well as the length of time a proposal would remain in the public discourse phase, may be the answer. The regulatory adjustments of the Exec. Council would be based on the *Priority* the community has established in attending to the situation the proposal was constructed to address. If they felt the advantage to the community at large outweighed the resistance of the naysayers, they would be empowered to adjust the three above *indexes*&#8230;..within certain parameters predetermined by the community at large.

OK, since no one else seems inclined to take this on, I'll bite:
1) For &quot;Executive Council&quot; for some reason my mind automatically
substitutes junta/politburo/oligarchy. Why does it do this? Oh, that's
right, just about everything I've learned over the last 50+ years
about how politics (and indeed human behavior in general) tells me
that this is the inevitable result of *any* system that gives ultimate
authority on *anything* to a small group of people. So the first
question has to be, how is your proposal any different than what we've
been living with for the last 6000 years or so?

2) While I don't see the need for this type of monkeying around with
thresholds (much better, as I've said, to incentivize the proposal
authors to seek high supermajorities), if it *does* turn out to be
necessary or even desirable, is there some other way we could
implement this feature? Could it be automated? Could the
variable/threshold choice be included in the proposal itself, perhaps
as a sort of progressive-implementation plan? For example, larger
supermajorities cause either an acceleration of the implementation, or
cause additional features to be automatically added to the to-do
list...

     Scott
