No, it's just the passage of time: The closer to the closing date a
proposal gets, the more direct votes will have been cast. The quality
of your proxy match depends on the number of these votes: The more of
them there are, the more likely it will be able to find someone who
voted like you would if you'd had the time to do the research to cast
your own direct vote. This applies even on the closing weekend (after
the batch proxy calculation have been done on Friday night): If you
log in on Sunday afternoon you might even find that the proxies it has
calculated for you, and even your calculated vote, will be different
due to a flurry of proxy-override votes cast on Saturday. How often
this happens I think will be a really good validation of the stability
of the system and the quality of the proxy matches (i.e., I predict it
won't happen very often or to very many people).

(snip)

&gt;<i> The system or platform I&#8217;m working on has a crowdsourced, ranked choice
</I>&gt;<i> *Priority Stack* that would inform the &#8220;executive council&quot; to assist them in
</I>&gt;<i> managing the position of proposals in the queue. Not the only criteria...but
</I>&gt;<i> useful information.
</I>
I've considered allowing people to attach a priority to a proposal
when they cast a vote and then using that to aid in scheduling, but
for now would prefer to run with the simpler vote-ratio mechanism...

&gt;<i> Seems to me it would be incumbent on the individual(s) developing the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to list the jurisdictions their proposal would impact&#8230;.and then the
</I>&gt;<i> agency vetting the proposal would certify the accuracy of their delineation.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the deliberation or *public discourse* phase would also be check on
</I>&gt;<i> the accuracy of the proposals stated influence. Tricky business nonetheless.
</I>
My general plan is to have single proposals at the global level that
each locality could accept or reject. For example a policy on rental
properties would be posed globally, and those localities that accept
it would only see it once and there'd be as much commonality as
possible (again, in our current system *vast* amounts of resources are
simply wasted with each locality reinventing the wheel on these
things). Any locality that rejected it would expected to come up with
an alternative/modification/addendum that they alone would vote on.
This makes the proposer's job harder because as they build in the
compromises they need to decide whether they're going to lose passage
in some localities in their attempts to pick up others, but it has
huge efficiency and social-engineering benefits to the operation of
government in general.

&gt;<i> So there would be some mechanism for determining 'popularity' before an
</I>&gt;<i> actual *official* vote?
</I>
The direct votes are currently visible to the proposer, and of course
used to sort the queue. The proposer needs to be able to see them to
do the tweaking as described above. Everyone else only gets to see
them as part of the commenting and proxy-matching process (where they
only see a subset) and after the voting has closed.

&gt;<i> In my mind, the related comments (for and against) would be ranked in terms
</I>&gt;<i> of popularity (a thumbs up/thumbs down kind of thing). This would be data
</I>&gt;<i> for those introducing the proposal as well as for the executive council to
</I>&gt;<i> determine the *ripeness* of the proposal for a vote.
</I>
It does this already (you can sort the posts by number of cites, date,
etc.) But, again, I'd generally prefer to have the advancement system
be fully automated so that you don't have the executive branch dicking
around with the queue manually except maybe in emergencies.

&gt;<i> I agree. I think designing kickass proposals and projects for better systems
</I>&gt;<i> of human *livingry* (as Bucky called it) will be the new groovy.
</I>
Currently nobody evaluates and votes for/against their representatives
using this criteria. Which is just bizarre if you think about it:
That's their freaking *job*, isn't it?

    Scott
