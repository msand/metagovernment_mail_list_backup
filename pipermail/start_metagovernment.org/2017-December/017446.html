&gt;<i> I am not saying that at all. You are assuming that decision-making is quick and final. I am describing a system where it is slow and flexible. If a group of interested people are starting to decide to build a nuclear power plant and then someone else notices and decides that they don&#8217;t want it to happen, they can join in and break the consensus. The people who care about an issue are not a static, small group, when you look at a long-term consensus-building process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, so if the reactor is half built and a few people change their
minds (or a few new people chime in), the process just stops until a
new consensus is reached. That's not social engineering or public
policy decisionmaking, it's anarchy (in the &quot;breakdown of
civilization&quot; sense of the word).

&gt;<i> It&#8217;s not authoritarian, it&#8217;s good governance. If people in Portugal want to build a dangerous nuclear power plant that could sent radiation all over Spain&#8230; you&#8217;re saying the people of Spain should have no say in that decision? What if the people of Chicago want to enslave the people of Indiana? Good governance has to be distributed to all people who care about any decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I love this quote because it perfectly captures what elitists use to
justify their elitism: You can't trust the people to make good
decisions, so you need a filter (in your case &quot;activism&quot; based on
&quot;caring&quot;) to determine who's voices get heard and who's can safely be
ignored.

&gt;<i> Well, I am arguing that deliberative consensus-building by all interested parties inherently renders good decisions. It has to. I am not saying compromise, I am saying consensus: something that is a win for everyone.
</I>
And what if only 1% of the population participates in the process? How
does your proposal ensure that &quot;everyone&quot; is represented?

&gt;<i> Please try to be more civil. I am respectful of you. Even though I disagree with you, I don&#8217;t think you are evil or ignorant (both words you used in reference to me). I think we just haven&#8217;t learned how to properly communicate with each other. Let&#8217;s get there, please.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I disagree: I see your willful ignorance and promotion of half-baked
ideas to be a serious problem and would prefer that either you educate
yourself to the point where you don't say irrational and
scientifically indefensible things or at least stop promoting things
you haven't bother to think through the repercussions of. It's not a
communication problem: What you're doing is not just wasting your time
(and mine), it's actually actively hampering the progress of
civilization.

An analogy: While it's tempting to consider the election of Trump (or
Hitler), the failure of the US federal government to pass any
significant legislation in the past year, and the data reported in
books like &quot;Stealth Democracy&quot; and &quot;Democracy for Realists&quot; to be
signs of the coming apocalypse, I see them as energy, like the flow of
wind. Our job is to design an airfoil such that sticking it out into
that wind will cause it to lift all of us. That's what proxyfor.me is
intended to be. But to extend the analogy, your posts, and the
promotions of organizations like <A HREF="https://www.democracy.earth/">https://www.democracy.earth/</A> and
<A HREF="https://thenextsystem.org">https://thenextsystem.org</A> are like ice crystals in the wind: Not only
are they not examples of a lifting body, by promoting unreasonable
(and IMHO irrational) expectations, they stick to anything that
actually *could* generate lift and prevent it from working as
designed. Which is sad because these &quot;snowflake&quot; proposals in fact are
not really &quot;designed&quot; at all, but merely pulled out of the asses of
people who fancy themselves as social engineers even though they have
no experience or education in the field, nor do they apparently even
recognize that their vast ignorance is a problem (i.e, it's the
Dunning-Kruger effect).

&gt;<i> You are asserting that everyone has an interest in every decision that may affect them. Frankly, I don&#8217;t care if the road outside my home has more parking on it or less.I don&#8217;t have a car and  I don&#8217;t want to have to spend one moment of thought on the issue, and am very happy to cede that decision to people who care.
</I>
Right, just like you don't own slaves and aren't likely to be captured
and sold into slavery and so should have no say on the subject. And
you're not a woman and so can't get pregnant, so the issue of abortion
doesn't really affect you and so your opinion can safely be ignored
(or if you're a Catholic and so do have a strong opinion on the issue,
your vote ought to be weighted proportionally to the strength of your
feelings). A properly functioning civilization requires *all* of us to
participate in *every* public policy decision to ensure that each one
is both fair and functional. Promoting a system that abdicates this
responsibility IMHO this is simply an ignorant, irresponsible, and
frankly evil thing to do.

&gt;<i> If however, I learn that my neighbors are starting to propose that garbage trucks should park outside my house all night every night, well then I might decide to jump into the conversation and sway the consensus away from that action. That paradigm gives me complete power in things I care about, and doesn&#8217;t bother me with things that I don&#8217;t care about at all. There are billions of public decisions that affect my community. No way can I participate in all of them; nor can I choose a proxy who will think like I do in all of them.
</I>
Exactly, which is why instead of promoting BS in your posts you ought
to take a few hours to try to understand how <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A>
works (read the help system, and then *all* of the scientific research
it points to) and maybe realize that it solves both of these problems.
Or if you subsequently come to think you've found a reason that it
doesn't at least you'll be in a position to offer constructive
criticism of it and participate in the development of an improvement.
Wasn't that the purpose of your setting up metagovernment.org in the
first place?
  Regards,
    Scott
