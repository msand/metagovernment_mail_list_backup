And I say that this is exactly the system we have now, and it always
leads directly to SDAP-based leadership and decisionmaking the
inevitable outcome of which is war, famine, and a wide variety of
other incompetent decisionmaking, and probably at some point the
extinction of our species. Essentially what you're proposing is a
plutocracy: A system where a small group of people who &quot;care&quot; about an
issue enough to overcome their inertia are allowed to make the
decision regardless of its effect on the vast majority of the
population. What you seem to be missing (among a great many other
things) is the fact that &quot;consensus&quot; means exactly *nothing* unless
you have 100% participation rates, which curiously is exactly the
opposite of what you're proposing!

There are a wide variety of reasons why the masses don't participate
in these decisions:
1) Maybe they're just busy.
2) They rationally realize that they lack the power to actually make
any difference.
3) They simply lack the psychological characteristics that make it
comfortable for them to wade into a conflict intensive environment.
4) The actively fear repercussions if they become active participants.
Your proposal is that these people don't count and so can and should
be ignored. That's not only anti-democratic, but I would go so far as
to characterize is as being explicitly evil because it is the exact
same justification dictators and other oligarchies used to justify
their seizing power and doing whatever it takes to hold onto it.

&gt;<i> If the active participants have to reach a consensus to pass a decision,
</I>&gt;<i> then it is very unlikely that any tyranny of one group could prevail over
</I>&gt;<i> other interested parties.
</I>
And I say all this tells us is that you don't understand human
psychology or group dynamics. Or history. Or social engineering. Or
even the definition of &quot;consensus&quot;: By my understanding of your
proposal, Hitler/Stalin/Mao and their cronies were merely &quot;people who
care about an issue&quot; and therefore were perfectly rationally and
morally justified in making the decisions they did. If people don't
&quot;care&quot; enough about an issue to lay down their lives to defend their
side, well, they get exactly what they deserve. And what better way to
achieve &quot;consensus&quot; than to insure that everyone who disagrees with
you is either eliminated or coerced into accepting your position.

    Scott
