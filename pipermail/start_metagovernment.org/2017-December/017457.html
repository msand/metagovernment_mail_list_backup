IMHO, better to not to build a distrubuted system, *and* better to not
use any sort of cryptography in the system (other than transactional
cryptography (like HTTPS)), as I tried to explain to the
DemocracyEarth folks:
<A HREF="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues/214">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues/214</A>

Unfortunately none of them bothered to respond to these criticisms.
Could be that that they didn't understand them because they hadn't
done the necessary background research, but I think more likely the
&quot;cryptography is a hammer&quot; explanation is the more accurate one (i.e.,
they don't *want* to know, because they're so infatuated with the
technology that they simply don't care whether any of their ideas make
any sense at all).

&gt;<i> There will be any need for a better system than block chain? or as for the
</I>&gt;<i> IoT is in development the IOTA token, maybe one day I will vote directly
</I>&gt;<i> from my fridge!
</I>
Better yet, if you're not going to take the time to seriously research
the issues before voting, let your proxies vote for you. They will
presumably invest a little more time to get it right than you and your
fridge will.
