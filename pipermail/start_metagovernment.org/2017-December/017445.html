&gt;<i> I&#8217;m coming at it from a very different angle Scott. I think the only way for

</I>
All agreed!

&gt;<i> That would be a lot of deliberation and decision-making.
</I>
You went into the weeds here: What evidence do you have that &quot;a lot&quot;
of either of these things is required? The problem with our existing
governments has absolutely nothing to do with the *number* of
decisions being made, merely that the *wrong* decisions are being
made. 99.99% of the public policy decisions that need to be made could
probably be made by a true benevolent dictator as long as we retain
the 0.01% ability to remove or override him (thereby ensuring the
&quot;benevolent&quot; part). Your proposal to burden millions or billions of
people with an obligation that they don't want and are probably
incapable of meeting seems to me not only an example of incompetent
social engineering, but just kind of heartless in addition...

&gt;<i> And, regardless of how incompetent you think *regular* people may be, I
</I>&gt;<i> would want to be a part of the process; including choosing my own proxy. I
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in that.
</I>
Certainly you aren't. But 88% of the German population apparently
wanted Hitler to be dictator in 1934 and so voted for that and by your
logic that worked out exactly as it should have. I'll admit that
getting people to accept their incompetence and act rationally in
response is an extremely difficult thing to do, but unfortunately it's
going to be required as part of the reform process. I'd like to start
with you: What is *your* justification for continuing to insist on
something that has clearly been shown to be based on a false belief?
To ensure that you've actually provided one, please note that you need
to deal with both the Hitler example and the lack of correlation in
delegate voting that was reported in the LQFB system in Kling
(<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf</A>).

&gt;<i> It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of
</I>&gt;<i> discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies
</I>&gt;<i> in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy.
</I>
Exactly, and exactly what proxyfor.me does, and does automatically,
dramatically reducing the incidence of human error in the process.

(snip)

&gt;<i> I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical
</I>&gt;<i> regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of
</I>&gt;<i> research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of
</I>&gt;<i> involvement.
</I>
Surely availability of good information is a necessary requirement for
good decisionmaking. But what does that have to do with proxies? Why
can't the information be provided (and judged) by people who aren't
necessarily likely to vote like you would? Certainly vastly reduces
the number of people required to run the system: Imagine if every
cluster in the 5-dimensional FFM space needed their own investigators:
You'd increase the number of &quot;journalists&quot; required by orders of
magnitude, and for no good reason.

&gt;<i> So, citizens would just push their *proxy* button and all would be well?
</I>&gt;<i> They could go back to watching Reality TV?
</I>
Yes, except that they don't even have to push a button (proxy matching
is opt-out, not opt-in). And I don't get the sarcasm: You say that
like it's some sort of problem. Or are you a follower of Ed's
philosophy: The people that decided to watch Reality TV didn't
participate and so their preferences not only *can* be ignored, but
indeed must be.

&gt;<i> In other words, we can&#8217;t trust the individual to choose for themselves, to
</I>&gt;<i> educate themselves about a situation, or a candidate, or to know what they
</I>&gt;<i> want in terms of say, transportation infrastructure, educational systems, or
</I>&gt;<i> regarding policy for prison systems?
</I>
No, merely that we can't *expect* them to do this. I believe that
everyone is capable of doing these things, which are much simpler
problems than choosing appropriate proxies, but also that it's
delusional (incompetent social engineering) to design a system that
*requires* all them to do this.

&gt;<i> It's a non-starter: People are not competent to choose their
</I>&gt;<i> proxies/representatives/delegates, something that has been clearly
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated by the failure of misrepresentative democracies in general,
</I>&gt;<i> to implement anything even vaguely resembling &quot;The Willl of the People&#8221;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would say that&#8217;s an absurd generalization if it weren&#8217;t such a cynical
</I>&gt;<i> one. I&#8217;m curious, would you include yourself in that characterization?
</I>
Definitely. A man's got to know his limitations. See above: Do you
know yours? Or are you one of the above average drivers? (see
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_superiority</A>)

&gt;<i> Is there any decision *We the People* are capable of making for ourselves in
</I>&gt;<i> this regard? Like maybe whether or not to adopt Matchism?
</I>
Unfortunately for the world-view of extremists, the world is not black
and white: Just because you're incompetent at choosing proxies doesn't
necessarily mean that you're incompetent at making every other
decision that affects you.

&gt;<i> Hmmmm&#8230;.I think you&#8217;ve been watching to too much Stefan Molyneux.  :)
</I>
Hmm, hadn't heard of him, actually. But a little research clearly
shows that he's like Ed (and indeed like most other extremists on both
the right *and* the left): They're not interested in building a
democratic or egalitarian society, or indeed even one that works, but
merely one where the &quot;right people&quot; get to make the decisions. The
flaw with their proposals is their failure to recognize that it's the
inequality in participation rates that's our main problem, and that it
has nothing to do with the process the &quot;right people&quot; (the active
participants) use to come to a decision.

    Scott
