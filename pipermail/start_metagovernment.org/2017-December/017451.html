<PRE>&gt;<i> 1) The proposal queue(s) are sorted by the ratio of yes to no votes,
</I>&gt;<i> so those with the highest approval ratings will get voted on first.
</I>
My main problem with the only having 1-2 votes a week based on highest
approval. What if we never pass anything of note? They would all be
vanilla, middle of the road stuff proposals. We would have never passed gay
marriage for instance. Nothing risky, sometimes a little risk is worth it
even it doesn't have the highest approval rating. No risk we don't shift or
evolve. I think it's important to rock the boat a little. I'd vote for more
votes in the week.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your basic objective is to develop and implement a system (or platform)

</I>&gt;<i> unable, for whatever reason, to make governance related decisions for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Good so far...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Proxy selection would be based on an algorithm that determines an
</I>&gt;<i> individual&#8217;s personal characteristics or *value traits* though testing or
</I>&gt;<i> some other artificially intelligent mechanism. Proxy selection would be
</I>&gt;<i> mandatory and automatic, but could be overridden by the individual at each
</I>&gt;<i> voting instant by simply changing their proxy&#8217;s vote to one more befitting
</I>&gt;<i> their individual preference.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been trying to avoid calling it AI for marketing reasons, but
</I>&gt;<i> you're basically right that that's what it is. I must confess, though,
</I>&gt;<i> that I consider &quot;AI&quot; to be a misnomer, at least as it has ever been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented so far: All we've ever built so far (especially anything
</I>&gt;<i> using neural networks) is just a fancy term for automated statistical
</I>&gt;<i> analysis, which is exactly what proxyfor.me does. True, the vast
</I>&gt;<i> majority of what &quot;intelligent&quot; human behavior is probably based on
</I>&gt;<i> that sort of pattern matching as well, but humans have additional
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities, many of which are hard-wired rather than learned, that
</I>&gt;<i> are orders of magnitude more complex and capable than any current AI
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The proxy/voter association would be reconfigured weekly and the
</I>&gt;<i> platform would provide some degree of redundancy in order to more
</I>&gt;<i> accurately secure a homogenous representation between the individual and
</I>&gt;<i> their proxy(ies) in the voting process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly: The proxy matching is done based on the direct votes
</I>&gt;<i> available at the time. That is, the results you get will depend on
</I>&gt;<i> when you open the site/app/etc. up until the batch calculation done on
</I>&gt;<i> Friday night. This is actually a feature under the presumption that
</I>&gt;<i> more votes means closer proxy matches and indeed better quality votes
</I>&gt;<i> because more information is available to later voters than to earlier
</I>&gt;<i> ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone can submit a proposal, but all submissions will be reviewed, or
</I>&gt;<i> vetted, by some central authority for their compliance with some set of
</I>&gt;<i> rational prerequisites before allowing them to move into deliberation, and
</I>&gt;<i> then on to a vote.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct, and I was assuming the gatekeeper would be the executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch. While there could be some sort of petition/initiative process
</I>&gt;<i> whereby a proposal that gets enough votes will be entered directly, my
</I>&gt;<i> firm belief is that not only is that not necessary, but will just
</I>&gt;<i> result in wasting *everyone's* time, something you'll clearly see if
</I>&gt;<i> you look at any of the petition-oriented (slacktivism) sites like
</I>&gt;<i> change.org, avaaz.org, and petitions.whitehouse.gov. The only
</I>&gt;<i> social-engineering fix I'd pre-apply to prevent tyrannical behavior
</I>&gt;<i> from the executive branch would be to have &quot;Remove the Manager&quot; always
</I>&gt;<i> be one of the proposals in the queue. If that one passes the next in
</I>&gt;<i> line would automatically assume the role of Manager, the line of
</I>&gt;<i> succession being defined ahead of time (e.g., the global manager line
</I>&gt;<i> of succession would be based on some objective assessment criteria
</I>&gt;<i> applied to all of the locality managers).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once proposals are reviewed and deemed to be appropriately constructed,
</I>&gt;<i> all individuals potentially affected by the proposal, should it pass, would
</I>&gt;<i> be notified of the impeding vote in time for them to fully research it
</I>&gt;<i> before it goes to a weekend vote. You&#8217;ve calculated that there would likely
</I>&gt;<i> be an average of one or two votes to consider each week&#8230;(for each region,
</I>&gt;<i> instance, or locale?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. Again, the number proposals voted on in a given week and how
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal queues are presented and sorted remains to be determined,
</I>&gt;<i> based in large part on how many overlapping jurisdictions the system
</I>&gt;<i> needs to support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pf.m would create a quorum nearing 100% which, if it accurately predicts
</I>&gt;<i> *value/voting* similarities between citizens and their proxies, would yield
</I>&gt;<i> a very reliable and representative democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and this is key: Because there are currently vast differences
</I>&gt;<i> in participation rates as a function of personality types this is the
</I>&gt;<i> *only* practical way to have a truly egalitarian society. And that's
</I>&gt;<i> just the theoretical/philosophical justification: In addition there's
</I>&gt;<i> the practical (social engineering) benefit that the kinds of people
</I>&gt;<i> who currently participate at the highest rates are exactly those
</I>&gt;<i> people who are most inclined to engage in aggressive and
</I>&gt;<i> discriminatory behavior that renders our current systems even less
</I>&gt;<i> egalitarian than they'd superficially appear to be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I&#8217;m guessing it's a fairly crude, nutshell apprehension of your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal&#8230;.but I thought I better start there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I have a another question for you: What (or who) determines the %
</I>&gt;<i> of votes necessary for passage of any given proposal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just have it set at 50% + 1 now, but my prediction is that it won't
</I>&gt;<i> matter in the long run because proposals will pass by such large
</I>&gt;<i> supermajorities that no one will even bother to ask if we need to
</I>&gt;<i> impose a higher standard. There are two features that will ensure
</I>&gt;<i> this:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The proposal queue(s) are sorted by the ratio of yes to no votes,
</I>&gt;<i> so those with the highest approval ratings will get voted on first.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The system supports versioning which will enable the proposer to
</I>&gt;<i> tweak a proposal to address criticism and hopefully boost its approval
</I>&gt;<i> rating. This is analogous to the kind of back-room dealing (like log
</I>&gt;<i> rolling) that goes on in existing misrepresentative democracies, but
</I>&gt;<i> it will all be done out in the open albeit with a single focal point
</I>&gt;<i> (the proposal author). I would expect (and hope) these &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> engineers&quot; to become the &quot;rock stars&quot; of the new system because they
</I>&gt;<i> will actually have power on the same level as the Managers and will
</I>&gt;<i> actually have more interaction with The People than Managers (who,
</I>&gt;<i> unlike mayors/governors/presidents won't have to run for office and so
</I>&gt;<i> won't have to have pretty faces and glib personalities).
