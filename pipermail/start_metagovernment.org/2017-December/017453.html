Like what the US congress spends the majority of their time on? Stuff
like renaming post offices and declaring &quot;national [insert your cause
here] day&quot;? I would predict (and prescribe) that the queue-keeper
simply not allow that kind of non-substantive proposal onto the queue.
Most of these kinds of things probably don't need to be done at all,
but the Manager could always do them by executive order based on input
from traditional public-opinion polling, slacktivism sites, etc. The
People's time is far too valuable to waste it on non-substantive
proposals.

&gt;<i> We would have never passed gay marriage
</I>&gt;<i> for instance. Nothing risky, sometimes a little risk is worth it even it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have the highest approval rating. No risk we don't shift or evolve.
</I>
There are several corrections for this already built into the system:

1) By controlling the number of proposals in the queue we can also
control the passage ratios (fewer proposals in the queue will push
through those with smaller supermajorities).

2) The Manager and/or queue-keeper can put something in the #2 slot
directly, forcing a vote for it in two weeks. This I would hope would
be a rarely used feature, reserved for cases where a timely decision
is required (natural disasters, declarations of war, etc.)

3) The versioning feature encourages refinement of proposals to secure
larger supermajorities. This would certainly allow passage of things
like abortion and gun control policies in the US with significant
supermajorities. We've just never been given the opportunity to
compromise on these things because of the way extremists have been
controlling them.

4) I sort of agree with Ed's position here: Sometimes things are not
ready to be decided yet and no amount of proposal tweaking will get
you a supermajority. In those cases it's probably better to let a
continued debate and the passage of time solve the problem rather than
having the government (Tyranny of the Tiny Majority) force the issue.
By making the debate (and the zeitgeist) visible to everyone, The
System would actually be an accelerating force for this type of moral
progressivism. Social media *could* have played this role, but
unfortunately people have walled-off their friend/follow lists to such
a degree that other social media sites now actually prevent it from
happening. There's specifically no way to block posts in proxyfor.me
to prevent this sort of echo-chamber behavior from stopping progress.

&gt;<i> I think it's important to rock the boat a little. I'd vote for more votes in
</I>&gt;<i> the week.
</I>
It seems reasonable, and perhaps even necessary, to me to support
votes on multiple proposals each week (although this isn't supported
currently). But I also believe that the weekend-close schedule is a
key feature that can't be eliminated without disenfranchising a
substantial portion of the population (the proxy-vote correction for
this notwithstanding). There's a reason why most places in the US only
allow voting on a weekday and with limited hours...

    Scott
