So what? You're going to deny them the right to do what they want
within their community? Sounds pretty authoritarian to me.

I'd propose just the opposite: If even a simple majority of them want
to accept a payment that will allow some company to turn their
locality into a chemical or nuclear wasteland, it's not up to us
outsiders to tell them they can't do that. Furthermore I believe we'd
be obligated to help them remove and relocate the resisters. Living in
civilization obligates each of us to do certain things, and what those
things are can be ascertained by simply taking a vote (although of
course that vote must ascertain the preferences of 100% of the
population, not just the &quot;active participants&quot;).

&gt;<i> In an open system where any interested party can participate, things only
</I>&gt;<i> happen when all those people reach the best decision together. The nuclear
</I>&gt;<i> power company can&#8217;t bully itself into a community; but it can work with
</I>&gt;<i> everyone who has a concern and find a great way to build their facility that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone&#8217;s happy with. It may take longer, but the result will be worth the
</I>&gt;<i> wait.
</I>
Wrong: What you're (again) proposing is dictatorship: When The People
are forced to try to live within a system that doesn't work (i.e.,
doesn't render decisions that benefit them) they inevitably end up
electing Hitler or Trump or some other authoritarian who promises to
&quot;drain the swamp&quot; or whatever will get them out of their current rut.

While I try to give the proponents of &quot;consensus&quot; like Ed the benefit
of the doubt, I often find it hard to believe that anyone could be
that ignorant and naive. I inevitably end up entertaining the
possibility that deep down they really are just authoritarians and
*want* the system to fail so that some &quot;Great Leader&quot; can come along
and tell them what to do. This post combined with his last post (his
characterization that automatically calculating proxies is &quot;forcing&quot;
people to vote) is just another example of that: Ed doesn't want a
system that gives equal weight to each individual's preferences, he
wants a system where the best and the brightest (the &quot;active
participants&quot;) make all the decisions, and to hell with the rest of
us.
