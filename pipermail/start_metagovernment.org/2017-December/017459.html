I&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;re referencing the same design idea Scott

As I see it, an Executive Council would be necessary to build and regulate any significantly large, crowdsourced governance mechanism.

A global platform with several million, or possibly several hundred million users would need extensive, qualified oversight. 

At that scale, I imagine dozens if not hundreds of proposals would arrive daily. Ok, I admit this is an unsubstantiated guess, but I&#8217;m just not sure where to get data on a self-organizing-global-network of human beings creating, deliberating, and voting on proposals together. I may be overestimating how active a Network of that size and scope would be, but I&#8217;m quite sure we&#8217;re not talking about what might be on the docket for a weekly City Council or HOA meeting.  

But let&#8217;s say that only a few dozen proposals arrive each day. Some may be short like the ones currently on pf.m&#8230;but more likely, they will be lengthly documents that cover items like staffing requirements, budget outlines, design criteria, and detailed, long-term projections of the benefit any given proposal would provide those who would be voting on it. So many proposals&#8230;so many details&#8230;.unbelievable numbers of details. (So many that vetting proposals would likely become an Agency of it&#8217;s own.)

And, in my mind, people will only want to vote on proposals that have been thoroughly researched by real people or institutions that they can *visibly* locate and easily track (read trust). I&#8217;m sure some people right from the get-go would be comfortable delegating their decisions to proxies operating behind a wall of algorithms run by bots. And I would bet that as time passes, more and more people would be comfortable with that set up&#8230;.if they found it was reliable and trustworthy. 

In the beginning though, the level of trust required for some (maybe most) people to send off qualitative personal data to a cloud on the internet so some other person who they&#8217;ll never see or know anything about can vote for them, would be substantial. And unfortunately, hackers and scammers will likely keep that fear in play for some time&#8230;I'm guessing. 

Proposals would also need to be vetted in order to keep the platform from being inundated with spurious, non-sensical, and poorly written manifestos. Allowing proposals that are not meaningful, concise, focussed, and reasonably well-constructed would be the second best way to discourage overall voter participation. To have a *Stack* cluttered with proposals that are vague, inaccurate, badly written, and not based on any actual facts would be a real buzz kill, imo. 

E.g. Let&#8217;s say some Nationalist group from Alabama submits a proposal to segregate the southern Confederate states and declare them as an International Sanctuary for white-skinned people of European origin. In their proposal they cite numerous bogus studies about the inferiority of non-white people and blather on for pages about how whites are discriminated against around the world. The budget they cite to achieve this barbaric regression is minuscule compared to what the actual costs would be, and the claimed net-effect their proposal would provoke is simple-minded, one-sided, and very limited in scope. 

My guess is that a such proposal would just linger in the proposal Stack because the opposition to it would be so insurmountable. It might though have enough support to suck a polarized electorate into a very lengthly deliberation and thus draw attention away from other proposals more relevant to the *Priority* of the collective *Global Body*. So why bother with that detritus when certain filters or vetting criteria, defined by the electorate, could be employed by an elected Executive Oversight Council to prevent this kind of old paradigm garbage from cluttering up our platform?

Obviously these filters and criteria would be mostly, if not entirely, subjective. So the vetting process would need to reflect the *Values and Priorities* of the electorate through which these criteria would be derived.

In my mind, &quot;We the People&quot; would need to develop a document that describes the core values of the Global Body. A Declaration of Inter-dependence, if you will. These Values would likely be based on principles like Freedom, Respect, Security, Equality, and Justice, to name a few. I imagine many of the Values inscribed in this document would immediately nix a proposal such as the one mentioned above, if there were a vetting process provided by an Executive Oversight Council.

Also, in my version a *Template* would be provided for proposal creation and submission delineating the various elements and criteria necessary for constructing a well-written proposal. Using The Template would be mandatory and it would be based on a subset of values, like brevity, clarity, methodical referencing of source material, accurate budgeting and cost analysis, reliable description or depiction of the net effect(s) should adoption of the proposal take place, and so on. 

As I see it, a Template *Agency* would be staffed in order to provide individuals and groups with assistance in the proposal development process because proposals would be the main drivers of the Organization and augmenting their successful formulation and submission would be key. And&#8230;.if the Executive Oversight Council were an elected body, with a very strict mandate, and we had the ability to fire them, at any point in their term, with one simple vote&#8230;.I would trust them to vet proposals according to the crowdsourced Values and Priority of the collective Global Body.



&gt;<i> 2) While I don't see the need for this type of monkeying around with
</I>&gt;<i> thresholds (much better, as I've said, to incentivize the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> authors to seek high supermajorities), if it *does* turn out to be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary or even desirable, is there some other way we could
</I>&gt;<i> implement this feature? Could it be automated? Could the
</I>&gt;<i> variable/threshold choice be included in the proposal itself, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> as a sort of progressive-implementation plan? For example, larger
</I>&gt;<i> supermajorities cause either an acceleration of the implementation, or
</I>&gt;<i> cause additional features to be automatically added to the to-do
</I>&gt;<i> list&#8230;
</I>

What better way to incentivize proposers than to make the process simple with clear guidelines and a staff to facilitate and encourage proposal development?
Oh, and a global crowd-funded Foundation to support projects born from their proposals.

I see six Agencies necessary to manage a global *organism* of this mandate.

1. The Template - as described above.

2. The Index - a crowdsourced continuously evolving indicator of the Networks *Priority* in a ranked stack format with various descriptors.

3. The Ballot - This is where proxyfor.me would set up shop. The Ballot would have a voting as well as a pledging function.

4. The Foundation - To manage the currency of the Network as well as it&#8217;s investments, donations, endowments, and profits. And, as mentioned above, to provide project financial support.

5. The Scales - This Agency would manage the Public Discourse platform. It would also function as a Magistrate for the Network...and ultimately as a Global  Tribunal as well.

6. The  Database - Multiple tasks here. Records of all proceedings, contracts, and agreements, minutes from meetings, copies of proposals, and so on would be stored here. It would also be the Proposal Vetting Agency, and it would have a Journalistic Branch to keep the Network abreast of the Real News. and so on&#8230;.


Then there&#8217;s just two Oversight Councils (one for the Structure and one for the Process), a Declaration of Values, a Mandate&#8230;..and a mass of creative, newly empowered human beings.  That&#8217;s it.  :)


As together we choose, together it will be.
