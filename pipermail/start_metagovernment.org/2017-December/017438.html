&gt;<i> Hi Scott, et al,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any decentralized online governance system that provides access to local, regional, international and global referendums will likely have more proposals scheduled for deliberation and a vote, at any given time, than any individual or small group of individuals could rationally and practically respond to in a timely and reliable manner.
</I>
I firmly believe this to be false, and stand by my analysis that one
or two votes a week will be sufficient to do *more* than what
governments at all levels do now. Of course I do expect there to be
some consolidation as part of this evolution: There are way too many
levels of government now, and there's virtually no justification for
it other than &quot;that's the way it's always been done&quot;, and which
results in us continuing to use a system that was designed to be run
on horseback. I also expect that the executive branch will handle even
more of the day-to-day operations than they do now, albeit with the
ability of The People to override bad decisions (the executive branch
already does *way* more than most people realize, particularly in the
area of trying to fine-tune business and environmental regulation, but
with almost no oversight or ability for The People to correct for
their mistakes).

&gt;<i> It seems to me that citizens wanting to participate *at all levels* of discussion and decision-making would need to enlist a small army of proxies in order to cover all of their bases in any form of global democracy. Personally, I don&#8217;t yet see a problem with this...but I&#8217;m wondering how others might imagine this playing out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that's what they do now: They're usually called
&quot;representatives&quot;, even though they are not &quot;representative&quot; of the
people, nor do they even claim to make any of their decisions based on
what is best for The People or what The People would choose to do if
they were given actual power.

&gt;<i> I think having a battery of proxies for the various geographical and topical regions or sectors one belongs to would be a solution to the overburden of research and participation one would necessarily encounter at this scale of involvement.
</I>
I think this misses the point: Any time you allow people to pick and
choose what level or even what issue to participate in, you end up
with &quot;Tyranny of the Active Participants&quot;, my correction to what most
people seem to fear as the mischaracterization &quot;Tyranny of the
Majority&quot;. Proxy selection must be automatic, and the proxies must not
be preselected by the individual or (as in the case of juries) by some
sort of government appointment. Otherwise all you've done is re-create
misrepresentative government.

&gt;<i> One might employ a proxy for local issues (with perhaps a backup should their first choice be unavailable) and several more for regional (environmental, political, scientific, social, technological, etc) issues and concerns. Ones proxy choice for environmental issues may be unconcerned with educational issues, or be so involved in the environmental arena that they just don&#8217;t have time to track anything else in a reasonable or acceptable manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts?
</I>
It's a non-starter: People are not competent to choose their
proxies/representatives/delegates, something that has been clearly
demonstrated by the failure of all the Liquid Democracy runs, and
indeed of misrepresentative democracies in general, to implement
anything even vaguely resembling &quot;The Willl of the People&quot;. My point
is that it's simply not necessary or even desirable that each person
actively participate in every decision or at every level or even to
have the knowledge and skill to choose a true representative. All we
have to do is to make sure that the ultimate vote cast for each person
is the same as what they would have cast if they *did* actively
participate in each decision. Fortunately this is a *much* simpler
problem to solve than to try to somehow make sure that the active
participants are actually representative of The People.
  Regards,
    Scott
