&gt;<i> A single figurehead, at the top of a global organization of the

</I>
I guess it's an empirical question, but IMHO you've *vastly*
over-estimated the power of an executive that only serves at the Will
of The People and could be removed next weekend by a simple vote.
Worse your proposed solution to this merely theoretical problem
(decisionmaking by committee) is to cripple the system to prevent it
from working properly in *any* situation.

&gt;<i> That said, if the a majority of the electorate felt that a single
</I>&gt;<i> figurehead/executive was a better way to do business, then that would become
</I>&gt;<i> the new Executive Structure. I just wouldn&#8217;t want to front load it with that
</I>&gt;<i> because of the reasons stated above.
</I>
Well, of course people would have to vote to approve the new system,
but wouldn't it be better if we *designed* it right in the first place
to reduce the number of these on-the-fly redesigns?

&gt;<i> There would be enough Councilors for there to be an effective delegation of
</I>&gt;<i> functions. This of course would depend entirely on the demands placed on
</I>&gt;<i> this body. (Actually there are two bodies that perform the Executive
</I>&gt;<i> function as I mentioned previously: one for the Process and one for the
</I>&gt;<i> Structure).
</I>
I restate my claim that it's a junta/politburo, then. Which have been
proven to be not only ineffective in a managerial sense, but because
they can always claim that they're &quot;representing&quot; the people, they're
far more likely to abuse their power than a single executive would be,
at least when there is even any hint of The People's power acting as a
constraint (e.g., US presidents have proven to be far less risky than
dictators, and yet presidents are *very* hard to removed by comparison
with Managers as I have proposed).

&gt;<i> Corporations are a different animal with a different mandate and a different
</I>&gt;<i> set of priorities.
</I>
Priorities, sure, but to claim that the executive branch of government
needs to operate in some manner different from hierarchy (i.e.,
government operations are just qualitatively different from
corporations, the military, etc.), you're making a fundamental error
IMHO. Where's the proof, or even the theory, that this is necessary?

&gt;<i> What I&#8217;m talking about is a self-organizing
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making platform whose sole purpose is to support the *Proposal* of
</I>&gt;<i> a sovereign People.
</I>
Sounds *very* slippery to me: Unless there is a *direct* coupling
between the Will of The People and the decisions rendered, you've
merely recreated oligarchy.

&gt;<i> The People are the legislators. They make the proposals, and decide on them
</I>&gt;<i> as well. The Executive Oversight Council exists strictly to administer the
</I>&gt;<i> decisions of the People. (Maybe it would be less confusing if they were
</I>&gt;<i> called the *Administrative* Oversight Council?)
</I>
I struggle with this too: Most people don't even understand the
difference between the executive and legislative branches. Not that
this is all their fault: Our current systems have the two mixed
together to a far larger degree than is optimal, let alone necessary.
But I'd stick with &quot;executive&quot; which is the more technically-correct
term.

&gt;<i> I have absolutely no interest in comparing this to something that&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> currently existing. I&#8217;ll leave that to others to whom that matters. Again,
</I>&gt;<i> this is a novel way of organizing humanity and, as the adage says, &quot;You
</I>&gt;<i> can&#8217;t put new wine into old skins.&#8221;
</I>
I struggle with *this* too, but I predict you're going to have to do
this in the end because very few people will be able to do it
themselves. If you don't do it, they' just dismiss your proposals out
of hand because they'll make the simplest comparisons (as perhaps I
have with the junta/council/committee thing).

(snip)

&gt;<i> From Wikipedia, &quot;Peer review is generally considered necessary to academic
</I>&gt;<i> quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no
</I>&gt;<i> means prevent publication of invalid research. Traditionally, peer reviewers
</I>&gt;<i> have been anonymous, but there is currently a significant amount of open
</I>&gt;<i> peer review, where the comments are visible to readers, generally with the
</I>&gt;<i> identities of the peer reviewers disclosed as well.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And one could argue that if there were more transparency, we wouldn&#8217;t have
</I>&gt;<i> so much corruption in the current peer review process.
</I>
I'd agree that perhaps we don't need to be as obsessive about
preserving anonymity as journals are, but neither do we want to swing
the pendulum very far to the other side as you have proposed: As a
rule of thumb people should always be encouraged to prioritize the
quality of the argument over the credentials of the source. And of
course if they can't do either, they should trust in their proxies
more than in *any* argument or source that they don't have the time to
properly research.

&gt;<i> As I said earlier, I&#8217;m proposing that the electorate have the option to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the Council, &quot;in whole, or in part&quot;, if they deem it appropriate and
</I>&gt;<i> have the votes to do so. My guess is that replacing the entire Council would
</I>&gt;<i> happen only under a very extreme circumstance, if ever.
</I>
But you haven't explained how we're supposed to figure out which
components of the Council are malfunctioning, or how we go about
removing and then replacing them...

&gt;<i> I&#8217;m talking about designing the next iteration of our *Social Medium*. A
</I>&gt;<i> place where a global People can gather online to connect and co-create our
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative human endeavor, together. As I see it, it will need to be
</I>&gt;<i> interesting, informative, empowering, and coherent if it&#8217;s going to be at
</I>&gt;<i> all successful.
</I>
Sounds to me like the same kind of &quot;active participant&quot; based system
that we've already tried and found wanting. Indeed, with the &quot;Council&quot;
apparently making many of the most important decisions themselves and
with The People having very limited awareness of their motivations or
hard control over them, it's really no different that the kinds of
oligarchies that &quot;active participant&quot;-based systems seem to always
devolve into.
