Subject: [MG] Global challenges finalists
Message-ID: <CACobxW3WxVbk6LTO-k9vhCg-jtk-JGRaBSZBNO6VYV-h3=XkVA@mail.gmail.com>

The Global Challenges competition finalists and their abstracts and
author bios have been published at:
https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/finalists

The only one I found sort of interesting was the one that proposes to
use AI to augment the proposal generation process. You can read more
at the product web site:
http://www.swae.io/

Of course I think that one too has the wrong end of the stick: Our
main problem isn't with the proposal generation process, it's with the
decisionmaking (voting) process, particularly the unequal
participation rate issue. Exactly none of the entries even address
this, although a couple do use the term "liquid democracy" as if it
were some sort of magic wand (and of course we all know by now that
not only is it not magic, it doesn't even work at all).

A lot of them also seem to violate the "acceptable to the powers that
be" rule that I struggled so much with, but I guess we'll have to read
the full proposals to see how they finesse their way around this.

Anyone think any of these have any chance of even getting implemented,
let alone working as promised?
  Regards,
    Scott

Hi everybody,
I went too far, I do not know if we still understand each other. Anyway I
hope somebody will find this interesting.
1.Let us be vague at first and say that the goal of existence is goodness (
8-| , 8D )
2. "definition":   goodness = happiness  + future generations happiness +
(animal happiness)
3. Measuring happiness!: How are you? Answer on a scale from 0-10.
Happiness is measurable!
4. Now we have a variable that we would like to maximize, but we need to
find some independent variables that maximize it.
5. Any data may be useful, but some are more likely to be useful, like data
from your smartphone sensors, your selected search results etc. = big data
6. So, we got dependent variable and independent variables. Now, we need a
way to intervene. Here comes the mediacentric theory. It is not
bulletproof, but it has a power.
7. We need a smaller sector than the whole media to start with. Let's find
the most effective. I suggest it is the Internet and on the Internet
*search engines*.
8. There is a way how to build Goodness search engine (for marketing
purposes I call it Happiness Search Engine). Would you like to build it?

I hope you will ask for more. Imagine that I would write it in detail, who
would read it? :D

Cheers

Maybe it's a translation issue I'm not sure "happiness" is what you
want to use here. There's lots of research in this area that shows
that "happiness" is relatively rare, very hard to measure (all kinds
of reporting biases), and not generally considered to be a reasonable
goal. I think we can learn something from the popularity of religions
here: Do they all promise "happiness"? No, they generally promote
peace, harmony, and well-being. I'd even put political and economic
ideals (freedom, power, success, satisfaction of desires, etc.) or
even simple stress reduction ahead of "happiness" as goals.

I'm also increasingly tending to discount "future generations" as an
issue because it's generally an example of replism
(http://www.matchism.org/matchism-code/) and so not a worthy goal in
itself. People should work to protect the future that *they* will
have, but worrying about their genetic descendants is at best a waste
of time and at worst counterproductive because it results in failure
to solve *today's* problems because you've piled on tomorrow's as
well.

Not counting reporting bias, of course, which is a *huge* problem,
especially if you want to compare success toward achieving the goal
across cultures.

I'm not sure I follow this, but it looks to me like it runs right
smack into the cross-cultural problem above.

I'm inclined to consider this issue in the "how many angels can dance
on the head of a pin" category: We don't need to measure any of these
things, we just need to empower individuals to make public policy
decisions. What they choose is what's important, not the label you
might try to attach to it.

Scott,
I am glad you wrote, good ideas. But for me, some meaningful interaction
after a longer time. The rest is in text...

With happiness I refer to "subjective well-being" to this collection
https://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/
As a method of measurement I like smartphone Experince Sampling Method.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method

I some sense you are right, but I hope this article will calm your worries
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300332706_What_We_Have_Learnt_About_Happiness

True, not a good goal for an individual, the intention of happiness ruins a
lot of happiness ;). But as a measure it should be ok.

for society, it is not the same happiness and it includes a lot from peace,
harmony, well-being, freedom, success, satisfaction.

Sure, it is not so much important as it seems in the equation. Still it has
some secondary importance, IMHO.

As far as I know there is only a few possible reporting biases.
Misunderstanding question. Forced answer (somebody answering on one's
bahalf). Inability to admit unhappiness, ego issue. But that is not ruining
it, these are acceptable biases.

No, to do it properly, we do need to measure it :D Not just believe we are
doing it correct :)

What they choose is not the best :/. And there is the voting mehtod issue :/
