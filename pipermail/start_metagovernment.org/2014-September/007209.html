<PRE>Michael was clearly onto something when he blanked the home page: it gave us a strong incentive to work on a solution. Now that I took the intermediate step of publishing text on the page, the urgency has declined quite a bit hasn&#8217;t it?

So I suggest we take an even bolder next step: gather together a pool of money and decide what we&#8217;re going to do with it. A large enough pot of money should provide a strong incentive (ideally, I&#8217;d like to see on the order of US$20,000, though even a few thousand would probably be a big enough carrot to get us to fight over it with some good fervor). I&#8217;m not really in a place to put up that kind of prize by myself, but I was thinking we could crowdfund the prize. 

What do you think?

And if you like the idea, do you have ideas on how to amass a crowdfunded prize? Or another way to gather a pile of cash for this purpose? I was looking at Kickstarter, and they seem to be very finite-project-oriented and may not accept something so open-ended as: &#8220;Create a cash prize and let an open community use open governance software to decide how to spend it.&#8221;

Regardless, note that crowdfunding sites don&#8217;t do much to publicize projects. So if we start one, we need to also have a publicity plan to get it recognized and to incentivize people to contribute.
