<PRE>Please, in trying to make sense of all this super-interesting discussion I
ask if someone can confirm my understanding:
1 sociocracy without hierarchy is very close if not equal to direct
democracy?
2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it does I did
not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
The new governance system that I am interested to develop and this is what
I believe that an e-democracy system should do is to extract and
consolidate consensus of millions (why not billions) of participants around
issues may this is to fix the toilet in a government building as to fix
supranational or world issues like global warming.
I will definitely vote for the toilet solution only if is the one where I
need to pee because I work in that specific building, I will probably vote
for the one related to the global warming but I will only vote for the many
solutions I will understand and abstain if I have no clue, because I am
sure that the neighbor that does have a clue will decide for me. I am not
delegating my vote, I will just not oppose the one I do not understand it,
does it sound like a sociocracy rule? I guess, I hope and I believe that
the majority of the people that do understand will take the best decision.
I doubt that particular interest can lobby and change this from happening.
To close I sense that another interesting discussion will be discussed here
but little will be done to find how we can implement the best of direct
democracy, and the best of sociocracy into a flexible and adaptable
governance system that can solve toilet flush and carbon dioxide related
problem.
Kind Regards to all and welcome to Gustavo

PS: I wonder if, in this dream system, we can add also the best of
dictatorship! I will not mind given the dictator is a person with superior
integrity! Rare case but not impossible :-)

&gt;<i> &gt;The problems come when *public* decisions are made in a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;little control over the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You would be right in most cases, but I it does not apply in a truly
</I>&gt;<i> sociocratic govrenance system. And I tell you this from personal
</I>&gt;<i> experience. Sociocratic organizations are not imposed; they are founded
</I>&gt;<i> upon the principle that no one objects it. Therefore, those at the top
</I>&gt;<i> agree to the fact that everyone's opinion, at any level, should be taken
</I>&gt;<i> into account at any moment. If that is not the case for a certain
</I>&gt;<i> &#176;sociocratic&quot; organization, then I would say they are not following a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;truly&quot; sociocratic model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Again, I think you're inventing a new form of government here.  Which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;is fine, but you can't use the term sociocracy to identify it because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that term is already being used to describe a different kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am really not. It seems to me you are not aware of how sociocratic
</I>&gt;<i> governance systems really work. It is also possible that my experience is a
</I>&gt;<i> different one than for others. One way or another, it only adds to the
</I>&gt;<i> point that maybe it would be better to discuss it more thoroughly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don&#8217;t imagine that a sociocratic system is the only way to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complex task of separating the functional from the structural aspects of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hierarchy. But hierarchies may serve a purpose, as leaders emerge
</I>&gt;<i> everywhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; without formal hierarchies anyway, as long as there are built-in
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for subverting the possibility of a small number of people having
</I>&gt;<i> power-over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Such as direct democracy ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree. Direct democracy does not really tackle most problems of
</I>&gt;<i> governance structure (problems related to the activities of Executive
</I>&gt;<i> offices of current political systems of developed countries, for instance),
</I>&gt;<i> as much as it tackles the problems related to decision-making structures
</I>&gt;<i> related to laws (problems related to the activities of Legislative offices
</I>&gt;<i> of current political systems of developed countries, for instance). You
</I>&gt;<i> probably would not want a national referendum approach to decide how to fix
</I>&gt;<i> the toilet in a government building! And thats fine! Direct democracy does
</I>&gt;<i> not fix all the problems we have in governance systems, neither does
</I>&gt;<i> sociocracy. But sociocracy does tackle more of the structural problems than
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy, as far as I know (or think I know).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;How many is too many? 2?  Maybe 3?  By the time you get enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;leverage that sociocracy has an organizational advantage over direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;democracy, you've institutionalized the problem of authoritarians
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rising to power (just like our current systems do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may have a point, but it is up for discussion. I think you may be
</I>&gt;<i> right that in most cases sociocracy has a decision-making disadvantage over
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy. However, the sociocratic organizational structure is
</I>&gt;<i> WAAAAAAAAY better than most other governance systems, while direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy does not really deal with the governance structure problems at
</I>&gt;<i> all (this should really be discussed in more depth...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have argued before that I do not believe there is a single best
</I>&gt;<i> governing or decision-making model which fits for every circumstance.
</I>&gt;<i> Organizing a community with 20 people is much different than organizing a
</I>&gt;<i> country with millions; or billions! I believe the model that works for the
</I>&gt;<i> first will not work for the second. Metagovernment is somewhat interested
</I>&gt;<i> in new governance systems for more complex communities, as far as the main
</I>&gt;<i> page statement goes. Therefore two really difficult problems are
</I>&gt;<i> intertwined, which are the structure of governance and the decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> process of governance. I think they should be discussed separately to come
</I>&gt;<i> to fruitful conclusions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as governance structures goes, I would say hierarchic structures
</I>&gt;<i> with more than five levels would be too many... It is not written in stone,
</I>&gt;<i> is just a personal feeling (based on limited experience). A general rule of
</I>&gt;<i> mine would be that the less levels, the better. Therefore, no hierarchy is
</I>&gt;<i> better, insofar as the community is somewhat small enough so that everyone
</I>&gt;<i> can be heard in a practical way. But most organizations have a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> people, which makes it very unpractical to hear everyone in a way that they
</I>&gt;<i> will feel heard. Therefore in some cases hierarchical governance systems
</I>&gt;<i> may prove to be a better solution. Heck, the people should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> choose it or not, and I know that in some cases people will willingly let
</I>&gt;<i> someone else decide for them in good will. That is the point of being
</I>&gt;<i> politically free!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, as good as hierarchical systems could become, I would argue that
</I>&gt;<i> most organizations (of any kind) with more than 4 hierarchy levels will
</I>&gt;<i> have problems, regardless of size, which are usually both structural
</I>&gt;<i> problems of management and decision making problems per se. I believe this
</I>&gt;<i> is why some people are so attracted to the enlightened dictator fantasy,
</I>&gt;<i> because it is so simple; management (dictatorship) is very straightforward,
</I>&gt;<i> and decision-making (centralized in the enlightened) would be exerted in a
</I>&gt;<i> supposedly &quot;good&quot; way for everyone. Of course this is not true, and the
</I>&gt;<i> problem is both in structure and decision-making. This is also why direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy is so appealing to many other people; like in enlightened
</I>&gt;<i> dictatorships decision-making is exerted in a supposedly &quot;good&quot; way for
</I>&gt;<i> everyone (albeit through direct voting by everyone in the community).
</I>&gt;<i> However, direct democracy systems usually does not really deal with
</I>&gt;<i> governance structure. And since direct democracy does not really deal with
</I>&gt;<i> governance structure issues, this is also why direct democracy can easily
</I>&gt;<i> co-exist with hierarchical structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another important aspect mentioned earlier is that the decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> problems of Executive offices of political systems is very different from
</I>&gt;<i> the problems of Legislative offices to enact, amend and repeal laws. Direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy usually focuses on the Legislative issues related to laws (and
</I>&gt;<i> rightfully so!) and, therefore, are more or less unrelated to the
</I>&gt;<i> structural problems of hierarchy inside governance systems (which is more
</I>&gt;<i> of a problem in the Executive branch).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In conclusion, I think the discussion on sociocracy may help with the
</I>&gt;<i> issues related to structure more so than direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Besides, I would think that discussing sociocracy is not out of the realm
</I>&gt;<i> of Metagovernment goals anyway (&quot;...We explore, challenge, and collaborate
</I>&gt;<i> with each other in the development of various ideas and technologies for
</I>&gt;<i> these new governance systems....&quot;).

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that we study HOW does Sociocracy work (in the details, not in vague
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; comparison &quot;like a soviet system&quot; - false, btw) before entering into
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; evaluation of it. And how can it be made better or discarded
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see any specific information in your post about *how* it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different from the soviet system, so that'd be a good place to start.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for &quot;how it works&quot;, near as I can tell it's theoretical because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there haven't been any large-scale implementations of it.  You're not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> going to start seeing these problems if you've only got a couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> levels so we're pretty much limited to making theoretical arguments at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this point.  Which I think is what I've convincingly done: If you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't understand RWA and SDO, you're going to miss a lot of the
