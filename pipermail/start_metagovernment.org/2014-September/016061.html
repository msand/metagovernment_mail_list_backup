&gt;<i> Please, in trying to make sense of all this super-interesting discussion I
</I>&gt;<i> ask if someone can confirm my understanding:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 sociocracy without hierarchy is very close if not equal to direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy?
</I>
Umm, I think the proposal was to keep the social organization of
sociocracy but add some sort of global decisionmaking option (i.e., a
vote, as in direct democracy).  In which case my claim (and I think
Gustav's) is that it's not sociocracy anymore....

&gt;<i> 2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it does I did
</I>&gt;<i> not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
</I>
It definitely does: Direct Democracy is just the legislative branch of
government.  I've not seen any compelling evidence that the
three-branch system (executive, judicial, legislative) has any
inherent or insurmountable problems.  This is actually a second
crucial flaw in the design of sociocracy because there *are* no checks
and balances like that.  But then, again, this is why it resembles the
soviet system more than a democracy.

Not to say that there aren't crucial flaws in most existing
implementations of the three-branch system: It's just stupid to have
the executive branch be an elected position because the things that
make a good executive are completely opposed to what would make them
electable.  Plus, at least we in the US give our executives (president
and governors) far more power than they should have (Obama waging an
undeclared war on ISIS being a classic example).  The executive should
be a bureaucratic position without the ability to make or even
interpret any new laws.  This is actually the way most City
governments in the US are run, so we do have precedent that works much
better than politics at the state or national level.

&gt;<i> The new governance system that I am interested to develop and this is what I
</I>&gt;<i> believe that an e-democracy system should do is to extract and consolidate
</I>&gt;<i> consensus of millions (why not billions) of participants around issues may
</I>&gt;<i> this is to fix the toilet in a government building as to fix supranational
</I>&gt;<i> or world issues like global warming.
</I>
Agreed, although I'd hope that most of the toilet fixing would
actually be handled by the executive branch.  Only when there is some
sort of systematic failure should The People be required to step in
and either replace the manager, or make a new law that more precisely
governs their actions.

&gt;<i> I will definitely vote for the toilet solution only if is the one where I
</I>&gt;<i> need to pee because I work in that specific building, I will probably vote
</I>&gt;<i> for the one related to the global warming but I will only vote for the many

</I>&gt;<i> that the neighbor that does have a clue will decide for me. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> delegating my vote, I will just not oppose the one I do not understand it,
</I>&gt;<i> does it sound like a sociocracy rule?
</I>
No: In a sociocracy the circle responsible for that particular toilet
would be responsible for maintaining it.  And the authoritarians at
the top level would probably just decide not to do anything about
anything fuzzy like global warming because it simply wouldn't be worth
their trouble (authoritarianism being a more &quot;adapt to change&quot; (or
&quot;exploit change&quot;) rather than &quot;fight to resist it&quot; kind of mindset).

&gt;<i> I guess, I hope and I believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the people that do understand will take the best decision. I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt that particular interest can lobby and change this from happening.
</I>&gt;<i> To close I sense that another interesting discussion will be discussed here
</I>&gt;<i> but little will be done to find how we can implement the best of direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, and the best of sociocracy into a flexible and adaptable
</I>&gt;<i> governance system that can solve toilet flush and carbon dioxide related
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards to all and welcome to Gustavo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I wonder if, in this dream system, we can add also the best of
</I>&gt;<i> dictatorship! I will not mind given the dictator is a person with superior
</I>&gt;<i> integrity! Rare case but not impossible :-)
</I>
Benevolent dictatorship I agree *is* the most efficient form of
government.  The claim in The Plan, though, is that no human is
capable of doing it, so we'll have to wait until an AI capable of
taking this on is eventually built.  Having studied in this area
extensively (I actually dropped out of the AI PhD program here at CU
in favor of getting a degree in Cognitive Psychology) I'm not holding
my breath as IMHO it will be a century or more before this will be
possible.

A few more points about Gustavo's message, and sociocracy in general:

1) With a maximum circle size of 40, it would require 3 levels to
govern a small city, 4 a state, 5 a country (US) and 6 for the world
as whole.  Any of these numbers are sufficient to engage the
authoritarian-filtering characteristics of sociocracy.

2) It's simply handwaving to say that we can have different classes of
government at different levels because there is no way to implement
such a system.  We either design to handle everything from a city to
the world, or we're just wasting everyone's time.

3) I still can't help thinking of Santa Clause every time I hear
&quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; proposed as a tenet of government.  Believe
in magic all you want, but it's still not going to make it true: Other
than the aforementioned benevolent dictator, there *is* no viable
alternative to voting for decisionmaking except in extremely limited
homogeneous populations.  And to make this all the more damning, I
still have yet to find a single published experiment in the social
sciences (social psychology, political economics, whatever) that could
lead anyone to believe otherwise.  Want to win a Nobel Prize?
Providing a refutation of this claim would be a great entry in either
the Peace or Economics categories...
  Regards,
    Scott
