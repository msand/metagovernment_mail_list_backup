<PRE>Hi Ed,

Speaking for myself, I continue to &quot;feel the urgency&quot; that we (humanity, 
nature, future generations) need a better global social system than we 
have now. (Needing a better public-matter decision system is one part of 
that.)

Feeling that urgency, I then try to use my meager resources (time, 
skills, focus, etc.) as seems to me best to try to bring about that 
better social system.

Ed wrote:

    We could look at it a different way: don't raise the case prize, but
    rather assume it already exists. If we were to spend a bunch of
    money on developing something for this community, what would it be?
    If we come up with a good enough answer to that question, then
    actually finding the money may not be too difficult.

Last I heard, the Apple corporation is sitting on $160 billion dollars 
that they cannot find profitable uses for. That is the global social 
system that we are living in. The money that is potentially available 
for new development is mostly in the hands of people who have no 
interest in a better world.

I have proposed a design for a new global social system (Isonomea), and 
a strategy for implementing it. Scott has proposed a design for a new 
global social system (ThePlan), and a strategy for implementing it. 
Others have advanced designs and partial designs as well.

I agree with you that if &quot;we&quot; (the Metagovernment community) could come 
up with a good enough design for a new global social system (that we all 
agreed upon), then actually finding the money to begin developing it 
might not be too difficult.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     putting money into the mix at this point would help that process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     at all, and the motivation provided by blanking the home page

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In various of my Vilfredo proposals, I listed numerous

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So I suggest we take an even bolder next step: gather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         together a pool of money and decide what we're going to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         with it. A large enough pot of money should provide a strong
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         incentive (ideally, I'd like to see on the order of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         US$20,000, though even a few thousand would probably be a big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         enough carrot to get us to fight over it with some good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         fervor). I'm not really in a place to put up that kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         prize by myself, but I was thinking we could crowdfund the prize.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         What do you think?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And if you like the idea, do you have ideas on how to amass a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         crowdfunded prize? Or another way to gather a pile of cash
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         for this purpose? I was looking at Kickstarter, and they seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to be very finite-project-oriented and may not accept
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         something so open-ended as: &quot;Create a cash prize and let an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         open community use open governance software to decide how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         spend it.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Regardless, note that crowdfunding sites don't do much to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         publicize projects. So if we start one, we need to also have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a publicity plan to get it recognized and to incentivize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         people to contribute.
