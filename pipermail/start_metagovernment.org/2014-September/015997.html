<PRE>My thought is that we should concentrate on exploring and mapping our 
agreements and disagreements concerning foundational principles and 
framings and strategies and such (that is, regarding metagovernment 
sorts of issues). I don't see that putting money into the mix at this 
point would help that process at all, and the motivation provided by 
blanking the home page suggests that it is not really necessary.

In various of my Vilfredo proposals, I listed numerous fundamental 
issues that we could explore and discuss together, and that would need 
to be settled as part of the run-up to any joint money-gathering attempt 
or any joint attempt to spend money.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I suggest we take an even bolder next step: gather together a pool of money and decide what we&#8217;re going to do with it. A large enough pot of money should provide a strong incentive (ideally, I&#8217;d like to see on the order of US$20,000, though even a few thousand would probably be a big enough carrot to get us to fight over it with some good fervor). I&#8217;m not really in a place to put up that kind of prize by myself, but I was thinking we could crowdfund the prize.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if you like the idea, do you have ideas on how to amass a crowdfunded prize? Or another way to gather a pile of cash for this purpose? I was looking at Kickstarter, and they seem to be very finite-project-oriented and may not accept something so open-ended as: &#8220;Create a cash prize and let an open community use open governance software to decide how to spend it.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, note that crowdfunding sites don&#8217;t do much to publicize projects. So if we start one, we need to also have a publicity plan to get it recognized and to incentivize people to contribute.
