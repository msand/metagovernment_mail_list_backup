&gt;<i> The ability to see the difference between two proposal is FUNDAMENTAL. And we still don't have a diff included mostly because I have not yet found a diff that works on complex edit (you know, the ones that have bold, and italic). If you could find one that would be great.
</I>
I didn&#8217;t know what a &quot;diff&quot; was until I read about it the other day. I stumbled around Google searching for a &quot;diff with complex edit&#8221; and couldn&#8217;t find anything. I&#8217;m not really sure where to find something like that.

&gt;<i> [Regarding] the option to mutate instead of having new proposals: this has two things. You already can click on a proposal and have an edit box where you write a new proposal with the edit box pre-filled with the old proposal elements. When you do this you also can read the comments the old proposal received. So this sounds a lot like what you were asking, so I suspect you never learned how to do that, which would be a UI problem.
</I>
Yes, I found and used that feature. What I&#8217;m thinking of is an easy way to edit a proposal as a *comment* suggestion to the author for the next generation. I would like to have this for *up voting* (or agreeing to) a proposal as well.  e.g. &quot;I like this proposal, but I would like it a lot better if it had the following changes&#8230;&#8221;.  (Displayed in  a 'diff&#8217; format of course.)

&gt;<i> A different request would be to change a proposal after it has already been voted. So the mutated version would take the place of the old one. Now this simply cannot be accepted because it goes against one of the fundamental principle in Vilfredo which makes sure that if you support a proposal, that will not change (so you end up supporting something different).
</I>
Right. That&#8217;s not what I was suggesting. 

There are 2 similar but separate items to my feedback:

1 - In the voting phase, display *mutant* and original proposals (together) in a &#8216;diff&#8217; format so one can easily see the changes or differences between the mutant and the original&#8230;.without having to do a lot of scrolling and re-reading of entire proposals.

2 - Allow editing (or mutation) as a *comment* or suggestion for the next generation. (This of course could be done by copy and pasting and changing the color of the mutated text&#8230;.but that&#8217;s a lot of work.)

And...it would probably make sense to have it separate to prevent overwhelming the *disagree* comment section. Maybe have the option (whether agreeing or disagreeing) to click on a *suggested mutation* button. There could be a separate column for this next to the *disagree* comments with the option for others to *like* a mutation suggestion.  

In other words, whether agreeing or disagreeing with a proposal, one could suggest changes by editing the proposal in a diff format which would be located in a separate column, maybe in between the disagree comments and the (?) comments. 

The intent of both suggestions is to make the voting and mutation process easier and more efficient for all participants in order to move more quickly from one generation to the next. I see voter burnout as one of biggest hurdles to overcome with Vilfredo.
