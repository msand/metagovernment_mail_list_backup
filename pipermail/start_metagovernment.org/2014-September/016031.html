<PRE>In my eyes, metagovernment.org should be an organization that evolves
theoretical foundations and most importantly, programs them into software
or helps already existing software projects to incorporate those, so that
they can interact with other projects (API based).

The process we already follow is nice. we pose fundamental questions and
the current tools are WIKI and MAIL combined with a few other tools,e.g
vilfredo ...

Now from what we learn about the process in every day discussions with each
other, those &quot;elements of the process&quot; that work really well, should be
figured out and added to the &quot;theoretical foundations&quot; to be used to
progressively ENHANCE our existing tools, by adding &quot;new features&quot; or
linking them to other tools, etc...

This can ONLY be done, if we enhance our literacy, which is the literacy of
the future, which is programming.
Once, only a few people could read and write, today only few can program.
Not everyone who can read and write is a world class writer, but in order
to actively participate at all, its MANDATORY to be able to read and
write.... i think the same is true, or especially TRUE for advancing
&quot;government&quot; in general through the means of the internet.

So, i strongly believe, that all those projects which are currently going
on should be using a GITHUB repository, which is currently the &quot;de facto&quot;
standard of open source hosting and we should start &quot;collaborating&quot; on REAL
CODE, making PULL REQUESTS...

...that means, learning to program,but some people can also write
translations or write comments or being &quot;testers&quot; or writing &quot;howtos&quot; in
the README files.... but in any way, it would teach a lot and it would
finally keep us moving, even though it might be &quot;snail speed&quot;,its better
than &quot;no speed&quot;
