<PRE>My.  I will trump your scientism with my pythogorian mysticism.   Woo.  Woo.

Axiom of choice says every collection is a set.  If this applies to the
mundane world then every arbitrary collection is not only homogeneous but
it includes all the items that are homogeneous, excluding none improperly.

I suppose I need to say the axiom does have physical reality.  But the
matter is a bit complex.

But all the collections you will come across are homogeneous and the
understanding and usefulness of this is limited by the computational
capability of the universe.  Notice that the word in question then become
meaningless in scientism.

You might want to think about how 5000 people can get together and reach
consensus by treating that as outside of scientism.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please, in trying to make sense of all this super-interesting discussion
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ask if someone can confirm my understanding:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1 sociocracy without hierarchy is very close if not equal to direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Umm, I think the proposal was to keep the social organization of
</I>&gt;<i> sociocracy but add some sort of global decisionmaking option (i.e., a
</I>&gt;<i> vote, as in direct democracy).  In which case my claim (and I think
</I>&gt;<i> Gustav's) is that it's not sociocracy anymore....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it does I did
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not understand even what Direct Democracy is!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It definitely does: Direct Democracy is just the legislative branch of
</I>&gt;<i> government.  I've not seen any compelling evidence that the
</I>&gt;<i> three-branch system (executive, judicial, legislative) has any
</I>&gt;<i> inherent or insurmountable problems.  This is actually a second
</I>&gt;<i> crucial flaw in the design of sociocracy because there *are* no checks
</I>&gt;<i> and balances like that.  But then, again, this is why it resembles the
</I>&gt;<i> soviet system more than a democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to say that there aren't crucial flaws in most existing
</I>&gt;<i> implementations of the three-branch system: It's just stupid to have
</I>&gt;<i> the executive branch be an elected position because the things that
</I>&gt;<i> make a good executive are completely opposed to what would make them
</I>&gt;<i> electable.  Plus, at least we in the US give our executives (president
</I>&gt;<i> and governors) far more power than they should have (Obama waging an
</I>&gt;<i> undeclared war on ISIS being a classic example).  The executive should
</I>&gt;<i> be a bureaucratic position without the ability to make or even
</I>&gt;<i> interpret any new laws.  This is actually the way most City
</I>&gt;<i> governments in the US are run, so we do have precedent that works much
</I>&gt;<i> better than politics at the state or national level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The new governance system that I am interested to develop and this is
</I>&gt;<i> what I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe that an e-democracy system should do is to extract and
</I>&gt;<i> consolidate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus of millions (why not billions) of participants around issues
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is to fix the toilet in a government building as to fix
</I>&gt;<i> supranational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or world issues like global warming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, although I'd hope that most of the toilet fixing would
</I>&gt;<i> actually be handled by the executive branch.  Only when there is some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of systematic failure should The People be required to step in
</I>&gt;<i> and either replace the manager, or make a new law that more precisely
</I>&gt;<i> governs their actions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will definitely vote for the toilet solution only if is the one where I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to pee because I work in that specific building, I will probably
</I>&gt;<i> vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the one related to the global warming but I will only vote for the
</I>&gt;<i> many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solutions I will understand and abstain if I have no clue, because I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the neighbor that does have a clue will decide for me. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delegating my vote, I will just not oppose the one I do not understand
</I>&gt;<i> it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does it sound like a sociocracy rule?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No: In a sociocracy the circle responsible for that particular toilet
</I>&gt;<i> would be responsible for maintaining it.  And the authoritarians at
</I>&gt;<i> the top level would probably just decide not to do anything about
</I>&gt;<i> anything fuzzy like global warming because it simply wouldn't be worth
</I>&gt;<i> their trouble (authoritarianism being a more &quot;adapt to change&quot; (or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;exploit change&quot;) rather than &quot;fight to resist it&quot; kind of mindset).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess, I hope and I believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority of the people that do understand will take the best decision. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doubt that particular interest can lobby and change this from happening.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To close I sense that another interesting discussion will be discussed
</I>&gt;<i> here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but little will be done to find how we can implement the best of direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy, and the best of sociocracy into a flexible and adaptable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; governance system that can solve toilet flush and carbon dioxide related
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind Regards to all and welcome to Gustavo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS: I wonder if, in this dream system, we can add also the best of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dictatorship! I will not mind given the dictator is a person with
</I>&gt;<i> superior
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; integrity! Rare case but not impossible :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Benevolent dictatorship I agree *is* the most efficient form of
</I>&gt;<i> government.  The claim in The Plan, though, is that no human is
</I>&gt;<i> capable of doing it, so we'll have to wait until an AI capable of
</I>&gt;<i> taking this on is eventually built.  Having studied in this area
</I>&gt;<i> extensively (I actually dropped out of the AI PhD program here at CU
</I>&gt;<i> in favor of getting a degree in Cognitive Psychology) I'm not holding
</I>&gt;<i> my breath as IMHO it will be a century or more before this will be
</I>&gt;<i> possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few more points about Gustavo's message, and sociocracy in general:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) With a maximum circle size of 40, it would require 3 levels to
</I>&gt;<i> govern a small city, 4 a state, 5 a country (US) and 6 for the world
</I>&gt;<i> as whole.  Any of these numbers are sufficient to engage the
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian-filtering characteristics of sociocracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's simply handwaving to say that we can have different classes of
</I>&gt;<i> government at different levels because there is no way to implement
</I>&gt;<i> such a system.  We either design to handle everything from a city to
</I>&gt;<i> the world, or we're just wasting everyone's time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I still can't help thinking of Santa Clause every time I hear
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; proposed as a tenet of government.  Believe
</I>&gt;<i> in magic all you want, but it's still not going to make it true: Other
</I>&gt;<i> than the aforementioned benevolent dictator, there *is* no viable
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to voting for decisionmaking except in extremely limited
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous populations.  And to make this all the more damning, I
</I>&gt;<i> still have yet to find a single published experiment in the social
</I>&gt;<i> sciences (social psychology, political economics, whatever) that could
</I>&gt;<i> lead anyone to believe otherwise.  Want to win a Nobel Prize?
</I>&gt;<i> Providing a refutation of this claim would be a great entry in either
</I>&gt;<i> the Peace or Economics categories...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
