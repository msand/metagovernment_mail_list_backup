<PRE>Apologies for bailing early on the conference: We're in the middle of
remodeling and so it's hard to take big chunks of time out from the
middle of the day (the wife was painting and can't reach the ceiling
;-)  But I wanted to get my 2 cents worth in on sociocracy.

If you've read my proposed plan you can probably guess what I'm going
to say, but sociocracy to me looks like SDA paradise.  It's exactly
the kind of hierarchy that social dominators and authoritarians would
create for themselves if they wanted something that provided the
*appearance* of egalitarianism without having to sacrifice any real
power.  It's also quite reminiscent of &quot;soviets&quot;, the small groups of
workers that the Soviet Union was supposed to be built on, which also
I think provides us with good predictive ability as to its failure
modes.

What happens in these hierarchical small-group based organizations is
that they act like filters, only allowing the most authoritarian
and/or socially dominant individuals to rise to the top of their small
circle and get passed up the chain to the higher level circles, which
repeat the process.  So by the time you get to the top level, all that
are left are the most ruthless individuals who will have no qualms
about imposing their &quot;guidelines&quot; on everything below them.  Whether
you call them &quot;the junta&quot; or just &quot;the Party&quot;, they're the ones that
set the rules that will aid people like them in their goal of staking
out power at whatever level they're able to rise to (e.g., joining
&quot;the Party&quot; will quickly become one of the requirements).

As for consensus, that too is how the soviets were supposed to work.
But as it turns out it's easy to manufacture consensus when speaking
out against the party line gets you demoted (or whacked).  Through all
of this you should keep in mind Altemeyer's findings on how
Authoritarians are actually the most likely to take part in this sort
of retribution, and also, inconveniently enough, they're also the most
susceptible to corruption, which means even if they don't have a dog
in the fight they can be easily bought when necessary.

Long story short, besides being archaic (we have the ability to
organize large groups using technology now), sociocracy is simply a
bad design for running an organization at any level of technological
development because it doesn't account for SDA behavior.
  Regards,
    Scott
