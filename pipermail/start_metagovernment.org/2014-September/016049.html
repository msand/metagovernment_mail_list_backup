<PRE>Scott,

The structure for the future in my novels is nothing like this. The books are a long slug. But you can skim the chapters, read what most interests you and then get the world reorg stuff in the last 4 chapters ( out of 54 total ). If you want a free ebook, just let me know.

I've been reading (or rereading) various utopian/dystopian novels
lately and so far have been amazed by how consistent they are in terms
of how the government is organized: They're all hierarchical and
authoritarian!  Most shocking for me was rereading Walden Two, which
supposedly is the most egalitarian and rationally-organized society of
them all.  But who runs that place?  A group of six &quot;Planners&quot;, who
not only aren't elected by the population (they's selected by the
Managers, the authoritarians the next level down) but seemingly don't
even have any accountability to them.  Skinner was obviously not big
on political science (or he wouldn't have specified an even number of
Planners ;-) but I'm still stunned by his complete inability to
anticipate that giving six people who *want* to be in charge (i.e.,
they're SDAs) unregulated power would inevitably result in corruption,
oppression, war, and eventually the demise of the organization.  I'd
be inclined to thinkk that this kind of benevolent-dictator fantasy
must have some sort of instinctive basis were it not for the fact that
LPA bands (aboriginal people who live like humans did prior to the
development of agriculture) *aren't* typically organized this way.

My list so far is Plato's Republic, Thomas More's Utopia, Bacon's New
Atlantis, Brave New World, 1984, Walden Two, and The Giver (with
limited input from a wide variety of other sci fi books/movies/tv
shows.  Oh, and I also reread The Prince and Mein Kampf, just to see
how the other half lives ;-).  Anybody know of any others,
particularly any that include some description of a non-hierarchical
government?
 Regards,
   Scott
