<PRE>Scott,

I would agree that if a zero tolerance policy with hierarchy is the goal,
then sociocracy is not your best alternative.

But it is not as bad as you make it look; especially if you are to use
&quot;Soviet&quot; in the same sentence. It is NOT the same kind of organization they
would have in communist parties and organizations. It works very
democratically and usually accounts for everyone's opinion if there are not
many levels of hierarchy. It may be much less effective if you have too
many hierarchy levels, though, because then I could easily foresee that the
bottom level would seldom have a saying at the top level decisions.

Again, I would agree that sociocracy will not help if you have a zero
tolerance with hierarchy. However, I would argue that decision-making
processes is quite different from systems of social organization. It is
entirely possible to have a hierarchical organization where decision-making
processes are made through direct voting of all its members. Thus, socially
hierarchic structures is only indirectly related to the possibility of a
small number of people having power-over everyone else.

Sociocracy in particular have an organization system AS WELL AS a
decision-making process. They are different things and should be discussed
as such.

My personal taking is that hierarchy is not intrinsically bad, especially
if you combine it with a decision making process which takes everyone's
opinion into account. It may combine the potential efficiencies that arise
from the expertise of functional leaders with the wisdom and emergent
qualities of sharing decision power.

I don&#8217;t imagine that a sociocratic system is the only way to accomplish the
complex task of separating the functional from the structural aspects of
hierarchy. But hierarchies may serve a purpose, as leaders emerge
everywhere without formal hierarchies anyway, as long as there are built-in
mechanisms for subverting the possibility of a small number of people
having power-over everyone else.

Regards,

Gustavo Menezes
