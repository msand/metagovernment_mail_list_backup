<PRE>I will not have the opportunity to put money right now into a proposal as I
am too busy trying to find the survival resources, but the idea I believe
will work best if we find one principle and we set a goal to achieve, with
or for it.
The principle should not be related to a metagovernment but to life.
This will put the group to a real test in finding priority.
Recently in a mail there was this suggestion... and I find it real
challenging.
Peace
Jacopo

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looking at Kickstarter, and they seem to be very finite-project-oriented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and may not accept something so open-ended as: &#8220;Create a cash prize and let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an open community use open governance software to decide how to spend it.&#8221;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regardless, note that crowdfunding sites don&#8217;t do much to publicize
