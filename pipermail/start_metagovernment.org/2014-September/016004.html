<PRE>You will find it in programming.
On &quot;Github&quot;, a popular coding plattform, you can have &quot;diffs&quot; for two
versions of the same program to see which lines of code were
added/changed/removed. its pretty common when you do programming.

Github is also the plattform that i personally think is most advanced when
it comes to those kind of tools we are talking about, just that github is
not very &quot;user friendly&quot; if you think of non-programmers...

</I>&gt;<i> The ability to see the difference between two proposal is FUNDAMENTAL. And

</I>&gt;<i> italic). If you could find one that would be great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn&#8217;t know what a &quot;diff&quot; was until I read about it the other day. I
</I>&gt;<i> stumbled around Google searching for a &quot;diff with complex edit&#8221; and
</I>&gt;<i> couldn&#8217;t find anything. I&#8217;m not really sure where to find something like
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Regarding] the option to mutate instead of having new proposals: this has
</I>&gt;<i> two things. You already can click on a proposal and have an edit box where
</I>&gt;<i> you write a new proposal with the edit box pre-filled with the old proposal
</I>&gt;<i> elements. When you do this you also can read the comments the old proposal
</I>&gt;<i> received. So this sounds a lot like what you were asking, so I suspect you
</I>&gt;<i> never learned how to do that, which would be a UI problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I found and used that feature. What I&#8217;m thinking of is an easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> edit a proposal as a *comment* suggestion to the author for the next
</I>&gt;<i> generation. I would like to have this for *up voting* (or agreeing to) a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal as well.  e.g. &quot;I like this proposal, but I would like it a lot
</I>&gt;<i> better if it had the following changes&#8230;&#8221;.  (Displayed in  a 'diff&#8217; format
</I>&gt;<i> of course.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A different request would be to change a proposal after it has already
</I>&gt;<i> been voted. So the mutated version would take the place of the old one. Now
</I>&gt;<i> this simply cannot be accepted because it goes against one of the
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental principle in Vilfredo which makes sure that if you support a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, that will not change (so you end up supporting something
</I>&gt;<i> different).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. That&#8217;s *not* what I was suggesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are 2 similar but separate items to my feedback:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - In the voting phase, display *mutant* and original proposals
</I>&gt;<i> (together) in a &#8216;diff&#8217; format so one can easily see the changes or
</I>&gt;<i> differences between the mutant and the original&#8230;.without having to do a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of scrolling and re-reading of entire proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - Allow editing (or mutation) as a *comment* or suggestion for the next
</I>&gt;<i> generation. (This of course could be done by copy and pasting and changing
</I>&gt;<i> the color of the mutated text&#8230;.but that&#8217;s a lot of work.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And...it would probably make sense to have it separate to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelming the *disagree* comment section. Maybe have the option (whether
</I>&gt;<i> agreeing or disagreeing) to click on a *suggested mutation* button. There
</I>&gt;<i> could be a separate column for this next to the *disagree* comments with
</I>&gt;<i> the option for others to *like* a mutation suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, whether agreeing or disagreeing with a proposal, one could
</I>&gt;<i> suggest changes by editing the proposal in a diff format which would be
</I>&gt;<i> located in a separate column, maybe in between the disagree comments and
</I>&gt;<i> the (?) comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The intent of both suggestions is to make the voting and mutation process
</I>&gt;<i> easier and more efficient *for all participants* in order to move more
</I>&gt;<i> quickly from one generation to the next. I see voter burnout as one of
</I>&gt;<i> biggest hurdles to overcome with Vilfredo.
