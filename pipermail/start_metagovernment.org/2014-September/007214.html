<PRE>One piece of feedback I had for Vilfredo was to be able to alter (or mutate) a proposal without having to submit an entirely new proposal.  Having to scroll back and forth between several similar proposals while trying to figure out what was different in each one of them was kind of frustrating for me. 

This was just posted on the Loomio - Feature Ideas group. I think this combined with Vilfredo would be a really useful set up. 

These first 2 screenshots are from quip.com




&gt;<i> Loomio Community - Feature Ideas
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Realtime Collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> by Jacob Gadikian
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My two bits in terms of feature requests is most certainly realtime collaboration on nearly any document that loomio can serve. Realtime collaboration is something I have seen used via my organization's quip account to really positive effect countless times.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a gut feeling it's going to work out quite well here, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there plans in the works for this?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I think it is something that will make loomio more fun and really help it to attract users to its deliberative process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  	
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal: Integrate Realtime collaboration wherever possible
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> by Jacob Gadikian
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because of its positive effect on user engagement, Loomio should integrate realtime collaboration features wherever possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have your say
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agree - Abstain - Disagree - Block
</I>&gt;<i> 	Jacob Gadikian agreed on the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> Quip.com has taught me the power of real-time collaboration very, very well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Ryan Gillespie agreed on the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Alanna Krause 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is quite high on the roadmap: <A HREF="https://trello.com/c/qeGivEzn">https://trello.com/c/qeGivEzn</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Expect a big update in this space later this year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is important to you, can you expand a bit on how you'd see it working? What would your ideal user experience be?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Alanna Krause agreed on the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> I agree this will make Loomio much more engaging
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Jacob Gadikian 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really happy to do that. I'm going to need about a week or so to get to know loomio to make some recommendations. I'd like to let you know about my use-case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm starting the 21C Dawn Foundation, a guiding body for a resilient mesh of project-oriented corporations that exchange equity with one another to enhance member individuals and corporations ability to take risk. Once I saw Loomio, I knew I'd found something really special. TOday, we use quip for nearly everything, and likely will until Loomio supports the level of interactivity that we desire. Today, we use quip for everything-- from to-do lists to decision-making, and of course, for collaboration, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone else out there has experience with Loomio in a business setting, I'd really like to hear it :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Alanna Krause 
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds really great @jacobgadikian ! My main experience with Loomio has been in business settings. Check out this blog for a bit more on that: <A HREF="http://blog.loomio.org/2014/06/17/management-hacker-gary-hamel-interviews-loomio/">http://blog.loomio.org/2014/06/17/management-hacker-gary-hamel-interviews-loomio/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Phill Coxon agreed on the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds rad!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 	Jacob Gadikian 
</I>&gt;<i> I am very interested in how you scaled up in size. What tools supported the scaling? Obviously there was a ton of sheer human networking, but I am guessing that you had some sort of a plan as you moved up in terms of members?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 150 is about the cap for us. We are not opposed to going above that, but at that number we would hope to form several 75-150 person &quot;cores&quot; so that each &quot;core&quot; or &quot;cluster&quot; could have genuine knowledge of the other members.
