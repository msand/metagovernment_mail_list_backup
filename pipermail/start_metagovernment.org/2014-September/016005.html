<PRE>Ned, I understand your position, but where&#8217;s the urgency now? The blanking of the homepage was a nuclear option that worked once, but what next? Do we just blank it again? It seems to me that a real tangible reward provides a really nice incentive (and a positive one, not a negative one).

Jacopo, a similar reply. I agree that we need to continue working on finding some core principles, or yes even just one. But I think we&#8217;d work harder if there were a bigger incentive. What if you had the chance to get &#8364;50,000 to work on Airesis for a year? Perhaps this group could agree to provide you that money. (We&#8217;d just need to find a way to raise the money first.)

We could look at it a different way: don&#8217;t raise the case prize, but rather assume it already exists. If we were to spend a bunch of money on developing something for this community, what would it be? If we come up with a good enough answer to that question, then actually finding the money may not be too difficult.

</I>&gt;<i> Recently in a mail there was this suggestion... and I find it real challenging.

</I>&gt;<i> My thought is that we should concentrate on exploring and mapping our agreements and disagreements concerning foundational principles and framings and strategies and such (that is, regarding metagovernment sorts of issues). I don't see that putting money into the mix at this point would help that process at all, and the motivation provided by blanking the home page suggests that it is not really necessary.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In various of my Vilfredo proposals, I listed numerous fundamental issues that we could explore and discuss together, and that would need to be settled as part of the run-up to any joint money-gathering attempt or any joint attempt to spend money.

</I>&gt;<i> Michael was clearly onto something when he blanked the home page: it gave us a strong incentive to work on a solution. Now that I took the intermediate step of publishing text on the page, the urgency has declined quite a bit hasn&#8217;t it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I suggest we take an even bolder next step: gather together a pool of money and decide what we&#8217;re going to do with it. A large enough pot of money should provide a strong incentive (ideally, I&#8217;d like to see on the order of US$20,000, though even a few thousand would probably be a big enough carrot to get us to fight over it with some good fervor). I&#8217;m not really in a place to put up that kind of prize by myself, but I was thinking we could crowdfund the prize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if you like the idea, do you have ideas on how to amass a crowdfunded prize? Or another way to gather a pile of cash for this purpose? I was looking at Kickstarter, and they seem to be very finite-project-oriented and may not accept something so open-ended as: &#8220;Create a cash prize and let an open community use open governance software to decide how to spend it.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, note that crowdfunding sites don&#8217;t do much to publicize projects. So if we start one, we need to also have a publicity plan to get it recognized and to incentivize people to contribute.
