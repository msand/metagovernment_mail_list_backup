I actually don't have a problem with hierarchy per se, and there are
lots of places where it is the optimal organizational structure (the
military being the most important, but I argue in my book that even
government and corporations will be organized this way for the most
part).  The problems come when *public* decisions are made in a
hierarchical structure because those at the bottom end up having too
little control over the process.

&gt;<i> But it is not as bad as you make it look; especially if you are to use
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Soviet&quot; in the same sentence. It is NOT the same kind of organization they
</I>&gt;<i> would have in communist parties and organizations. It works very
</I>&gt;<i> democratically and usually accounts for everyone's opinion if there are not
</I>&gt;<i> many levels of hierarchy. It may be much less effective if you have too many
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy levels, though, because then I could easily foresee that the
</I>&gt;<i> bottom level would seldom have a saying at the top level decisions.
</I>
How many is too many? 2?  Maybe 3?  By the time you get enough
leverage that sociocracy has an organizational advantage over direct
democracy, you've institutionalized the problem of authoritarians
rising to power (just like our current systems do).

&gt;<i> Again, I would agree that sociocracy will not help if you have a zero
</I>&gt;<i> tolerance with hierarchy. However, I would argue that decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> processes is quite different from systems of social organization. It is
</I>&gt;<i> entirely possible to have a hierarchical organization where decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> processes are made through direct voting of all its members. Thus, socially
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchic structures is only indirectly related to the possibility of a
</I>&gt;<i> small number of people having power-over everyone else.
</I>
I think this is not a reasonable interpretation of the design of
sociocracy.  I do see a little bit of wiggle room here between the
social and decision-making properties, but I think you're overselling
it: There *is* a hierarchy of decisionmaking in sociocracy, which IMHO
is inherently problematic.

&gt;<i> Sociocracy in particular have an organization system AS WELL AS a
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making process. They are different things and should be discussed
</I>&gt;<i> as such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My personal taking is that hierarchy is not intrinsically bad, especially if
</I>&gt;<i> you combine it with a decision making process which takes everyone's opinion
</I>&gt;<i> into account. It may combine the potential efficiencies that arise from the
</I>&gt;<i> expertise of functional leaders with the wisdom and emergent qualities of
</I>&gt;<i> sharing decision power.
</I>
Again, I think you're inventing a new form of government here.  Which
is fine, but you can't use the term sociocracy to identify it because
that term is already being used to describe a different kind of
system.

&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t imagine that a sociocratic system is the only way to accomplish the
</I>&gt;<i> complex task of separating the functional from the structural aspects of
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchy. But hierarchies may serve a purpose, as leaders emerge everywhere
</I>&gt;<i> without formal hierarchies anyway, as long as there are built-in mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> for subverting the possibility of a small number of people having power-over
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else.
</I>
Such as direct democracy ;-)
