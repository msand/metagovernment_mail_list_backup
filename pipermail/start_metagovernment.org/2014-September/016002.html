<PRE>Dear Steve,
thanks for the feedback.

The ability to see the difference between two proposal is FUNDAMENTAL. And
we still don't have a diff included mostly because I have not yet found a
diff that works on complex edit (you know, the ones that have bold, and
italic). If you could find one that would be great.

Respect the option to mutate instead of having new proposals: this has two
things. You already can click on a proposal and have an edit box where you
write a new proposal with the edit box pre-filled with the old proposal
elements. When you do this you also can read the comments the old proposal
received. So this sounds a lot like what you were asking, so I suspect you
never learned how to do that, which would be a UI problem.

A different request would be to change a proposal after it has already been
voted. So the mutated version would take the place of the old one. Now this
simply cannot be accepted because it goes against one of the fundamental
principle in Vilfredo which makes sure that if you support a proposal, that
will not change (so you end up supporting something different).

So, if you could help us with a diff that would be great. And the mutation
part sure.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     *Alanna Krause*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is quite high on the roadmap: <A HREF="https://trello.com/c/qeGivEzn">https://trello.com/c/qeGivEzn</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expect a big update in this space later this year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since this is important to you, can you expand a bit on how you'd see it
</I>&gt;<i> working? What would your ideal user experience be?
</I>&gt;<i>     *Alanna Krause* *agreed on the proposal*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree this will make Loomio much more engaging
</I>&gt;<i>     *Jacob Gadikian*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm really happy to do that. I'm going to need about a week or so to get
</I>&gt;<i> to know loomio to make some recommendations. I'd like to let you know about
</I>&gt;<i> my use-case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm starting the 21C Dawn Foundation, a guiding body for a resilient mesh
</I>&gt;<i> of project-oriented corporations that exchange equity with one another to
</I>&gt;<i> enhance member individuals and corporations ability to take risk. Once I
</I>&gt;<i> saw Loomio, I knew I'd found something really special. TOday, we use quip
</I>&gt;<i> for nearly everything, and likely will until Loomio supports the level of
</I>&gt;<i> interactivity that we desire. Today, we use quip for everything-- from
</I>&gt;<i> to-do lists to decision-making, and of course, for collaboration, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone else out there has experience with Loomio in a business setting,
</I>&gt;<i> I'd really like to hear it :)
</I>&gt;<i>     *Alanna Krause*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds really great @jacobgadikian ! My main experience with Loomio has
</I>&gt;<i> been in business settings. Check out this blog for a bit more on that:

</I>&gt;<i> Sounds rad!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very interested in how you scaled up in size. What tools supported
</I>&gt;<i> the scaling? Obviously there was a ton of sheer human networking, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> guessing that you had some sort of a plan as you moved up in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> members?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 150 is about the cap for us. We are not opposed to going above that, but
</I>&gt;<i> at that number we would hope to form several 75-150 person &quot;cores&quot; so that
</I>&gt;<i> each &quot;core&quot; or &quot;cluster&quot; could have genuine knowledge of the other members.
