<PRE>Hi Scott,


&gt;<i> &gt; Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am obviously very upset by Scott's message which seems to convey HIS
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding and judgments and prejudices before you get a chance to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand how does it work and make up your mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By all means, enlighten us!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not sure if I can &quot;enlighten&quot; anyone. But if no one objects in the next 24
hours, I will then prepare a long description of my experience of
Sociocracy in the weekend when I started learning it. Then if we agree with
that (as much as I can) objective description we can start discuss the plus
and vices of such system and how it can be made better. I am confident once
this is done we will find ourselves to be much more in agreement than in
disagreement, and much better than now.

Regards,
Pietro



&gt;<i> &gt; So if no one, and Scott in particular, has no objection, I would suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we study HOW does Sociocracy work (in the details, not in vague
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comparison &quot;like a soviet system&quot; - false, btw) before entering into each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluation of it. And how can it be made better or discarded completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see any specific information in your post about *how* it's
</I>&gt;<i> different from the soviet system, so that'd be a good place to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;how it works&quot;, near as I can tell it's theoretical because
</I>&gt;<i> there haven't been any large-scale implementations of it.  You're not
</I>&gt;<i> going to start seeing these problems if you've only got a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> levels so we're pretty much limited to making theoretical arguments at
</I>&gt;<i> this point.  Which I think is what I've convincingly done: If you
</I>&gt;<i> don't understand RWA and SDO, you're going to miss a lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> potential problems here.  Again I recommend Altemeyer's book The
</I>&gt;<i> Authoritarians:
