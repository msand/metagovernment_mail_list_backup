By all means, enlighten us!

I don't see any specific information in your post about *how* it's
different from the soviet system, so that'd be a good place to start.

As for &quot;how it works&quot;, near as I can tell it's theoretical because
there haven't been any large-scale implementations of it.  You're not
going to start seeing these problems if you've only got a couple of
levels so we're pretty much limited to making theoretical arguments at
this point.  Which I think is what I've convincingly done: If you
don't understand RWA and SDO, you're going to miss a lot of the
potential problems here.  Again I recommend Altemeyer's book The
Authoritarians:
