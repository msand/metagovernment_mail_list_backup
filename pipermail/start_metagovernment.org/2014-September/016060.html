<PRE>Hi Jacopo,

I'll try to describe sociocracy in the next days, as I promised.
In the meantime:

</I>&gt;<i>

Absolutely not. DIrect democracy is based on voting, and doing what the
majority wants. Sociocracy uses a different system not related with voting.

 Please abstain from guess work. I will try to write down my understanding
asap.

And Gustav who has obviously more experience to work inside a sociocratic
organization can correct me.


2 does direct democracy need executive officers? Because if it does I did
&gt;<i> not understand even what Direct Democracy is!

&gt;<i> I believe that an e-democracy system should do is to extract and

</I>&gt;<i> I will definitely vote for the toilet solution only if is the one where I

</I>&gt;<i> for the one related to the global warming but I will only vote for the many
</I>&gt;<i> solutions I will understand and abstain if I have no clue, because I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure that the neighbor that does have a clue will decide for me. I am not
</I>&gt;<i> delegating my vote, I will just not oppose the one I do not understand it,
</I>&gt;<i> does it sound like a sociocracy rule? I guess, I hope and I believe that
</I>&gt;<i> the majority of the people that do understand will take the best decision.
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that particular interest can lobby and change this from happening.
</I>&gt;<i> To close I sense that another interesting discussion will be discussed
</I>&gt;<i> here but little will be done to find how we can implement the best of
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy, and the best of sociocracy into a flexible and adaptable
</I>&gt;<i> governance system that can solve toilet flush and carbon dioxide related
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards to all and welcome to Gustavo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I wonder if, in this dream system, we can add also the best of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;The problems come when *public* decisions are made in a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;little control over the process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You would be right in most cases, but I it does not apply in a truly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sociocratic govrenance system. And I tell you this from personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience. Sociocratic organizations are not imposed; they are founded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> upon the principle that no one objects it. Therefore, those at the top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agree to the fact that everyone's opinion, at any level, should be taken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into account at any moment. If that is not the case for a certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#176;sociocratic&quot; organization, then I would say they are not following a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;truly&quot; sociocratic model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Again, I think you're inventing a new form of government here.  Which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;is fine, but you can't use the term sociocracy to identify it because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;that term is already being used to describe a different kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am really not. It seems to me you are not aware of how sociocratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance systems really work. It is also possible that my experience is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different one than for others. One way or another, it only adds to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point that maybe it would be better to discuss it more thoroughly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I don&#8217;t imagine that a sociocratic system is the only way to accomplish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; complex task of separating the functional from the structural aspects of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hierarchy. But hierarchies may serve a purpose, as leaders emerge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everywhere
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; without formal hierarchies anyway, as long as there are built-in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mechanisms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for subverting the possibility of a small number of people having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power-over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Such as direct democracy ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I disagree. Direct democracy does not really tackle most problems of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance structure (problems related to the activities of Executive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offices of current political systems of developed countries, for instance),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as much as it tackles the problems related to decision-making structures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related to laws (problems related to the activities of Legislative offices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of current political systems of developed countries, for instance). You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably would not want a national referendum approach to decide how to fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the toilet in a government building! And thats fine! Direct democracy does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not fix all the problems we have in governance systems, neither does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sociocracy. But sociocracy does tackle more of the structural problems than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democracy, as far as I know (or think I know).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;How many is too many? 2?  Maybe 3?  By the time you get enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;leverage that sociocracy has an organizational advantage over direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;democracy, you've institutionalized the problem of authoritarians
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;rising to power (just like our current systems do).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may have a point, but it is up for discussion. I think you may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right that in most cases sociocracy has a decision-making disadvantage over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democracy. However, the sociocratic organizational structure is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WAAAAAAAAY better than most other governance systems, while direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy does not really deal with the governance structure problems at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all (this should really be discussed in more depth...).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have argued before that I do not believe there is a single best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governing or decision-making model which fits for every circumstance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Organizing a community with 20 people is much different than organizing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> country with millions; or billions! I believe the model that works for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first will not work for the second. Metagovernment is somewhat interested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in new governance systems for more complex communities, as far as the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page statement goes. Therefore two really difficult problems are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intertwined, which are the structure of governance and the decision-making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of governance. I think they should be discussed separately to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to fruitful conclusions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As far as governance structures goes, I would say hierarchic structures
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with more than five levels would be too many... It is not written in stone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is just a personal feeling (based on limited experience). A general rule of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mine would be that the less levels, the better. Therefore, no hierarchy is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better, insofar as the community is somewhat small enough so that everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be heard in a practical way. But most organizations have a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people, which makes it very unpractical to hear everyone in a way that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will feel heard. Therefore in some cases hierarchical governance systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may prove to be a better solution. Heck, the people should be able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choose it or not, and I know that in some cases people will willingly let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else decide for them in good will. That is the point of being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> politically free!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, as good as hierarchical systems could become, I would argue that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most organizations (of any kind) with more than 4 hierarchy levels will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have problems, regardless of size, which are usually both structural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems of management and decision making problems per se. I believe this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is why some people are so attracted to the enlightened dictator fantasy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because it is so simple; management (dictatorship) is very straightforward,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and decision-making (centralized in the enlightened) would be exerted in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supposedly &quot;good&quot; way for everyone. Of course this is not true, and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem is both in structure and decision-making. This is also why direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy is so appealing to many other people; like in enlightened
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dictatorships decision-making is exerted in a supposedly &quot;good&quot; way for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everyone (albeit through direct voting by everyone in the community).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, direct democracy systems usually does not really deal with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance structure. And since direct democracy does not really deal with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance structure issues, this is also why direct democracy can easily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> co-exist with hierarchical structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another important aspect mentioned earlier is that the decision-making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems of Executive offices of political systems is very different from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the problems of Legislative offices to enact, amend and repeal laws. Direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy usually focuses on the Legislative issues related to laws (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rightfully so!) and, therefore, are more or less unrelated to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structural problems of hierarchy inside governance systems (which is more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a problem in the Executive branch).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In conclusion, I think the discussion on sociocracy may help with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issues related to structure more so than direct democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Besides, I would think that discussing sociocracy is not out of the realm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Metagovernment goals anyway (&quot;...We explore, challenge, and collaborate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with each other in the development of various ideas and technologies for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these new governance systems....&quot;).

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that (as much as I can) objective description we can start discuss the plus

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So if no one, and Scott in particular, has no objection, I would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that we study HOW does Sociocracy work (in the details, not in vague
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; comparison &quot;like a soviet system&quot; - false, btw) before entering into
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; evaluation of it. And how can it be made better or discarded

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see any specific information in your post about *how* it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different from the soviet system, so that'd be a good place to start.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for &quot;how it works&quot;, near as I can tell it's theoretical because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there haven't been any large-scale implementations of it.  You're not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> going to start seeing these problems if you've only got a couple of
