</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you've read my proposed plan you can probably guess what I'm going
</I>&gt;<i> to say, but sociocracy to me looks like SDA paradise.  It's exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the kind of hierarchy that social dominators and authoritarians would
</I>&gt;<i> create for themselves if they wanted something that provided the
</I>&gt;<i> *appearance* of egalitarianism without having to sacrifice any real
</I>&gt;<i> power.  It's also quite reminiscent of &quot;soviets&quot;, the small groups of
</I>&gt;<i> workers that the Soviet Union was supposed to be built on, which also
</I>&gt;<i> I think provides us with good predictive ability as to its failure
</I>&gt;<i> modes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens in these hierarchical small-group based organizations is
</I>&gt;<i> that they act like filters, only allowing the most authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> and/or socially dominant individuals to rise to the top of their small
</I>&gt;<i> circle and get passed up the chain to the higher level circles, which
</I>&gt;<i> repeat the process.  So by the time you get to the top level, all that
</I>&gt;<i> are left are the most ruthless individuals who will have no qualms
</I>&gt;<i> about imposing their &quot;guidelines&quot; on everything below them.  Whether
</I>&gt;<i> you call them &quot;the junta&quot; or just &quot;the Party&quot;, they're the ones that
</I>&gt;<i> set the rules that will aid people like them in their goal of staking
</I>&gt;<i> out power at whatever level they're able to rise to (e.g., joining
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the Party&quot; will quickly become one of the requirements).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for consensus, that too is how the soviets were supposed to work.
</I>&gt;<i> But as it turns out it's easy to manufacture consensus when speaking
</I>&gt;<i> out against the party line gets you demoted (or whacked).  Through all
</I>&gt;<i> of this you should keep in mind Altemeyer's findings on how
</I>&gt;<i> Authoritarians are actually the most likely to take part in this sort
</I>&gt;<i> of retribution, and also, inconveniently enough, they're also the most
</I>&gt;<i> susceptible to corruption, which means even if they don't have a dog
</I>&gt;<i> in the fight they can be easily bought when necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Long story short, besides being archaic (we have the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> organize large groups using technology now), sociocracy is simply a
</I>&gt;<i> bad design for running an organization at any level of technological
</I>&gt;<i> development because it doesn't account for SDA behavior.
