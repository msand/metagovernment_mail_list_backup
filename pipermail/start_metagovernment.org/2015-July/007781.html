<PRE>A discussion I'm having over at &quot;ELECTION METHODS&quot; (electorama.com)

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Cc: Election Methods &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">election-methods at lists.electorama.com</A>&gt;

I'm sad to say, that it's hard for me to imagine what politicians could do
to improve the situation of people in their everyday life.
I can see how &quot;business&quot; can and does change the every day life of people.
It's about whether people earn money,    because *MONEY = VOTES*, it gives
people the power to vote on what they want others to do for them.
It's about whether people spend money, because *MONEY = VOTES*, it gives
people the power to vote on what they want others to do for them.

Most people have very few &quot;votes&quot; and need to earn more in order to get
more.
Most people have NO SAY in how they do business and earn money - even when
they choose their profession, the decide early in their life and transition
is not trivial.

*This is how REAL DEMOCRACY works!*
1. MONEY = VOTES
2. BUYING = VOTING
3. SELLING = BEING a CANDIDATE that others can VOTE for :-)

*AND YES...*
The way our current money works is pretty flawed and so our &quot;REAL
DEMOCRACY&quot; is pretty broken, but to make it work, the rules around
democracy (which is how money works), needs to be fixed, to make it mean
something in the ways i describe above.
The ECONOMY is our real democracy and people buy/sell every day and thus
participate EVERY DAY.
We need to UPGRADE this democracy, by:
1. fixing money (and talk about what could be fixed)
2. augmenting it with all kinds of apps/meetings/events/activities that
inform people better and guide this democracy

*The FAKE BULLSHIT (which is voting every couple of years on which party
(they are the same anyways) gets king for a period of time) has to disolve.*

This might sound radical, but please step back for a while and imagine,
that money would work not as it works today with central banks and rigged
rules (see europe/greece), but in the best possible version you could
imagine - basically some kind of utopia/fairytale currency... (which might
not be so far away from today if you have ever heard of a technology called
&quot;BLOCKCHAIN&quot;) ...so under this light, maybe what i describe as &quot;REAL
DEMOCRACY&quot; makes sense? :-)
