<PRE>Hello, 

I was rereading the Humanure handbook
<A HREF="http://humanurehandbook.com/contents.html">http://humanurehandbook.com/contents.html</A>
and at the end of chapter 8 I got idea for this email.

I was trying to understand why some of you believe in modern technology
so firmly. The Humanure handbook may be an unexpected key to it.
Perhaps we have have different understanding of our cultural
development. Perhaps you see all the scientists and you reasonably
expect that they were exploring all the major parts of human life.
But even the most basic things of major importance to human life are
still waiting for their explorer.

Of course we should consider modern technology, but we should use it
just when is it the best solution.

What do you think ?

Anyway, I making the last preparations to start an &quot;Open Association&quot;,
it will be a group of poeple that want to do something (I am living in a
boring village). I am hoping for major influence when establishing the
decision-making process. With this influence I will try to grow the the
association till reaching critical mass for something like 
<A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/agora-global-parties">http://participedia.net/en/methods/agora-global-parties</A>

And, what do you do ?

Kind regards
m.
