&gt;<i> I would like to suggest that we should try to

</I>&gt;<i> 1.maximize net *procedural* utility of social choice for
</I>&gt;<i> (average neurotypical) citizen.
</I>&gt;<i> (net = positive utility - negative utility)
</I>
Where the rubber hits the road in that article is the statement in
2.2.: &quot;In this paper, utility is measured in terms of reported
subjective well-being.&quot; I'm still thrashing on this, but am generally
leaning toward the conclusion that maximizing *subjective* well-being
is not an appropriate primary goal for government design, or social
engineering in general. Instead there has to be a balance between the
collective good and an individual's wants/needs/preferences. Otherwise
you end up with broken systems like we currently have (especially in
the US) where individual &quot;freedom&quot; means freedom to smoke, carry guns,
eat junk food to the point that they become morbidly obese, and a wide
range of other behaviors that increase &quot;subjective well-being&quot; but
clearly conflict with what The People as a whole require to have a
society that is stable, efficient, and maximally beneficial to them.
This is especially true when people are ignorant about their
Clinations (e.g., they're oblivious to the fact that it's their
genetically-derived instincts that drives them to exhibit tribalistic
behavior, a source of behavior that we otherwise generally agree
should be deprecated).

This is really the realm of philosophy rather than psychology or
economics, but the solution to the problem clearly still requires some
sort of direct democracy because that is the only way to even *assess*
the collective good (the references cited on matchism.org providing
convincing evidence that allowing &quot;representatives&quot; to determine this
is simply bad design). If you're interested in this, I recommend Owen
Flanagan's &quot;The Really Hard Problem: Meaning in a Material World&quot; as a
good overview, where he talks a lot about &quot;eudamonia&quot;: What is &quot;a good
life&quot;? He, and other philosophers, seem to generally agrees with me
that you can't answer that by just asking people if they are satisfied
or happy or whatever. Living a good life requires more than that, and
indeed directly conflicts with it in many cases.

Not that I disagree with the conclusions of the paper: It seems to me
fairly obvious that people prefer to have more control over the
systems that they must function in, and using the political power of
natives vs. foreigners in Switzerland seems to me about the best place
to look at this issue. I expect the effect size to be far larger once
we develop a general proxy-based direct democracy decisionmaking
system.

&gt;<i> 2. keep the costs within budget, where budget may range from 0 up
</I>&gt;<i> to the limits of technological development. It depends on your resources
</I>&gt;<i> and resources of your movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is all, nothing more.
</I>&gt;<i> The utility, *quality* and *quantitity* of produced decision is
</I>&gt;<i> important just as a part of procedural utility.
</I>&gt;<i> Resources are important just if you cannot &quot;pay the bill&quot; as a movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say the old performance functions are imprecise, especially those of
</I>&gt;<i> 1.maximum decisions for minimal economic costs.
</I>&gt;<i> 2.maximum quality of decision for minimal costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To sum it up, my performance fucntion is
</I>&gt;<i> most pleasurable decision-making for accepted costs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you say ? Do you think that there is something more important
</I>&gt;<i> than procedural utility ?
</I>
I'm thinking the &quot;budget&quot; you're talking about is just a measure of
economic efficiency and so probably doesn't need to be called out as a
special category. It's just one of many factors that people will use
when deciding whether a decision, or a decision-making system, is
suitable for them or not.
