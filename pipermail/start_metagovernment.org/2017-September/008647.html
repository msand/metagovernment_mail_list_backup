<PRE>I've been struggling with Russian (at least according to their IP
addresses) spammers/trolls/bots hacking into the Matchism forum for
the past few months, a problem that has gotten significantly worse
over the past few weeks. The problem is that most of the &quot;Captcha&quot;
routines have now been broken, resulting in fake accounts being
created at the rate of dozens an hour (and once an account is
&quot;verified&quot; by email they promptly fill the forum with spam and/or fake
political rants).

But I think I've got these holes plugged now and would appreciate it
if you all could help me make sure that I haven't just shut *everyone*
out. If you could create an account and make sure you can post
(nothing selling erection pills, just so I can distinguish you from
the spammers!), it'd be very helpful.

To give you something to talk about, I've posted my response to the
Democracy.earth proposal, and put up a short &quot;rules of thumb for
designing an EDD system&quot; post:
