<PRE>Scott,
thanks for saving me the trouble of reading it too!

&gt;<i> Looks like everyone else took the summer off too: I was swamped by
</I>&gt;<i> demands in RL and about the only political thing I got done was to
</I>&gt;<i> read Democracy for Realists (Achen and Bartels, 2016). Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> things will settle down and I can get back to updating proxyfor.me now
</I>&gt;<i> that the Angular developers have released version 4 which reportedly
</I>&gt;<i> has fixed many of the design flaws that were vexing me with the
</I>&gt;<i> previous version (Angular 2: Seems they skipped &quot;3&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can't say that I'd recommend the book, especially for this group
</I>&gt;<i> which is undoubtedly fully aware of all the flaws in misrepresentative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. It's criticism of direct democracy is at best half-hearted
</I>&gt;<i> and they offer exactly pretty much only one anecdotal analysis to
</I>&gt;<i> justify their dismissal of it: Apparently there was an example of The
</I>&gt;<i> People cutting fire department budgets when given direct control over
</I>&gt;<i> them in Illinois (data from Tessin 2009, which turns out to be an
</I>&gt;<i> unpublished PhD dissertation). Unfortunately although the authors
</I>&gt;<i> claim that this was a bad outcome, they offer very little in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> economic analysis to prove it. Sure, fire response times increased,
</I>&gt;<i> but they never provide any direct evidence that compared fire
</I>&gt;<i> insurance rates in these counties in Illinois with comparable counties
</I>&gt;<i> other states to prove that it was economically an unwise decision. Not
</I>&gt;<i> to mention the whole problem of expecting people to make wise
</I>&gt;<i> decisions when the only power they're given is to veto a tax increase
</I>&gt;<i> (vs. giving them total control over the budget which would allow them
</I>&gt;<i> to cut some other service to use that money to beef up fire fighting).
</I>&gt;<i> There is of course no citation of any experiments actually comparing
</I>&gt;<i> direct with representative democracy (e.g., maybe compare how often
</I>&gt;<i> major decisions are reversed in the two systems: My money would be on
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracy having a far higher failure rate by this
</I>&gt;<i> criteria). I haven't found experimental reports like that either,
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was also very disappointed that they failed to deliver on the
</I>&gt;<i> promises made by the endorsements on the dust jacket (and cited in the
</I>&gt;<i> reviews on Amazon and elsewhere): Nowhere do they propose a better
</I>&gt;<i> system, or even any way to improve our current systems beyond some
</I>&gt;<i> vague handwaving about how reducing inequality will result in better
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. Unfortunately they apparently even lack even any awareness
</I>&gt;<i> of the Catch-22 implicit in their recommendation. All in all I think
</I>&gt;<i> the title of the book should probably have been &quot;Democracy for Cynics&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About the only thing I *did* find enlightening were the
</I>&gt;<i> descriptions/examples of how demagogues take advantage of uninformed
</I>&gt;<i> voters and how they even have major impacts in the operation of
</I>&gt;<i> small-scale &quot;deliberative democracies&quot; like New England town halls
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., &quot;activerts&quot; end up making the decisions in those forums, just
</I>&gt;<i> like they do in misrepresentative democracies everywhere else).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone else get anything else out of it?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
