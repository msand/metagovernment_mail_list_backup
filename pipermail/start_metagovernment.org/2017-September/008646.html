<PRE>Democracy.Earth is trying something new, releasing a white paper on GitHub:
<A HREF="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper</A>

Unfortunately they've fallen for Liquid Democracy as the underlying
technology, something I think we've pretty much concluded is
non-viable. I'd like to advise them of this issue, but curiously can't
really figure out how to do this given the constraints of GitHub.
Anyone else have any idea other than just opening an &quot;issue&quot; that
their entire system is doomed to failure because of a fundamental
design flaw?

If you'd like, I'll post the screed I've written for them here, though
of course you've probably all already seen everything in it during the
analysis of the LQFB system we did last year.

I do recommend reading the paper, if only to see how little being
associated with big-shot organizations like TED and Y Combinator
really gets you in terms of competence (or enlightenment)...

I also recommend reading the &quot;Google Votes&quot; paper they cite, another
Liquid Democracy implementation:
<A HREF="http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&amp;context=dpubs_series">http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&amp;context=dpubs_series</A>

Curiously (or perhaps not) the delegation rate in &quot;Google Votes&quot; was
almost exactly the same as LQFB (around 3%) which is just another nail
in the coffin of the Liquid Democracy architecture. This just
reinforces my conclusion that the only viable decisionmaking
technology will include having delegation be the *default* (i.e.,
proxy selection will have to be &quot;opt out&quot; rather than &quot;opt in&quot;).
  Regards,
    Scott
