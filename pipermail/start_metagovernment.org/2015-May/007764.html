<PRE>Would it be prudent to address the idea that the U.S. Constitution was
meant to be a form of collaborative governance (government of, by, for
the People) before going about re-inventing the wheel?

In other words, that we should address where things have gone wrong,
before we try to fix or replace anything.

I have identified two major internal problems with the Constitution:

1) The election of a federated leader, regardless of the level of
popular support allowed incompetence to be placed in power and in
charge of trillions of national assets and atomic bombs.
2) The election of paid legislators which created a dominance of
political activity at the federal level instead of the local level
where it belonged.  Now, no one participates in local government
because the federalists have dominated the conversation.  Further,
requiring election pushes away interested community members from being
equal voices in their law-making apparati.

These problems were hidden mostly until media and the end of expansion
to the West exacerbated their weaknesses.

That's a start.  I'm Mark Janssen and have been working on developing
a world constitution, expanding on the wisdom of the US Constitution
and built upon the pillars of &quot;liberty and justice for all&quot;.  A strong
foundation which any nation or people should be able to agree upon.

Cheers,
