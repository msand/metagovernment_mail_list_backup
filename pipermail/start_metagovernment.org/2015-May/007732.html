<PRE>Sorry for the extended absence in my reply, I hope we can pick up where we
left off.


&gt;<i> Right. I'm actually considering having 4 categories: pro, con, Q&amp;A,
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;discussion&quot;. The latter might be like Slashdot or Reddit, which
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully would increase the quality of the pro/con sections by
</I>&gt;<i> allowing an outlet for some of the less well thought out comments.
</I>&gt;<i> When you've really got your position worked out, then and only then
</I>&gt;<i> should you polish it up and put it into the pro or con list.
</I>

Sounds good. Where's the bar at for adding your post to a pro/con list
though? Anything stopping you from just throwing it up there immediately?
Also do you intend to have a proposer address his con list ever to make it
more agreeable to more people? Will the pro/con lists be reset upon an edit
of the proposal?


&gt;<i> It might devolve into settle-it (<A HREF="https://settleit.org/">https://settleit.org/</A>). I found that
</I>&gt;<i> system too easy to game because people can just add *anything* and it
</I>&gt;<i> counts for/against the comment (i.e., there's no rating of comments
</I>&gt;<i> which could be used to weight them, or even flagging which could be
</I>&gt;<i> used to constrain trolls). So I'm thinking no: comments on comments
</I>&gt;<i> maybe can be rated, but not separated into pro/con streams.
</I>

I agree

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) People gaming the system, say adding a pro to the con list instead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and getting it 5 star rated so it stays at the top. Makes for additional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moderating/flagging that isn't necessary otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People will always do stuff like this, and sometimes even just
</I>&gt;<i> accidentally. Flagging would seem to me the best way to combat this.
</I>&gt;<i> Gaming by gang-up-rating would require large-scale cooperation which
</I>&gt;<i> should be easy to detect, and again flag. I'm not sure it's going to
</I>&gt;<i> be necessary, but have put flagging trolls as *people* rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just as posts in the spec. Get too many posts flagged as trolls, and
</I>&gt;<i> *you* get flagged as a troll and people will then have the option of
</I>&gt;<i> filtering *everything* you do out of their feed.
</I>

Here our designs split a bit and the question of free speech comes up. I
think that there should be complete transparency in all communications and
that punishable actions should be taken to these trolls in the form of time
penalties before they're able to post again. Your concept would allow
trolls to run rampant but allow people to ignore them by filtering them
out, which I think most people would choose to do.


I think it dangerous to hid away and marginalize an entire group from
having their opinion heard and leaving it up to past flagging to determine
their legitimacy. Again at some point one of these trolls might reform or
actually have something valuable to say. I don't feel it's right to hid
what they say because a group of people have deemed it irrelevant. I
instead argue that every post should remain public and viewable but that
individuals be given a time out for abuse of the posting code. One by one
we treat these trolls like criminals and give them a trail where the
evidence is produced and a verdict is reached by an outside jury,
everything remains transparent.


We can draw from the shouting fire in a crowded theater analogy or crying
wolf. You prefer to automatically block these people from ever being heard
except by others like them (which might only serve to encourage them
further), I say we give them the benefit of the doubt and punish them
later.

(snip)

&gt;&gt;<i> My site is a fully threaded forum yes. I assume yours will be as well?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, although I'm still a little worried about sorting based on rating
</I>&gt;<i> with this: Do posts that come later somehow depend on context derived
</I>&gt;<i> globally from earlier posts, even if they don't specifically attach to
</I>&gt;<i> any of them? I think I see this effect on Slashdot sometimes...
</I>

Posts that come later in my system have the effect of bumping all its
parents posts to the top of their feed lists temporarily, they all take on
the vitality of the brand new post but as that post grows older and starts
to lose overall score the parent posts revert back to their score once it's
overtaken. Because the brand new post has a lesser chance of receiving as
many props it loses score at a much quicker rate than it's more visible
parent posts.

&gt;&gt;<i> If these re-drafts were fair enough to gain the support of the original
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposer as well as all the highest rated commenters then there would be
</I>no
&gt;&gt;<i> issue, right? Everyone agreed this was an accurate summary. I think this
</I>is
&gt;&gt;<i> achievable, the re-drafters include the top comments in the summary and
</I>gain
&gt;&gt;<i> their approval. Original proposers want to see their proposal go through
</I>to
&gt;&gt;<i> the vote so they would approve as many redrafts as they thought was fair
</I>in
&gt;&gt;<i> hopes that top commenters would do so as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the original proposer has veto power over the redrafts? That would
</I>&gt;<i> seem to address my concern, but this is also something that could be
</I>&gt;<i> worked out off-line (e.g., one of these experts could just email the
</I>&gt;<i> original proposer and offer to edit it).
</I>

But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that people
can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
quality.

&gt;<i> Good luck with that ;-)  My hunch is we can't really do either: making
</I>&gt;<i> law/policy is just always going to be boring for us neurotypicals
</I>&gt;<i> because power just doesn't fascinate us the way it does the SDAPs. And
</I>&gt;<i> work is a funny thing: People will insist on being paid far more then
</I>&gt;<i> they're really worth if it's anything they don't enjoy and don't
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely have to do. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have the budget to
</I>&gt;<i> pay anyone who knew what they're doing (do you know how much political
</I>&gt;<i> consultants make? The competent ones make 6 figures, and the good ones
</I>&gt;<i> can make several times that).
</I>

They're only making 6 figures because there's a market for it. Removing
much of the personal financial gian from politics lowers these wages
dramatically. I think there would be interest in getting paid for activity
that you had expertise in. Like karma for Reddit, there's always somebody
stepping in and sharing their knowledge. Here you're helping run the world,
and getting money for it, it's even more incentive to contribute.
Competition breeds innovation. If there's money to be made in finding the
greatest solution to a problem, I believe innovation will occur and we'll
all benefit from it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think not, plus it makes people wade through a lot of stuff they may
