No, it's way more sophesticated when used in the right way.

1. Every times  &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; is made, a PROPOSAL is made
2. Every time a &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; is accepted, a PROPOSAL is accepted by the
one who accepted the &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot;.
3. Every time a &quot;REPOSITORY&quot; is &quot;FORKED&quot;, the Forker joined that Proposal,
thus supports the current Version of the Proposal with his Vote.

An Accepted &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; needs all people who &quot;FORKED&quot; to update their
FORKS or it needs the guy who made the &quot;PULL REQUEST to also ask FORKERS to
include it by creating multiple PULL REQUEST, one for each Forker.


Imagine, an Individual A0 creates a &quot;PROPOSAL XYZ&quot;.
No Individuals A2, A3, A4, ...A9 all FORKING the repository of &quot;PROPOSAL
XYZ&quot;,
which is then to be interpreted, that those 10 individuals support the
&quot;PROPOSAL XYZ&quot;.
Now A3 makes a change and asks for a &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; to A0, but if he wants
also to others who forked.
If accepted, everyone could update their version. (at least if they follow
the repository they get informed.)

Sure, GITHUB is lacking some &quot;automatization of automatically PULLING
UPDATES from some master repositories for certain proposal,
but then again, its also a question if people WANT an automatic update once
a certain PROPOSAL changes.
