<PRE>I would like to step in in this discussion.

What government does, and needs to do, is to take care of shared resources.
Especially limited shared resources. As well as to define laws. Laws which
we all follow, otherwise bad things happen... to us.

Let's clarify, those laws are never ever wanted by the complete consensus.
Even a law as basic as &quot;thou shall not rape&quot; and &quot;thou shall not kill&quot; has
some people who disagree with it. Similarly we need to decide how much fish
can each person (or nation, or fleet) take before the sea/lake/river
becomes over fished.

In those cases (and many others) you need government.

Then there are situations where this is not the case. If a project can be
copied infinitely amount of time; if it only uses vast unlimited (or
practically unlimited) resources... then we can have it on git hub. And
then it is a very good decision making. Because basically no one is
deciding. But everybody is experimenting in parallel. It is also what
happens in nature.

You can see each git hub project as an animal, that reproduces when it
forks with mutations. But nature does not care if it creates some animals
that eat up all of one resource. They will die, and that's it. Problem
solved.

We human beings kind of need to remain alive.

So git hub is great for infinite resources, easily copied systems.

It is not usable for laws, and government. At least in its current format.
