That's not &quot;decisionmaking&quot; or &quot;government&quot;, it's a tool to facilitate
anarchy. Which is OK for the extremely limited domain where it works,
but how are you going to come up with a collective decision on
abortion or gun control or gay marriage with it?

I'm sure we've had this debate on this list before. Or maybe I'm just
misremembering the ad-nauseum debates I've had with libertarians on
this issue in a variety of other forums. They don't understand what
government is for either, and this is *exactly* the kind of &quot;belief
preferences&quot; Caplan is talking about...
  Regards,
    Scott
