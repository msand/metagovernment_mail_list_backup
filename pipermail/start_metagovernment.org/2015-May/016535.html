<PRE>(snip)
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Currently reading Caplan's &quot;Myth of the Rational Voter&quot;. He attributes
</I>&gt;<i> most of the problems with democracy to the low cost associated with
</I>&gt;<i> indulging personal biases (&quot;belief preferences&quot;, as he calls them in
</I>&gt;<i> his &quot;everything is economics&quot; worldview). The result is political
</I>&gt;<i> parties and politicians who are able to encourage and capitalize on
</I>&gt;<i> these biases to further their own agendas. Although there are a few
</I>&gt;<i> large holes in his thesis, to the extent that he's on to something the
</I>&gt;<i> solution seems to me to be exactly what I'm working on: An open voting
</I>&gt;<i> system which decreases the cost of voting but significantly
</I>&gt;<i> *increases* the costs of indulging these biases (i.e., they have to
</I>&gt;<i> make their statements and votes in public where they will be subjected
</I>&gt;<i> to scrutiny and fact checking).
</I>
If I drive it into exteme. Do you expect everybody to defend his
believes ? There are times where are no facts to check, where we are
just following Occam's razor. One more note to this is that theories
cannot be verified, they are just resisting falsification.

And practically we see politician and their minions talking garbage
every day, still there is quite a lot of people who take them
seriously. Not just RWAs from my experience.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I hate when somebody compares people to computers, for a hardcore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programmer like you it might be useful :) We may need to develop and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update some social software into people. Replace fear by hope,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guilt by confidence, competition by collaboration.... without that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even if everybody could program, we will be slaves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As you'll read on matchism.org I have no problem with this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> social and behavioral engineering, but I divide behavioral engineering
</I>&gt;<i> in to 5 classes and propose that social engineering should use the
</I>&gt;<i> lowest effective class. This &quot;software update&quot; you're proposing looks
</I>&gt;<i> like class 4, conditioning, which is the second most invasive of the 5
</I>&gt;<i> classes. Far better to provide a decisionmaking system that
</I>&gt;<i> facilitates voting rationally without requiring that we change the
</I>&gt;<i> internal processing of individuals in the more general sense you're
</I>&gt;<i> proposing.
</I>
I do not say I want do it directly. Hope might be rusult of
understanding alternatives. Confidence and collaboration might be result
of successful deliberation. 

You snipped the most interesting part for me :)
Strengths and weaknesses of electronic communication. Tell me something
to that please.

+ large scale

- more suitable for simple commands
- limited flow of information
- limited trust
- higher dependence on network technology that is in hands of elites
