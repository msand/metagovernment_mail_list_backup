<PRE>Hi all
I come from the perspective of the italian constitution the article 3 of it
state in the 2nd paragraph :
E` compito della Repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e
sociale, che, limitando di fatto la libert&#224; e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini,
impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva
partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica
e sociale del Paese.
I find it in it simplicity the ever best solution to all problems.
It say: the task of the republic (sic)( in term of power to the public) (to
elect temporarily with limited power leaders) is to REMOVE OBSTACLES,
economic and social that in fact limit freedom and equality (as equaliser
of opportunity), LIMITING the full development of human being end therefore
EFFECTIVE PARTICIPATION OF ALL  worker (the first article say the republic
is founded on work!)TO THE POLITICAL ECONOMICAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
To rephrase in short and for the modern era:
The perfect society will remove all obstacles that limit effective
participation to the social organization.
by implementing advanced direct democracy without delegation (even liquid
one) stakeholders will participate to what concern them.
Please take a look at this 90 second <A HREF="https://youtu.be/QMPAzakTgfA">https://youtu.be/QMPAzakTgfA</A>  video we
are now in 10 languages. We believe the internet will solve most of the
genetic behavioural idiosyncrasies of human nature and by good biomath will
do the rest!
Peace

&gt;<i> Would it be prudent to address the idea that the U.S. Constitution was
</I>&gt;<i> meant to be a form of collaborative governance (government of, by, for
</I>&gt;<i> the People) before going about re-inventing the wheel?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, that we should address where things have gone wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> before we try to fix or replace anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have identified two major internal problems with the Constitution:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The election of a federated leader, regardless of the level of
</I>&gt;<i> popular support allowed incompetence to be placed in power and in
</I>&gt;<i> charge of trillions of national assets and atomic bombs.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The election of paid legislators which created a dominance of
</I>&gt;<i> political activity at the federal level instead of the local level
</I>&gt;<i> where it belonged.  Now, no one participates in local government
</I>&gt;<i> because the federalists have dominated the conversation.  Further,
</I>&gt;<i> requiring election pushes away interested community members from being
</I>&gt;<i> equal voices in their law-making apparati.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These problems were hidden mostly until media and the end of expansion
</I>&gt;<i> to the West exacerbated their weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a start.  I'm Mark Janssen and have been working on developing
</I>&gt;<i> a world constitution, expanding on the wisdom of the US Constitution
</I>&gt;<i> and built upon the pillars of &quot;liberty and justice for all&quot;.  A strong
</I>&gt;<i> foundation which any nation or people should be able to agree upon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
