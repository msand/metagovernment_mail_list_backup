Ah, but there are many different forms of &quot;democracy&quot;. And they vary
considerably in the extent to which they are &quot;by&quot; The People...

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is outdated.
</I>
As IMHO is representative democracy in general, at least one based on
elected representatives (i.e., the Matchism proxy system might be
considered a form of representative democracy, but the representatives
are matched rather than elected and are temporary and overrideable).

&gt;&gt;<i> I have dared to make some notes into your text, you will find it

</I>&gt;<i> Oh, please dare!  I appreciate any and all feedback.

</I>
OK, I'll bite: It's not optimal because it assumes a system based on
elected representatives, which I argue is obsolete. I've been working
on an Executive Summary for matchism.org. Here's the current draft.
Does it explain well enough *why* representative democracy must be
replace with something better?

Tenets of Matchism
(The Executive Summary)
version 0.6

1) Human beings evolved to function best in small bands in vigorous
competition with each other in an environment characterized by
scarcity of resources (The Era of Evolutionary Adaptation, or EEA).

2) Humans, like all animals, come with built-in behavior patterns that
evolved to facilitate gene transmission in the EEA. These patterns of
behavior are called Clinations in Matchism.

3) Clinations vary in strength among individuals and they combine with
other differences among individuals to generate &quot;personality&quot;.
Personality has a large effect on an individual's behavior and the
roles that individual tends to play in society.

4) Clinations and their expression as personality characteristics are
frequently maladaptive in modern society because they evolved prior to
our access to technology and because our definition of &quot;system
success&quot; has shifted away from gene transmission and toward the goal
of enabling the well-being (happiness, freedom, sense of purpose,
etc.) of individuals and ensuring the survival of our
political/economic/cultural/social systems. These new goals are known
in Matchism as the Goals of The People.

5) Clinations can be overridden with behavioral engineering, the
extensive conditioning we are subjected to as children being the
primary example.  Other examples are the development and enforcement
of laws, and the various means we have developed to ensure compliance
with social/cultural/religious customs. But there is a cost associated
with all behavioral engineering, however, both individually and
collectively. The more we try to suppress Clinations, the more
expensive it is, the larger the side effects (particularly fear and
stress, which can lead to depression, self-medication, and violence
and other antisocial behavior), and the higher the failure rate
(non-compliance).

6) There is as yet no field of research or specialization of &quot;social
engineering&quot; that specifically addresses the issues of our suboptimal
political/economic/social systems and our amateurish attempts at
behavioral engineering, but there is a vast amount of research in
social psychology, anthropology, economics, and other fields that can
now be used to create one.

7) Because there is no field of social engineering, our
political/economic/social systems have either been created by amateurs
or merely evolved to fit the constraints in knowledge and technology
available at some point in the past. In the search space of all
possible systems there are a large number of &quot;local maximums&quot;; stable
but suboptimal states that are hard to get out of even if advances in
knowledge or technology should allow this. Examples of these are
(were) heredity-based monarchies, feudalism, slavery, and a wide range
of other sets of dysfunctional customs and traditions.

8) Matchism is the process of considering the available research and
social engineering technology to determine which
political/economic/social systems are the best &quot;match&quot; for our
Clinations and our current level of technology. It also seeks to
facilitate the transition to those new systems and to direct research
and development to enable the next iteration.

9) Among the primary observations of Matchism is that the most
maladaptive Clination in the modern environment is tribalism and its
various expressions (racism, nationalism, nativism, protectionism,
etc.), and that this Clination is thoroughly intertwined with the
human moral architecture. If this is the case it would mean that the
architecture of the human moral system is inadequate to the task of
facilitating achievement of The Goals of The People and so it must be
supplemented, and in some cases replaced, by a more robust system.

10) A second proposal is that individuals who score highly on the
psychological measures of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO),
Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and Psychopathy are of particular
concern when determining which political/economic/social systems are
the best match for human beings. Each of these sets of traits is
correlated with prejudice, aggression, and corruptibility. The people
with high levels of these characteristics are known collectively in
Matchism as SDAPs (Social Dominators, Authoritarians, and
Psychopaths). SDAPs make up a minority of the population in general,
but a far larger percentage of &quot;leaders&quot; in all fields.

11) Any form of government that doesn't take into account these
variations in personality is guaranteed to be suboptimal at best and
dangerous to The People at worst. Among those that we have tried and
found wanting include dictatorship, oligarchy, and representative
democracy, all of which are fatally flawed because the characteristics
of the people who are inclined to wield power in these systems have
personality characteristics (i.e., are SDAP) that make it difficult or
impossible for them to act in the best interests of The People as a
whole.

12) Because it is now clear that &quot;representative democracy&quot; is just
another local maximum and has become an impediment to further
progress, a new political/governmental system must be designed that
compensates for the inclination of SDAP individuals to take on
leadership roles by ensuring that decisions are made not by &quot;leaders&quot;,
but by The People as a whole. The best match currently, therefore, is
a form of direct democracy where each individual can cast a vote
directly when practical and through a matched proxy otherwise. The new
system must also be designed to facilitate achievement of The Goals of
The People, bypassing the Clinations, and the associated SDAP
behavior, that are incompatible with that process.
