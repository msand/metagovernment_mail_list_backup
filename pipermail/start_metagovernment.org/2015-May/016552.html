<PRE>Hello Mark, welcome,

I will start with some general note. I must admit that I have read
just a few of federalist papers. Still solving the influence of fereing
power as the main issue of constitution, gives us a clue that
collaboration is not the primary concern. Position of federalists was
understandable when facing militant absolute monarchies, but is
outdated in relation to global environmental crisis and even to
representative democracies.

I have dared to make some notes into your text, you will find it
bellow...

Scott may tell you more about this, but in the meantime you may have a
look at <A HREF="https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/">https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/</A>

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> These problems were hidden mostly until media and the end of expansion
</I>&gt;<i> to the West exacerbated their weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's a start.  I'm Mark Janssen and have been working on developing
</I>&gt;<i> a world constitution, expanding on the wisdom of the US Constitution
</I>&gt;<i> and built upon the pillars of &quot;liberty and justice for all&quot;.  A strong
</I>&gt;<i> foundation which any nation or people should be able to agree upon.

There are some other interesting theorethical projects at
Metagovernment, you may have a look

<A HREF="https://airesis.eu/">https://airesis.eu/</A> - this is just software, ask Jacopo for more.

There is more of them, I was trying to list the most relevant for you.
