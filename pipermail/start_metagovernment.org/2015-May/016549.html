Yeah, I was kind of hoping you weren't going to go there. I see far to
much of this kind of naivety from the libertarians.

Again, what you're describing is not &quot;government&quot; or politics, it's
anarchy (the opposite of those things).

Imagine a Github &quot;push&quot; command that downloads onto everyone's system
a new version, *OVERWRITING* whatever they've been working on and they
have no choice but to accept it. That's what government is and why you
need a damn good decisionmaking system to ensure that what gets
&quot;pushed&quot; is the best possible version.
  Regards,
    Scott
