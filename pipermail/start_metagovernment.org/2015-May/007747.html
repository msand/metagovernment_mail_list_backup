<PRE>Changed the subject: IMHO Github is not only the best but is not even
really suitable as a basis for any decisionmaking process, mostly
because although it facilitates collaboration, it doesn't even *have*
any decisionmaking capability built in and instead relies on the
&quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model of government.

</I>&gt;<i> well, I think there is a way around programming.

I sure hope so too: It's a good skill to have but expecting everyone
to be able to do it is like expecting everyone to do their own
plumbing or car repairs.

&gt;&gt;<i> Capitalists (Investors, Business folks, Bankers, Entrepreneurs, Big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shareholders) ... they all usually are not programmers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there are specialized on organizing people or deriving benefits
</I>&gt;<i> from existing organized structures. I would say the ultimate business
</I>&gt;<i> is organizing people, not explicitly programing.
</I>
Very astute, but maybe a little oversold: Organizing people doesn't
need to be a business nor do we need anyone (or any small group) to do
it. People are self organizing, we just need to provide them with the
technology to facilitate this. The problem is that the tools built
into our brains were &quot;designed&quot; (by evolution) to function best in
small groups in an era of scarce resources and limited technology. The
trick is to create tools that harness these (limited) capabilities and
their associated biases, yet work in a much larger and more complex
environment.

&gt;&gt;<i> There are well paid corporate programmers, but the majority of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmers share the same fate and are paid little money compared to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the skills they are/were able to learn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes.
</I>
Yes, and why we don't need more of them (or at least lots more of them) ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, if people on large scale, know how to program, they can build an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative future, because practically they share the same fate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They share the same fate. And I dare to say that in most cases they see
</I>&gt;<i> it as a part of reality, almost destiny, the best system to go,
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism as the best option in history. They blame themselves for
</I>&gt;<i> not being able enough to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> First of all they need to see that current politics in not inseparable
</I>&gt;<i> part of reality. That there is plenty of options, that there are
</I>&gt;<i> promising worldviews humanity is ignorant of or ignoring.
</I>
Currently reading Caplan's &quot;Myth of the Rational Voter&quot;. He attributes
most of the problems with democracy to the low cost associated with
indulging personal biases (&quot;belief preferences&quot;, as he calls them in
his &quot;everything is economics&quot; worldview). The result is political
parties and politicians who are able to encourage and capitalize on
these biases to further their own agendas. Although there are a few
large holes in his thesis, to the extent that he's on to something the
solution seems to me to be exactly what I'm working on: An open voting
system which decreases the cost of voting but significantly
*increases* the costs of indulging these biases (i.e., they have to
make their statements and votes in public where they will be subjected
to scrutiny and fact checking).

(snip)

&gt;<i> As I hate when somebody compares people to computers, for a hardcore
</I>&gt;<i> programmer like you it might be useful :) We may need to develop and
</I>&gt;<i> update some social software into people. Replace fear by hope, guilt by
</I>&gt;<i> confidence, competition by collaboration.... without that even if
</I>&gt;<i> everybody could program, we will be slaves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
As you'll read on matchism.org I have no problem with this kind of
social and behavioral engineering, but I divide behavioral engineering
in to 5 classes and propose that social engineering should use the
lowest effective class. This &quot;software update&quot; you're proposing looks
like class 4, conditioning, which is the second most invasive of the 5
classes. Far better to provide a decisionmaking system that
facilitates voting rationally without requiring that we change the
internal processing of individuals in the more general sense you're
proposing.

    Scott
