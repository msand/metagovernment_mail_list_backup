<PRE>Its not about a certain date, its continuous, once a majority adopted, it
can be counted as &quot;in effect&quot;, once a proposal does not any longer share a
majority, it goes &quot;out of effect&quot;.
Github as sucht has nothing to do with voting, just the mechanisms it
offers can be used to play around with it and you can create a github
account with others and use that kind of methodology and eventually an
&quot;APP&quot; using the github API can be created to make that sort of usage easier.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; it's called &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; :-) accept/discuss/reject it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That's not &quot;decisionmaking&quot; or &quot;government&quot;, it's a tool to facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anarchy. Which is OK for the extremely limited domain where it works,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but how are you going to come up with a collective decision on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; abortion or gun control or gay marriage with it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, it's way more sophesticated when used in the right way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Every times  &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; is made, a PROPOSAL is made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Every time a &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; is accepted, a PROPOSAL is accepted by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one who accepted the &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Every time a &quot;REPOSITORY&quot; is &quot;FORKED&quot;, the Forker joined that
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus supports the current Version of the Proposal with his Vote.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An Accepted &quot;PULL REQUEST&quot; needs all people who &quot;FORKED&quot; to update their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; FORKS or it needs the guy who made the &quot;PULL REQUEST to also ask FORKERS
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; include it by creating multiple PULL REQUEST, one for each Forker.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But again, where's the decisionmaking? Seems to me you're equating
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;pull&quot; with &quot;vote yes&quot;. Where does Github say that a majority has to
</I>&gt;<i> pull by a certain time/date to cause a proposal to be adopted? Indeed,
</I>&gt;<i> how does it even have any way of reporting that as a percentage of
</I>&gt;<i> people who are interested in a particular project, combined across
</I>&gt;<i> potentially dozens or hundreds of forks?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me your obsession with Github has blinded you to how limited
</I>&gt;<i> it is as a decisionmaking system, and without decisionmaking you're
</I>&gt;<i> not talking about government, you're merely talking about opinion
</I>&gt;<i> polling.
