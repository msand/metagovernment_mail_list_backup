No problem: Rome wasn't built in a day!

&gt;&gt;<i> Right. I'm actually considering having 4 categories: pro, con, Q&amp;A,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and &quot;discussion&quot;. The latter might be like Slashdot or Reddit, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully would increase the quality of the pro/con sections by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowing an outlet for some of the less well thought out comments.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you've really got your position worked out, then and only then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should you polish it up and put it into the pro or con list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good. Where's the bar at for adding your post to a pro/con list
</I>&gt;<i> though? Anything stopping you from just throwing it up there immediately?
</I>&gt;<i> Also do you intend to have a proposer address his con list ever to make it
</I>&gt;<i> more agreeable to more people? Will the pro/con lists be reset upon an edit
</I>&gt;<i> of the proposal?
</I>
All good questions, and to some extent I'll handwave and claim these
are details that will need to be worked out during the initial beta
testing and the normal upgrade cycle (even FaceBook wasn't built in a
day!)  That said, I would think that when the proposer does a revision
that the pro/con/question categories get wiped and everyone who'd
entered one of these would get an alert (and an email) asking if they
want to repost their comment (perhaps after an edit) based on the
current version of the proposal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) People gaming the system, say adding a pro to the con list instead
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and getting it 5 star rated so it stays at the top. Makes for additional
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> moderating/flagging that isn't necessary otherwise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People will always do stuff like this, and sometimes even just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accidentally. Flagging would seem to me the best way to combat this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gaming by gang-up-rating would require large-scale cooperation which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be easy to detect, and again flag. I'm not sure it's going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be necessary, but have put flagging trolls as *people* rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just as posts in the spec. Get too many posts flagged as trolls, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *you* get flagged as a troll and people will then have the option of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtering *everything* you do out of their feed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here our designs split a bit and the question of free speech comes up. I
</I>&gt;<i> think that there should be complete transparency in all communications and
</I>&gt;<i> that punishable actions should be taken to these trolls in the form of time
</I>&gt;<i> penalties before they're able to post again. Your concept would allow trolls
</I>&gt;<i> to run rampant but allow people to ignore them by filtering them out, which
</I>&gt;<i> I think most people would choose to do.
</I>
Free speech is indeed a major issue here and why I've never been
comfortable with the proposal of allowing moderators (or &quot;juries&quot;) to
make decisions like this. There are some good ones, but I've just run
into too many bad ones to trust that design. My sense is that it's
related to the SDAP problem with representative government: That
position just seems to attract people who are unsuitable to wield that
kind of power. How exactly the individual-based filtering will work
again is an empirical question: We'll just have to try different
things until we figure out how well they work against the disruptive
and those who would try to game the system.

&gt;<i> I think it dangerous to hid away and marginalize an entire group from having
</I>&gt;<i> their opinion heard and leaving it up to past flagging to determine their
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy. Again at some point one of these trolls might reform or actually
</I>&gt;<i> have something valuable to say. I don't feel it's right to hid what they say
</I>&gt;<i> because a group of people have deemed it irrelevant. I instead argue that
</I>&gt;<i> every post should remain public and viewable but that individuals be given a
</I>&gt;<i> time out for abuse of the posting code. One by one we treat these trolls
</I>&gt;<i> like criminals and give them a trail where the evidence is produced and a
</I>&gt;<i> verdict is reached by an outside jury, everything remains transparent.
</I>
Filtering has got to be dynamic: Everything will be in the stream but
people will be able to change their filters on the fly (hide/show
posts based on rating, poster rating, individual filter list, etc.)
Slashdot does something like this, but only with post rating.
Unfortunately none of the big social media sites do what we need,
provide negative feedback to trolls and other disrupters, because they
*benefit* from trolls: Their eyeballs count, perhaps even more than
non-trolls because they spend more time on the sites, and because the
sites actually benefit from disharmony. Getting people riled up brings
them back, and FB and Reddit in particular seem to me to be designed
to encourage this type of behavior. Unlike those sites ours will
actually benefit from shutting trolls down or sending them back to
Reddit/FB/Slashdot/etc. as long as it's clear that they weren't
censored by the system but instead just ignored, or perhaps even
actively shunned, by the community.

&gt;<i> We can draw from the shouting fire in a crowded theater analogy or crying
</I>&gt;<i> wolf. You prefer to automatically block these people from ever being heard
</I>&gt;<i> except by others like them (which might only serve to encourage them
</I>&gt;<i> further), I say we give them the benefit of the doubt and punish them later.
</I>
Again, my proposal that it's not the *system* doing this, but the
individuals using it. In your analogy it would be like giving everyone
in the theater noise-canceling headphones that they can adjust the
level of external sound volume that passes in. Sure, some of them will
miss the initial call of &quot;fire&quot;, but those with their filters set
lower (or off) will start moving and the rest will see that.

&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My site is a fully threaded forum yes. I assume yours will be as well?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, although I'm still a little worried about sorting based on rating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with this: Do posts that come later somehow depend on context derived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> globally from earlier posts, even if they don't specifically attach to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any of them? I think I see this effect on Slashdot sometimes...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Posts that come later in my system have the effect of bumping all its
</I>&gt;<i> parents posts to the top of their feed lists temporarily, they all take on
</I>&gt;<i> the vitality of the brand new post but as that post grows older and starts
</I>&gt;<i> to lose overall score the parent posts revert back to their score once it's
</I>&gt;<i> overtaken. Because the brand new post has a lesser chance of receiving as
</I>&gt;<i> many props it loses score at a much quicker rate than it's more visible
</I>&gt;<i> parent posts.
</I>
Sounds pretty fancy! I need to look at the Slashdot system more
because it does something like this but I read a lot of complaints
about how good comments get buried because they're associated with a
crappy post higher up...

&gt;<i> But my argument is that it's better being an actual public job that people
</I>&gt;<i> can see happen online. Getting multiple people to submit redrafts will
</I>&gt;<i> ensure the best summarization of proposals and encourage a standard of
</I>&gt;<i> quality.
</I>
I've no problem with professionals (indeed paid professionals) doing
most of the work. That's what the Managers are in the Matchism
proposal, and where I expect most of the proposals will come from. I
just have a problem with paying *everyone* to do this kind of work
because unless you have a very sophisticated bidding and management
system (something like what Ned has proposed with Blinap) it just
seems to me to open up too many avenues for gaming the system.

&gt;&gt;<i> Good luck with that ;-)  My hunch is we can't really do either: making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> law/policy is just always going to be boring for us neurotypicals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because power just doesn't fascinate us the way it does the SDAPs. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> work is a funny thing: People will insist on being paid far more then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're really worth if it's anything they don't enjoy and don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absolutely have to do. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have the budget to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pay anyone who knew what they're doing (do you know how much political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consultants make? The competent ones make 6 figures, and the good ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can make several times that).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They're only making 6 figures because there's a market for it. Removing much
</I>&gt;<i> of the personal financial gian from politics lowers these wages
</I>&gt;<i> dramatically.
</I>
Yeah, but that would be communism ;-) Instead of just trying to remove
the financial gain I recommend we remove the people who would exploit
this design and the jobs they use to do so.

&gt;<i> I think there would be interest in getting paid for activity
</I>&gt;<i> that you had expertise in. Like karma for Reddit, there's always somebody
</I>&gt;<i> stepping in and sharing their knowledge. Here you're helping run the world,
</I>&gt;<i> and getting money for it, it's even more incentive to contribute.
</I>&gt;<i> Competition breeds innovation. If there's money to be made in finding the
</I>&gt;<i> greatest solution to a problem, I believe innovation will occur and we'll
</I>&gt;<i> all benefit from it.
</I>
This is reminiscent to me of the government design proposal in
&quot;Looking Backward&quot; (i.e., eventually all companies merge into one
giant conglomerate and politics *becomes* corporate management). IMHO,
however, the two systems are fundamentally incompatible: I'm a strong
proponent of capitalism as an economic system because it's clear to me
that it works better, and is more compatible with human nature, than
any of the alternatives. But capitalism requires regulation and that
can only be done by people who are operating outside of that system.
Matchism requires volunteer work to function, but is also designed to
minimize the amount of effort any one individual has to expend. If we
can get it down low enough (like in the realm of what people now
expend on FB and other social media) we won't have to pay them to do
it.

    Scott
