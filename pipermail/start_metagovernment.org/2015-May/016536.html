<PRE>It has a decision making mechanism built in

it's called &quot;*PULL REQUEST*&quot; :-) accept/discuss/reject it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't think there is a way around programming.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well, I think there is a way around programming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I sure hope so too: It's a good skill to have but expecting everyone
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to do it is like expecting everyone to do their own
</I>&gt;<i> plumbing or car repairs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Capitalists (Investors, Business folks, Bankers, Entrepreneurs, Big
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Shareholders) ... they all usually are not programmers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, there are specialized on organizing people or deriving benefits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from existing organized structures. I would say the ultimate business
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is organizing people, not explicitly programing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very astute, but maybe a little oversold: Organizing people doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> need to be a business nor do we need anyone (or any small group) to do
</I>&gt;<i> it. People are self organizing, we just need to provide them with the
</I>&gt;<i> technology to facilitate this. The problem is that the tools built
</I>&gt;<i> into our brains were &quot;designed&quot; (by evolution) to function best in
</I>&gt;<i> small groups in an era of scarce resources and limited technology. The
</I>&gt;<i> trick is to create tools that harness these (limited) capabilities and
</I>&gt;<i> their associated biases, yet work in a much larger and more complex
</I>&gt;<i> environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; There are well paid corporate programmers, but the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; programmers share the same fate and are paid little money compared to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the skills they are/were able to learn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, and why we don't need more of them (or at least lots more of them) ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So, if people on large scale, know how to program, they can build an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; alternative future, because practically they share the same fate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They share the same fate. And I dare to say that in most cases they see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it as a part of reality, almost destiny, the best system to go,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; capitalism as the best option in history. They blame themselves for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not being able enough to be successful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all they need to see that current politics in not inseparable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of reality. That there is plenty of options, that there are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; promising worldviews humanity is ignorant of or ignoring.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently reading Caplan's &quot;Myth of the Rational Voter&quot;. He attributes
</I>&gt;<i> most of the problems with democracy to the low cost associated with
</I>&gt;<i> indulging personal biases (&quot;belief preferences&quot;, as he calls them in
</I>&gt;<i> his &quot;everything is economics&quot; worldview). The result is political
</I>&gt;<i> parties and politicians who are able to encourage and capitalize on
</I>&gt;<i> these biases to further their own agendas. Although there are a few
</I>&gt;<i> large holes in his thesis, to the extent that he's on to something the
</I>&gt;<i> solution seems to me to be exactly what I'm working on: An open voting
</I>&gt;<i> system which decreases the cost of voting but significantly
</I>&gt;<i> *increases* the costs of indulging these biases (i.e., they have to
</I>&gt;<i> make their statements and votes in public where they will be subjected
</I>&gt;<i> to scrutiny and fact checking).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I hate when somebody compares people to computers, for a hardcore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programmer like you it might be useful :) We may need to develop and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; update some social software into people. Replace fear by hope, guilt by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; confidence, competition by collaboration.... without that even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everybody could program, we will be slaves.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you'll read on matchism.org I have no problem with this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> social and behavioral engineering, but I divide behavioral engineering
</I>&gt;<i> in to 5 classes and propose that social engineering should use the
</I>&gt;<i> lowest effective class. This &quot;software update&quot; you're proposing looks
</I>&gt;<i> like class 4, conditioning, which is the second most invasive of the 5
</I>&gt;<i> classes. Far better to provide a decisionmaking system that
</I>&gt;<i> facilitates voting rationally without requiring that we change the
</I>&gt;<i> internal processing of individuals in the more general sense you're
</I>&gt;<i> proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
