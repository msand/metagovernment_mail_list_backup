</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it is outdated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As IMHO is representative democracy in general, at least one based on
</I>&gt;<i> elected representatives (i.e., the Matchism proxy system might be
</I>&gt;<i> considered a form of representative democracy, but the representatives
</I>&gt;<i> are matched rather than elected and are temporary and overrideable).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have dared to make some notes into your text, you will find it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; bellow...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, please dare!  I appreciate any and all feedback.
</I>
Mark, I did it. You may find it in the first email.

&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You may also like a page I created on the wiki:  [[fractional
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting]].  I'll claim it to be the optimal voting scheme in every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; case.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I'll bite: It's not optimal because it assumes a system based on
</I>&gt;<i> elected representatives, which I argue is obsolete. I've been working
</I>&gt;<i> on an Executive Summary for matchism.org. Here's the current draft.
</I>&gt;<i> Does it explain well enough *why* representative democracy must be

</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>
well, you may simply change the &quot;candidates&quot; for &quot;proposals&quot;.
Still I will bite too :D.
I would like to claim (without any evidence) that confidence is not
just function of relevant education. I would like to claim that it is
personality trait as well.

(Not my case of course. I am unhealthy confident, because I have read
Nietzche :D)

Thus people with unhealthy confidence (e.g. RWA ) have more
power in your system for no reason.
Or, is there any subtle mechanism that I should understand ?

I would like to note that there are many things that are not solved in
fractional voting page. E.g. Who creates questions ? Is there some
discussion attached, how does it look ?
I see that you are following the scientific mathematic theory of social
choice (formed by Condorced and Arrow) and I think that that is a wrong
way to go. Because mathematics is so just and inert to humans. We are
not looking for system that is &quot;just&quot;( because people are not just),
we are looking for a system that produces good results. When I am using
the word &quot;good&quot;, I am hiding my values and philosophy behind it. What is
your philosophy ?

Uh,  that is a text, sorry, it is late here. Could you imagine that I am
smiling. I mean it good, I hope it will help you in your endeavour.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tenets of Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> (The Executive Summary)
</I>&gt;<i> version 0.6
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Human beings evolved to function best in small bands in vigorous
</I>&gt;<i> competition with each other in an environment characterized by
</I>&gt;<i> scarcity of resources (The Era of Evolutionary Adaptation, or EEA).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Humans, like all animals, come with built-in behavior patterns that
</I>&gt;<i> evolved to facilitate gene transmission in the EEA. These patterns of
</I>&gt;<i> behavior are called Clinations in Matchism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Clinations vary in strength among individuals and they combine with
</I>&gt;<i> other differences among individuals to generate &quot;personality&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Personality has a large effect on an individual's behavior and the
</I>&gt;<i> roles that individual tends to play in society.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Clinations and their expression as personality characteristics are
</I>&gt;<i> frequently maladaptive in modern society because they evolved prior to
</I>&gt;<i> our access to technology and because our definition of &quot;system
</I>&gt;<i> success&quot; has shifted away from gene transmission and toward the goal
</I>&gt;<i> of enabling the well-being (happiness, freedom, sense of purpose,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) of individuals and ensuring the survival of our
</I>&gt;<i> political/economic/cultural/social systems. These new goals are known
</I>&gt;<i> in Matchism as the Goals of The People.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Clinations can be overridden with behavioral engineering, the
</I>&gt;<i> extensive conditioning we are subjected to as children being the
</I>&gt;<i> primary example.  Other examples are the development and enforcement
</I>&gt;<i> of laws, and the various means we have developed to ensure compliance
</I>&gt;<i> with social/cultural/religious customs. But there is a cost associated
</I>&gt;<i> with all behavioral engineering, however, both individually and
</I>&gt;<i> collectively. The more we try to suppress Clinations, the more
</I>&gt;<i> expensive it is, the larger the side effects (particularly fear and
</I>&gt;<i> stress, which can lead to depression, self-medication, and violence
</I>&gt;<i> and other antisocial behavior), and the higher the failure rate
</I>&gt;<i> (non-compliance).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) There is as yet no field of research or specialization of &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering&quot; that specifically addresses the issues of our suboptimal
</I>&gt;<i> political/economic/social systems and our amateurish attempts at
</I>&gt;<i> behavioral engineering, but there is a vast amount of research in
</I>&gt;<i> social psychology, anthropology, economics, and other fields that can
</I>&gt;<i> now be used to create one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Because there is no field of social engineering, our
</I>&gt;<i> political/economic/social systems have either been created by amateurs
</I>&gt;<i> or merely evolved to fit the constraints in knowledge and technology
</I>&gt;<i> available at some point in the past. In the search space of all
</I>&gt;<i> possible systems there are a large number of &quot;local maximums&quot;; stable
</I>&gt;<i> but suboptimal states that are hard to get out of even if advances in
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge or technology should allow this. Examples of these are
</I>&gt;<i> (were) heredity-based monarchies, feudalism, slavery, and a wide range
</I>&gt;<i> of other sets of dysfunctional customs and traditions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8) Matchism is the process of considering the available research and
</I>&gt;<i> social engineering technology to determine which
</I>&gt;<i> political/economic/social systems are the best &quot;match&quot; for our
</I>&gt;<i> Clinations and our current level of technology. It also seeks to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate the transition to those new systems and to direct research
</I>&gt;<i> and development to enable the next iteration.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 9) Among the primary observations of Matchism is that the most
</I>&gt;<i> maladaptive Clination in the modern environment is tribalism and its
</I>&gt;<i> various expressions (racism, nationalism, nativism, protectionism,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.), and that this Clination is thoroughly intertwined with the
</I>&gt;<i> human moral architecture. If this is the case it would mean that the
</I>&gt;<i> architecture of the human moral system is inadequate to the task of
</I>&gt;<i> facilitating achievement of The Goals of The People and so it must be
</I>&gt;<i> supplemented, and in some cases replaced, by a more robust system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 10) A second proposal is that individuals who score highly on the
</I>&gt;<i> psychological measures of Social Dominance Orientation (SDO),
</I>&gt;<i> Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), and Psychopathy are of particular
</I>&gt;<i> concern when determining which political/economic/social systems are
</I>&gt;<i> the best match for human beings. Each of these sets of traits is
</I>&gt;<i> correlated with prejudice, aggression, and corruptibility. The people
</I>&gt;<i> with high levels of these characteristics are known collectively in
</I>&gt;<i> Matchism as SDAPs (Social Dominators, Authoritarians, and
</I>&gt;<i> Psychopaths). SDAPs make up a minority of the population in general,
</I>&gt;<i> but a far larger percentage of &quot;leaders&quot; in all fields.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 11) Any form of government that doesn't take into account these
</I>&gt;<i> variations in personality is guaranteed to be suboptimal at best and
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous to The People at worst. Among those that we have tried and
</I>&gt;<i> found wanting include dictatorship, oligarchy, and representative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, all of which are fatally flawed because the characteristics
</I>&gt;<i> of the people who are inclined to wield power in these systems have
</I>&gt;<i> personality characteristics (i.e., are SDAP) that make it difficult or
</I>&gt;<i> impossible for them to act in the best interests of The People as a
</I>&gt;<i> whole.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 12) Because it is now clear that &quot;representative democracy&quot; is just
</I>&gt;<i> another local maximum and has become an impediment to further
</I>&gt;<i> progress, a new political/governmental system must be designed that
</I>&gt;<i> compensates for the inclination of SDAP individuals to take on
</I>&gt;<i> leadership roles by ensuring that decisions are made not by &quot;leaders&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but by The People as a whole. The best match currently, therefore, is
</I>&gt;<i> a form of direct democracy where each individual can cast a vote
</I>&gt;<i> directly when practical and through a matched proxy otherwise. The new
</I>&gt;<i> system must also be designed to facilitate achievement of The Goals of
</I>&gt;<i> The People, bypassing the Clinations, and the associated SDAP
</I>&gt;<i> behavior, that are incompatible with that process.
