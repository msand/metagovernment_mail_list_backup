&gt;<i> well, you may simply change the &quot;candidates&quot; for &quot;proposals&quot;.
</I>
I go back and forth on this, but my general sense is that having
multiple &quot;competing&quot; proposals that the voter has to choose between is
too much work. You run into all kinds of &quot;diff&quot; issues where people
have to go back and forth between proposals to try to discern which is
the best. Better I think is to have a simple up/down vote for final
acceptance and do the tweaking during the development phase. Part of
that may involve some sort of rank ordering UI that can be used to
work out the details of a proposal (e.g., doing a budget, where people
will want to sort the priority list and set budget amounts for each).
Haven't really got to that part yet in my project, though, so it's
still a little fuzzy.

Definitely!

&gt;<i> (Not my case of course. I am unhealthy confident, because I have read

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus people with unhealthy confidence (e.g. RWA ) have more

</I>&gt;<i> Or, is there any subtle mechanism that I should understand ?
</I>
It's actually high SDO that's most highly correlated with this
&quot;confidence&quot; issue, but I see your point. Other than random sampling
(and it'd have to be more enforceable than e.g., jury duty) I don't
see anyway to avoid the self-selection bias you're talking about. But
at least in my proposed system I wouldn't say that these people have
more &quot;power&quot; because they *don't* have the power to actually approve
anything (unlike the situation in our current representative
democracies). I would concede that they'll have more &quot;influence&quot;
because they'll be inclined to write up convincing pro/con arguments
that the less engaged (i.e., less confident) individuals will rely on
to make their decisions. The leap of faith I'm willing to make is that
these &quot;confident&quot; people will be distributed across the political
spectrum (which is what the research shows) and that the competition
between these viewpoints will keep these SDAPs in check (e.g., I'm
thinking even Hitler would have a hard time selling &quot;Let's ship the
Jews to Poland and take all their stuff!&quot; in my proposed system
because unlike 1930s Germany there will be a sufficient counterbalance
because the opposing positions will appear right in the same window on
the screen the voters will be using to make their decision about
whether to approve that proposal and everyone will *see* how they're
voting).

&gt;<i> I would like to note that there are many things that are not solved in
</I>&gt;<i> fractional voting page. E.g. Who creates questions ? Is there some
</I>&gt;<i> discussion attached, how does it look ?
</I>&gt;<i> I see that you are following the scientific mathematic theory of social
</I>&gt;<i> choice (formed by Condorced and Arrow) and I think that that is a wrong
</I>&gt;<i> way to go. Because mathematics is so just and inert to humans. We are
</I>&gt;<i> not looking for system that is &quot;just&quot;( because people are not just),
</I>
Yeah, I have a problem with the word/concept &quot;just&quot; here too, but I
don't have a problem with using math (or any other technology) to
facilitate the decisionmaking. You just have to make sure the system
is designed to account for human maladaptions when defining and trying
to achieve the Goals of The People. Which is how I try to get around
the problem of figuring out what is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;just&quot;: What's good is
what works. I'm not in a position to predict what the Goals will end
up looking like with any great accuracy yet, but I've read everything
I can find on &quot;veil of ignorance&quot; experiments and although I think the
result is going to be very different from what we have now and will be
pretty hard to stomach for some people (particularly social
conservatives, but also a lot of the SJWs who will have the wind taken
from their sails), I'm pretty confident that Matchism is not going to
recreate Communism or Nazism...
