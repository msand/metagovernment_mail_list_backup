<PRE>Thank you. Although I am still waiting till somebody accepts me in the
group. (For anybody else, ask for group membership in advance, before
you are provoked to type something :D)

I cannot write there so I will do it here and resend it later.

The last at loomio post including this paper
<A HREF="http://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2014/luskin-online.pdf">http://cdd.stanford.edu/mm/2014/luskin-online.pdf</A>
is a useful paper for my concept
<A HREF="http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora">http://participedia.net/en/methods/parties-global-agora</A>
because I cannot agree that the face-to-face actions are generally
more costly than electronics. From some point of view they may cost
nothing, if it is attaching to some kind of event that would happen
anyway.

Of course you may read the paper in favour of e-democracy, but it may be
like reading Rousseau in favor of aristocracy.

What do you think ?

I have one more question. Recently I was looking for more criticism or
support for my concept, but I cannot get any of those two.
What should I do about it ? Is it me ?
Anyway, I will try to improve the concept, add some secondary resources
and we will see. Right ?

Kind regards
m.
