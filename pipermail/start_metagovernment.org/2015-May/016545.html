But again, where's the decisionmaking? Seems to me you're equating
&quot;pull&quot; with &quot;vote yes&quot;. Where does Github say that a majority has to
pull by a certain time/date to cause a proposal to be adopted? Indeed,
how does it even have any way of reporting that as a percentage of
people who are interested in a particular project, combined across
potentially dozens or hundreds of forks?

Seems to me your obsession with Github has blinded you to how limited
it is as a decisionmaking system, and without decisionmaking you're
not talking about government, you're merely talking about opinion
polling.

    Scott
