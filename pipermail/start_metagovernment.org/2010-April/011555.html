<PRE>Yes Ed your idea is a perfect way to ensure integrity. In fact it is a 
project in itself, I will search around if something  like this already  
exists.

&gt;<i> I want to explain my solution again, because I think it is the most 
</I>&gt;<i> open and bulletproof way of protecting the validity of running software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds a lot like distributed computing or cloud computing, but 
</I>&gt;<i> there is an essential difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In distributed computing, one administrator can control all of the 
</I>&gt;<i> computers in the cluster, and has root power over all the software 
</I>&gt;<i> running on them. In cloud computing, there may be different server 
</I>&gt;<i> administrators, but any single running application still has one 
</I>&gt;<i> controlling password.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am talking about is where a single application and database 
</I>&gt;<i> runs in several different, independent instances (on different 
</I>&gt;<i> computers, clouds, clusters, or whatever), and each instance is 
</I>&gt;<i> controlled by a different person or entity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever a change is made to one instance, it then propagates that to 
</I>&gt;<i> other running instances. Each time a propagation occurs (or at some 
</I>&gt;<i> sort of interval), instances would checksum each other to ensure that 
</I>&gt;<i> they are running the same software, that they have the same data 
</I>&gt;<i> integrity, and that the new data being propagated is a legitimate 
</I>&gt;<i> product of the software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a hacker or a rogue administrator messes with the data or compile 
</I>&gt;<i> on one instance, the other instances stop trusting it and it 
</I>&gt;<i> essentially drops from the community of interworking instances (which 
</I>&gt;<i> is why there must be more than 3, and preferably many more than 3, for 
</I>&gt;<i> proper continuity).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (A necessary shortcoming of this system is that all of the instances 
</I>&gt;<i> are somewhat out of sync with each other, but that is a matter of 
</I>&gt;<i> efficiency and can be kept low with good design. It also makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to upgrade the software, but again this is just a technical 
</I>&gt;<i> problem.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is still essential that the software have code that can be read and 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled by anyone, but there is a much stronger security controller: 
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have to trust one person's compile, because there are many 
</I>&gt;<i> different compiles all checking each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
