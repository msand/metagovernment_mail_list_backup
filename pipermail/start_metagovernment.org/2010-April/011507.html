<PRE>Hi all,

I too think that creating common facilities for voter registration
(and also for agenda sharing at a later stage) would be a great task
for Metagovernment. I've talked to Thomas about the subject and I
think that we should start by deepening our analysis of the
requirements and tools we have regarding voter reg. Michael Allen has
written a document  (<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor</A>)
that could serve as a foundation in this area (although I don't agree
to some of his proposal, e.g. the tight/loose distinction). Some
relevant questions wrt registration would be:

* Which projects would be interested in working on this?
* Which 'axes of identity' are relevant to us? (e.g.
geographical/political subdivisions, institutional membership,
citizenship, ..)
* Which technologies can we use? (e.g. OpenID, LDAP, CAS, ...)
* Which institutions/services can we use? (e.g. the German postal
service offers identity verification for a small fee)
* Who can run such a service? How do we achieve federation/distribution?

&gt;<i> meta-organization) can build on at this time. Working out the details would
</I>&gt;<i> be a great topic for this Saturday's meeting.
</I>
I'm afraid I won't be able to attend on Saturday.

&gt;<i> As for Liquid Democracy, I admit I haven't had much time to look into them
</I>&gt;<i> (and their English resources are not very robust yet), but it is worth
</I>&gt;<i> noting that delegated voting is effectively a subset of the mission of
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment.
</I>
True; we still have a lot of work to do to make our site more
accessible to international visitors - but that's going to happen, I
promise :-)

In general, I think that delegated voting is only a tiny fraction of
the discussion within liqd. We're essentially experimenting with the
idea of turning policy proposals into social objects that are subject
to cooperative development and evaluation both by groups of citizens
and individuals. In order to do that, we're proposing to create a
discussion between voter groups ('B&#252;ndnisse')  that proposing
modifications to some set of fixed documents (i.e. laws, bylaws...).

While this process has been worked out to some detail on the German
site, we're still in an early stage of the actual implementation. My
current goal with Adhocracy (the software running at <A HREF="http://liqd.net">http://liqd.net</A>)
is to integrate a candiwi-ish multi-variant wiki to allow for an
in-depth discussion of the implementation of specific proposals and
then later to integrate the idea of voter groups as delegation
recipients (i.e. &quot;Voters for environmental sustainability&quot; or &quot;Voters
for social justice&quot;, but also &quot;US Democratic Party&quot;).

&gt;<i> Our mission encompasses any project which gives everyone a
</I>&gt;<i> direct voice in governance. It is my understanding that Votorola (and I
</I>&gt;<i> presume the other Liquid members) allows people to de-delegate or
</I>&gt;<i> re-delegate at any time, effectively taking direct control of their vote if
</I>&gt;<i> they don't like how the delegate is representing them.
</I>
True, that's fundamental to any web-based delegation system, I think.

&gt;<i> Finding more common ground with Liquid would be fantastic.
</I>
There is quite a lot of common ground already, I think - we just need
to do a better job of presenting liqd to an international audience.
Liquid Democracy is simply a brand that has picked up some traction in
Germany (and that now encompasses a wide range of ideas).

Regards,

 Friedrich

p.s. There is another German group, Echo, which should be included in
this discussion. Are you subscribed, guys? ;-)
