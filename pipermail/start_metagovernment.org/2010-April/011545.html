<PRE>My preferred solution here is to have several (at least four) servers  
running the same software but under different admins. Each server  
would checksum the others to ensure that they are all running the same  
build of the software.

There is no reliance on an outside authority... instead we would just  
be, essentially, crowdsourcing the administration of the servers. At  
any time, additional administrators could open new mirrors and ask the  
existing instances to authenticate them into the mesh.

Implementing or even designing it is beyond me, but I do know that it  
would be an ideal solution for both security and redundancy.

P.S. I should also note that the distinction between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open&quot;  
is quite relevant here. Not just because we included rms in the  
discussion :) but also because there certainly are cases (even by  
Microsoft) of non-free but open software, where the code can be read,  
but the control of the code is closed.
