<PRE>Michael, I have to say this your replies here are very encouraging.

While I continue to have faith in a reputation-based system over rigid  
authentication, your are presenting something even better: an open  
ecosystem which allows for both. Basically a meta-system.

I particularly like the idea of a, basically, Darwinian ecosystem:  
where everything is allowed, but only those which prove themselves in  
the real-world survive. (And presumably evolve into even better  
systems.)

Why should we try to design for every eventuality, when it is a given  
that the real-world will present things we couldn't account for?  
Better to take several stabs at solutions and see what can gain  
traction in practice.

I will delve into it further when I have more time (I am still unclear  
on how I or others specifically can contribute). I just wanted to say  
for now that this sounds fantastic.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my own understanding:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's an application of vote mirroring:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Though I still share Manuel's reservation concerning the utility at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end. At what point can a community say that a decision has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reached?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think, each community needs to decide this for themselves before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the actual voting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Or at any time during the course of it.)  Hopefully it's open enough
</I>&gt;<i> that no community or project is ever left out, regardless of their
</I>&gt;<i> rules or tools:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Decision rules may vary from community to community.  So although
</I>&gt;<i>    the communities have access to the same votes, their decisions may
</I>&gt;<i>    vary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Decision tools must be layered on the common voting
</I>&gt;<i>    infrastructure, co-existing with it (and with each other) with
</I>&gt;<i>    minimal friction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Voting is not exclusively for decision making.  Decision tools
</I>&gt;<i>    must therefore coexist with tools for other purposes, such as
</I>&gt;<i>    coordination with legislative drafters, opinion tracking/trend
</I>&gt;<i>    analysis, and simple free expression.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owen:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Might it be possible to specify a standard for the data required to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certify participants and have each application consider the adequacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the data provided?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think standards will be essential at some point, but too-early
</I>&gt;<i> adoption could be a problem.  We simply don't know enough to set
</I>&gt;<i> standards.  Nobody's ever done this before.  Hopefully we can push as
</I>&gt;<i> far forward as possible on nothing by ad hoc prototypes, and get it
</I>&gt;<i> all roughly working *before* we sink standards deep into the
</I>&gt;<i> foundation.  It's been suggested that we'll end up with a messaging
</I>&gt;<i> transport, maybe based on XMPP.  But that's a technical challenge and
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully we can grow a little before taking it on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree about independent interpretation of authentication data.  This
</I>&gt;<i> *is* something that we can build into the earliest prototypes, I
</I>&gt;<i> think.  Each pollserver admin (ultimately each user) should be
</I>&gt;<i> deciding which auth-data to trust, and which votes to count.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I still maintain that there are better ways than formal registration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to correct for sock puppets. Reputation is a self-correcting method,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and does not require the complexity or cost of a formal system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Auth methods (formal and informal) may exist side by side.  New ones
</I>&gt;<i> may be added - it's all open.  We can play with the mix, and learn
</I>&gt;<i> what's best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So isn't a reputatuon system a trust network, and doesn't it allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us to dispense with all the residence-definition stuff?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The particular value of being able to authenticate on residence (among
</I>&gt;<i> other properties) is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a) It offers an assurance of a universally tight register with no
</I>&gt;<i>     sock puppets, not even across national borders.  So a user may
</I>&gt;<i>     own 3 homes in 3 different countries, but he only gets to vote
</I>&gt;<i>     once.  Ordinary users will know this.  They'll know from hands on
</I>&gt;<i>     experience how hard it is to cheat the trust network.  Later,
</I>&gt;<i>     when the votes are challenged and the system is attacked (as
</I>&gt;<i>     surely it will be) the users may come to its defense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  b) Universal tightness also allows the members of two organizations
</I>&gt;<i>     (for example) to participate in a joint vote.  This requires a
</I>&gt;<i>     union of their membership registers, and normally you can't do a
</I>&gt;<i>     union unless you also intersect it with a third, universally
</I>&gt;<i>     tight register:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor#Voter_eligibility_tests">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor#Voter_eligibility_tests</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  c) Voters and politicians are already familiar with the concept of
</I>&gt;<i>     residence-based authentication and electoral districts.  They'll
</I>&gt;<i>     understand the sense in which localized votes are to be taken
</I>&gt;<i>     seriously.  No explanations will be needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it's one example in a vast array of possibilities. Take the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stream example instead. Should we allow someone who owns a natural
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource to have complete domination over it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I like the picture, that everybody can vote in every question. and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additionally everybody can filter all the votes by all possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criteria (age of voter, age of vote, nationality of voter,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> residential adress of voter, ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So anyone can *vote*, and that vote can never be suppressed (it's like
</I>&gt;<i> free speech).  On the other hand, neither can anyone ever be forced to
</I>&gt;<i> *count* that vote (forced to listen).  Something has to give.  What
</I>&gt;<i> gives is that we allow multiple pollservers (count engines).  They all
</I>&gt;<i> draw their votes from a common &quot;pool&quot;, but they may filter those votes
</I>&gt;<i> before counting them, and ofc they may filter according to different
</I>&gt;<i> criteria.  (Ideally each user will do her own filtering, but that's a
</I>&gt;<i> little further in the future.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, from your example: What do people at the source think?  What do
</I>&gt;<i> people downstream think?  We need two separate counts to find out.  We
</I>&gt;<i> need a residential register too, because the filtering criterion is
</I>&gt;<i> residential (source residence vs downstream).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, we could ask, &quot;What do the local farmers think?&quot;  For
</I>&gt;<i> that, we'd need to bring in additional registers - maybe the member
</I>&gt;<i> rolls of local farm cooperatives.  No problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we should start a school project where we teach to kids how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do voting in other ways. And then they will use it throughout
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high school
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the student is free-ranging across different pollservers (voting
</I>&gt;<i> sites) she may also be free-ranging across different voting methods.
</I>&gt;<i> What does her vote look like under STV?  Under asset?  She may go to
</I>&gt;<i> the STV and asset pollservers to see for herself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owen:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At some point, it seems to me that is is not just one's &quot;vote&quot; than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> matters but also what else one is willing and able to contribute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> toward realization of the objective(s) implicit in one's vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it's maybe like this.  You:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Vote for policy, but you also help in drafting it (if you wish)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Vote for a plan, but you also help in executing it
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Vote for a town councillor.  Afterwards he contacts you for advice
</I>&gt;<i>    regarding the policy you are drafting and the plan you are
</I>&gt;<i>    executing.  Or perhaps he delegates power to you, in these regards
