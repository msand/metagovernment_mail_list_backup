<PRE>I want to explain my solution again, because I think it is the most  
open and bulletproof way of protecting the validity of running software.

It sounds a lot like distributed computing or cloud computing, but  
there is an essential difference.

In distributed computing, one administrator can control all of the  
computers in the cluster, and has root power over all the software  
running on them. In cloud computing, there may be different server  
administrators, but any single running application still has one  
controlling password.

What I am talking about is where a single application and database  
runs in several different, independent instances (on different  
computers, clouds, clusters, or whatever), and each instance is  
controlled by a different person or entity.

Whenever a change is made to one instance, it then propagates that to  
other running instances. Each time a propagation occurs (or at some  
sort of interval), instances would checksum each other to ensure that  
they are running the same software, that they have the same data  
integrity, and that the new data being propagated is a legitimate  
product of the software.

If a hacker or a rogue administrator messes with the data or compile  
on one instance, the other instances stop trusting it and it  
essentially drops from the community of interworking instances (which  
is why there must be more than 3, and preferably many more than 3, for  
proper continuity).

(A necessary shortcoming of this system is that all of the instances  
are somewhat out of sync with each other, but that is a matter of  
efficiency and can be kept low with good design. It also makes it  
difficult to upgrade the software, but again this is just a technical  
problem.)

It is still essential that the software have code that can be read and  
compiled by anyone, but there is a much stronger security controller:  
you don't have to trust one person's compile, because there are many  
different compiles all checking each other.
