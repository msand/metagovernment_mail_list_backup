I plan to start on it in a week or so.  I'll resume the prototype of
this: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki</A>

Unless there's another design aside from streetwikis that can fill
this particular niche (universal coverage, strong assurance of no sock
puppets), it should be safe to jump right in and start using them.
AFAIK they'll be compatible with any registration framework we agree
on in future (more below).

&gt;<i> * Which 'axes of identity' are relevant to us? (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> geographical/political subdivisions, institutional membership,
</I>&gt;<i> citizenship, ..)
</I>
Technically, I guess we can't exclude any.  A streetwiki/trustserver
is primarily for personal identity (proves you are human, not a bot or
sock puppet).  It also has the side-effect of authenticating your
residency, so it covers geographical/political subdivisions, too.

But it doesn't cover institutional membership or citizenship.  Other
types of voter register will have to cover those properties.  (Some
already do, and I know you've done work in this area yourself.)

Whatever overarching framework we eventually adopt must (I think)
extend interoperability across all the different types and instances
of voter register.  The crucial thing here is to ensure that clients
(voting facilities) can mix and match registration data from all
register types (hopefully from traditional registers, too).

&gt;<i> * Which technologies can we use? (e.g. OpenID, LDAP, CAS, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> * Which institutions/services can we use? (e.g. the German postal
</I>&gt;<i> service offers identity verification for a small fee)
</I>&gt;<i> * Who can run such a service? How do we achieve federation/distribution?
</I>
These could be design questions for particular registers.  Whatever
solutions are chosen, they need not (ideally) affect interoperability.
The registration framework can help to ensure this by being blind to
the details.  For example, we can transport data (registration
properties) in the equivalent of shipping containers.  No need to look
inside.

&gt;<i> I'm afraid I won't be able to attend on Saturday.
</I>
Unfortunately, I can't either.  I'm working nights.  4pm is my
earliest.
