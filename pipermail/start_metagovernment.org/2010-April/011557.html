Source is sometimes crucial, at least for some applications.
Democracy is inherently a public application, for example.  Things
would get complicated if the core, underlying software were privately
owned.  Free/open source is maybe the simplest solution: the public
codes the software, and the public owns it.  (Maybe too, that kind of
self-determination is more in the spirit of democracy.)

&gt;<i> Both the content of the record and its authoritative *presentation*
</I>&gt;<i> should be maintained in assured inviolate form, apart from the
</I>&gt;<i> databases in which the &quot;votes&quot; are tallied and under the control of
</I>&gt;<i> at least one other &quot;authority&quot; trusted by the voter...
</I>
Here are database dumps for the common pollwiki and Votorola:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/system/host/havoc/var/cache/votorola/v/backup/">http://zelea.com/system/host/havoc/var/cache/votorola/v/backup/</A>

The dump files are standard SQL.  Can anyone transfer an occaisonal
copy to an offsite mirror?  Please let me know.  (I'll put password
protection on that directory, soon - to keep spammers from the email
addresses.)

&gt;<i> It does not seem to me that whether the software is open source or not truly
</I>&gt;<i> matters, so long as the data that it processes can easily be audited (votes
</I>&gt;<i> automatically &quot;re-counted&quot;) by other trusted systems.  (This not a message
</I>&gt;<i> that software programmers or database designers are open to hearing, because
</I>&gt;<i> they tend to want to play God in their creations.)
</I>
We expose more Votorola data here:

Votes are exported here:
