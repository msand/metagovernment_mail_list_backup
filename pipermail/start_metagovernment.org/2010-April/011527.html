I'm sorry I missed it, it looks like an enjoyable meeting.  Only a few
technical points I would add.

Owen:
&gt;<i> it would be good first to have a comon understanding of what
</I>&gt;<i> free-range voting is.
</I>
This is my own understanding:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Free-range_voting">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Free-range_voting</A>

It's an application of vote mirroring:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring</A>

Ed:
&gt;<i> Though I still share Manuel's reservation concerning the utility at
</I>&gt;<i> the end. At what point can a community say that a decision has been
</I>&gt;<i> reached?
</I>
Thomas:
&gt;<i> I think, each community needs to decide this for themselves before
</I>&gt;<i> the actual voting
</I>
(Or at any time during the course of it.)  Hopefully it's open enough
that no community or project is ever left out, regardless of their
rules or tools:

  * Decision rules may vary from community to community.  So although
    the communities have access to the same votes, their decisions may
    vary.

  * Decision tools must be layered on the common voting
    infrastructure, co-existing with it (and with each other) with
    minimal friction.

  * Voting is not exclusively for decision making.  Decision tools
    must therefore coexist with tools for other purposes, such as
    coordination with legislative drafters, opinion tracking/trend
    analysis, and simple free expression.

Owen:
&gt;<i> Might it be possible to specify a standard for the data required to
</I>&gt;<i> certify participants and have each application consider the adequacy
</I>&gt;<i> of the data provided?
</I>
I think standards will be essential at some point, but too-early
adoption could be a problem.  We simply don't know enough to set
standards.  Nobody's ever done this before.  Hopefully we can push as
far forward as possible on nothing by ad hoc prototypes, and get it
all roughly working *before* we sink standards deep into the
foundation.  It's been suggested that we'll end up with a messaging
transport, maybe based on XMPP.  But that's a technical challenge and
hopefully we can grow a little before taking it on.

I agree about independent interpretation of authentication data.  This
*is* something that we can build into the earliest prototypes, I
think.  Each pollserver admin (ultimately each user) should be
deciding which auth-data to trust, and which votes to count.

Ed:
&gt;<i> I still maintain that there are better ways than formal registration
</I>&gt;<i> to correct for sock puppets. Reputation is a self-correcting method,
</I>&gt;<i> and does not require the complexity or cost of a formal system.
</I>
Auth methods (formal and informal) may exist side by side.  New ones
may be added - it's all open.  We can play with the mix, and learn
what's best.

Ed:
&gt;<i> So isn't a reputatuon system a trust network, and doesn't it allow
</I>&gt;<i> us to dispense with all the residence-definition stuff?
</I>
The particular value of being able to authenticate on residence (among
other properties) is:

  a) It offers an assurance of a universally tight register with no
     sock puppets, not even across national borders.  So a user may
     own 3 homes in 3 different countries, but he only gets to vote
     once.  Ordinary users will know this.  They'll know from hands on
     experience how hard it is to cheat the trust network.  Later,
     when the votes are challenged and the system is attacked (as
     surely it will be) the users may come to its defense.

  b) Universal tightness also allows the members of two organizations
     (for example) to participate in a joint vote.  This requires a
     union of their membership registers, and normally you can't do a
     union unless you also intersect it with a third, universally
     tight register:
     <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor#Voter_eligibility_tests">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor#Voter_eligibility_tests</A>

  c) Voters and politicians are already familiar with the concept of
     residence-based authentication and electoral districts.  They'll
     understand the sense in which localized votes are to be taken
     seriously.  No explanations will be needed.

Ed:
&gt;<i> But it's one example in a vast array of possibilities. Take the
</I>&gt;<i> stream example instead. Should we allow someone who owns a natural
</I>&gt;<i> resource to have complete domination over it?
</I>
Thomas:
&gt;<i> I like the picture, that everybody can vote in every question. and
</I>&gt;<i> additionally everybody can filter all the votes by all possible
</I>&gt;<i> criteria (age of voter, age of vote, nationality of voter,
</I>&gt;<i> residential adress of voter, ...)
</I>
So anyone can *vote*, and that vote can never be suppressed (it's like
free speech).  On the other hand, neither can anyone ever be forced to
*count* that vote (forced to listen).  Something has to give.  What
gives is that we allow multiple pollservers (count engines).  They all
draw their votes from a common &quot;pool&quot;, but they may filter those votes
before counting them, and ofc they may filter according to different
criteria.  (Ideally each user will do her own filtering, but that's a
little further in the future.)

So, from your example: What do people at the source think?  What do
people downstream think?  We need two separate counts to find out.  We
need a residential register too, because the filtering criterion is
residential (source residence vs downstream).

Alternatively, we could ask, &quot;What do the local farmers think?&quot;  For
that, we'd need to bring in additional registers - maybe the member
rolls of local farm cooperatives.  No problem.

Pietro:
&gt;<i> I think we should start a school project where we teach to kids how
</I>&gt;<i> to do voting in other ways. And then they will use it throughout
</I>&gt;<i> high school
</I>
While the student is free-ranging across different pollservers (voting
sites) she may also be free-ranging across different voting methods.
What does her vote look like under STV?  Under asset?  She may go to
the STV and asset pollservers to see for herself.

Owen:
&gt;<i> At some point, it seems to me that is is not just one's &quot;vote&quot; than
</I>&gt;<i> matters but also what else one is willing and able to contribute
</I>&gt;<i> toward realization of the objective(s) implicit in one's vote.
</I>
So it's maybe like this.  You:

  * Vote for policy, but you also help in drafting it (if you wish)

  * Vote for a plan, but you also help in executing it

  * Vote for a town councillor.  Afterwards he contacts you for advice
    regarding the policy you are drafting and the plan you are
    executing.  Or perhaps he delegates power to you, in these regards
