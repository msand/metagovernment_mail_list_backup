<PRE>I'm glad we were able to connect on this, Thomas.  Eventually, I hope that: 

a) anyone who wishes to accomplish anything that takes a significant amount
of effort and requires the involvement of others will publish their goals
and objectives on the Web in StratML format, and 

b) tools like those on which the Metagov subscribers are working can be used
to enable stakeholders anywhere at any time to efficiently and effectively
provide feedback on goals and objectives of interest to them (including
contributions of time, effort, money, and other inputs required to achieve
the objectives).

BTW, w/re the issue of open versus closed source, I believe what matters is
whether the *records* are open and managed in systems trusted by the
stakeholders.  

Both the content of the record and its authoritative *presentation* should
be maintained in assured inviolate form, apart from the databases in which
the &quot;votes&quot; are tallied and under the control of at least one other
&quot;authority&quot; trusted by the voter.  For some folks, that may mean a paper
copy they can take with them, i.e., a &quot;receipt&quot; ... at least until they can
justifiably trust electronic systems, which is not entirely possible yet,
since: a) databases have administrators with superuser privileges, and b)
the records are generally &quot;shredded&quot; into the same databases in which the
votes are tallied.  

(As Arthur Andersen learned, shredding is not a good thing to do with
records. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Andersen</A>  Doing so destroys the
integrity of the presentation of the record, thus creating untrustworthy
records.  At the very least it imposes needless cost as well as risk that
the records, both content and presentation, cannot be reliably
reconstructed.)  

It does not seem to me that whether the software is open source or not truly
matters, so long as the data that it processes can easily be audited (votes
automatically &quot;re-counted&quot;) by other trusted systems.  (This not a message
that software programmers or database designers are open to hearing, because
they tend to want to play God in their creations.)

Hello Owen,

Thank you for rendering the plan! Yes, the clarity is beautiful! Now I 
can really see the benefits, if every project would publish such a plan.

&gt;<i> I look forward to learning whether Pollwiki, Streetwiki and/or other 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> tools and services can eventually be used to enable stakeholder 
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on
</I>&gt;<i> goals and objectives rendered in StratML format ...
</I>
Yes of course! The stakeholders can be of any number and type. Filtering 
their votes by type will be possible, sockpuppets can be filtered out, 
and each stakeholder can propose little or major changes to the 
strategic plan he is voting for and collect support (i.e. votes) for 
these proposed changes. And the plans can be of any format.

Best, Thomas
