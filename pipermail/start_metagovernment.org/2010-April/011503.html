Assuming they are properly designed, if you pick up the tools just
once, the technologists are henceforth working for you.  It's almost
at that point, anyway.  (Heaven help us. ;-)

&gt;<i> I think this is a semantic distinction. As far as I am concerned, your

</I>
OK.  (BTW free-range voting is Thomas's invention.)

&gt;<i> Whatever it is called, this sort of cross-project communication seems  
</I>&gt;<i> like something that would be of interest to members of a meta- 
</I>&gt;<i> organization.

Then I'm at your service, just tell me what to do.
