<PRE>That sounds good. Yes, let's talk about this on Saturday.
@Friedrich: since you can not come: If there are things you want us to 
keep in mind, please tell me via skype or so. ;-)

Best,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i> In other threads, the idea has been developing that that project

</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment (as a meta-organization) can build on at this time.  
</I>&gt;<i> Working out the details would be a great topic for this Saturday's  
</I>&gt;<i> meeting. For example, the new hosting space on Tuxfamily.org would  
</I>&gt;<i> likely be a good residence for it.

</I>&gt;<i> As for Liquid Democracy, I admit I haven't had much time to look into  
</I>&gt;<i> them (and their English resources are not very robust yet), but it is  
</I>&gt;<i> worth noting that delegated voting is effectively a subset of the  
</I>&gt;<i> mission of Metagovernment. Our mission encompasses any project which  
</I>&gt;<i> gives everyone a direct voice in governance. It is my understanding  
</I>&gt;<i> that Votorola (and I presume the other Liquid members) allows people  
</I>&gt;<i> to de-delegate or re-delegate at any time, effectively taking direct  
</I>&gt;<i> control of their vote if they don't like how the delegate is  
</I>&gt;<i> representing them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finding more common ground with Liquid would be fantastic.
