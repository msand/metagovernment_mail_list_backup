That's largely my fault, I'm afraid. Several huge, unavoidable  
projects have been consuming most of my time for a long time now, and  
the end result is that I don't spend enough time comprehending what I  
read. So I am guilty of glossing over some conversations and  
interjecting what end up being uninformed comments. In any event, my  
intention is to usually defer to the technologists in this project, as  
you are the ones actually producing the tools we need.

I think this is a semantic distinction. As far as I am concerned, your  
free-range voting project is a form of standardization. Indeed it is  
not a set of standards, but it does have some of the same effects as  
standards, by providing some form of normalization between different  
voting systems.

Whatever it is called, this sort of cross-project communication seems  
like something that would be of interest to members of a meta- 
organization.
