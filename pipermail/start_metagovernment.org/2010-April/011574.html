<PRE>Dear Pledgebank Team, I subscribed to the Metagov listserv to explore
prospects for facilitating feedback on goals and objectives rendered in
Strategy Markup Language (StratML) format.  Via the Metagov listserv, I
learned of your service.  While any feedback may be better than no feedback,
meaningful offers of assistance may be the best kind of feedback.

 

I encourage you to consider enabling usage of Pledgebank to enable
individuals to offer their time, expertise, money, and other resources
toward the realization of goals and objectives rendered in StratML format.

 

The purposes of the StratML standard (ANSI/AIIM 21:2009) are outlined at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A>  (We hope it will
eventually become an ISO standard.)  Thus far, nearly 600 strategic plans
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm</A>&gt;  have been rendered in StratML
format, including the plans of more than 260 nonprofit, public
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Nonprofits">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#Nonprofits</A>&gt;  service
organizations.  The prototypical StratML-enabled services that have been
developed so far are listed at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Services">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Services</A>
However, none of them yet leverages the StratML &lt;Identifier
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Identifier">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Identifier</A>&gt; &gt; element to
enable feedback on individual goal and objective statements.  (Joe Carmel's
XForms form automatically creates GUID IDs for each goal and objective
statement contained in plans authored or edited using the form
&lt;<A HREF="http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/stratmlxform3.xml">http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/stratmlxform3.xml</A>&gt; .)

 

If, by any chance, this is an opportunity Pledgebank may wish to pursue, the
open &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OpenGovDirective">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OpenGovDirective</A>&gt;
government plans that U.S. federal agencies have been directed to compile
and maintain might provide an excellent focus for such feedback services.
See, for example, the &quot;Participation&quot; goals/objectives in each of the plans
currently in the collection:  USDA

64ea2a&gt;  1.b contained in the Open Gov Directive, agencies will eventually
maintain their own plans in StratML format.)

 

Needless to say, if you do decide to take up this challenge, I will be more
than happy to assist in any way of which I am capable.

Though it has some big name sponsors, the conference is 100% volunteer run,
so i don' think they'll be willing to subsidize transportation costs.  

Your idea about raising money from the group is a good one.  We could use
pledgebank &lt;<A HREF="http://www.pledgebank.com/">http://www.pledgebank.com/</A>&gt;  to manage our fundraising.  The way
it works is we set a goal (the cost of your travel) and each of us pledge as
much as we're willing to contribute.  When the total amount pledged reaches
the goal, everyone who pledged is charged.  (Actually, I just tried to
create a pledge for us, and I'm not sure it can work exactly as I described.
I've sent an email to their team to inquire.)

Or we could just keep a running total - I'd be willing to chip in $100 to
get you out here.  Anyone else?

for what I have seen the cheapest is to go to london, london NY, and then NY
portland. Now I am asking the group here to pay me to NY, and the conference
organiser to pay me from NY. It will not work, but it is worth a try :-)

Thank you. I do appreciate your offer.  

 

I made a search on the internet. Leaving from london, with aircanada, and
then using local flight the cost would be around 800$. It is way too much
for me to finance it by myself. 

I am asking my boss if they would be willing to pay part of it, but part of
the problem is that I am not actually presenting any work. So I was thinking
how it could be done.

 

For example, if, as part of the session I got to present the work we did
with Vilfredo, this would cover some bases: it might be a good ground to ask
to the group to support part of it. If the conference sponsor could pay for
part of the trip (say from NYC to Oregon) then I think that we could do it.
I would pay inside Europe (to London), maybe the group here would pay the
europe-US part, and the conference sponsor might pay for the US part.

 

What do you think? Would this sound reasonable? I am sorry I cannot chip in
with more. I am sure you will understand.

 

Best Regards,

Pietro

Hi Pietro, I'd be thrilled if you could make it.  You'd be welcome to stay
at my place, if that would help on the cost side of things.

Hello Mark, 

I would love to participate. Unfortunately coming to Oregon from Portugal is
not exactly cheap.  

If you are interested I will look if I can find some cheap flights.

 

Cheers,

Pietro

Your points make the case for the title of the panel - &quot;Grass Roots
Implementation of the OGD&quot;.  The reality is that the easy part for
government is transparency.  It's our work that can provide participatory
and collaborative data products for consumption by government decision
makers.

I'll do some work on roughing out an agenda and will share it with the
group.  Ed, I'll pencil you in as a participant and continue recruiting.
I'm hoping to have a state or local government official on the panel to
provide their perspective.

More to come-

I would be likely to be interested in joining your panel, if you would be
interested in a sort of devil's advocate (from the far side of the
spectrum). That is, while I think the general idea of the Open Government
Directive is laudable, I also think it is deceptively short-sighted. It is
wonderful that the public is being invited into more of the machinations of
the bureaucracy of the Federal government, but there is very little being
done to promote the core of democracy: inviting people into the
decision-making processes of the legislature and executive (or even into the
final decision-making of the bureaucracy). I also am critical of the
top-down Federal approach, when the real downfall of closed government
happens at the local levels, where corruption and secrecy often run rampant.

 

So if you would like that perspective on your panel, I'd be happy to
consider joining you. If you think it would dilute focus... I understand
that as well. :)
