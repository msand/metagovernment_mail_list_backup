<PRE>Your points make the case for the title of the panel - &quot;Grass Roots
Implementation of the OGD&quot;.  The reality is that the easy part for
government is transparency.  It's our work that can provide participatory
and collaborative data products for consumption by government decision
makers.

I'll do some work on roughing out an agenda and will share it with the
group.  Ed, I'll pencil you in as a participant and continue recruiting.
I'm hoping to have a state or local government official on the panel to
provide their perspective.

More to come-

</I>&gt;<i> spectrum). That is, while I think the general idea of the Open Government
</I>&gt;<i> Directive is laudable, I also think it is deceptively short-sighted. It is
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful that the public is being invited into more of the machinations of
</I>&gt;<i> the bureaucracy of the Federal government, but there is very little being
</I>&gt;<i> done to promote the core of democracy: inviting people into the
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making processes of the legislature and executive (or even into the
</I>&gt;<i> final decision-making of the bureaucracy). I also am critical of the
</I>&gt;<i> top-down Federal approach, when the real downfall of closed government
</I>&gt;<i> happens at the local levels, where corruption and secrecy often run rampant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you would like that perspective on your panel, I'd be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> consider joining you. If you think it would dilute focus... I understand
</I>&gt;<i> that as well. :)
