<PRE>It's great to hear form you Mark. I hope you are following the other  
concurrent threads: DemocracyLab sounds like a good candidate for  
participation in the free-range voting project.

I would be likely to be interested in joining your panel, if you would  
be interested in a sort of devil's advocate (from the far side of the  
spectrum). That is, while I think the general idea of the Open  
Government Directive is laudable, I also think it is deceptively short- 
sighted. It is wonderful that the public is being invited into more of  
the machinations of the bureaucracy of the Federal government, but  
there is very little being done to promote the core of democracy:  
inviting people into the decision-making processes of the legislature  
and executive (or even into the final decision-making of the  
bureaucracy). I also am critical of the top-down Federal approach,  
when the real downfall of closed government happens at the local  
levels, where corruption and secrecy often run rampant.

So if you would like that perspective on your panel, I'd be happy to  
consider joining you. If you think it would dilute focus... I  
understand that as well. :)
