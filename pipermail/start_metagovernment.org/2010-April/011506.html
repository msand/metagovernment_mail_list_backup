<PRE>I think it is a wonderful idea, Thomas.

In other threads, the idea has been developing that that project  
appears to be the best concrete development project that  
Metagovernment (as a meta-organization) can build on at this time.  
Working out the details would be a great topic for this Saturday's  
meeting. For example, the new hosting space on Tuxfamily.org would  
likely be a good residence for it.

As for Liquid Democracy, I admit I haven't had much time to look into  
them (and their English resources are not very robust yet), but it is  
worth noting that delegated voting is effectively a subset of the  
mission of Metagovernment. Our mission encompasses any project which  
gives everyone a direct voice in governance. It is my understanding  
that Votorola (and I presume the other Liquid members) allows people  
to de-delegate or re-delegate at any time, effectively taking direct  
control of their vote if they don't like how the delegate is  
representing them.

Finding more common ground with Liquid would be fantastic.

</I>&gt;<i> What do you guys think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,

</I>&gt;<i> PS: The current version of the pollwiki (very new and almost empty)

</I>&gt;<i> The common pollwiki is necesarry for vote-mirroring, because it
