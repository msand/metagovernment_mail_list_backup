<PRE>I don't think it is reasonable to develop a language just so that everybody
is able to read the code without studying the language before. I do admit
that it would be a really important thing, but the level of complication
necessary might be way too much.

I mean, we accept that laws are written by lawyers, read by lawyers and
interpreted by lawyers. If you need to do anything real with laws you pay a
lawyer. And similarly we accept that we have engineer to build stuff.  I
understand I am right now shooting a huge arrow against the whole point of
eGov because if we accept that laws need people educated in laws to develop
them, then how can we ever have participatory democracy at all.

But I think we need to strike a balance.

Regarding the code. Anyone should be able to employ a technician to check
out something, or study a bit and be able to check it himself. Like it is
with open source software right now.

And regarding the participation, there might be different level of
participations. When people are discussing ideas maybe it is more open, but
when we move to the phase of actually crafting down laws, I do expect
technician to be involved. Which does not mean that a self educated person,
or someone who pays someone else to explain them cannot participate.

Just I don't think we can honestly expect everybody to understand every
possible detail, and be able to participate. It is important to move away
from the bottleneck where only few voted (and lobbied) people craft the law.
But the intrinsic complexity of the system will never permit everyone to
participate with no prior-education.

But the good news is that computer language are getting easier with time. I
mean, reading today's python code is much easier than reading yesterday's C.
And it is all much easier than two days ago 8086 Assembly.

Maybe in future we will just have a machine asking:
&quot;SO what the f... do you want me to do?&quot; ;-)
You tell it to the machine in plain English and it just does it. We just are
not there yet :-)
