  Thank you. I do appreciate your offer. 


  I made a search on the internet. Leaving from london, with aircanada, and then using local flight the cost would be around 800$. It is way too much for me to finance it by myself.
  I am asking my boss if they would be willing to pay part of it, but part of the problem is that I am not actually presenting any work. So I was thinking how it could be done.


  For example, if, as part of the session I got to present the work we did with Vilfredo, this would cover some bases: it might be a good ground to ask to the group to support part of it. If the conference sponsor could pay for part of the trip (say from NYC to Oregon) then I think that we could do it. I would pay inside Europe (to London), maybe the group here would pay the europe-US part, and the conference sponsor might pay for the US part.


  What do you think? Would this sound reasonable? I am sorry I cannot chip in with more. I am sure you will understand.


  Best Regards,
  Pietro

    Hi Pietro, I'd be thrilled if you could make it.  You'd be welcome to stay at my place, if that would help on the cost side of things.

      Hello Mark,
      I would love to participate. Unfortunately coming to Oregon from Portugal is not exactly cheap. 
      If you are interested I will look if I can find some cheap flights.


      Cheers,
      Pietro

        Your points make the case for the title of the panel - &quot;Grass Roots Implementation of the OGD&quot;.  The reality is that the easy part for government is transparency.  It's our work that can provide participatory and collaborative data products for consumption by government decision makers.

        I'll do some work on roughing out an agenda and will share it with the group.  Ed, I'll pencil you in as a participant and continue recruiting.  I'm hoping to have a state or local government official on the panel to provide their perspective.

        More to come-

          I would be likely to be interested in joining your panel, if you would be interested in a sort of devil's advocate (from the far side of the spectrum). That is, while I think the general idea of the Open Government Directive is laudable, I also think it is deceptively short-sighted. It is wonderful that the public is being invited into more of the machinations of the bureaucracy of the Federal government, but there is very little being done to promote the core of democracy: inviting people into the decision-making processes of the legislature and executive (or even into the final decision-making of the bureaucracy). I also am critical of the top-down Federal approach, when the real downfall of closed government happens at the local levels, where corruption and secrecy often run rampant.


          So if you would like that perspective on your panel, I'd be happy to consider joining you. If you think it would dilute focus... I understand that as well. :)

            Hi Metagovers-

            Mark Frischmuth at DemocracyLab checking in.  I'd like to let this group know about a speaking opportunity in early June out in Oregon.  &quot;
            Transparent, Collaborative, Participatory - Grass Roots Implementation of the Open Government Directive&quot; was accepted as a session for this conference.  I'm working to assemble a panel of speakers to discuss the broad themes of our movement.  I'd like to invite this group to help me shape the agenda for the session, and for anyone who's interested in being a panelist to let me know. 


            Here's a link to the conference info page.

            Cheers-


            Mark\
