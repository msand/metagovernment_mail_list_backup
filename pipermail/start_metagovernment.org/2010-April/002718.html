Letter to Bob Howard.
Contact person of democracy.org 501c3.

Subject: Project proposal
---------------------------------------

Dear Bob Howard,

We read at democracy.org that you are listening for ideas to support,
with both your non-profit status and/or website. We are writing to you
because we have an interesting one.

We are a project that supports the development and use of Internet
tools which enable the members of any community to fully participate
in the governance of that community; called Metagovernment
(<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>). Actually, Metagovernment is an umbrella,
a hub point between several projects. Most of them are groups of
programmers that code tools for democracy in their free time.

There is a flourishment of this kind of projects around the world,
specially in the United States, as can be seen in this list:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/related.">http://www.metagovernment.org/related.</A> We would like to raise
donations and help them providing them resources. For this, we should
create a 501c3...

We want these projects share their experiences between them, to
communicate and aid each other, and to set up a portal to present the
projects to the public. A fine place in the Internet is required,
something like &quot;edemocracy.org&quot;...

We wanted to see what were behind such an important domain. Nothing;
it is for sale for a huge price. So we tried similar ones, and found
you. And what you are offering suits more than perfect to our needs:
501c3 and website. Serendipity.

We understand that this proposal falls outside of your scope of
action. You are an educational NGO. Although, we are working for a
better democracy too, that is our shared interest. We are convinced
that Internet is a key ingredient to boost democracy. We could work
together (because technology alone fixs nothing) accomplishing
educational aims also.

</PRE>
