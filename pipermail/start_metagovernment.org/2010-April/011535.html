Winner of Innovations Award 2009 for IT Innovation and
Manthan Award 2006 for e-Inclusion &amp; Livelihood Creation.
Selected for World Bank Innovation Fair 2010.

Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and
well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing
and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in
the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other
lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control. &#8230; Article 25 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

&quot;A quick evaluation of the progress we have achieved in the last 20 years
shows that in the area of poverty alleviation, we have not done enough.
 History will judge us harshly, unless we seize the opportunity to do more.&quot;
- Archbishop Njongo Ndungane, President and Founder, African Monitor.
