<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i> Is the process of navigating Votorola documented somewhere? In any

Yes, I agree. I will do a screencast in the next couple of days, which 
will make everything very clear.

&gt;<i> Separately, I think I support this proposal, but would like to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> a little clarification. What is meant by an &quot;official subsidiary?&quot; The
</I>&gt;<i> nuance seems relevant since, in a sense, Metagov itself is not an
</I>&gt;<i> official organization (that is, we are not recognized by any existing
</I>&gt;<i> authority as having any status other than something like a club). But
</I>&gt;<i> then again, we do toy with the idea of adding some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> formalization to our existence in some way.
</I>
Maybe my English is a bit strange. With &quot;official&quot; I meant, that we as 
Metagovernment officially (publically and with consensus) declare it as 
one of our projects, give it a name and keep supporting it. And 
additionally I also like the idea of formalizing its existence or/and 
ours as Metagov, because this would open the possiblities for 
fund-raising, ...

&gt;<i> Alternately, why a subsidiary and not just a part of Metagov? Is this
</I>&gt;<i> to also bring in Liquid Demorcracy? Again, I am just asking for
</I>&gt;<i> clarification, but also suggesting that, since this project appears to
</I>&gt;<i> fulfill a core function of Metagov's mission, that is can be a direct
</I>&gt;<i> (as opposed to subsidiary) project of Metagov.
</I>
Yes, I think there is some interest of Liquid Demorcracy e.V. to further 
contribute to it too. And since it is a meta-group too, I thought we 
make it our common project. Maybe even other such groups will emerge in 
the future. I think this openness is desirable, but I dont know how to 
describe it with an English term.?

&gt;<i> And returning to the process of Votorola, would it be more appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> for me to bring this up elsewhere (such as on a discussion page in a
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola wiki), or is this list equally acceptable, since it reaches
</I>&gt;<i> the relevant audience?
</I>
I think this list is best for the discussion. And the pollwiki is best 
for presenting and formalizing the different positions.

Your position-page for this poll is here:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Ed-EdpastoreCom/G/p/frvp</A>

If you like, you can copy and paste from mine and then make your changes 
to it:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp</A>

And then you can collect votes for your position. If it convinces me too 
and the folks who voted for me have no objections, I will delegate our 5 
votes to you too and merge your changes into my/our position. ;-)


Thomas
