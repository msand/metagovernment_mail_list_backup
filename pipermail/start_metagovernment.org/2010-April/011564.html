<PRE>Mark, I should mention that my situation has become rather fluid, and  
I can't make definitive plans for that time period.

Any chance they could accommodate Pietro, me and/or others via Skype  
(etc.)?

</I>&gt;<i> I would be likely to be interested in joining your panel, if you  
</I>&gt;<i> would be interested in a sort of devil's advocate (from the far side  
</I>&gt;<i> of the spectrum). That is, while I think the general idea of the  
</I>&gt;<i> Open Government Directive is laudable, I also think it is  
</I>&gt;<i> deceptively short-sighted. It is wonderful that the public is being  
</I>&gt;<i> invited into more of the machinations of the bureaucracy of the  
</I>&gt;<i> Federal government, but there is very little being done to promote  
</I>&gt;<i> the core of democracy: inviting people into the decision-making  
</I>&gt;<i> processes of the legislature and executive (or even into the final  
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making of the bureaucracy). I also am critical of the top- 
</I>&gt;<i> down Federal approach, when the real downfall of closed government  
</I>&gt;<i> happens at the local levels, where corruption and secrecy often run  
</I>&gt;<i> rampant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you would like that perspective on your panel, I'd be happy to  
</I>&gt;<i> consider joining you. If you think it would dilute focus... I  
</I>&gt;<i> understand that as well. :)
