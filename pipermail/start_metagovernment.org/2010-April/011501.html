It's best to speak with Thomas, at least initially.  There's lots to
be gained from working together, and I've always hoped for it, but you
and I often have trouble understanding each other.

Quite honestly, I'm not working on any standards.  I really don't
think they are needed (not yet).

Thomas is better for that, too.  I have trouble defining tasks for
other people.

True, and it's a good mission statement - a good definition of
e-democracy.

The vision is a little on the particular side.  It's just one path
(among many) that people might choose to follow.  The crucial thing is
having the freedom to choose.  (But I'm sure nobody disagrees with
that.)
