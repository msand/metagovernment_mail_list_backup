<PRE>This would be a good opportunity for Votorola to be a little better  
explained to the general Metagov group...

It took me some clicking around to find the associated proposal:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe&amp;p=G!p!frvp">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe&amp;p=G!p!frvp</A>
Is the process of navigating Votorola documented somewhere? In any  
event, it would be helpful to explain it to this group to encourage  
participation.

Separately, I think I support this proposal, but would like to ask for  
a little clarification. What is meant by an &quot;official subsidiary?&quot; The  
nuance seems relevant since, in a sense, Metagov itself is not an  
official organization (that is, we are not recognized by any existing  
authority as having any status other than something like a club). But  
then again, we do toy with the idea of adding some sort of  
formalization to our existence in some way. I am just asking for  
clarification.

Alternately, why a subsidiary and not just a part of Metagov? Is this  
to also bring in Liquid Demorcracy? Again, I am just asking for  
clarification, but also suggesting that, since this project appears to  
fulfill a core function of Metagov's mission, that is can be a direct  
(as opposed to subsidiary) project of Metagov.

And returning to the process of Votorola, would it be more appropriate  
for me to bring this up elsewhere (such as on a discussion page in a  
Votorola wiki), or is this list equally acceptable, since it reaches  
the relevant audience?

It would also be helpful to explain here how I (or someone else) would  
go about proposing an alternative proposal.

Thanks!
