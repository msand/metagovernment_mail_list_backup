<PRE>Hello everybody,

while talking so long about standardization, common registration, 
vote-mirroring etc. Mike and Philippe have also been working on the 
software itself. Some parts developed out of Votorola, some are 
completely new. From my perspective it has now reached a stage where it 
needs a frame for itself. I mean, it needs an own name, something like a 
project-site and so on.

Now my question is: Since to a large degree it all developed out of the 
discussions in our list here, how if we make this an official subsidiary 
project of Metagovernment?

Additionally I want to propose the same to the Liquid Democracy e.V., 
because of their contribution to the ideas and their similiar mission to 
Metagovernments. (For those not familiar with it: it is a german 
metagroup for e-dem-projects, but more with the focus on delegated 
voting. (at least Friedrich (Adhocracy) and me are members in both) 
(german homepage: <A HREF="http://wiki.liqd.net/Main_Page">http://wiki.liqd.net/Main_Page</A>)) How if our two 
meta-organizations would make this our common project?

For other reasons I had bought the domains FreeVoters.net and 
FreeVoters.org a while ago. In case we all like this name, I would give 
these domains for the project. FreeVoters.net could be where the actual 
software is running, and FreeVoters.org could be the project-site for 
presentation, coordination of support, etc.

What do you guys think?

Best,
Thomas

PS: The current version of the pollwiki (very new and almost empty) can 
be found here: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:Main_page">http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:Main_page</A>

The common pollwiki is necesarry for vote-mirroring, because it tells 
every engine which poll to mirror from and to in all the other engines.
