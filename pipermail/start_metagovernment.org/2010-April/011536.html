<PRE>

Thanks for the link, Owen.  I consider this to be horrendous news. A
major motivator in starting Metagovernment was to get the jump on companies
like Microsoft or FaceBook, which inherently would lead to commercializing
core governance functions. Just what we need!  You can see it right in the
linked page: &quot;TownHall provides a cloud-hosted solution in a low-cost,
low-friction fashion.&quot; <A HREF="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/TownHall">http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/TownHall</A>  So first
they are saying it would be cloud-hosted, which means that Microsoft would
control the actual mechanism, as opposed to a non-profit, a government, or
the best solution: a distributed, multiply check-summed network where no
one player has unilateral control. How can government agencies fall for
this? They really implicitly trust Microsoft to never, ever tamper with any
of the data?  Second, they say it is &quot;low-cost.&quot; In other words, that they
intend to make a profit off our governance, as opposed to the free (as in
freedom) projects in Metagovernment. This is the core issue of libre
software: it isn't always as robust as commercial software, but it doesn't
require that you forfeit your freedom to use it. People are often overly
tempted by the bells and whistles of the commercial freedom, and think they
are worth the sacrifice of a little freedom. For example, see the &quot;Fear of
Freedom&quot; section of:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html</A> 
Additionally, MS TownHall seems to violate Jim Gilliam's very sensible rule
of never giving a user reputation for something they do themselves, but
only for what others do for them. Allowing someone to gain reputation
simply by counting their posts obviously will lead to
spamming-for-reputation. Isn't that obvious?  And of course, there is the
simple fact that it is Microsoft... not exactly known for their
non-draconian ways.  The one redeeming grace I see here is that they seem
to be stuck in the traditional Government 2.0 model, where citizen input is
only for the processes of bureaucratic agencies, never for actual
governance decisions. We can continue to hope that they fail to realize the
potential for governance itself to be crowdsourced. But eventually the day
will come when a large commercial institution will attempt to make
governance proprietary. The key question, then, is can Metagovernment have
software ready and implemented by then such that people will be unwilling
to forfeit their freedom to a corporation for a few pretty graphics.

Dear Metagov
Colleagues, perhaps you already know about MS's TownHall [1] but this is
the first I've heard of it. While they suggest [2] social networking tools
are maturing and what is needed is an even greater level of engagement, in
my view the tools remain highly immature and most of us already have more
(relatively unproductive) &quot;engagements&quot; than we can handle. 

In that sense
it seems to me tools like TownHall are tantamount to &quot;paving the cow path&quot;
with respect to old-fashioned discussion and debate, which may be &quot;fun&quot;
(now we can even do it on our all-purposeful cell phones &#8230; isn't that
wonderful!) but tends to lead to greater polarization, if not gridlock,
when what is truly needed are new and better (super highway) tools to help
people *WORK TOGETHER* *MORE PRODUCTIVELY* to *ALLOCATE (THEIR OWN)
RESOURCES* and *EXERT (THEIR OWN) EFFORTS* to accomplish *COMMON
OBJECTIVES* (and to measure and report to stakeholders the degrees to which
they are able to do so). 

If the MS folks are seriously open to greater
engagement with folks like me (which I doubt), I will suggest they
incorporate the Strategy Markup Language (StratML) standard (ANSI/AIIM
21:2009) into a more mature and potentially productive version of TownHall.
Unless and until it supports something very much like the open StratML
standard, TownHall looks to me like yet another &quot;pretty face [3]&quot; in the
crowd &#8230; or dare I say yet another attempt to put lipstick on a
(proprietary) pig.

In the
not too distant future, a new generation of social media will be
administered by virtual civil servants and patrolled by cyber sheriffs.
