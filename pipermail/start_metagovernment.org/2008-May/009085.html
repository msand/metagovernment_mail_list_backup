<PRE>As I've said numerous times, for me the most important aspect of
this project, is not the software, but our way of thinking about
government. What we're asking for is to put every member of a
community on the same level, when it comes to deciding what
direction the community is going to take.

Very few CEO types or in fact any organizations with a hierarchy,
will immediately adopt our model. Those making the decisions, will
find ways to keep the status quo. I mean they've spent their carriers
trying to get where they are, they're not about to give that away.

What we need are convincing arguments, data, case studies. We
need to show that our system is more efficient, can produce better
decisions, and invoke a greater sense of personal responsibility
in individual members of the community.

This is a matter of education and as far as I'm concerned, the most
important task for the Metagovernment Organization. It is currently
however not our top priority, and can in fact hardly be undertaken,
without previously acquiring some data.

I think the only realistic approach is an incremental one.

Aur is right, when he says that the software is hard. Therefore we
should start out with something that may not fulfill all our
criteria on every level, but will at least be useful for our own
discussions, as well as any other community wishing to use an open
source government model.

Using this prototype, I hope we can gain some publicity and
recognition, and grow our community to a level where we can start
working on more lofty goals.
