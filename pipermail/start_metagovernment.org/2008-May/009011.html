<PRE>The problem with having too wide a range is that every user defines
her/his threshold of acceptability - my 3 may mean I approve, someone
else's 3 may mean no, but better than the rest. Even if we define what
'3' means, as you suggest below, users are prone to ignore these
recommendations.

I say we keep it simple - yes, no, not sure. Anything more nuanced
warrants a comment, or too much complexity (like ranking among yes and
no responses).

In market research, where I have some experience, surveys are
typically given a finer gradation of possible response choices where
we want their response to be more heavily influenced by the user's gut
response. The fewer choices given, the more we force them to come to a
decision, ie think about their response and thus the response becomes
more heavily influenced by rational thought.

In this case, contrary to what was posted by others on the list, I
think having a less finely graded system (such as yes/no) will be more
likely to foster consensus than having a -10/+10 or -1/+1
nearly-continuous grading system where users can pick a number more or
less at random, thus facilitating impulsive decisions. Having a less
finely graded scoring system will also force users to voice their more
nuanced opinions to qualify their 'yes' or 'no' instead of giving a
score of 5.7 which they may feel expresses their opinion without their
having to expend the effort to comment specifically.

Comments from the group?
