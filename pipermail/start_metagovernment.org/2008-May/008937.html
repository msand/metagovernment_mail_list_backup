<PRE>&gt;<i>  implementations as possible. A community should be able to define itself
</I>&gt;<i>  and implement the software in the way it sees most fit for self-governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Is this consistent with what others are thinking?
</I>
I don't think we will actually know what the best implementation or the best
use of the software will be, until we actually start seeing it being used. Every
community is different and will want the software to support the process
they develop, so I agree that we should support as many features, as a
community might want to use.

Nonetheless, I do want to set them on the right track, and I would again
like to emphasize that the software is not the most important thing here.
If we simply release the software to a community, who is new to open
government they might simply start voting on everything.

More than writing software, I think we are trying to find a way of doing
government. An important part of this project will therefor be a guidebook,
showing different models for a community and how members interact
within it.
