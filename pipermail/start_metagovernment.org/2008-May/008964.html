I think I can see how this could work... provided there are enough  
active communities that nobody could possibly participate in all of  
them. I also am very in favor of simplification. Every time this  
project has been simplified, it has gotten stronger.

But I still have reservations about hot-button issues, where people  
get swayed into voting on a particular issue because of some outside  
pressure such as a political party or a labor union. But again,  
perhaps sheer volume of votable issues would be a regulating factor.  
If there are millions of resolutions out there, people would naturally  
only vote on ones they really care about.

I would like to hear what some other members of this group think about  
this...

&gt;&gt;<i> That's just it. In attempting to build your consultancy, isn't it

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can outweigh them if enough of them participate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People will know my name and learn to respect my words. I don't need

</I>&gt;<i> ours) to give me an edge.
</I>
I am not sure how well this scales to large communities. As long as we  
have the convenience of having computers intermediate in our  
conversations, why not use them to help us to filter the millions of  
voices speaking on the large-scale issues?

&gt;<i> Why don't we build the simpler version, test it in practice, and if we
</I>&gt;<i> see that it needs a fix because mobs use their mass to impose their
</I>&gt;<i> rule - we can add that fix later (as I said, lets make the math VERY
</I>&gt;<i> modular).
</I>
There is something to be said for having a limited scope to version  
0.1. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Lets start from the simplest possible: 90% of votes in favor, at  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1% of the community participates, sends a proposed legislation to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;prerelease&quot;. If after one week at least 90% of the votes are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> positive, it is law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there is the problem of defining the community. How do you say  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;1%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the community&quot; if the community is self-defined and anyone can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh no, I was meaning &quot;1% of the world population known to the
</I>&gt;<i> software&quot;. This is a temporary measure that will be changed to
</I>&gt;<i> something more reasonable later on. It exists because it works for
</I>&gt;<i> small communities and would remove an obstacle in the way of working.
</I>
There has to be more flexibility than that. Some communities may only  
be relevant to ten people, and some may be relevant to the entire world.

What if we say X% of the number of the number of people who have  
participated in that community in the last three months? In that case,  
I would guess that X would usually be rather high.

If we have non-binding user scores, I imagine that their adoption  
would vary significantly depending on the community. Perhaps larger  
communities could start to use it to have additional meaning for  
filtering, while smaller communities would see no need for using it.
