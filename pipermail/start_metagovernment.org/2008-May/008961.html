And what is an artificial heart, if not a series of pumps and pistons?

And if an old heart surgeon hears about something stupid that the old

</I>&gt;<i>  should the 4-year-olds get to decide policy on artificial hearts?
</I>
If they care enough to vote, then they are probably connected to the
problem somehow... Like the fact that one day they will grow up and
maybe need an artificial heart. If they really are indifferent to the
problem.. They won't vote.

&gt;<i>  &gt; So I write &quot;I am not a doctor, but here's a smart idea&quot; and if it IS
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; smart people vote for it and if it isn't they don't. He writes &quot;I'm a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; doctor. It is essential that you vote for THIS because I have
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; experience and can tell you THIS IS HOW IT GOES IN PRACTICE&quot;. He might
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; (or might not :P) get more &quot;mob&quot; votes because of that. In practice,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; if a really bad idea gets voted, the doctors association will publish
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; an urgent warning to the public and ask everyone to vote it down. Just
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; like you have people in wikipedia who spend hours refreshing the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;latest changes&quot; page and fixing spam... I'm betting the jackpot on
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; there being far more concerned citizens than mischievous citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  User scoring is just a way of codifying the &quot;I am a doctor&quot; statement.
</I>&gt;<i>  So that instead of having to take someone at their word at that
</I>&gt;<i>  moment, we can judge them by all of their past contributions to the
</I>&gt;<i>  community.
</I>
The community does this for itself. Have you ever noticed the respect
veteran forum users get? It's not because of the &quot;500 posts&quot; they have
written near their user names. It's because community members learned
to respect what they have to say.

&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; If we create a system in which anyone can participate, then people
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; who
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; participate more in a particular area should(?) have more say in that
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; area. This way, we allow anyone to add their ideas to the betterment
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; of a community, but the active members of the community are the ones
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; whose ideas are most respected.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Sorry, I just don't see why, and as someone who is building a personal
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; career as a consultant on fields he never touched before, I STRONGLY
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; disagree with your logic. I think voting can regulate it all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That's just it. In attempting to build your consultancy, isn't it
</I>&gt;<i>  crucial that you build your reputation over time? User-scoring doesn't
</I>&gt;<i>  disallow participation from people with no experience or reputation,
</I>&gt;<i>  it is just a formal way of mathematically expressing one's reputation.
</I>&gt;<i>  If we do the math right, we can make it so that the people with high
</I>&gt;<i>  scores in a particular topic have a larger say, but that other people
</I>&gt;<i>  can outweigh them if enough of them participate.
</I>
People will know my name and learn to respect my words. I don't need
the mechanics of the world (the laws in this case, the software in
ours) to give me an edge.


Why don't we build the simpler version, test it in practice, and if we
see that it needs a fix because mobs use their mass to impose their
rule - we can add that fix later (as I said, lets make the math VERY
modular).

&gt;<i>  Here's an example I had been thinking of: imagine a city which wants
</I>&gt;<i>  to flood a canyon in order to build a dam that will power the city. It
</I>&gt;<i>  could be that the people of the city have decided that they want the
</I>&gt;<i>  dam, and their community strongly supports the building of the dam. If
</I>&gt;<i>  some non-resident people want to prevent the building of the dam, they
</I>&gt;<i>  should be able to express their opinions and try to sway the
</I>&gt;<i>  conversation, but being non-resident, they shouldn't have equal say to
</I>&gt;<i>  the residents. However, if everyone downstream from that city is
</I>&gt;<i>  extremely opposed to the dam, they can all start participating in the
</I>&gt;<i>  community. Even with their lower scores in that community, they can
</I>&gt;<i>  outweigh the votes of the city residents.
</I>
Am I the only one that thinks they should have equal say as the residents?

&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; Well, we still need the math to determine a consensus score; that is,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; at what point does something become a law? This is complicated by the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; fact that it is an open, inclusive system. If anyone can participate
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; in any community, then what sets the threshold for any particular
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; community? Can it be a floating number based on recent past scores?
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; That is, could it be something like: the top-scoring 1% of all
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;&gt; resolutions in a community become laws?
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Lets start from the simplest possible: 90% of votes in favor, at least
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; 1% of the community participates, sends a proposed legislation to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &quot;prerelease&quot;. If after one week at least 90% of the votes are
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; positive, it is law
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But there is the problem of defining the community. How do you say &quot;1%
</I>&gt;<i>  of the community&quot; if the community is self-defined and anyone can
</I>&gt;<i>  participate?
</I>
Oh no, I was meaning &quot;1% of the world population known to the
software&quot;. This is a temporary measure that will be changed to
something more reasonable later on. It exists because it works for
small communities and would remove an obstacle in the way of working.

&gt;<i>  If we do have a central repository, it can still be distributed, as is
</I>&gt;<i>  done with the root nameservers:
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  If we have several servers mirroring each other, then they would also
</I>&gt;<i>  checksum each other, so that any corruption of one gets cancelled out
</I>&gt;<i>  by the others. Each server could have a different management team, and
</I>&gt;<i>  the checksumming would then correct for corruption in one team.
</I>
On the other hand, it would be a problem to have mirrors that are
supposed to be identical in real time when you have things changing as
fast as I expect them to.

Anyway, this is something that should be built UPON what we make, not
IN what we make.

&gt;<i> There can still be user scoring by field of expertise -- this helps give
</I>&gt;<i> their opinion more weight (like in any well-structured forum) and people
</I>&gt;<i> can take this into consideration in giving their vote. But all people
</I>&gt;<i> should still decide how much each opinion is worth putting into law.
</I>
I don't think I follow. But what I think is that we should let the
people read the different opinions and decide based on their validity
instead of giving some of the opinions &quot;more say&quot; to start with and
some of the people &quot;more weight&quot; in voting.
