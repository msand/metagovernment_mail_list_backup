<PRE>&quot;The issue I see here, is that messages don't really need to be under
version control. Implementing the scoring system on that, may also
be more difficult. I think it would be appropriate, to separate
discussions into a different medium than the legislation. A database
seems to be the intuitive solution, but that may be due to our
backgrounds.&quot;

Yip- proposed legislation, comments, discussions, videos, polls etc would all require a lot of metadata to sort categorise and manage this in the most user-friendly and intuitive ways. Not to mention the user management side. While .txt files could do this, we would effectively be building a database but without the robustness or features of a database. And I'm not clear what the benefit of doing this is? 

&quot;One that comes to mind, would be something implemented on top of
freenet. This is very experimental atm. and usability would be a big issue
here, but it may be an option. All data would be &quot;on the net&quot;, so to
speak, including the data for the scoring system. When a client connects
to the system, it would download the scoring data, and then retrieve other
data, such as messages, according to the users priorities and their scores.&quot;

Back in 1999/2000 a UK company launched a web application called Pointcast which downloaded everything it needed and ran offline as well as online. It was WAY ahead of its time.  And again I'm not understanding why we need this? When you say on the net but not on a server - do you mean P2P? That is an intriguing concept!
