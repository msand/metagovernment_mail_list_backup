That's more or less my idea, except that I don't believe the security of a
key saved on a PC is enough for something so sensitive and therefore
advocate using smart cards that can sign and encrypt (but that is a decision
that could even be left to the admin, or to the user, or to the organization
that signs certificates...)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I envision metascore running on top of only a revision control system,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that plays probably a larger role that what you see as reflected in that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document, and storing everything as plaintext in there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue I see here, is that messages don't really need to be under
</I>&gt;<i> version control. Implementing the scoring system on that, may also
</I>&gt;<i> be more difficult. I think it would be appropriate, to separate
</I>&gt;<i> discussions into a different medium than the legislation. A database
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be the intuitive solution, but that may be due to our
</I>&gt;<i> backgrounds. I can certainly think of how a scoring system might be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented in that scenario, but there are probably other good
</I>&gt;<i> approaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 You don't revision control messages. You revision control THREADS. See
wikipedia's discussion system. I don't see any reason to not have discussion
as PART of non-final branches of legislations.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One that comes to mind, would be something implemented on top of
</I>&gt;<i> freenet. This is very experimental atm. and usability would be a big issue
</I>&gt;<i> here, but it may be an option. All data would be &quot;on the net&quot;, so to
</I>&gt;<i> speak, including the data for the scoring system. When a client connects
</I>&gt;<i> to the system, it would download the scoring data, and then retrieve other
</I>&gt;<i> data, such as messages, according to the users priorities and their
</I>&gt;<i> scores.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to emphasize here, that the biggest issue would be usability.
</I>&gt;<i> Wrapping your head around all these concepts (PGP, DVCS, Freenet,
</I>&gt;<i> Scoring) is a rather big burden for a new user, which may not seem
</I>&gt;<i> justified
</I>&gt;<i> until you've come to know why they have been put in place. It may not be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for the user to know all this, but since trust in the system is
</I>&gt;<i> essential, it would be good, to keep the system as simple as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On that note, trust in this kind of system (once you understand it) is
</I>&gt;<i> much
</I>&gt;<i> simpler, considering there won't be any people (administrators) you need
</I>&gt;<i> to trust, since there would be no servers to administer.
