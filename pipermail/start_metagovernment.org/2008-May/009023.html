<PRE>Quoting:

.{as}
**************************

Wiki systems have proven that a discussion can reasonably be held
within a text file under version control.

The alternative would be to hold the proposals for legislation in a
VCS and the discussion and ratings in a database.

However, Metascore relies on the distributed nature of a DVCS to
easily coordinate between many versions of the data in a decentralized
way. Thus, it is essential that the files storing the discussion and
ratings are kept within the DVCS repository. That being a given, there
are a few advantages to text over a binary database format:

- Plaintext plays better with the DVCS, especially:
 * Delta storage means much smaller footprint
 * Merging works (working with files that can't be merged and change
   often, in a DVCS, is a nightmare, which means we would otherwise have
   had to write a tool to merge databases)
- Generic tools that exist on every developer's computer, specifically
  a DVCS and a text editor, are sufficient to read and manipulate the
  entire data model, thus making the data independent of
  Metascore. This has many advantages, like being able to debug, to
  validate the data and to participate in a discussion from a computer
  where you cannot install Metascore.
- It is much easier for the power user to automate tasks and for the
  developer to create scripts and tools that manipulate the data.

In general, it helps make the data independent from Metascore, which
is a 'very' good thing.
