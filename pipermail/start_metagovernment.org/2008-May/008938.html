<PRE>&gt;<i>  with the lingo, but I am thinking of something like domain name
</I>&gt;<i>  servers, where all servers reference each other (perhaps like mysql
</I>
What you are referring to, sounds very similar to open-id.

&gt;<i>  the user can reference that account from other installs by entering
</I>&gt;<i>  their username/password combination -- once referenced, the user uses
</I>
Rather than setting up an account system, we could use existing PGP
infrastructure. A member of a community, would set up a PGP-Key and
send the public key to a Keyserver. From thereon, all data she sends,
could be verified, as originating from her.

This is the best solution I can think of at the moment, if we go in the
direction of an entirely distributed system. This will probably be more
&quot;interesting&quot; to implement, to say the least.

&gt;<i> I envision metascore running on top of only a revision control system,
</I>&gt;<i> that plays probably a larger role that what you see as reflected in that
</I>&gt;<i> document, and storing everything as plaintext in there.
</I>
The issue I see here, is that messages don't really need to be under
version control. Implementing the scoring system on that, may also
be more difficult. I think it would be appropriate, to separate
discussions into a different medium than the legislation. A database
seems to be the intuitive solution, but that may be due to our
backgrounds. I can certainly think of how a scoring system might be
implemented in that scenario, but there are probably other good
approaches.

One that comes to mind, would be something implemented on top of
freenet. This is very experimental atm. and usability would be a big issue
here, but it may be an option. All data would be &quot;on the net&quot;, so to
speak, including the data for the scoring system. When a client connects
to the system, it would download the scoring data, and then retrieve other
data, such as messages, according to the users priorities and their scores.

I would like to emphasize here, that the biggest issue would be usability.
Wrapping your head around all these concepts (PGP, DVCS, Freenet,
Scoring) is a rather big burden for a new user, which may not seem justified
until you've come to know why they have been put in place. It may not be
necessary for the user to know all this, but since trust in the system is
essential, it would be good, to keep the system as simple as possible.

On that note, trust in this kind of system (once you understand it) is much
simpler, considering there won't be any people (administrators) you need
to trust, since there would be no servers to administer.
