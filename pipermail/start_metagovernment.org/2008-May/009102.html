<PRE>I am still on the road and continue to have limited availability until  
at least June 4, but I have some time tonight, so...

I have no objection to publicly advertising the meeting and inviting  
the world to attend. The wiki is not quite ready for publication  
(though it may be by the 7th) and the list is not a mass-participation  
option (I'll be discussing this on Aur's resolution), but the meeting  
address itself should be made publicly available.

Note that Manuel has specified
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1</A>
that the meeting be held by IRC, in the channel #metascore on  
irc.freenode.net. Any objections?

As for the date, before we set it in stone, I was intending to write  
to all the other members of this list who have not been participating  
much. I know that several of them have heavy schedules and have not  
been keeping up with the list server, so someone needs to contact them  
directly and ask them if they could indicate their availability on the  
wiki
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1/Date">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1/Date</A>
or at least indicate that availability to someone else on the list.

Would someone else like to contact the inactive members?
