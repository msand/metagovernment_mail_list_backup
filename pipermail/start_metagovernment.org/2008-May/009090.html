<PRE>Hello Everybody,

Since there seems to be vast support accumulating on the list for
opening up, and since I've waited in vain for someone else to take the
lead and codify a proposition so that action can be taken about it, I
will:

*** RESOLUTION 1 ***

The <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A> list's permissions will be immediately
changed so that anyone could subscribe by sending a subscription email
and the archives be made public.

A link from the www.metagovernment.org main page will be set up that
points to the wiki, warning that it is in a half-ready state.

These community rules would be posted, stating them to be nothing but
non-binding customs:

 * Every new member should introduce himself, where he comes from,
what is his occupation and how he relates to the project.
 * Members of the project are busy people, and care should be taken to
not waste their time with excessive discussion of unimportant things
on the mailing list.
 * No member holds more power than another, and no member should.
 * The community strives to be ran the way the metagovernment we
envision might be ran one day.

********************


R1+

Since we want to pass this quick, let us not dabble with bureaucracy
and lawyering. We can change wordings later to fix minor issues.


In addition, here is another proposal, independent of the first,
including opinions of mine that I would love accepted but am not sure
have as much consensus as those in the first and I'd be less bothered
if we argue over for months:

*** RESOLUTION 2 ***

These community rules will be posted, in addition to any others and
with the same disclaimer that they are non-binding customs:

 * The community favors personal initiatives as a way of action. If
you want something done, do it and ask for help when you need it, but
under your flag. When it is at a stage where you already have
something to show and if you want official endorsement, offer it as a
resolution.
 * New members should contribute in actions before they start
contributing philosophy - where philosophy is the participation in the
far-fetched discussions and actions is something like helping write
the wiki, helping with the design of Metascore, helping with gathering
people and resources for the project, collecting or processing data
for research, or anything else that would advance the current state of
the project.

********************

Note: I have chosen to use my proposed system of resolution passing
since it has much support, I am comfortable with it and no official
system was chosen yet.
