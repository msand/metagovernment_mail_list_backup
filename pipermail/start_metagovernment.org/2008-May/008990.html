It does some but not all to prevent spam: people have to either set up  
a real identity and spam from that (which will cause their user score  
to plummet from negative community reactions) or they have to spam  
anonymously and their spam will have a very low score and be unlikely  
to have any impact. Combine that with a simple rate limiter (one post  
per minute, for example), and there is very little incentive to spam.

On a different track, who are we to decide what is spam? I would like  
our system to accommodate absolutely every kind of input people want  
to put into it, and allow for community/user filtering of that input.  
One person's spam may be another person's great idea.
