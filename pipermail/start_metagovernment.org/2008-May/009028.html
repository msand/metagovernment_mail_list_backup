<PRE>A friend of mine at JaaNix.com (Jaa = Yes, Nix = No) is working on an
application that is [obviously] based on the yes/no idea. He also has
included some excellent controls that enable people to rank the ideas that
are most important to them through equalizer controls on the side of the
screen.

Overall, I think my problem with the Digg interface is the same I have for
the Wikipedia interface in that neither feel like they are accessible to the
ENTIRE community. Digg does a slightly better job, but Wikipedia is clearly
a READ-ONLY-UNLESS-YOU'RE-AN-EXPERT application, which is almost as
problematic as our current bureaucracy.

I feel we should aim for objects so that communities can clearly identify
their &quot;education system&quot; or &quot;healthcare system&quot; and rate them as more or
less important. If they have the knowledge and expertise to write a
complicated and well-written law to govern one of these objects, then allow
them to do so through a separately from the primary user experience.

Maybe we should consider something similar to Facebook, where average users
are able to sign in and build their own communities. If the source code is
freely available through our Metagovernment community, then developers could
modify it to run in their own software environment -- which I think is
obvious, but is different from the &quot;legal code&quot; which requires as much
expertise to write as the software.

This approach allows mom and pops the ability to start a small community for
their personal groups on our website (or another host that comes up with a
catchier name and more appropriate location), or provide actual governments
with the code to run on their own secure servers. Either way, the &quot;laws&quot;
should still be accessible by those who wish to copy or contribute.
