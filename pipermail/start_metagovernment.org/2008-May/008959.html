</I>
I am saying: truck drivers know more about pistons, heart surgeons  
know more about artificial hearts. So I am suggesting that each have  
more say in their respective field of expertise (as defined by their  
past exemplification of expertise in that field).

</I>&gt;<i> that).
</I>
There's nothing in user-scoring that prevents even a 4-year-old child  
from having their voice heard. The only thing it does is to give some  
preference to a heart surgeon over a 4-year-old when the subject is  
artificial hearts. (If the subject is TV cartoons, the roles may be  
reversed.) There are many more 4-year-olds than heart surgeons. Why  
should the 4-year-olds get to decide policy on artificial hearts?

&gt;<i> So I write &quot;I am not a doctor, but here's a smart idea&quot; and if it IS
</I>&gt;<i> smart people vote for it and if it isn't they don't. He writes &quot;I'm a

</I>&gt;<i> like you have people in wikipedia who spend hours refreshing the

</I>&gt;<i> there being far more concerned citizens than mischievous citizens.
</I>
User scoring is just a way of codifying the &quot;I am a doctor&quot; statement.  
So that instead of having to take someone at their word at that  
moment, we can judge them by all of their past contributions to the  
community.

&gt;&gt;<i> If we create a system in which anyone can participate, then people  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate more in a particular area should(?) have more say in that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> area. This way, we allow anyone to add their ideas to the betterment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of a community, but the active members of the community are the ones
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whose ideas are most respected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I just don't see why, and as someone who is building a personal
</I>&gt;<i> career as a consultant on fields he never touched before, I STRONGLY
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with your logic. I think voting can regulate it all.
</I>
That's just it. In attempting to build your consultancy, isn't it  
crucial that you build your reputation over time? User-scoring doesn't  
disallow participation from people with no experience or reputation,  
it is just a formal way of mathematically expressing one's reputation.  
If we do the math right, we can make it so that the people with high  
scores in a particular topic have a larger say, but that other people  
can outweigh them if enough of them participate.

Here's an example I had been thinking of: imagine a city which wants  
to flood a canyon in order to build a dam that will power the city. It  
could be that the people of the city have decided that they want the  
dam, and their community strongly supports the building of the dam. If  
some non-resident people want to prevent the building of the dam, they  
should be able to express their opinions and try to sway the  
conversation, but being non-resident, they shouldn't have equal say to  
the residents. However, if everyone downstream from that city is  
extremely opposed to the dam, they can all start participating in the  
community. Even with their lower scores in that community, they can  
outweigh the votes of the city residents.

&gt;&gt;<i> Well, we still need the math to determine a consensus score; that is,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at what point does something become a law? This is complicated by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fact that it is an open, inclusive system. If anyone can participate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in any community, then what sets the threshold for any particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community? Can it be a floating number based on recent past scores?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is, could it be something like: the top-scoring 1% of all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolutions in a community become laws?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets start from the simplest possible: 90% of votes in favor, at least
</I>&gt;<i> 1% of the community participates, sends a proposed legislation to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;prerelease&quot;. If after one week at least 90% of the votes are
</I>&gt;<i> positive, it is law
</I>

But there is the problem of defining the community. How do you say &quot;1%  
of the community&quot; if the community is self-defined and anyone can  
participate?

However, if every user has a score in every community, then a  
community can be roughly defined as: all users who have X score or  
higher within this community.

&gt;<i> And lets make the math very modular (maybe even scripted) so we can
</I>&gt;<i> later experiment with it once the platform exists.
</I>
Agreed, it should be as flexible as possible. It should be expressed  
as a series of clearly-defined variables, so that particular  
communities can tweak the variables as they see fit.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. How specifically do you plan to do interaction with other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repositories?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see no escape from there being an accepted &quot;main&quot; repo, but
</I>&gt;<i> someone else might see that escape later on, and our solution will
</I>&gt;<i> already lend itself easily to that escape.
</I>

If we do have a central repository, it can still be distributed, as is  
done with the root nameservers:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver</A>

If we have several servers mirroring each other, then they would also  
checksum each other, so that any corruption of one gets cancelled out  
by the others. Each server could have a different management team, and  
the checksumming would then correct for corruption in one team.
