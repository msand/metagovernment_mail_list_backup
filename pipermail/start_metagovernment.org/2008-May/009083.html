<PRE>Hello everybody,
new kid in town.

I contacted Ed some days ago, wishing to join. So here I am.
In the last 36 hours I have read ALL of the archives, mindmapped most of it,
and I am now doing my first homework which is the introduction. After that I
will enter in the conversation.

Let me start by saying that I am very excited to be here.

I am 37, work for the Uni as a post doc. Originally I come from Italy, where
I also gooften, but right now I am working for DCU, Dublin.
I have a degree in maths, and my speciality is building mathemathical models
of natural systems.
I have a website (pietrosperoni.it) and a (few) blog. Although I haven't
updated it (them) in quite some time.

One of my speciality is to study topics from a mathemathical POV. I did just
this with tags, and I wrote a three entries in my blog on tags, and how
would you go and define a metric on tags, and so on. They are available from
my blog
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/25/tag-clouds-metric">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/25/tag-clouds-metric</A>
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/28/tagclouds-and-cultural-changes">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/28/tagclouds-and-cultural-changes</A>
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/06/07/tag-clouds-and-spam/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/06/07/tag-clouds-and-spam/</A>

Thanks to those entries I was invited to the kickoff meeting of Tagora, a
European project to study tags, and then the Tagora group proceeded to study
how you can cluster tags, and and place tags in a continuous
multidimensional space, so that given any two resources you can find the
distance between them. In lay man terms, this mean that Yes, Jacki, it is
possible to (and I can) make a system where the resources (comments, laws,
proposals) are being tagged, and as an effect an emergent position in the
tag space appears, that let you know what is near what.  All this in a way
that is continuous, so that if people have an area of expertise, this
translates only partially to expertise in neighboring areas, and so on.

I am VERY happy to have seen the beginning of the wiki. I was going to
propose it. And I think we should use it as much as possible to store every
partial or final resolution we made. At least to have the information
organised by content.

I do agree very much on the topic of, is better to have a system that half
work, and use this to move toward a system that works better. As such I
think a wiki, and a slashdot system can be taken as very good temporary
systems.

In my notes, here, about what we have discussed, I have written many other
things. In the interest of brevity I will keep this short. I will eventually
add more things later.

By the way, would it be possible to have a collaborative mindmap somwhere?
There are a number of resources that let you do this, and if anyone else is
interested we could use that (also) to store some of the information we
develop.

Finally, I have some difficulty with anything that require fast internet
connection. I am ok with wiki, discussion group, and email, but anything
beyond an image is a hard task for me. This because I spend considerable
amount of time in the countryside, from where I work. ANd from here I have
no broadband.

So the idea of setting up my own repository is out of the question. Can I
still play with you? ;-)

Ok, I think this is enough as a first message,
Pietro
