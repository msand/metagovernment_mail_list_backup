No, encrypting: if you want to send me a message across a public
network, which only I can read, you encrypt it with my public key.

</I>&gt;<i> system. On the contrary, in a system where every citizen has the power of a
</I>&gt;<i> senator, I think every citizen's votes should be made just as public.
</I>
I also don't think we really need it, but as we have discussed in other
threads, if people want it, we should offer it.
Regarding sniffing: If the ballot, containing the vote and a token send by
the central authority is encrypted, the only information you may be able to
determine, is if a person has voted or not.

&gt;<i> Police covers political persecution.

Scenario 1: Wife not wanting to upset her husband by voting
differently from him.
Scenario 2: Employer fires a worker for a publicly viewable vote.
Scenario 3: Police officer becomes alienated by his colleagues for
voting a certain way.
etc. etc.

Not much the police can do in most of these situation. Nobody is being
directly forced to vote a certain way, nonetheless, they aren't free to
vote as they please. All this is handled by anonymous voting.

Assuming anonymous voting:

Scenario 4: A person expressing wanting to vote for a controversial bill, but
without access to a terminal from which she can't be watched.

There are certain prerequisites for using this software, be it a certain
degree of technical literacy or cheap and widespread computers. Maybe
one of them is a certain maturity of the community, where Scenario 4
isn't an issue. In any case, it's nothing we can solve by a technical measure,
the only solution I see, is a voting booth.

Who said nothing was anonymous? Nothing is stopping you, from
creating a PGP-Keypair for an alias. I can sign all my messages as
SpammerDeluxe, and you can be certain that all the junk mail you
receive from me, actually comes from me. Not that thats something
you would be interested in verifying, but that's all that the signature
can tell you.

What we may do however is allow keys to be verified by the community,
so that you only need to accept messages with signatures from keys
which have been verified as belonging to a member of the community.
This mitigates the problem somewhat.

Sorry, my mistake. Thanks for the correction.

The real problem with anonymous voting is that it makes the whole
thing unverifiable. Without anon-voting, the only aspect of the system
that can be cheated by the server is filtering out unwanted opinions
(and that can be exposed easily by the poster and published, creating
a huge scandal and overthrowing the old admins of the system). With
anon-voting, suddenly nothing in the system can be trusted and nothing
can be done about it. There MIGHT be a very elegant crypto solution to
that where the votes are stored half encrypted and signed with the
rest of the data, every user can count them and every user can verify
his own vote... We should think about that.

</I>&gt;<i>

Especially if you want votes to be meaningful, you HAVE to have some
organization that signs public keys and makes sure that they belong to
different people (that could be the government or a private firm, all
it needs to do is check social-security-card upon registration and
publish its database publicly so that it is verifiable that the same
person does not have a different registered keypair elsewere). And
then its a matter of having the software insist on only using keys
signed by accepted authorities.

As I said elsewhere, the second step is to issue
encryption-smart-cards that never expose their private key, to
mitigate the risk of someone hacking into PCs, stealing the keys and
building a voters-army.
