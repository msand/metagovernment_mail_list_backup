Because I do not completely oppose it. Further, in a small scale like  
this list, +/- votes may work, but the idea does not scale to mass  
participation. If there are a thousand competing resolutions, must I  
only vote for ones I think are perfect? Or do I vote for anything I  
may find acceptable? Neither solution promotes consensus-building.  
This is a critical discussion and needs to be moved to a more workable  
format. I have started a statement of the issues here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system</A>
but have not had much time to work on it.

&gt;&gt;<i> First, I do not see &quot;vast support&quot; for opening up. If we are to count
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the (now) 15 members of the list, a small percentage has spoken in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> favor of opening the list. So how do we define a quorum? How many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people need to be in favor of something before it goes into effect?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Both I and Aur suggested using a significant percentage of people who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have participated in the last month, but in retrospect that does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seem realistic. Clearly this is a central issue we need to define for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metascore to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vast support is when a question is asked  and all the answers are the
</I>&gt;<i> same. You are the only one I heard opposing opening up, and your
</I>&gt;<i> position is &quot;weakly against&quot;, whilst anyone else I've heard talking is
</I>&gt;<i> positioned &quot;strongly pro&quot;.
</I>
Not true. See <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/private/start_metagovernment.org/2008-April/000125.html">http://metagovernment.org/mailman/private/start_metagovernment.org/2008-April/000125.html</A> 
  for example. And also I take exception to defining vast support as  
the absence of refutation. There has to be some sort of critical mass  
before something can be said to be a belief of the community at large.

&gt;<i> The AktivDemoktrati people have a very nice solution to that problem -
</I>&gt;<i> their rating is the integral of of support for an idea d(time), so
</I>&gt;<i> ideas with more support are accepted quickly and ideas with less
</I>&gt;<i> support are accepted slowly, giving more time to reflect.
</I>
I am intrigued but do not yet get it. If you have time, could you  
explain this on the scoring system wiki page above?

&gt;&gt;<i> My strongest reason for objecting to opening the list is one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> emphasis. I very much want this group to open up, but I do not think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that e-mail is an appropriate mechanism for large-scale  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is not like a typical list server where one can only read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selected threads: in order to keep up with the project, one really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to read almost all the messages on the list. Wider  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means more list traffic, which means more reading for everyone, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can result in *less* participation by several valuable members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But we are losing people, and those people won't come back when we
</I>&gt;<i> open up. Why don't we open the list, ask nicely that people keep their
</I>&gt;<i> writing volume low, politely tell anyone who doesn't that he's wasting
</I>&gt;<i> our time reading, and if that doesn't work - close again, explaining
</I>&gt;<i> why on the main page? That would solve the &quot;losing people&quot; problem.
</I>&gt;<i> (If you support this, vote R1+... There's no need for a new resolution
</I>&gt;<i> for this solution).
</I>
We don't know that we are losing people or that they won't come back.  
And it might be considered beneficial that the only people joining are  
those who think it is worth some extra effort.

It may be reasonable to make the list available for automatic  
subscription instead of requiring my manual intervention. However, I  
will not publish the archives until the wiki is secured. The archives  
contain a link to the wiki, and it would be incredibly negligent to  
make the wiki public without proper security (see below).

&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, I propose that we open up the wiki &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> soon but not immediately. (The main obstacle right now for me is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time: I just need to spend a few hours studying how to properly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MediaWiki, and I have not yet had those hours. I intend/hope to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it secure by June 7.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just back it up, twice a day, and if someone does something really bad
</I>&gt;<i> - restore a backup from before that.
</I>
The cornerstone of I.T. is security, and the above is a prescription  
for disaster. What if, as one of many examples, someone compromises  
the system but doesn't act on it for a year? Or compromises it in a  
way that is never noticed?

My problem with MediaWiki security is that I am not experienced in  
administering it, and so far I have not found a good explanation of  
how to secure it. Among other things, my largest concern is that it  
publishes its administrator AND database passwords in a *plaintext*  
file accessible on the root web directory. I am protecting that file  
with posix permissions, but am not confident that that is sufficient.  
Strangely there is no good documentation in this regard, so I have  
questions posted on the MediaWiki Talk pages.
<A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual_talk:LocalSettings.php#Securing_this_file">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual_talk:LocalSettings.php#Securing_this_file</A>
<A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual_talk:Installing_MediaWiki#Security_instructions_missing">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual_talk:Installing_MediaWiki#Security_instructions_missing</A>
(And the most popular MediaWiki forums <A HREF="http://www.mwusers.com/">http://www.mwusers.com/</A> are  
down now.)

&gt;<i> But... opening the wiki isn't enough. People who would think to join
</I>&gt;<i> us want to know that there is /transparency/, and that means anything
</I>&gt;<i> we use - we open.
</I>
I very much like Rob's comment here. As stated above, I want to open  
the archives but do not think it is prudent until the wiki is secure.  
I would gladly accept help in figuring out the generally accepted way  
to secure the LocalSettings.php file in MediaWiki. We also need to  
assign a copyright (or perhaps copyleft) to the contents of the wiki.

&gt;&gt;<i> Another objection I had to opening up the list server was that we do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not yet have a formal organization, However, I am starting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formulate a way we might be able to proceed without any formal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organization, even if we have financial needs. I am not sure I even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want that, but I think it is worth exploring. I will present more on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really don't see why this matters. Could you open my eyes?
</I>
Administration of the site is under my control because it is tied to  
my credit card and my personal information. I would very much like to  
change that, but there needs to be some entity to transfer these  
things to (I am starting to doubt my above assertion that we can avoid  
making such an entity). Most participatory entities have some formal  
organization before they open up to allowing others to freely join,  
otherwise they risk dilution/perversion of focus.

P.S. As an aside, note that the website is currently down.  
ASmallOrange has told me that they are &quot;working on it.&quot; I am in fact  
eager to get something opened to the public so that I can go back to   
fusednetwork and ask again if they would be willing to host us.
