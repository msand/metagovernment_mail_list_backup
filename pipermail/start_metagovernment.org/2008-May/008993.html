The more one tries to define spam, the less clear the definition  
becomes. There is no authoritative definition, because different  
people value different things. You can say that a particular message  
is definitely spam (and even then, not absolutely everyone will agree  
with you), but you cannot define a cut-off point where things on one  
side are spam and things on the other are not.

&gt;<i> It's easy to set up a hundred accounts and spam the hell out of a  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion.
</I>
Simple rate limiters and a bit of account controls can stop most of  
this. Even anonymous accounts will need to be associated with an e- 
mail address, and we can have delays built in between when one signs  
up and when one can post. More importantly, variable scoring takes  
away the incentive to spam, as I'll explain below.

&gt;<i> What it will mean is that nobody who has sense will read ANYTHING by
</I>&gt;<i> any anon user, because 99.99% of it will be spam.
</I>
Absolutely true... if we have neither user scoring nor post scoring.  
If we have one or both of those, then the problem is self-controlling.  
Imagine that anonymous users and posts start out with a score of .001,  
and that they can be knocked down to .0001 by bad scores.

Some people would still then read anonymous posts, and if they think  
the posts are spammish, they would give negative ratings to the user  
and/or post. Maybe nobody would be willing to read posts that are  
below .0005, but some people would always still look at the new anon  
posts. There are people who trawl Wikipedia all day just looking for  
vandalism to revert.

That's where the disincentive comes in. People who are willing to read  
the new, anonymous posts will know that they're going to encounter  
spam, and will have a cautious attitude. They will quickly down-score  
anything they see as spam and up-score anything they don't. So the  
only people the spammers get to get noticed by are the (self-defined)  
spam-police.  What is the incentive to spam then? It would be like a  
con artist having to start out every con-job in a police station...  
they're just not going to do it very often.
