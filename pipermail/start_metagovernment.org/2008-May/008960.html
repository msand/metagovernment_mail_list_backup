There can still be user scoring by field of expertise -- this helps give 
their opinion more weight (like in any well-structured forum) and people 
can take this into consideration in giving their vote. But all people 
should still decide how much each opinion is worth putting into law.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am saying: truck drivers know more about pistons, heart surgeons  
</I>&gt;<i> know more about artificial hearts. So I am suggesting that each have  
</I>&gt;<i> more say in their respective field of expertise (as defined by their

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The dream that is driving me to contribute here is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that one day, Locke and Demosthenes (of Ender's Game fame) will rise.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wonder kids who are smart enough to lead the world into a new era (I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 19. As a kid, which is up to last year, I never felt kids got enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respect for their ideas. I think it harms them and I want to fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's nothing in user-scoring that prevents even a 4-year-old child  
</I>&gt;<i> from having their voice heard. The only thing it does is to give some  
</I>&gt;<i> preference to a heart surgeon over a 4-year-old when the subject is  
</I>&gt;<i> artificial hearts. (If the subject is TV cartoons, the roles may be  
</I>&gt;<i> reversed.) There are many more 4-year-olds than heart surgeons. Why  
</I>&gt;<i> should the 4-year-olds get to decide policy on artificial hearts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I write &quot;I am not a doctor, but here's a smart idea&quot; and if it IS
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smart people vote for it and if it isn't they don't. He writes &quot;I'm a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doctor. It is essential that you vote for THIS because I have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experience and can tell you THIS IS HOW IT GOES IN PRACTICE&quot;. He might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or might not :P) get more &quot;mob&quot; votes because of that. In practice,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if a really bad idea gets voted, the doctors association will publish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an urgent warning to the public and ask everyone to vote it down. Just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like you have people in wikipedia who spend hours refreshing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;latest changes&quot; page and fixing spam... I'm betting the jackpot on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there being far more concerned citizens than mischievous citizens.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> User scoring is just a way of codifying the &quot;I am a doctor&quot; statement.  
</I>&gt;<i> So that instead of having to take someone at their word at that  
</I>&gt;<i> moment, we can judge them by all of their past contributions to the  
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If we create a system in which anyone can participate, then people  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> participate more in a particular area should(?) have more say in that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> area. This way, we allow anyone to add their ideas to the betterment
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of a community, but the active members of the community are the ones
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> whose ideas are most respected.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, I just don't see why, and as someone who is building a personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> career as a consultant on fields he never touched before, I STRONGLY
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagree with your logic. I think voting can regulate it all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's just it. In attempting to build your consultancy, isn't it  
</I>&gt;<i> crucial that you build your reputation over time? User-scoring doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> disallow participation from people with no experience or reputation,  
</I>&gt;<i> it is just a formal way of mathematically expressing one's reputation.  
</I>&gt;<i> If we do the math right, we can make it so that the people with high  
</I>&gt;<i> scores in a particular topic have a larger say, but that other people  
</I>&gt;<i> can outweigh them if enough of them participate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an example I had been thinking of: imagine a city which wants  
</I>&gt;<i> to flood a canyon in order to build a dam that will power the city. It  
</I>&gt;<i> could be that the people of the city have decided that they want the  
</I>&gt;<i> dam, and their community strongly supports the building of the dam. If  
</I>&gt;<i> some non-resident people want to prevent the building of the dam, they  
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to express their opinions and try to sway the  
</I>&gt;<i> conversation, but being non-resident, they shouldn't have equal say to  
</I>&gt;<i> the residents. However, if everyone downstream from that city is  
</I>&gt;<i> extremely opposed to the dam, they can all start participating in the  
</I>&gt;<i> community. Even with their lower scores in that community, they can  
</I>&gt;<i> outweigh the votes of the city residents.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Well, we still need the math to determine a consensus score; that is,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at what point does something become a law? This is complicated by the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fact that it is an open, inclusive system. If anyone can participate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in any community, then what sets the threshold for any particular
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> community? Can it be a floating number based on recent past scores?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That is, could it be something like: the top-scoring 1% of all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> resolutions in a community become laws?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lets start from the simplest possible: 90% of votes in favor, at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1% of the community participates, sends a proposed legislation to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;prerelease&quot;. If after one week at least 90% of the votes are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> positive, it is law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there is the problem of defining the community. How do you say &quot;1%  
</I>&gt;<i> of the community&quot; if the community is self-defined and anyone can  
</I>&gt;<i> participate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, if every user has a score in every community, then a  
</I>&gt;<i> community can be roughly defined as: all users who have X score or  
</I>&gt;<i> higher within this community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And lets make the math very modular (maybe even scripted) so we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later experiment with it once the platform exists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, it should be as flexible as possible. It should be expressed  
</I>&gt;<i> as a series of clearly-defined variables, so that particular  
</I>&gt;<i> communities can tweak the variables as they see fit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. How specifically do you plan to do interaction with other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> repositories?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can see no escape from there being an accepted &quot;main&quot; repo, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone else might see that escape later on, and our solution will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already lend itself easily to that escape.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we do have a central repository, it can still be distributed, as is  
</I>&gt;<i> done with the root nameservers:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we have several servers mirroring each other, then they would also  
</I>&gt;<i> checksum each other, so that any corruption of one gets cancelled out  
</I>&gt;<i> by the others. Each server could have a different management team, and  
</I>&gt;<i> the checksumming would then correct for corruption in one team.
