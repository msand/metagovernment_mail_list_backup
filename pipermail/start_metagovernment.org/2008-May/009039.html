Discussion and legislation are the same thing.

quoting:

show a legislation tree as follows:

 * at each moment it shows one revision. The text is color coded for
different authors and hovering the mouse on a passage shows who wrote
it and when. Comments can be folded and unfolded.
 * a passage can be selected and its history summarized in a timeline
that can be scrolled to quickly see how it had grown (animated)
 * a tree is shown, similar to the timeline, that can be moved through
to quickly and animatedly browse different revisions and branches of
the legislation
 * maybe there should be markers of fading visibility to indicate
recently deleted passages
 * one can start editing at any point and the interface will
automatically crypto-sign the edit and submit it (of course, an easy
option to first branch the legislation should exist)

points 2 and 4 must be lightning quick. I don't think 200ms is the
latency caused by rendering a complex page as described. And the file
isn't reloaded from disk, it is dynamically generated.

&gt;<i>  99% of the time, the user will be reading rather than browsing the
</I>&gt;<i>  revision tree, and even that should feel pretty fast. What kind of
</I>&gt;<i>  ultra snappy reaction (better than the 200ms or less, that it will

He will first browse, and a lot, to find something he's interested in reading.

&gt;<i>  I suggest a simple web server, extending the existing one in mercurial,
</I>&gt;<i>  with additional views of the repo, specific to metascore. Some work
</I>&gt;<i>  has been done in mercurial for this, upon which we can build. I would
</I>&gt;<i>  suggest we keep this interface read only for now, which has the added
</I>&gt;<i>  benefit of allowing anybody to set up a server to view a repo, without
</I>&gt;<i>  having to worry about user restrictions.
</I>
Now this is a GREAT idea. I really like how the mercurial webserver is
built. The only problem I have with this is that I don't want to use
mercurial but git, which is an order of magnitude faster, which is
essential if every vote is a new revision and millions of votes are
expected per revision of a legislation.

&gt;<i>  The wxWidgets UI is primarily intended as a fancy configuration editor
</I>&gt;<i>  and frontend for hg operations. It would help interact with other
</I>&gt;<i>  repositories of the community, manage PGP-Keys and configure the
</I>&gt;<i>  users metascore filter. These are tasks, I see a local widget based UI being
</I>&gt;<i>  more suited to than a web interface.
</I>
Oh no, this I cannot accept. Whatever interface we choose, it MUST be
unified. One tool, one look, does everything.

There's no reason these shouldn't be done in a web based interface, though.
