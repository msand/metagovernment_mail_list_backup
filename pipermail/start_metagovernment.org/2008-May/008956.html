I agree that the software will evolve beyond what we can expect. But  
in this initial phase, our political philosophies are unavoidably  
going to influence the development.

My primary goal has been to ensure that this project started out with  
some core principles as integral to its function. Basically, they are  
the principles that evolved in the open source community:  
transparency, community-controlled leadership, flexibility, and a  
desire for consensus when possible. By developing the project as open  
source and with those defined principles, we are creating a system of  
government which integrates those principles.

None of these principles inherently have to be involved in  
governmental software. Many people are looking at ways to incorporate  
web technologies into governments, but they do not always have these  
principles in mind. Not at all.

I do not by any means wish for us to take specific political  
positions. But I think it is a given that we are generally in favor of  
ground-up government, and that we are generally opposed to top-down  
government. If we weren't, we wouldn't have much interest in this  
project.

&gt;<i> * I don't really like the division you guys are thinking up to
</I>&gt;<i> geographic and topical boards. I think one huge lawbook can hold all
</I>&gt;<i> the legislation for the planet, with tagging making it easier for
</I>&gt;<i> someone to keep track of just legislation relevant to his town or
</I>&gt;<i> hobby.
</I>
I somewhat agree, particularly because geography is becoming less  
important as a unifying factor. Particularly historic geography; that  
is, nations.

When trying to think of natural divisions of people, the most natural  
groupings I could think of are: villages, metropolitan regions, and  
ecoregions &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion</A>&gt;. If we do end up  
defining a literal &quot;law of the land,&quot; it should be of one or some of  
those divisions. But I am still unsure as to whether any authoritative  
geographic division is necessary. I am still hopeful that the  
interaction between self-defining communities can somehow be leveraged  
to form authority when necessary.

&gt;<i> * I'm still thinking about scoring systems. I'm not sure there's
</I>&gt;<i> reason for users to have a personal score - it doesn't make much
</I>&gt;<i> sense, in fact, to have someone's vote count more just because other
</I>&gt;<i> people liked his suggestions. Maybe the only &quot;score&quot; should be that
</I>&gt;<i> given to branches of a proposed law, and that used to decide when and
</I>&gt;<i> which branch and revision get merged to the &quot;release&quot; branch. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> also rating comments, but using those ratings just for deciding which
</I>&gt;<i> comments to display in the client, not for any math that matters to
</I>&gt;<i> the mechanics of lawmaking. An alternative would be that every time I
</I>&gt;<i> vote up someone's comment in a law tagged &quot;UK&quot;, &quot;Manchester&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;restaurant&quot; his rankings in these three tags would be affected
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly, as well as his &quot;generic&quot; ranking, and if he does not yet
</I>&gt;<i> have a ranking relating to a certain legislation, a fraction of his
</I>&gt;<i> generic rating would be used by default until he gets one.
</I>
I am open to your ideas here, but the idea of a user score is intended  
to solve an inherent problem in direct democracy: mob rule, where the  
least informed have the most power (because for any specific topic,  
there are far fewer informed people than uninformed people).

When a group is working on legislation about safety features in  
artificial hearts, why should a truck driver get the same amount of  
say as a heart surgeon? Likewise, when another group is working on  
safety features in trucks, why should the heart surgeon have the same  
amount of say as the truck driver?

If we create a system in which anyone can participate, then people who  
participate more in a particular area should(?) have more say in that  
area. This way, we allow anyone to add their ideas to the betterment  
of a community, but the active members of the community are the ones  
whose ideas are most respected.

&gt;<i> * When thinking about the software, I strive in this order for:
</I>&gt;<i>   * Simplicity of the interface
</I>&gt;<i>   * Flexibility of the interface
</I>&gt;<i>   * Flexibility of the data model
</I>
+1!

I think your ideas below are very much on the right track. Clearly I  
need to learn more about DRCS. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRCS#Distributed_revision_control">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRCS#Distributed_revision_control</A> 
  seems like a nice start, but I'd like to see Git in action to get a  
feel for it. I looked briefly at <A HREF="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=summary">http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=summary</A> 
  but I do not have enough context in which to understand it.

&gt;<i> * I base my design very closely on DRCSs, and use their terminology -
</I>&gt;<i> revision, branch, commit log... you should try working with one before
</I>&gt;<i> you read this or you'll need much googling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The data model would be a directory structure of plaintext files under
</I>&gt;<i> revision control by a tool like git that allows very cheap branching
</I>&gt;<i> and advanced merging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the legislations directory you'd have one text file per proposed
</I>&gt;<i> law (of course, in the &quot;release&quot; branch there would only be those of
</I>&gt;<i> accepted versions of laws).
</I>&gt;<i> This text file would contain a lightly-marked-up law. There would be
</I>&gt;<i> markup for a comment box.
</I>&gt;<i> At first I thought about markup for user-id and crypto-sig for every
</I>&gt;<i> sequence of text, but then I realised:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It would work for comments, since they are not meant to be edited,
</I>&gt;<i> but for legislation - say I write a sentence, sign it, then you fix a
</I>&gt;<i> typo, my sig is now unverifiable in the latest revision
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The data is already there in the revision history, so instead of
</I>&gt;<i> duplicating data, lets have the client traverse the whole history when
</I>&gt;<i> it displays a file, and remember what was written by whom (and verify
</I>&gt;<i> the crypto signatures which would be given in the commit log)
</I>&gt;<i> On second thought,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There would also be markup for voting, that is comprised of a line
</I>&gt;<i> containing SSN of voter, rank given by voter and a crypto signature of
</I>&gt;<i> the string legislationname-branchname-revisionnumber-rankgiven. That
</I>&gt;<i> means, of course, that a revision's initial score is that of the
</I>&gt;<i> revision before it - which is in my opinion a correct behavior. We
</I>&gt;<i> COULD have the engine reduce a tiny bit of score for each new
</I>&gt;<i> revision, to make it harder to jump-on-the-bandwagon with a tiny
</I>&gt;<i> change and have YOUR version selected over the one everyone voted for
</I>&gt;<i> by merit of a handful votes.
</I>
This is similar to the idea of thresholding I had proposed for the  
other side: once something becomes a law, it should take more than a  
slight change of score to remove it from law again. We don't want laws  
flapping on and off with every vote.

&gt;<i> Special attention should be given to how legislations are tagged,
</I>&gt;<i> since otherwise it would be easy to game the system - you branch an
</I>&gt;<i> obscure legislation, tag it with a thousand tags, vote for it and have
</I>&gt;<i> your friends do so too, and suddenly your score in so many tags is
</I>&gt;<i> up...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the users directory you'd have one file per social security number
</I>&gt;<i> of a user, with a plaintext templated file that has the user's
</I>&gt;<i> rating(s), bio and userpage (like in wikipedia), perhaps also public
</I>&gt;<i> key (should this be stored elsewhere? I haven't thought through the
</I>&gt;<i> security aspects of this thoroughly).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interface would be a program that can do the pushing-pulling of
</I>&gt;<i> data to/from other computers, could do the maths and calculate scores
</I>&gt;<i> and decide when something is ripe for inclusion in &quot;release&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> automatically send it there, could verify all the crypto sig
</I>&gt;<i> correctness and the integrity of all the data, could handle voting and
</I>&gt;<i> could show a legislation tree as follows:
</I>&gt;<i> * at each moment it shows one revision. The text is color coded for
</I>&gt;<i> different authors and hovering the mouse on a passage shows who wrote
</I>&gt;<i> it and when. Comments can be folded and unfolded.
</I>&gt;<i> * a passage can be selected and its history summarized in a timeline
</I>&gt;<i> that can be scrolled to quickly see how it had grown (animated)
</I>&gt;<i> * a tree is shown, similar to the timeline, that can be moved through
</I>&gt;<i> to quickly and animatedly browse different revisions and branches of
</I>&gt;<i> the legislation
</I>&gt;<i> * maybe there should be markers of fading visibility to indicate
</I>&gt;<i> recently deleted passages
</I>&gt;<i> * one can start editing at any point and the interface will
</I>&gt;<i> automatically crypto-sign the edit and submit it (of course, an easy
</I>&gt;<i> option to first branch the legislation should exist)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> other features would be ability to browse user profiles and userpages
</I>&gt;<i> and write there, but that is about the same things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is it. There is no step four. I am astounded by how simple this
</I>&gt;<i> all is once written down :) This makes me very happy, I thought it
</I>&gt;<i> would be a much harder thing to implement. The math should be given
</I>&gt;<i> thought that I didn't, but except for that my design probably works.
</I>

Well, we still need the math to determine a consensus score; that is,  
at what point does something become a law? This is complicated by the  
fact that it is an open, inclusive system. If anyone can participate  
in any community, then what sets the threshold for any particular  
community? Can it be a floating number based on recent past scores?  
That is, could it be something like: the top-scoring 1% of all  
resolutions in a community become laws?
