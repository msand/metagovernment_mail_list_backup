</I>
I agree with the calling it &quot;rating&quot; or &quot;scoring&quot; instead of &quot;voting&quot;
because it is not supposed to be a majority-win vote but a drive to
consensus. I strongly disagree, in fact, with a floating point vote
(or a star system). I support a yes/no vote because  I don't think
there's any meaningfulness to saying &quot;I kinda like his ideas but not
very much&quot; in this context, and because it would complicate any
attempt at calculating consensus to no end. I like the &quot;yes/no&quot; system
because it has a very simple definition of consensus: many said yes,
(almost) nobody said no.

&gt;<i>  The question Aur raised was whether user scores should be a weighting
</I>&gt;<i>  factor on one's resolution score. My inclination would be that we
</I>&gt;<i>  should have the system accommodate both kinds of scores and also
</I>&gt;<i>  accommodate weighting, just in case people want to use it. For
</I>&gt;<i>  example, we could just have one's final weighted vote be equal to
</I>&gt;<i>  something like:
</I>
No, I don't think there should BE a user score, not one that has
effect on the user's say and not one that doesn't.

Want to make sure a user that contributes a lot of wisdom to a
community will get some extra attention? Add a &quot;favorite users&quot;
feature to the interface (that is saved locally and has nothing to do
with the data model) that lets people mark users as favorite and then
the software always shows their contributions highlighted. Members of
a community will &quot;fav&quot; each other and there... Without adding anything
to the data model.


&gt;<i>  Concerning Aur's dislike of the concept of communities and Jacki's
</I>&gt;<i>  suggestion of making user scores resolution-specific, I am not sure I
</I>&gt;<i>  want to abandon the concept of communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Aur, how else do we associate resolutions with each other? How do
</I>&gt;<i>  people even find the resolutions they are interested in? In a global
</I>&gt;<i>  society with an infinite amount of available information, how can one
</I>&gt;<i>  person know about the issues that are going to affect their
</I>&gt;<i>  neighborhood, the river they live on, the road they drive on, and the
</I>&gt;<i>  company they work at? There would have to be some sort of tagging
</I>&gt;<i>  system that will let a person find things. I think that those tags are
</I>&gt;<i>  naturally going to develop into communities, and we should facilitate,
</I>&gt;<i>  not hinder, that process.
</I>
Tags.

I propose legislation about the lake near my home, I tag it by
geographic data (both name of nearby city and coordinates), &quot;local
scope&quot;, &quot;lake&quot;, &quot;ecology&quot;, ...

Any tag that I missed (&quot;fishing&quot;?), someone else will add. If we don't
have communities, there is no danger in letting anyone add any tag.

Did you notice how well categories in wikipedia work?


And I would set the interface to alert me about:
 * any national or wider scope legislation having to do with fishing
 * any legislation having to do with cryptography
 * any local or smaller scope legislation in my area or in my parents' areas
 * any changes by users I think worth tracking

besides that, I would follow news and blogs periodically to make sure
I didn't miss anything.

And I would keep a close eye on the &quot;prerelease&quot; area. At least read
the titles of EVERYTHING on prerelease, GLOBALLY. (That's beacuse I'm
an info-freak).

The &quot;prerelease&quot; period would make sure no &quot;under the table&quot;
legislation is made - besides, if you pass a law you have to inform
authorities that are touched by it or involved in enforcing it,
otherwise it would have no effect, and such authorities would cry out
loud if a law that makes no sense is passed &quot;under the radar&quot;.


I don't think we need to tie tags to communities. If communities want
to be formed around some of them, they will do that without our help,
but we don't need to involve that process into our math.

&gt;<i>  There may be a simple way to do it. Instead of letting people comment
</I>&gt;<i>  on any sentence, we could just allow and encourage people to make
</I>&gt;<i>  sections in their resolutions. For example, &quot;Funding&quot; would always be
</I>&gt;<i>  a separate section of a resolution.
</I>
Of course legislation will be well-written and well-edited and will
have sections, but this does not introduce the feature Jacki proposed
- he wanted users to be able to highlight &quot;passages&quot; and rate them,
where passages can be from a whole section to a single word (in the
case of an unclear word or typo, for example). I don't think this
feature is worth the effort, as cool as it sounds.
