<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>First a point of clarification, just to be sure we are all on the same  
page... We are talking about two kinds of scores: resolution scores  
and user scores.

A resolution score is the score a user gives to a resolution,  
indicating how much they approve or disapprove of that resolution  
becoming law. A user score is the score a user has received from other  
users (possibly combined with other factors such as a post count; and  
also possibly differing from one community to another).

I think most of us agree with the concept of resolution scoring  
instead of pure voting. Instead of everyone having a yes/no vote,  
people can give a more nuanced &quot;vote&quot; in terms of a number, say from  
-10 to 10 (like the Apache -1.0 to +1.0, but without the decimal  
point, to be less geeky). Some of us have referred to this as  
&quot;voting,&quot; but Manuel is right that we should avoid that word and call  
this &quot;scoring,&quot; to avoid confusion.

The question Aur raised was whether user scores should be a weighting  
factor on one's resolution score. My inclination would be that we  
should have the system accommodate both kinds of scores and also  
accommodate weighting, just in case people want to use it. For  
example, we could just have one's final weighted vote be equal to  
something like:

(Res Score / 2) + ((Res Score * User Score * X) / 2)

Where:
Res Score is a user-defined value from -10 to 10
User Score is 1 by default (and ranges from .001 to 1000?)
X is a variable, and can be set to 0 by default.

By making X default to zero, we remove the weighting factor until  
people decide they want to use it.

Concerning Aur's dislike of the concept of communities and Jacki's  
suggestion of making user scores resolution-specific, I am not sure I  
want to abandon the concept of communities.

Jacki, having communities allows us to implement a separate User Score  
for each community. So someone who has distinguished themselves in the  
community of heart surgeons will have a greater say in the heart  
surgeon community... but not anywhere else. In the truck driver's  
community, that person will have a default score. Unless they start  
participating a lot in the truck driver community, in which point they  
may distinguish themselves there as well.

Aur, how else do we associate resolutions with each other? How do  
people even find the resolutions they are interested in? In a global  
society with an infinite amount of available information, how can one  
person know about the issues that are going to affect their  
neighborhood, the river they live on, the road they drive on, and the  
company they work at? There would have to be some sort of tagging  
system that will let a person find things. I think that those tags are  
naturally going to develop into communities, and we should facilitate,  
not hinder, that process.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have allot of issues with this discussion. Sorry in advance, for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wall of text. Here's a heads up, but please bear with me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Voting allows everybody to participate, even those without a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thorough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understanding of the subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Scoring is intended to filter discussions for valuable  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than suppress members who have not established themselves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The effort required to participate in a discussion, weeds those  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shouldn't be participating anyway.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again it seems that voting has become the default means for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making a decision. And again I would like to point out, that voting  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very bad for a number of reasons. If a member of the community can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even coherently articulate their opinion, and contribute to a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hopefully making a better proposal, or rejecting the existing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a valid argument, there is no reason, for that member to have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say in a discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Allowing people to vote encourages mob rule. If a certain opinion is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> represented on the news as being urgent, and people are allowed to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we have effectively implemented mob rule.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The reason I see for a scoring system, is not to reduce what any  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> member
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the community has to say on a certain topic, but to extract the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valuable contributions, from a discussion among 2000 people. I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can all agree, that even with just 20 people, all eagerly  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in a discussion, there is a need for some filtering mechanism, let  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the amount of people that would participate in a discussion over an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue relevant to an entire nation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What scoring does, is not to reduce the say any member has, based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their track record, but it allows the messages of any individual  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be rated, purely based on their merit. If the truck driver actually  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have something relevant to say concerning heart surgery, the few  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> members
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the community that will initially see his message, will recognize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, rate it positively, thereby publishing it to a larger audience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Analogous can be said for an old senile heart surgeon, who may have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> valuable contributions in the past, but lately can hardly gain any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support. His messages will never make it to a wider audience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nowhere here is there any need for a vote. Most of the time, a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will emerge from the discussion, which all can agree upon. Once that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision moves on in its life cycle, and is proposed to be merged  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the main repository, as law. More people will see it, they can read  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussions that occurred surrounding it. Ideally there will be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> summary of the discussion, making the reasons clear, that lead to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular choice of legislation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If somebody can then articulate a good reason against the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legislation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the community can go back to the drawing board.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Voting shifts the focus away from making the best decision for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, allowing each voter to evaluate a decision, purely based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on the effects it will have on the individual member himself. If he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feels somehow mistreated, by some proposed legislation, he can make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> himself heard, in the form of a veto.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There may be cases, where no decision can recognized as the best  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the community (which should be the basis upon which a decision is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evaluated). This shouldn't occur too often, if the discussion is held
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properly, the relevant facts and clearly formulated consequences of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal, should make the right decision obvious to everybody. This  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be the case, if facts are scarce and a decision is mostly a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> judgment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> call. If that is the case, the people can vote for all I care.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'll take the position of a tech snob here for a second, just for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguments sake: If people are willing to vote, it shows a lack
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of technical understanding in a subject. For one reason or another,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are unable to evaluate the facts presented to them and make there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions based upon that. When making software in an open source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community, the right decisions can mostly determined, based on their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical merit. The decisions that do come down to a vote, are the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> banal things you could imagine. Those that everyone feels obligated  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pitch in on, because it is basically a judgment call. As anecdotes of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this, I offer:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And a more concrete example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The latter case shows, that on the most banal decision, the syntax  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how to write a conditional expression in one line, no consensus can  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> achieved. Simply because it doesn't make that much of a difference,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no technical merit to judge decisions by.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could go on, but I've taken enough of your time.
