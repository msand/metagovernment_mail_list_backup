<PRE>*** RESOLUTION 1.1 ***

A resolution is proposed to the mailing list by enclosing it in a
block delimited by &quot;*** RESOLUTION &lt;serial number&gt; ***&quot; and
&quot;********************&quot;.

The serial number is a number that no resolution in a thread already
has, and is used when rating to indicate which resolution you are
rating. It may be any number that wasn't used in the same thread.
Example legal s/ns: 1, 2, 12, 1.1, 3.005. Choosing a number is up to
the proposer of a resolution.

A resolution is rated by including a line with &quot;R&lt;s/n&gt;+&quot; or &quot;R&lt;s/n&gt;-&quot;
in an email in the thread. An explanation is preferred in the + case
and MANDATORY in the - case. Only the latest rating of the same
resolution by a user is taken into account.

If, at any point in time,
 * 72 hours have already passed since a resolution was posted
 * 90% of the users active in the mailing list in the past month have
rated that resolution +
 * no user active in the mailing list in the past month had rated it -
 * an email is sent to the mailing list with the subject &quot;[resolution]
&lt;an appropriate title for the resolution&gt;&quot; and the resolution quoted
in the message body
 * no other resolution in the same thread was accepted
then the resolution is accepted.

For convenience, proposed resolutions must be complete - they cannot
reference other resolutions by name but must instead quote anything
that they wish to incorporate.

********************
Changes:

Paragraph 2
-
+ It may be any number that wasn't used in the same thread. Example
+ legal s/ns: 1, 2, 12, 1.1, 3.005. Choosing a number is up to the
+ proposer of a resolution.
Paragraph 4
-  * no other resolution to the same issue has been accepted
+  * no other resolution in the same thread has been accepted
Notice:
For convenience, proposed resolutions must be complete - they cannot
reference other resolutions by name but must instead quote anything
that they wish to incorporate.

That is, you do not propose amendments, but instead you copy the
entire proposal and edit what you want to edit. Here I edited the
second paragraph, clearing the numbering rules, and the fourth
paragraph, clearing the tie-breaker wording.

The clause

&quot; * no other resolution in the same thread was accepted
then the resolution is accepted.&quot;

is a tie breaker, based on the concept that if there is consensus
around more than one proposal, it is safer to just let one win than
start arguing about it: what if I send a message in which I rate two
different resolutions positively (say &quot;R5+&quot; and &quot;R7.2+&quot;), and both now
have 90% support and no vetos? Then the first message arriving to the
list with a subject line &quot;[accepted] Handling foobar&quot; and the body
quoting either R5 or R7.2 makes either R5 or R7.2 accepted,
respectively. If, later, an email arrives to the list with such a
subject and quoting the OTHER resolution, it is meaningless - since
the first one already won. (You might claim that this would never
happen, although I know at least I will tend to rate more than one
proposition + in the same email, but a case that WILL happen often is
of another user rating another proposition + after one already has the
required score and before it is announced accepted).


You've probably noticed that a theme in my actions is to usually
support a non-perfect decision that can be later changed over not
deciding. I encourage you to do the same instead of lawyering over
technical issues.
