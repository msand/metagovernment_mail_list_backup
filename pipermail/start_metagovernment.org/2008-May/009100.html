<PRE>&gt;<i> Are the above wordings OK?
</I>
The first one doesn't make entirely clear who we are talking about, maybe:
* few communities today are truly egalitarian, decisions are made by
few high ranking members

To the last one I would add
* an incomplete version of metascore would be helpful in gathering
experience and grow
the community

Otherwise they seem ok.
