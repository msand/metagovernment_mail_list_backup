<PRE>
This being said, I think it's important that we not impose *our* view of 
the ideal government on communities by developing the software in a 
particular way.

Example, if we don't think there should be political parties, we should 
make this happen by not supporting them (thus, forcing users to adapt to 
our model of government). Much better would be to leave that decision to 
the people, to let the decision to have or not have parties be reached 
in consensus.

It seems to me that the revolutionary concept is the enabling of direct 
democracy, or any style of participatory government. But these choices 
shouldn't be forced on communities before they have been made.

I do think the conversation of possible implementations is helpful, 
because if the software is to support a wide range of government types 
and community types, we will want to consider these communities in 
building it. To that end, I would make two proposals:

1) we begin to list the types of communities that might find such a 
software package useful, and identify any particular needs a community 
might want, such as:
    - non-profit/for-profit organization (example: Lake Sunapee 
Protection Society in NH, US)
    - a part of an existing government (example: City Transportation 
Authority)
    - organizational structure of a political party (example: Democratic 
party in US)
    - political party running on platform of direct democracy (example: 
&quot;senator on-line&quot; in Australia)
    - alumni association of an educational institution
    - a department within an educational institution (example: Math 
Department)
    - metagovernment of a geographical region with force of law
    - worker's union
    - shadow-government / polling

2) set up an on-line survey to solicit information about potential 
organizations and their members. We might ask what tools their 
organization might use (example -- do they have a budget), what type of 
organization it is, what size, how likely to adopt framework, etc. Also, 
of users, we might ask about likely frequency of participation, their 
knowledge of encryption, what concerns they may have (security, 
transparency, lack of trust in a scoring system, etc), what limitations 
they perceive in the current system of organization, any handicaps we 
will want to support, etc...  remember that the system not only has to 
be trustworthy, but it also has to gain the trust of its users, so their 
initial perceptions matter to some extent.

We might want to wait on the second of these, and begin to develop the 
first internally but, eventually .... this kind of thing might be useful.

Thoughts?
