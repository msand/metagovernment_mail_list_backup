<PRE>Allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Rob Peters.  I am a 34-year-old Caucasian male living in the 
UK but originally from Canada.  I do not have a University degree, 
despite spending 10 years on-and-off in a variety of faculties.  I'm a 
passionate learner and always have been.  I enjoy history, computer 
science, and anthropology, although I have only studied the first two at 
Uni.  I am interested in all things and nothing gives me more pleasure 
than spirited debate.

I came across MetaGovernment several months ago while Stumbling on the 
internet and was intrigued.  I think our governmental systems could use 
a refresh and I'm always eager to get involved in a good project.  My 
personality profile is &quot;idealist dreamer&quot;, so dreaming of an ideal 
government is exactly my style.

It is with some hesitancy that I join this community.  I'm deeply 
suspicious of anyone who claims they know what is best for me (for 
example, I find the &quot;nanny-state&quot; mentality of the UK preposterous and 
eagerly await a return to the much more &quot;open&quot; Canada) and were I to 
join MetaGovernment, I worry that I will now be the one claiming I know 
what is best for others.  I will have become what I hate.

However, I try to make a habit of challenging my fears, so here I am.

I wrote a brief personal statement that I will use for guidance and 
posted it on my forum as a sort of Constitution.  Please see it here: 
<A HREF="http://observercollective.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2">http://observercollective.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=2</A>

I have created a forum at <A HREF="http://observercollective.com/forum/">http://observercollective.com/forum/</A> that you 
should please feel free to use.  I think it would be a good way to draw 
in the many people who long for better government but find mailing lists 
and repositories intimidating.  I also hope it will reduce any 
perception of elitism that MetaGovernment may have.  If we are not open, 
we cannot be trusted, and if we cannot be trusted, we are irrelevant.

I wish us a bright future.  I hope we don't break it.
Rob
