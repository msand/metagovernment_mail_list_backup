<PRE>Sorry for taking the discussion off-list, I didn't notice.

The reason I want ratings (I have stopped calling them votes, see the
thread on my design) to be 1:1 with real identities, is that I want an
automated means of measuring consensus. Otherwise, you'd need admins
that go over the discussion, notice when there is consensus and move
it to &quot;prerelease&quot; state and later to &quot;legislation&quot; state - and I do
NOT at all trust people with this decision.

If we already have non-anon ratings, I thought non-anon discussion
would also be a good idea as a way to fight spam - but that should be
thought out, balancing it against the advantages of having a way to
post anonymously (if there really are any, in a world where a
metagovernment rules).

&gt;<i>  &gt;  As I said elsewhere, the second step is to issue

</I>&gt;<i>  sure fire way to bury the project in its tracks.
</I>
If our software handles the encryption well, then all the user will
have to do, depending on the level of security, is:
 * filling a form and paying a few dollars to the local
signature-providing agency (later on, keys will be distributed with ID
cards) and later sticking that key in the computer whenever he wants
to post
or
 * waving the mouse around the screen for a minute and then forgetting
all about it

It is NOT scary and will not prevent adoption.

Encryption isn't such a  hurdle to users if it is dealt with 100% backstage...
