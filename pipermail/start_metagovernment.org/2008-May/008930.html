Oh no no no. It has far too complicated a use to be a standard with
different implementations.


&gt;<i> As a software standard, it would be a source code which is published
</I>&gt;<i> in one form, but which is expected to be modified in its adaptation to

</I>&gt;<i> software if they choose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We can make it generic enough to be used by anything, so why expect
communities to need programming know how to be set up?


&gt;<i> As a communication standard, it would enable every community to
</I>&gt;<i> interact with every other community, regardless of how they have
</I>&gt;<i> tweaked their software. An individual would have to set up an account
</I>&gt;<i> on any community they wished to participate in, but most of their

</I>&gt;<i> communities could &quot;borrow&quot; scores and laws from each other, allowing

</I>

Distributed revision control is a wonderful thing. It would solve this
trivially (almost).

Just have a piece of software that uses a DRCS as a backend and under that
saves everything as plaintext. Make sure that people are able to add their
voice using but git and a text editor, but make available a client that lets
one browse through a graphical representation of everything and edit in a
custom-designed editor etc'. Make the protocol simple enough that it's easy
to taylor tools around it, but make one such tool the official &quot;do
everything&quot; tool because otherwise bugs in different tools will make it
HELL.
