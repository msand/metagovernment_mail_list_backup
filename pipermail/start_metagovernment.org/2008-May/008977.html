<PRE>One more clarification: there is also a Post Score, which would be the  
rating given to one's comment on any resolution. This would be the  
mechanism for filtering conversations on a resolution, similar to the  
way SlashDot refines discussions.

Post Scores could be calculated in several ways. I was suggesting we  
use a combination of:
- scores given the post by readers, weighted by their own User Score
- the User Score of the person who posted

This means that, usually, the more people who find a post worthwhile,  
the more likely you are to see it (unlike SlashDot, which only allows  
a few people to rate any one post).

But with recursive scoring, it also means that people who are  
respected in the community automatically get more notice. Yet it also  
means that if someone foreign to the community says something that  
appeals to a respected member of the community, that member can  
elevate that post to the attention of the rest of the community.
