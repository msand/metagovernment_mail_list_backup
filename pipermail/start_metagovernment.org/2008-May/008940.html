<PRE>I agree with both Jacki and Manuel in that we need to approach it in a pincer movement from the software side and from the implementation side. My own preference if for an implementation led approach, partly a personal style, and so that we can make sure that the software will do what is needed rather than what we feel like or are able to deliver. And partly because I retain Manuel's hope that we may be able to come up with a game changing process / methodology / or approach to &quot;doing&quot; government. That said - a pincer movement from the software side will add a lot as it may uncover some cool features and functionality that inform the kinds of things can be viably considered in implementations.
I also agree with Jackie's other point about flexibility and configuration options. We could have a number of template flavours which are pre-configured to particular needs. For example village association, local authority, regional government, national government, interest group, professional group etc.

I think it might be appropriate for us to insist on a certain amount of direct governance in whatever configuration. Otherwise there are plenty of other tools out there to manage a monarchy - facebook, yahoo groups etc. While it is important to get as wide a user base as possible, if they are not supporting direct rule in some way, what's the point?

&gt;<i> implementations as possible. A community should be able to define itself
</I>&gt;<i> and implement the software in the way it sees most fit for self-governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this consistent with what others are thinking?
</I>
I don't think we will actually know what the best implementation or the best
use of the software will be, until we actually start seeing it being used. Every
community is different and will want the software to support the process
they develop, so I agree that we should support as many features, as a
community might want to use.

Nonetheless, I do want to set them on the right track, and I would again
like to emphasize that the software is not the most important thing here.
If we simply release the software to a community, who is new to open
government they might simply start voting on everything.

More than writing software, I think we are trying to find a way of doing
government. An important part of this project will therefor be a guidebook,
showing different models for a community and how members interact
within it.

Manuel
