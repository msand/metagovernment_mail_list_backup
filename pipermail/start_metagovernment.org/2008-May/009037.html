<PRE>&gt;<i> Would you care to move this discussion into comments to the design
</I>&gt;<i> document? That would serve the double purpose of also testing out my
</I>&gt;<i> ideas about storing a discussion in a DVCS.
</I>
No, because I need your agreement, before something I say is recorded
in your repo. The other option is me cloning your repo and hoping you
will pull from it, which you may not do, if you disagree with me. The
point is, that if I express my opinion, it should be recorded, the way
I want. The only censorship that should be imposed, is by the final
reader and the whole reason for the scoring system.

&gt;<i>From the Unix philosophy:
</I>    Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

Mercurial does revision control, and it does that well. You're trying to
implement something on top of it, that it obviously isn't suited for.


&gt;<i> Wiki systems have proven that a discussion can reasonably be held
</I>&gt;<i> within a text file under version control.
</I>
I would say that wikis use discussion pages in the wiki format, not
because that is a particularly good format for discussions, but because
programmers are lazy and implementing the discussion page just like
wiki page is easier to implement.

The discussions on a wiki can be edited. They are not a reproduction of
the actual discussion that has taken place, but are cleaned up over
time to only contain relevant information. So the discussion may be held
&quot;reasonably&quot; well, but I think we need more than that. We're talking
hundreds of people writing in one text file. It just seems ridiculous.

That would be fine for making a summary of the decisions that lead to a
certain decision, or elaborating legislation, that might otherwise be
hard to penetrate. What it isn't suited for, is recording what has
actually been said.

Pulling and pushing, between repositories, implies an agreement with
the contents of them. You are agreeing that certain messages are part
of the discussion, and allowing them into you're repo when you pull. In
a wiki, this isn't much of a problem because everybody shares the
same repo. With a distributed system, this introduces unnecessary
overhead.

A repository is fine for legislation, because we are actually evaluating
something which we want agreement upon. Discussion however just happens,
it's there, no matter what I think of it. People can rate it and ignore
it, but it should be recorded and be available to everybody, not just
those that happen to pull from a certain repository.
