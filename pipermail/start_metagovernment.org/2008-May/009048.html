<PRE>It looks as though you answered your own question about legislating through
an iPhone!

You wouldn't necessarily code law through a mobile device (without, of
course, the keyboard, etc.) Mom and Pop, however, aren't looking for the
complicated interaction -- they just wanna say Yes or No and be done with
it!

Most of the time it's not a matter how much the people want to get involved,
but how much they want to get involved WITH. In easier terms: education is
just as important to them as police and healthcare, etc. That doesn't mean
they want to sit and debate and educate themselves to the doctorates level
on every single issue.
