There are numerous ways to combat autospams; most notably CAPTCHA,  
rate-limiters, and blocking open proxies.

But no matter what system we try to employ, there will always be spam  
getting through. What do you suggest to limit spam, if not user/post  
scores?

Having ratings of users and/or posts provides an internal mechanism  
for dealing with spam. That mechanism will be vastly superior to any  
after-the-fact measure, because it is integral to the data model.

Yes I do (it is one of the joys of being an I.T. admin), and a lot of  
other people do as well. It only takes a few people to sieve through a  
hoard of spam. And tweaking the scoring system can handle the majority  
of it.

Anonymous users who wish to not be disregarded as spammers can start  
out by posting a few times in a small discussion where their messages  
are more likely to be noticed. There, they can get their score  
elevated (even marginally) above the default .001 (or whatever). Once  
they are anything over the default, it would be assumed they are  
unlikely to be a spammer and other people will read their messages as  
well.

Conversely, any spammer would immediately drop below the default on  
their first post, and their account wouldn't be good for spamming  
anymore.
