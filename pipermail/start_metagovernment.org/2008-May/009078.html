<PRE>I am open to the idea of opening the list, but I still favor having it  
remain as it is. Everyone who expresses an interest is invited to join  
the list, so there is no pre-filtering mechanism. But while we are  
still such a small group, I like having some individual contact with  
people before they join the list so that I can ensure that they will  
introduce themselves.

The other reasons for keeping it closed were to control spam and to  
provide a bit of identity protection for members of the list during  
this fragile startup stage.

If the rest of the group would like, we could open up the list: I'll  
follow the group opinion here. And at some point I would like to make  
the wiki public, which will then also bring the whole world into the  
project. But I tend to be cautious about that sort of move until we  
have a critical mass within the group.

In any event, in the past day three more people have expressed  
interest and one of them has asked to join the list, so you should be  
hearing from them soon.
