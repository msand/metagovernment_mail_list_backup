<PRE>Hello everyone.

My name is Christopher Humphrey. I was born and raised in southern
California in the United States, obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer
Science there, and am currently working as a small-fry QA engineer at a
technology start-up in Silicon Valley.

Ever since a conversation with one of my schoolmates back at college (a
philosophy major) I've been thinking over what makes a government
legitimate, what makes it effective, and what makes it robust in the face of
attempts to subvert it. However, I've never really been satisfied with my
own ideas; one guy talking to himself about what is first and foremost the
interactions of society is unlikely to come to any useful conclusions.

Enter the Metagovernment project, via a (semi-offtopic) posting to Slashdot
and a quick e-mail to Ed.

I'm super excited about all of this, and have already been reading the
various ideas posted here with interest (although it's sometimes hard to
keep track of who said what).

I look forward to working with all of you on this in the days to come.

- Chris
