<PRE>I forgot to mention the other reason: we still do not have any formal  
organization, such as a non-profit corporation or a co-op. It seems  
prudent to have a nominally closed group until such an organization is  
formed... provided one is even necessary. I would very much like this  
to be a topic of discussion at the June meeting.
