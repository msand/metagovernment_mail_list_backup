</I>
Why, if you oppose the implementation then your vote should be
against, final. You can state in your explanation that you like the
idea, but it shouldn't affect the rating you give. What you are rating
is the implementation, which you oppose.

&gt;<i> First, I do not see &quot;vast support&quot; for opening up. If we are to count
</I>&gt;<i> the (now) 15 members of the list, a small percentage has spoken in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of opening the list. So how do we define a quorum? How many
</I>&gt;<i> people need to be in favor of something before it goes into effect?
</I>&gt;<i> Both I and Aur suggested using a significant percentage of people who
</I>&gt;<i> have participated in the last month, but in retrospect that does not
</I>&gt;<i> seem realistic. Clearly this is a central issue we need to define for
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore to succeed.
</I>
Vast support is when a question is asked  and all the answers are the
same. You are the only one I heard opposing opening up, and your
position is &quot;weakly against&quot;, whilst anyone else I've heard talking is
positioned &quot;strongly pro&quot;.

The AktivDemoktrati people have a very nice solution to that problem -
their rating is the integral of of support for an idea d(time), so
ideas with more support are accepted quickly and ideas with less
support are accepted slowly, giving more time to reflect.

&gt;<i> My strongest reason for objecting to opening the list is one of
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis. I very much want this group to open up, but I do not think
</I>&gt;<i> that e-mail is an appropriate mechanism for large-scale participation.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not like a typical list server where one can only read
</I>&gt;<i> selected threads: in order to keep up with the project, one really
</I>&gt;<i> needs to read almost all the messages on the list. Wider participation
</I>&gt;<i> means more list traffic, which means more reading for everyone, which
</I>&gt;<i> can result in *less* participation by several valuable members.
</I>
But we are losing people, and those people won't come back when we
open up. Why don't we open the list, ask nicely that people keep their
writing volume low, politely tell anyone who doesn't that he's wasting
our time reading, and if that doesn't work - close again, explaining
why on the main page? That would solve the &quot;losing people&quot; problem.
(If you support this, vote R1+... There's no need for a new resolution
for this solution).

&gt;<i> Instead, I propose that we open up the wiki &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; soon but not immediately. (The main obstacle right now for me is
</I>&gt;<i> time: I just need to spend a few hours studying how to properly secure
</I>&gt;<i> MediaWiki, and I have not yet had those hours. I intend/hope to have
</I>&gt;<i> it secure by June 7.)
</I>
Just back it up, twice a day, and if someone does something really bad
- restore a backup from before that.

But... opening the wiki isn't enough. People who would think to join
us want to know that there is /transparency/, and that means anything
we use - we open.

&gt;<i> Another objection I had to opening up the list server was that we do
</I>&gt;<i> not yet have a formal organization, However, I am starting to
</I>&gt;<i> formulate a way we might be able to proceed without any formal
</I>&gt;<i> organization, even if we have financial needs. I am not sure I even
</I>&gt;<i> want that, but I think it is worth exploring. I will present more on
</I>&gt;<i> that later.
</I>
I really don't see why this matters. Could you open my eyes?
