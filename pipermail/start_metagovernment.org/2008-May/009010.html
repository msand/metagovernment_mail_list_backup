<PRE>I recently received a private message from Aur and we've agreed it might
not be a bad idea to make my response public for reasons which I hope are
self explanatory:

He wrote:
&gt;<i> Hello Harry,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I need a few more opinions about my ideas about decision making in my

</I>&gt;<i> You seem to be the community member most learned in this field.

</I>&gt;<i> Could you have a look and give me some input?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two threads about it in <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagov</A>, one called &quot;a half

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>  -- Aur
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
to which I replied:


I am desperately keen to help. Unfortunately I am currently fully
committed to a very exciting and very demanding software project which has
considerable connections to my wider Trusted Surveillance project and
tangential connections to this project. If I tell you what it is (it's no
secret) you might understand why I am unable to participate as I would
wish.

I've been asked to created a Security Steward administration system for
the company that provides the perimeter security at the annual Glastonbury
festival. This has plunged me directly into putting into practice some of
the principles I'm bleating about on my websites. I have a free hand to do
it exactly the way I want it done. But I only got the go ahead in February
and it's got to be live and controlling the lives of 1200 Stewards -
without serious fault - by the last week in June.

I'm making good progress. Don't think there are any serious obstacles. So
I think I'm going to make it.

Just.

Meanwhile I aint got time to fart never mind read and give intelligent
responses to other peoples efforts. Which really pisses me off because the
Trust scoring/metascoring system together with the rules we build in to it
are easily the most important components of a digital democracy.

So, please forgive me, I cannot commit more to the project right now. I
wont even have an opportunity to catch up at least on what everyone has
been saying until the week starting 17 May when I happen to be in Brighton
for the week on another long standing commitment...

Hmmm... do you think I should post something to this effect on the group?
I don't want the impression to be given that I'm losing interest. I just
ran out of hands and time!

Regards

Harry
**********
The gist is that I'm still very much committed to this project but don't
expect much from me until the dust (or - more typically - mud) has settled
in Glastonbury at the end of June.
