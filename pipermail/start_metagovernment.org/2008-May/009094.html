<PRE>Hi Aur, You said &quot;I disagree completely about your ideas of what would make a project of
this kind successful.&quot; I have the feeling you may have read too much into my ideas. I'd like to look into it in case others in the group are in the same boat.

I presume you are referring to my statement that what is needed by metagovernments (and by us - by way of eating our own dog-food) is, &quot;a process to define the most important problem needing our effort, define what we want the result of our effort to be, then (and only then) define what solutions and actions need put in place to achieve that vision.&quot;

By disagree completely, do you mean we don't need to define our most important problem, don't need to define what the results of our effort should be, and don't need to define the actions needed to achieve our vision?

To me these things seem intuitive and self-evident common sense to make sure a group of people are all on the same page. That is not to say anything against diversity and experimenting with multiple possible routes, which may be precisely what is needed. Do you see where I'm coming from? If not could you please explain what you mean?

Thanks very much for providing your list despite your reservations.

Paul
