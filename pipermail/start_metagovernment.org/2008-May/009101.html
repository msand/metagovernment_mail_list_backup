Exactly what I meant. Deriving a weight for a user writing in a nearby
field from the tag weighs would be simple.

&gt;<i> Let us suppose that I have a family with a wife and 3 kids. We decide to

</I>&gt;<i> joking? Or we would have to ask for even more people to join in to balance
</I>&gt;<i> them? Where would our personal responsability go? Our actions before words
</I>&gt;<i> if we need to get a cometee through half of the world just to decide if the
</I>&gt;<i> toilet paper should be white or pink.
</I>&gt;<i> So people outside might be able to see, maybe to speak, but of course not to
</I>&gt;<i> vote, or at leats their vote would be much much MUCH smaller weighted than
</I>&gt;<i> ours.
</I>&gt;<i> Something that would have an effect only if we are exactly in balance.

Ah, what a great example. I might reuse it. A lot.

What I liked about Ed's ideas so much that it made me join the project
is the ultralow level of *enforcement* they require.


What would happen is this:

The dad proposes buying white toilet paper.

The wife and kids rate +.

Six kids from Israel decide to run a prank, go and rate -, then
propose the family buys pink toilet paper and vote +.

The family votes - on the new proposal.

The family goes and buys white toilet paper - a law wasn't yet passed
against that and the system has achieved the purpose of helping them
reach consensus (even if it is not recorded in the system as
consensus).

Then when they come back from the store they propose a new law banning
the kids from Ms for a month, citing the prank as reason (and there
would probably be a law already passed with guidelines on what to do
with such pranksters that says &quot;ban them for a month&quot;).

Since it was an attack against the SYSTEM, millions of enraged
citizens rate + in order to defend their system from the kids' abuse.


Social systems tend to be VERY self preserving.
