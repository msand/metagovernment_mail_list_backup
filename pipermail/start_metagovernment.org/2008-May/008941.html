<PRE>As I've said in previous posts I'd like to see the traditional hierarchy turned on its head in some respects. So the closer to the individual, the more sovereignty it is though to have.

This in conjunction with the fact that only geography is finite, and only geographic communities have to mix and balance the needs of lots of all of their constituents sometimes competing and conflicting interests and priorities.

Putting these 2 thoughts together I would say that we could create a structure whereby small self-defined geographic based communities can band together to seed some of their powers to a larger government in order to achieve specific objectives they cannot achieve acting on their own. They retain the right to pull out of this, although they risk being ostricised and avoided by the other communities in future if they do so. This pressure could be quite strong such as the pressure on the US delegation at the recent Bali climate talks.

Individuals do belong to geographic communites, whether they recognise them or not, they can influence where the boundaries are, and how their community positions itself relative to other communities, but if they choose not to engage they have to abide by the laws in any case. The only way out of that would be to get together with their neighbours and start another community. Which would be great!

Communities (for proagmatic reasons of scale and resource effciciency) will often function best at certain levels of critical mass. These levels will vary from issue to issue. For example the residents of 1 street could get together to make a residents association but it will find it difficult to impact on the number of drug adicts in the next neighbourhood, whereas a town council could address that issue more easily. Climate change might need certain aspect delegated to a global government (always with the option of pulling these powers back if needs be).

It might be useful to look at how traditional governments have layered themselves as a pointer to where these critical masses might be found.  In the UK for example there are a number of systems but largely they follow this model:

* Village/Parish governments (mostly volunteer staff)
* Districts/Towns (hundreds of employees)
* Counties/Cities (large, powerful, thousands of employees)
* Regions (5-12 counties) (powers vary)
* Nations (Scotland, England, N.Ireland, Wales - roughly equivalent to US states)(very powerful, Bns of pounds under control)
* UK (Westminster, London)(defence, foreign policy, immigration, income tax, currency-via Bank of England-nationalised 1947)
* EU (Brussells)
* UN (New York)

If we had templates set up at these levels it would make the job of recuiting activists to set up these metagovernments much easier.

I've attached the appendix to a case-study I wrote last year on a direct democracy related project undertaken by a local goverment authority in England - see page 4 for a diagram with more info on the above. Although it was written for a mainstream audience and I'd change it in certain ways if working from a blank sheet as we are.

How are things organised where you are?

Paul

&gt;<i> particular community the force of law? That is, how can a government
</I>&gt;<i> have the ability to enforce laws if participation in the government is
</I>&gt;<i> voluntary?
</I>
Participation may be voluntary, but if the jurisdiction of a government is
uncontested, they should have the ability to enforce their laws. Same as
with every other government right now. If you live in a certain jurisdiction,
you have to abide by the laws there, or try to change them.

If multiple communities have power over a certain area, it should be made
clear, which is the higher government body. If their legislation conflict
one another they should of course resolve that issue, for clarities sake.
In any case, it should be clear, which community has more authority.

That of course doesn't answer your question of who has authority, it just
assumes there is a hierarchy of communities with authority. Establishing
that hierarchy will be something we may help with, but ultimately I would
say, that is essentially a question the respective communities have to
solve. Be it through dialog, forming a new community or outright war.
I'm not sure we can do much about this.

Manuel
