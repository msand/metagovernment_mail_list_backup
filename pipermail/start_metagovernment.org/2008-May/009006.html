I did not investigate Apache's system thoroughly, but I think the only  
way in which mine differs is that all scores are tallied at the end  
(and that yes, it is multiplied by ten). So a score of 5  
mathematically expresses half-support.

The reason I propose nuanced scoring like this is that people can show  
different levels of support for different competing propositions. If  
one has no opinion but wants to comment, one can vote zero.

I suggested that as a convenience for this group, since we have 11  
members. If everyone participated in a vote and ten people gave it  
total support 10*10=100, one person could still veto with a  
-10(*10)=-100.
