<PRE>OK.

Seeing that there is much community support for a binary system and
thus the advantage of Ed's suggestion being the only supported one is
lost,let me formalize and propose a binary system:

*** RESOLUTION 1 ***

A resolution is proposed to the mailing list by enclosing it in a
block delimited by &quot;*** RESOLUTION &lt;serial number&gt; ***&quot; and
&quot;********************&quot;.

The serial number is a number that no resolution in a thread already
has, and is used when rating to indicate which resolution you are
rating.

A resolution is rated by including a line with &quot;R&lt;s/n&gt;+&quot; or &quot;R&lt;s/n&gt;-&quot;
in an email in the thread. An explanation is preferred in the + case
and MANDATORY in the - case. Only the latest rating of the same
resolution by a user is taken into account.

If, at any point in time,
 * 72 hours have already passed since a resolution was posted
 * 90% of the users active in the mailing list in the past month have
rated that resolution +
 * no user active in the mailing list in the past month had rated it -
 * an email is sent to the mailing list with the subject &quot;[resolution]
&lt;an appropriate title for the resolution&gt;&quot; and the resolution quoted
in the message body
 * no other resolution to the same issue was accepted
then the resolution is accepted.

For convenience, proposed resolutions must be complete - they cannot
reference other resolutions by name but must instead quote anything
that they wish to incorporate.

********************

R1+

I do NOT remove my +10 vote on Ed's suggestion. If it has more
support, I will be perfectly happy to try it.
