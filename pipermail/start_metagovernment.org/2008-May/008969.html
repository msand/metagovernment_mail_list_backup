Thank you, Manuel, for some great input.

The way you see discussion mechanics is very similar to my own...

You rate revisions (a new revision is created every time an edit is
made to proposed legislation or a comment is added) to make them more
visible and show your assessment of their value. If a revision gets
something close to consensus (90% positive votes by at least 1% of the
population, as a temporary measure for testing... of course we will
perfect the math once the rest is there and with the help of game
theorists) it becomes &quot;prerelease legislation&quot; (something like an RFC
- request for comments - document) and is put in a place where people
are invited, for say one week, to discuss it before it becomes final -
that is just another measure to promote the visibility of the really
good ideas.

What I called &quot;voting&quot; should in fact be called &quot;rating&quot; - it does not
lead to 51% victories, it is just a way to measure consensus and make
propositions into law if the consensus is there.


Ed, this leads to my response to my impression of what you said:

I think it is the WHOLE WORLD's business what happens in every little
park in Tijuana, if the world cares enough to go , read the discussion
and rate it (or maybe even just click a link given by a journalist and
rate that). I think that in cases where one large population would
stick it's nose where it shouldn't, the victims could and would go to
the press and ask the rest of the world to come and help &quot;police&quot; the
discussion. If there is a case where AT LEAST 90% of the world
population sticks it's nose where it shouldn't, then... it's probably
wrong to said that it shouldn't, since so many people thought that it
IS their business.

Once you demand consensus, then the consensus should be between
EVERYBODY, defined as &quot;everybody who cares enough to participate in
the discussion&quot;. Since we've never seen a consensocracy, it doesn't
come natural to us, but if you think about it, it and only it makes
sense.

About communities - I just don't see them existing. They have no place
in my design and would needlessly complicate it.

I do think that between those who care a lot about the same issue
there would evolve some recognition of each other - see wikipedia,
slashdot as examples where you have TONS of commentors and yet there
are cliques.

Try to think how it would work without any software support of &quot;communities&quot;...


About my math: all of it is just simplifications for experimental
purposes. Those measures will be thought through with help of game
theorists once we have software that can test the better measures, but
this is enough to test my ideas and start writing the software.
