<PRE>For some of our more complex conversations, a list server does not  
serve well because it is too linear and people who don't respond  
quickly may not get around to responding later.

I had hoped that a wiki would be the obvious solution, but I am not  
sure it is ideal. It is great for collaborating on the creation of  
documents, where everyone can change parts of the document as they see  
fit. But it is sometimes cumbersome for conversation.

So I suggest we keep this list server some of our conversations, and  
that we use the wiki as a sort of whiteboard where we can develop  
ideas together.

The wiki is not well-secured nor is it well-configured, so please do  
not give out this address yet. But you can see/edit what is there now  
with the below links. Please feel free to set up an account, which  
will then give you the ability to edit. (Recommend that you use your  
real name as your user name.)

The Metagovernment home page has been recreated here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>
Please edit this page! But please avoid making major edits without  
getting some approval from the group (here or on the Discussion page).

As an example of how we might use the wiki, I recreated my scoring  
proposal here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Resolutions/0/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Resolutions/0/</A>
and the conversation about it on the associated Discussion page:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Resolutions/0/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Resolutions/0/</A>

I think Aur's counter-proposal would be filed at &quot;/Resolutions/1/&quot;...  
I just have not gotten around to that. Nor am I sure if this filing  
system is the right way to do it, since it does not really take  
advantage of the collaboration features of a wiki. Please feel free to  
experiment with different organization techniques.

In any event, at some point the wiki should take over for the current  
flat HTML. At that point, we are effectively inviting the world into  
the project.
