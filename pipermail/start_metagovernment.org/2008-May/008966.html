<PRE>&gt;<i>  I would like to hear what some other members of this group think about
</I>&gt;<i>  this...
</I>
I have allot of issues with this discussion. Sorry in advance, for the
wall of text. Here's a heads up, but please bear with me.

- Voting allows everybody to participate, even those without a thorough
understanding of the subject.

- Scoring is intended to filter discussions for valuable contributions,
rather than suppress members who have not established themselves.

- The effort required to participate in a discussion, weeds those out who
shouldn't be participating anyway.


Again it seems that voting has become the default means for
making a decision. And again I would like to point out, that voting is a
very bad for a number of reasons. If a member of the community can't
even coherently articulate their opinion, and contribute to a discussion,
hopefully making a better proposal, or rejecting the existing proposal
with a valid argument, there is no reason, for that member to have any
say in a discussion.

Allowing people to vote encourages mob rule. If a certain opinion is
represented on the news as being urgent, and people are allowed to vote,
we have effectively implemented mob rule.

The reason I see for a scoring system, is not to reduce what any member
of the community has to say on a certain topic, but to extract the
valuable contributions, from a discussion among 2000 people. I think we
can all agree, that even with just 20 people, all eagerly participating
in a discussion, there is a need for some filtering mechanism, let alone
the amount of people that would participate in a discussion over an
issue relevant to an entire nation.

What scoring does, is not to reduce the say any member has, based on
their track record, but it allows the messages of any individual user to
be rated, purely based on their merit. If the truck driver actually does
have something relevant to say concerning heart surgery, the few members
of the community that will initially see his message, will recognize
this, rate it positively, thereby publishing it to a larger audience.
Analogous can be said for an old senile heart surgeon, who may have made
valuable contributions in the past, but lately can hardly gain any
support. His messages will never make it to a wider audience.

Nowhere here is there any need for a vote. Most of the time, a decision
will emerge from the discussion, which all can agree upon. Once that
decision moves on in its life cycle, and is proposed to be merged into
the main repository, as law. More people will see it, they can read the
discussions that occurred surrounding it. Ideally there will be a
summary of the discussion, making the reasons clear, that lead to this
particular choice of legislation.

If somebody can then articulate a good reason against the legislation,
the community can go back to the drawing board.

Voting shifts the focus away from making the best decision for the
community, allowing each voter to evaluate a decision, purely based
on the effects it will have on the individual member himself. If he
feels somehow mistreated, by some proposed legislation, he can make
himself heard, in the form of a veto.

There may be cases, where no decision can recognized as the best decision
for the community (which should be the basis upon which a decision is
evaluated). This shouldn't occur too often, if the discussion is held
properly, the relevant facts and clearly formulated consequences of a
proposal, should make the right decision obvious to everybody. This may
not be the case, if facts are scarce and a decision is mostly a judgment
call. If that is the case, the people can vote for all I care.

I'll take the position of a tech snob here for a second, just for
arguments sake: If people are willing to vote, it shows a lack
of technical understanding in a subject. For one reason or another, they
are unable to evaluate the facts presented to them and make there
decisions based upon that. When making software in an open source
community, the right decisions can mostly determined, based on their
technical merit. The decisions that do come down to a vote, are the most
banal things you could imagine. Those that everyone feels obligated to
pitch in on, because it is basically a judgment call. As anecdotes of
this, I offer:
- <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html</A>
And a more concrete example
- <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/</A>

The latter case shows, that on the most banal decision, the syntax for
how to write a conditional expression in one line, no consensus can be
achieved. Simply because it doesn't make that much of a difference, so
there is no technical merit to judge decisions by.

I could go on, but I've taken enough of your time.

Manuel
