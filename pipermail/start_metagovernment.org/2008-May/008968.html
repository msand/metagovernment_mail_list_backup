</I>
I think, that by now, it should be clear, that I don't want votes to be
meaningful. But that's besides the point. What you're referring to, from
an implementation perspective is the choice between a web of trust and
a trusted central authority.

Personally I don't think we need a central authority. The only information I
intend to extract from a signature is, that a message comes from the same
person who wrote all the other messages and signed it with the same key.
Not who they are in the real world, weather they belong to the community
at all or any other criteria which might invoke respect beyond what they
can garner from their contributions.

No need for authentication and certainly not for checking a SSN.

&gt;<i>  As I said elsewhere, the second step is to issue
</I>&gt;<i>  encryption-smart-cards that never expose their private key, to
</I>&gt;<i>  mitigate the risk of someone hacking into PCs, stealing the keys and
</I>&gt;<i>  building a voters-army.
</I>
I think of PGP encryption as a big hurdle, that might prevent the adoption
of this software, but I can't think of any other way to ensure that messages
aren't forged. If the encryption itself is a danger, then smart-cards are a
sure fire way to bury the project in its tracks.

I don't want perfect security, I would hope we can implement a system that
is resilient enough not to require that kind of security. If a key is
compromised, all the intruder can do with it, is write and sign messages
as the person who hasn't been taking good care of his key. The key can
then be revoked and damage will be minimized.

In the case of secure voting, with the procedure I proposed, any member of
the community will notice if their key has been compromised, because the
token for their ballot will have expired, rendering their ballot invalid, maybe
even the entire vote (probably only, if not counting that ballot might change
the outcome of the vote).
