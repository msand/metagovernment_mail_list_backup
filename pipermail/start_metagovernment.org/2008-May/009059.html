<PRE>Below is my reply to a recent query to the Metascore contact address.  
Everyone who has written to a contact address has been invited to join  
this list, so it seems reasonable to continue that policy. Unless  
anyone objects, I will continue to subscribe anyone who requests it.

I think it would also be helpful for the members of this list to  
invite one or two others to join the list. Opinions?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Joel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the project is still quite young. A closed list server with 11  
</I>&gt;<i> members from ~7 countries started up about a month ago. Since then,  
</I>&gt;<i> some initial development has started in the Mercurial distributed  
</I>&gt;<i> version control system, and some work has begun on a wiki to replace  
</I>&gt;<i> the current website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you like me to add you to the list server? If so, you will be  
</I>&gt;<i> asked to post a short e-mail introducing yourself. Being added to  
</I>&gt;<i> the list will also give you access to its archives, where you can  
</I>&gt;<i> catch up as you please.
