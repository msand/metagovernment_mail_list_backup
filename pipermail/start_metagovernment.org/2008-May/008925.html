<PRE>I can imagine all kinds of practical difficulties and uncomfortable trade-offs with this. What if we assume that there are 3 kinds of communities. Communities of interest (like people who like fishing on lake XYZ), Geographic communities (people who live, work or play, in a particular place or geographical area), and demographic communities (ie teens, elderly people, chinese americans, etc). If we assume that there can be infinite interests and hence Communities of Interest (COIs), and multiple demographic communities (DCs or CODs, it makes sence that there can only be one geographic community in any particular place, although it could have sub-communities, and it could be a participant in other larger community areas. In this way it maps to the role local government plays now. These local metagovernments could and should take a leadership role in facilitating and balancing the needs of all the COIs and CODs in their area. So while in some cases the COIs and CODs could be powerful and influential (based on the merit and participation of their members), it is the geographic communities that ultimately hold the real powers and it is there that the difficult decisions will need to be taken.

How does that sound?

Subject : [Start] Community relationships

I have been trying to work out a lingering problem with our new open 
community model. If anyone can start a community, then what gives any 
particular community the force of law? That is, how can a government 
have the ability to enforce laws if participation in the government is 
voluntary?

I think the answer to this may lie in the groundwork we have already 
established: the synthesis score, as defined here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works">http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works</A>

Synthesis scores could provide the solution if they can transcend any 
particular community. That is, if someone sees two conflicting 
resolutions in two different communities, they can propose a 
resolution in either community (or in a third community) which they 
think synthesizes the other two. If that resolution gains a 
significant synthesis score, then it draws those other two communities 
into its realm, effectively subsuming those communities (at least in 
regard to that one issue).

As an example: imagine that there is a community of people who live 
around a lake. Now imagine a second community of people who do not 
live near that lake, but who like to go fishing there. Each one of 
these has their own community website with its own set of laws. But it 
is easy to imagine that some laws in one community might conflict with 
laws in the other. So in response to one of those conflicts, someone 
could start a new community of people who have a concern with that 
lake (regardless of whether they live on the lake or not). That larger 
community would be better able to come to agreement on issues on which 
the two communities are in conflict.

Does this sound viable as an authority-building mechanism? Can it be 
constructed in such a way that people would be inclined to follow laws 
of the community even if they disagree? In the example, a resident of 
the lake area might not agree with a law made by the larger lake- 
concern community, however they would have to either abide by it or 
stop participating in any of the involved lake communities 
(effectively, they would have to move away).

If this does seem workable, can the programmers in this group imagine 
how it could be implemented? Each instance of Metascore would have to 
be able to influence each other instance.
