<PRE>RESOLUTION
*****
I propose a slightly less geeky scale than the Apache project (which 
we discussed in a previous thread): that people vote by expressing an 
integer score from -10 to 10. 

Much less geeky would be a common 5 star rating. When do we really need to know more than *no way, **has flaws, ***acceptable, ****worthwhile, *****awesome - or words to that effect.
We can retain the maths you propose but attach -100 to *, +10 to ***** etc.
I propose that the system be flexible enough to allow a bunch of geeks to over-ride the 5 star system to be able to access more subtle levels of control but my advice is by default - KEEP IT SIMPLE.

And that unless there is compelling 
reason to do otherwise, scores are accepted for 72 hours. At the end 
of 72 hours, the scores are simply added together, and a positive 
score means approval. 

I propose that communities are given the choice to allow or disallow time limited resolutions. In my own view they can sometimes be very dangerous and would need accompanied by safeguards to make sure decisions are quorate. There are a number of important US laws in force today that were passed by VERY small numbers of elected members while the rest of the house was not there! By default I would prefer if decisions were made once &quot;critical mass&quot; is reached. What critical mass actually is can be decided by each community and might be different for different kinds of resolutions.

To reproduce Apache's veto, I also propose that 
a vote of -10 be tallied as -100. 

In some cases we may need some other more flexible and scaleable maths, but this will get us started.

People can express a score with an 
explanation, or simply a score with nothing else. If anyone votes -10, 
then the resolution is stalled until that person can be convinced to 
change their mind (probably by the group changing the resolution in 
some way). A change to the resolution resets the 72-hour clock. Unless 
they say otherwise in their proposal, let us automatically assume that 
an author of a resolution gives it a +10.

I also agree that a veto needs to have an explanation, even a holding explanation like &quot;My research results are coming in against this, I'll collate them and post my ideas tomorrow.&quot;

*****


+6 or 4 stars (****)

Paul
