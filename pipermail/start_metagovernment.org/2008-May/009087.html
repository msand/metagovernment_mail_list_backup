<PRE>Hi Manuel,

Yes I very much like mindmaps,
you can consider me alternatively a mind map junkie or a mindmap expert. :)
I have tried most of the program out there, even reaching the point of
buying programs to test them. If this isn't being a junkie.
On the other hand I really love the way my head gets clear once I get the
all on the mindmap.

Regarding what to use,
there is a number of programs out there, and a number of service.
The de facto standard for open source mindmaps is freemind. You can google
it and download it.
Stay on the latest stable reliese, as the new once have some nasty bugs, at
least they had them last time I heard about them.

Freemind is really easy to use once you get accostumed to it, with single
click that let you do a lot of things.
I normally take notes on it during the lessons, unles I am teaching myself,
in which case I often use a mindmap instead of a power point presentation.
And students get it much better.

When I mindmap for my website I use other programs, but this is another
story.

SOme time ago I was using wikiwoki (or similar) and it was able to upload
mindmaps directly on the wiki.
I think by now mediawiki should have the plug in to make it possible too.

While this is nice, it is much less than perfect (or even acceptable) to
work on the mindmap in a communal way.

You would have to download the mindmap, then change it, then upload it
again.

If this is what you want to do, then I have a website that let you publish
your own mindmap,
download others mindmap, and does a bunch of other things unrelated (make a
mindmap out of oyur del.icio.us entries).

So if we are happy for it to go public I could just upload it there, and
then we could all download it, make changes, and upload the next version,
and so on.

But the mindmap would get public. And visible by everyone. DO we want this
at this stage?

To collaborate on a single mindmap there are other tools on the net.

Although I have never tried it
<A HREF="http://www.mindmeister.com/">http://www.mindmeister.com/</A>
comes to mind. Which have been studied just for that.

But I would have to look at all the other tools available.
( <A HREF="http://del.icio.us/popular/mindmap">http://del.icio.us/popular/mindmap</A> )
Especially because I would not touch with a pole a tool that does not let me
upload and download a freemind (.mm) version of the data. That is the
standard!


The other problem is a problem of what is public, and what is not.
In a sense if we use mindmeister are we sure the mindmap we get will be just
for us to see?
If not we can only use it AFTER we went public.
What is the situation here with attachment?

Can I just attach the mindmap, and it would get sent to all of you?
In the archive ALL the attachments were being stripped.

So, yes I have here the mindmap,
I can send it to you, but to collaborate we probably should look a bit
around for the best collaborative tool.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>the problem with non having broadband is not so much the single file, but
all the search you need to do to understand what is the single file you need
to upload. Once you know exactly what to do, you have downloaded the manual,
the video of the manual, and so on, THEN it is only 168kb.
So  what I can say is that I will try it out after the 3 of June. When I am
back working in the office for some time.

Then once it is set up, it might be possible for me to keep it up to date
from a slow connection.

Something about going public, you have heard me asking if we want to go
public,
but my position on this is is that we (you) should have gone public ages
ago.
I see this as a requirement of the transparency.
And I find that the project is loosing a lot in credibility (and integrity)
by not having started as public.
