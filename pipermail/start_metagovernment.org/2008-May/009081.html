<PRE>Hello Paul,

I disagree completely about your ideas of what would make a project of
this kind successful.

BUT, and it is much more important, I STRONGLY agree with the attitude
of &quot;But rather than take up your valuable time what I would like to
try is to take soundings and inputs from each of us, then lock myself
in a smoke-filled room until I've &quot;processed&quot; your inputs, then
present them back to the group for validation and enhancement from
you&quot;. That is exactly the attitude I'm trying to take with my design
document. So rather than bash you now, I'd rather help as much as I
can, let you process our input, and then decide whether to oppose or
agree with your results.

Here is my list, then:

 * The technology is hard
 * Governments don't like to be replaced
 * Lots of people feed off the governments
 * Lots of entities depend on governments (from corporations to lawyers)
 * An age of change is an age of uncertainty
 * Let people talk, and they will not shut up for a month


I hope you'll come up with great ideas that will advance us all :) I
really like what you're doing here.

 -- Aur
