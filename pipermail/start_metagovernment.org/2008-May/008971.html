<PRE>My concern is that a user's valid arguments with a high score on some
pieces of legislation will give their opinions greater weight in
conversations where their opinions may not be so widely thought valid.
I don't think tagging or categorizing can be enough to prevent against
this-but i could be wrong. It seems to me there are too many
dimensions here: federalism, social values, fiscal responsibility,
etc. A user may be an economist commenting valuably on healthcare
expenditure but may not have a valuable comment on euthenasia. If this
list is at all representative, we know that there will be a
considerable back and forth in the comments and discussion that
parallel the development of a single piece of legislation. What if we
implement scoring on a per-legislation basis? So that a user's
contributions to a text are rated by their discussion about that text?
Otherwise if there is a way to weight the score intelligently by all
tags applied to past and current statements i'm all ears :)

&gt;<i> &gt;  I would like to hear what some other members of this group think about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  this...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have allot of issues with this discussion. Sorry in advance, for the
</I>&gt;<i> wall of text. Here's a heads up, but please bear with me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Voting allows everybody to participate, even those without a thorough
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of the subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Scoring is intended to filter discussions for valuable contributions,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than suppress members who have not established themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The effort required to participate in a discussion, weeds those out who
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be participating anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again it seems that voting has become the default means for
</I>&gt;<i> making a decision. And again I would like to point out, that voting is a
</I>&gt;<i> very bad for a number of reasons. If a member of the community can't
</I>&gt;<i> even coherently articulate their opinion, and contribute to a discussion,
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully making a better proposal, or rejecting the existing proposal
</I>&gt;<i> with a valid argument, there is no reason, for that member to have any
</I>&gt;<i> say in a discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing people to vote encourages mob rule. If a certain opinion is
</I>&gt;<i> represented on the news as being urgent, and people are allowed to vote,
</I>&gt;<i> we have effectively implemented mob rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason I see for a scoring system, is not to reduce what any member
</I>&gt;<i> of the community has to say on a certain topic, but to extract the
</I>&gt;<i> valuable contributions, from a discussion among 2000 people. I think we
</I>&gt;<i> can all agree, that even with just 20 people, all eagerly participating
</I>&gt;<i> in a discussion, there is a need for some filtering mechanism, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of people that would participate in a discussion over an
</I>&gt;<i> issue relevant to an entire nation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What scoring does, is not to reduce the say any member has, based on
</I>&gt;<i> their track record, but it allows the messages of any individual user to
</I>&gt;<i> be rated, purely based on their merit. If the truck driver actually does
</I>&gt;<i> have something relevant to say concerning heart surgery, the few members
</I>&gt;<i> of the community that will initially see his message, will recognize
</I>&gt;<i> this, rate it positively, thereby publishing it to a larger audience.
</I>&gt;<i> Analogous can be said for an old senile heart surgeon, who may have made
</I>&gt;<i> valuable contributions in the past, but lately can hardly gain any
</I>&gt;<i> support. His messages will never make it to a wider audience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nowhere here is there any need for a vote. Most of the time, a decision
</I>&gt;<i> will emerge from the discussion, which all can agree upon. Once that
</I>&gt;<i> decision moves on in its life cycle, and is proposed to be merged into
</I>&gt;<i> the main repository, as law. More people will see it, they can read the
</I>&gt;<i> discussions that occurred surrounding it. Ideally there will be a
</I>&gt;<i> summary of the discussion, making the reasons clear, that lead to this
</I>&gt;<i> particular choice of legislation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody can then articulate a good reason against the legislation,
</I>&gt;<i> the community can go back to the drawing board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Voting shifts the focus away from making the best decision for the
</I>&gt;<i> community, allowing each voter to evaluate a decision, purely based
</I>&gt;<i> on the effects it will have on the individual member himself. If he
</I>&gt;<i> feels somehow mistreated, by some proposed legislation, he can make
</I>&gt;<i> himself heard, in the form of a veto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There may be cases, where no decision can recognized as the best decision
</I>&gt;<i> for the community (which should be the basis upon which a decision is
</I>&gt;<i> evaluated). This shouldn't occur too often, if the discussion is held
</I>&gt;<i> properly, the relevant facts and clearly formulated consequences of a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, should make the right decision obvious to everybody. This may
</I>&gt;<i> not be the case, if facts are scarce and a decision is mostly a judgment
</I>&gt;<i> call. If that is the case, the people can vote for all I care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll take the position of a tech snob here for a second, just for
</I>&gt;<i> arguments sake: If people are willing to vote, it shows a lack
</I>&gt;<i> of technical understanding in a subject. For one reason or another, they
</I>&gt;<i> are unable to evaluate the facts presented to them and make there
</I>&gt;<i> decisions based upon that. When making software in an open source
</I>&gt;<i> community, the right decisions can mostly determined, based on their
</I>&gt;<i> technical merit. The decisions that do come down to a vote, are the most
</I>&gt;<i> banal things you could imagine. Those that everyone feels obligated to
</I>&gt;<i> pitch in on, because it is basically a judgment call. As anecdotes of
</I>&gt;<i> this, I offer:
</I>&gt;<i> - <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And a more concrete example
</I>&gt;<i> - <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latter case shows, that on the most banal decision, the syntax for
</I>&gt;<i> how to write a conditional expression in one line, no consensus can be
</I>&gt;<i> achieved. Simply because it doesn't make that much of a difference, so
</I>&gt;<i> there is no technical merit to judge decisions by.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I could go on, but I've taken enough of your time.
</I>&gt;<i>
