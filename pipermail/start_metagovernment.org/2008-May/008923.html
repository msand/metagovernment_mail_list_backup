<PRE>David Doonan was considering a run for public office last year, but not
necessarily for Mayor. But when then Mayor Chris McCormick, was quoted in
the local paper as saying &quot;things are easier to get done when the public
doesn't show up&quot; Doonan knew he had to run. &quot;That was really the turning
point for me&quot;. Doonan said, &quot;People felt like they were shut out of the
process, that decisions were being made without public input&quot;. Doonan made
Open Government the central issue of his campaign. It turns out that was the
right focus. Doonan won the election with more than 70 percent of the vote.
The incumbent, running for a Trustee position, garnered only 8 percent.
