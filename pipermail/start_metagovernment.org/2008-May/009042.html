<PRE>Hi all.

I want to clarify something, because of an email I received from Manuel.


This thread, as well as two others I opened about my design, deal with
a design proposal that *I* am writing, that I will want to suggest to
the community once it is ready, and I hope that there will be other,
radically different, design proposals written by other people.

Why? Because I do not believe in design-by-committee. It is a
well-known meme in programming circles that design-by-committee
doesn't work. I think the only solution would be for each of us to
fork his own design document, where he is the sole decider, he is the
one who has a vision and knows where he is taking the design, and
others give him feedback and suggestions that he chooses to
incorporate if they fit with his vision... And when we're all done, we
all propose our versions as resolutions and try to reach consensus
about which is best or how to synthesize them.

When I ask definitive questions, set definitive answers or generally
act like a know-it-all, I am talking about MY design, for which I have
a vision that will only be fully expressed in words once I'm done. I
thought that was apparent because at the beginning of the discussion
of my design I stated that, and these threads were stated to be about
it... In other threads I try to be much less benevolent-dictator-like.
I saw that Manuel has a different design document in the works in his
repo, and I invite anyone to fork my design and change and finish it
as he sees fit (and I wouldn't state anything absolute about it, just
give him friendly suggestions), and would love that to happen as it
would test my ideas about non-linear discussion/editing that are
relevant to the final result.

I'm sorry if I sounded like I'm taking control of the whole Metascore
design - in a community that has a goal to be leaderless I don't thing
that anyone should, and I am definitely not qualified.
