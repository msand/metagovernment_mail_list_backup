<PRE>I'm not sure this is going to grant a community 'authority' -- the
authority can and will only come from the people. synthesis here is
not enough, there needs to be a particular rate of participation in
order for the synthesized opinion (which may represent the opinions of
several few) to apply to the many people in the community .. however
it is defined.

thoughts on this issue?

Maybe for purposes of establishing authority we need a traditional
'vote' -- to ensure a threshold of participation rate is reached.

</I>&gt;<i> I have been trying to work out a lingering problem with our new open
</I>&gt;<i> community model. If anyone can start a community, then what gives any
</I>&gt;<i> particular community the force of law? That is, how can a government
</I>&gt;<i> have the ability to enforce laws if participation in the government is
</I>&gt;<i> voluntary?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the answer to this may lie in the groundwork we have already
</I>&gt;<i> established: the synthesis score, as defined here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works">http://www.metagovernment.org/#How_it_works</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Synthesis scores could provide the solution if they can transcend any
</I>&gt;<i> particular community. That is, if someone sees two conflicting
</I>&gt;<i> resolutions in two different communities, they can propose a
</I>&gt;<i> resolution in either community (or in a third community) which they
</I>&gt;<i> think synthesizes the other two. If that resolution gains a
</I>&gt;<i> significant synthesis score, then it draws those other two communities
</I>&gt;<i> into its realm, effectively subsuming those communities (at least in
</I>&gt;<i> regard to that one issue).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an example: imagine that there is a community of people who live
</I>&gt;<i> around a lake. Now imagine a second community of people who do not
</I>&gt;<i> live near that lake, but who like to go fishing there. Each one of
</I>&gt;<i> these has their own community website with its own set of laws. But it
</I>&gt;<i> is easy to imagine that some laws in one community might conflict with
</I>&gt;<i> laws in the other. So in response to one of those conflicts, someone
</I>&gt;<i> could start a new community of people who have a concern with that
</I>&gt;<i> lake (regardless of whether they live on the lake or not). That larger
</I>&gt;<i> community would be better able to come to agreement on issues on which
</I>&gt;<i> the two communities are in conflict.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this sound viable as an authority-building mechanism? Can it be
</I>&gt;<i> constructed in such a way that people would be inclined to follow laws
</I>&gt;<i> of the community even if they disagree? In the example, a resident of
</I>&gt;<i> the lake area might not agree with a law made by the larger lake-
</I>&gt;<i> concern community, however they would have to either abide by it or
</I>&gt;<i> stop participating in any of the involved lake communities
</I>&gt;<i> (effectively, they would have to move away).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this does seem workable, can the programmers in this group imagine
</I>&gt;<i> how it could be implemented? Each instance of Metascore would have to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to influence each other instance.
