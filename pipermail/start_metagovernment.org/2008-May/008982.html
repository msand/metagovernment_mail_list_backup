A floating score may do less to build consensus, but it does more to  
build synthesis.

In a global community where there can be thousands of resolutions  
about the same subject, I should be able to rate one resolution over  
another. If I can only say yes or no to each resolution, then there is  
no way I can favor a better one over a mediocre one.

You could say that I could only vote for the ones I think are best,  
but in practice that system suppresses new ideas and suppresses  
synthesis, because existing laws will always have very high scores. An  
existing law may be preferable to no law. So why should I have to  
withdraw my vote from the existing law just to promote a new one?

If we don't have variable resolution scores, then the idea of  
synthesis scores (as currently stated on the website) becomes much  
more important. They seem more complex to implement than floating  
scores.
