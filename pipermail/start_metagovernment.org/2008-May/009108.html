<PRE>I, like everybody else,
is very much time constrained.
So I'll be brief.

I agree with Ed that mailing list are not the perfect (or even good) medium.
And I agree that the wiki is better.
Still I think we should couple the wiki with a simple discussion board.
Nothing fancy for now. Any will do from my part. Later we can move to a
slash system, and later to a slash system of our own implementation that we
can then start tweaking.

What we REALLY have to avoid is to open up the wiki, while keeping up the
mailing list, thus creating a double standard between people who are in one
but not in the other.

So I would suggest to:
-open up the wiki,
-install immediatly a discussion board,
-stop using the mailing list, and make the the archive open.

By the way, due to the positive support about the mindmap, I went back and I
am REreading the whole past discussion and putting it in much more detail in
the mindmap. RIght now I am through at half of the april file. But I iwll
not have time to work on it for today. So I just wanted to announce it. If I
get stuck I shall send whatever I have reached and ask if anyone is willing
to continue the work.

</I>&gt;<i> First, I do not see &quot;vast support&quot; for opening up. If we are to count
</I>&gt;<i> the (now) 15 members of the list, a small percentage has spoken in
</I>&gt;<i> favor of opening the list. So how do we define a quorum? How many

</I>&gt;<i> Both I and Aur suggested using a significant percentage of people who

</I>&gt;<i> seem realistic. Clearly this is a central issue we need to define for
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My strongest reason for objecting to opening the list is one of
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis. I very much want this group to open up, but I do not think
</I>&gt;<i> that e-mail is an appropriate mechanism for large-scale participation.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not like a typical list server where one can only read
</I>&gt;<i> selected threads: in order to keep up with the project, one really
</I>&gt;<i> needs to read almost all the messages on the list. Wider participation
</I>&gt;<i> means more list traffic, which means more reading for everyone, which
</I>&gt;<i> can result in *less* participation by several valuable members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, I propose that we open up the wiki &lt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; soon but not immediately. (The main obstacle right now for me is
</I>&gt;<i> time: I just need to spend a few hours studying how to properly secure
</I>&gt;<i> MediaWiki, and I have not yet had those hours. I intend/hope to have
</I>&gt;<i> it secure by June 7.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is why I believe the wiki is superior:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Discussion can be expansive, yet people can keep up with topics of
</I>&gt;<i> interest. Instead of everyone having to read every single post, people
</I>&gt;<i> can simply track the areas of the wiki that interest them (and/or use
</I>&gt;<i> MediaWiki's other tracking mechanisms). We simply have to be careful
</I>&gt;<i> to wikilink where appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Everyone can introduce themselves in a push manner, instead of
</I>&gt;<i> pull. That is, people can simply post a user profile as I will be
</I>&gt;<i> doing shortly at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Wiki's are vastly superior to list servers at promoting
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration. A list server is inherently discussion-oriented, and
</I>&gt;<i> thus leads to dispute. A wiki is inherently collaborative and leads to
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis and consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The wiki is more conducive to inclusion and participation. If we
</I>&gt;<i> open up the list server archives, then a dedicated person such as
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro will be able to sift through the postings, but most people will
</I>&gt;<i> simply balk at the wall of messages. A wiki, however, is much easier
</I>&gt;<i> to get started in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another objection I had to opening up the list server was that we do
</I>&gt;<i> not yet have a formal organization, However, I am starting to
</I>&gt;<i> formulate a way we might be able to proceed without any formal
</I>&gt;<i> organization, even if we have financial needs. I am not sure I even
</I>&gt;<i> want that, but I think it is worth exploring. I will present more on
</I>&gt;<i> that later.
</I>&gt;<i>
