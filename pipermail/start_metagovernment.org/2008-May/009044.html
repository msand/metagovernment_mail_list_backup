<PRE>I also think a user should be able to summarize the legislation for
the community, and debate whether the summaries accurately represent
the entire law -- ie, in case there is some objectionable earmark
buried in the legalese that the summary neglected to mention.

Ideally, the summary makes reference to the main document,
facilitating verification.

That way people can vote without having to read the whole darn thing.
And, those who do bother to read all or part of the legalese can
summarize usefully for the rest.

Thoughts on this?
