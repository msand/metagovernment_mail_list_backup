This is another reason to consider using user scores as a weighting  
factor: it solves the issue of anonymity.

Imagine a scenario something like this. Anyone can create as many  
accounts as they wish, but a new account starts with a User Score of  
0.001. If that person verifies their identity in some way and claims  
that account as being representative of their real identity, then  
their User Score gets multiplied by 1000 (i.e., it jumps to a value of  
1, plus or minus whatever scores they have received so far).

So people can make anonymous accounts and post from them when/if they  
see a need, but they are incentivized to set up and use non-anonymous  
accounts.
