You are right, I didn't argue for it. I will write my argument in the
design document. Basically, it's twofold:
 * Keeping it all in the same place
 * Easy to write tools that play with the data
My precedent is wikipedia.

&gt;<i>  You reference the unix philosophy but then go on to use DVCS for something which

</I>
Is there anything against this in the unix philosophy?

You sent me to reread the &quot;unix philosophy&quot; essay (I needed to refresh
my memory anyway) and there was nothing against it there.

I guess old-timer unix philosophy would have supported using a
directory hierarchy as a database, but then we would have to implement
a VCS anyway, and unix philosophy is all pro-tool reuse (even in
non-conventional ways).

&gt;<i>  Anyway, if all data is local, we won't need any javascript to make
</I>&gt;<i>  things feel snappy,
</I>
We will. The screen that lets you browse through a revision tree has
to feel much snappier than possible with no-JS HTML, even if the
server is local. The time to render the whole DOM is too much latency.

&gt;<i>  so I'd go with the browser based UI for browsing the contents of the
</I>&gt;<i>  repository.
</I>&gt;<i>  Interaction with other repos and configuration might be more intuitive with a
</I>&gt;<i>  local UI
</I>
Why?



Would you care to move this discussion into comments to the design
document? That would serve the double purpose of also testing out my
ideas about storing a discussion in a DVCS.
