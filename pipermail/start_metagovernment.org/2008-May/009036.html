<PRE>Browsers are well suited for displaying documents, you can have the
discussion open in one tab and the legislation open in another.
Clicking on a URL doesn't force you to switch to a different application.

99% of the time, the user will be reading rather than browsing the
revision tree, and even that should feel pretty fast. What kind of
ultra snappy reaction (better than the 200ms or less, that it will
take to reload a page from a local file) do we really need? Certainly
for a prototype, I would say this is overkill.

I suggest a simple web server, extending the existing one in mercurial,
with additional views of the repo, specific to metascore. Some work
has been done in mercurial for this, upon which we can build. I would
suggest we keep this interface read only for now, which has the added
benefit of allowing anybody to set up a server to view a repo, without
having to worry about user restrictions.

The wxWidgets UI is primarily intended as a fancy configuration editor
and frontend for hg operations. It would help interact with other
repositories of the community, manage PGP-Keys and configure the
users metascore filter. These are tasks, I see a local widget based UI being
more suited to than a web interface.
