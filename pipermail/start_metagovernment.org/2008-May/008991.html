This is a tech experiment. It is not supposed to be intuitive. What my
idea of metascore is is exactly *an interface on top of mercurial that
would make it intuitive for this use (which isn't mercurial's intended
use)* (well, actually on top of git, but the differences are
minor...). But we will learn from it a lot of things about how to make
Metascore intuitive (and whether this concept for Ms is indeed a good
idea or not).

Yes, you need to install mercurial to participate. You can find the
files in the website I linked to (go to the changeset, click on &quot;file&quot;
near the html file's name, find the link called &quot;raw&quot; and click
that... not very intuitive, took me 8 minutes to find it)... But
please don't. Please make a little effort and participate in my
experiment.

Once you install mercurial, it's a matter of typing one command and
then you just have the files on your computer and can read them and
edit them like any other files.

&gt;<i> For discussion, I am looking for something much more intuitive and
</I>&gt;<i> easy for everyone to follow. I am working on an installation of
</I>&gt;<i> MediaWiki now. Of course, since the front-end is very accessible, the
</I>&gt;<i> back-end is loaded with administrative details. But I hope to have it
</I>&gt;<i> ready for this group later this week, with the eventual goal of having
</I>&gt;<i> it publicly editable quite soon. The wiki may be mostly for the
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment side, while the Metascore side may be OK with something
</I>&gt;<i> a little more geeky.
</I>
This is a good idea for Mg, until an Ms beta is available.

I'd prefer to run Ms over email and revision control, both to gain the
experience and to take advantage of the unique advantages of revision
control.

&gt;<i> Aur, you cite <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A> as a contact address, however
</I>&gt;<i> this is currently a closed list server (see the Administrivia thread).
</I>&gt;<i> Please use <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">contact at metagovernment.org</A> as the point of contact. Or if
</I>&gt;<i> it is directly about the code, you can use &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">source at metascore.org</A>&gt;.
</I>
Nobody outside <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at mg</A> should know about this design document or be
willing to help write it.
