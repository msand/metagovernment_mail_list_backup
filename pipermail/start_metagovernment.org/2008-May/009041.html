This is an IDE for amateur legal code developers.

It should allow a momma or poppa that heard in the news about a
proposed law that is directly related to him to dive right in and
participate in the discussion about it, MAYBE with a bit of help from
his son.

It should be usable from a PC - other systems will get their own
interfaces later if anyone cares enough... That's the beauty of having
the data be in a very open format.
