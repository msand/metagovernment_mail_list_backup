Congratulations; that sounds like a really interesting project, and I  
can certainly see connections to this one.

That seems to be the case for several of the people here. We all have  
other lives to lead and unlike some other open source projects, this  
one does not readily provide tangential money-making scenarios for the  
developers.

I expect many members of the group (including myself) to fade in and  
out as availability allows. I am working on changing part of the  
format so that it will be easier for people to pick up on  
conversations that have been idle for a while. (Basically, I am  
thinking we keep this list for notifications, but move the more  
complex discussions into a wiki. More on that soon.)
