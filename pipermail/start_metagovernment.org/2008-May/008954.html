<PRE> * I only care about the software we build. Any philosophy-of-politics
discussion right now is meaningless as the masses will decide that the
moment we make the tools available, and what they do WILL surprise all
of us, if we judge based on the experience of any social application
of the web to date

 * I don't really like the division you guys are thinking up to
geographic and topical boards. I think one huge lawbook can hold all
the legislation for the planet, with tagging making it easier for
someone to keep track of just legislation relevant to his town or
hobby.

 * I'm still thinking about scoring systems. I'm not sure there's
reason for users to have a personal score - it doesn't make much
sense, in fact, to have someone's vote count more just because other
people liked his suggestions. Maybe the only &quot;score&quot; should be that
given to branches of a proposed law, and that used to decide when and
which branch and revision get merged to the &quot;release&quot; branch. Maybe
also rating comments, but using those ratings just for deciding which
comments to display in the client, not for any math that matters to
the mechanics of lawmaking. An alternative would be that every time I
vote up someone's comment in a law tagged &quot;UK&quot;, &quot;Manchester&quot; and
&quot;restaurant&quot; his rankings in these three tags would be affected
accordingly, as well as his &quot;generic&quot; ranking, and if he does not yet
have a ranking relating to a certain legislation, a fraction of his
generic rating would be used by default until he gets one.

 * When thinking about the software, I strive in this order for:
   * Simplicity of the interface
   * Flexibility of the interface
   * Flexibility of the data model

 * I base my design very closely on DRCSs, and use their terminology -
revision, branch, commit log... you should try working with one before
you read this or you'll need much googling

The data model would be a directory structure of plaintext files under
revision control by a tool like git that allows very cheap branching
and advanced merging.

In the legislations directory you'd have one text file per proposed
law (of course, in the &quot;release&quot; branch there would only be those of
accepted versions of laws).
This text file would contain a lightly-marked-up law. There would be
markup for a comment box.
At first I thought about markup for user-id and crypto-sig for every
sequence of text, but then I realised:
1) It would work for comments, since they are not meant to be edited,
but for legislation - say I write a sentence, sign it, then you fix a
typo, my sig is now unverifiable in the latest revision
2) The data is already there in the revision history, so instead of
duplicating data, lets have the client traverse the whole history when
it displays a file, and remember what was written by whom (and verify
the crypto signatures which would be given in the commit log)
On second thought,

There would also be markup for voting, that is comprised of a line
containing SSN of voter, rank given by voter and a crypto signature of
the string legislationname-branchname-revisionnumber-rankgiven. That
means, of course, that a revision's initial score is that of the
revision before it - which is in my opinion a correct behavior. We
COULD have the engine reduce a tiny bit of score for each new
revision, to make it harder to jump-on-the-bandwagon with a tiny
change and have YOUR version selected over the one everyone voted for
by merit of a handful votes.

Special attention should be given to how legislations are tagged,
since otherwise it would be easy to game the system - you branch an
obscure legislation, tag it with a thousand tags, vote for it and have
your friends do so too, and suddenly your score in so many tags is
up...

In the users directory you'd have one file per social security number
of a user, with a plaintext templated file that has the user's
rating(s), bio and userpage (like in wikipedia), perhaps also public
key (should this be stored elsewhere? I haven't thought through the
security aspects of this thoroughly).

The interface would be a program that can do the pushing-pulling of
data to/from other computers, could do the maths and calculate scores
and decide when something is ripe for inclusion in &quot;release&quot; and
automatically send it there, could verify all the crypto sig
correctness and the integrity of all the data, could handle voting and
could show a legislation tree as follows:
 * at each moment it shows one revision. The text is color coded for
different authors and hovering the mouse on a passage shows who wrote
it and when. Comments can be folded and unfolded.
 * a passage can be selected and its history summarized in a timeline
that can be scrolled to quickly see how it had grown (animated)
 * a tree is shown, similar to the timeline, that can be moved through
to quickly and animatedly browse different revisions and branches of
the legislation
 * maybe there should be markers of fading visibility to indicate
recently deleted passages
 * one can start editing at any point and the interface will
automatically crypto-sign the edit and submit it (of course, an easy
option to first branch the legislation should exist)

other features would be ability to browse user profiles and userpages
and write there, but that is about the same things.


This is it. There is no step four. I am astounded by how simple this
all is once written down :) This makes me very happy, I thought it
would be a much harder thing to implement. The math should be given
thought that I didn't, but except for that my design probably works.
