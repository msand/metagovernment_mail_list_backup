<PRE>&gt;<i> Something about going public, you have heard me asking if we want to go
</I>&gt;<i> public,
</I>&gt;<i> but my position on this is is that we (you) should have gone public ages
</I>&gt;<i> ago.
</I>&gt;<i> I see this as a requirement of the transparency.
</I>&gt;<i> And I find that the project is loosing a lot in credibility (and integrity)
</I>&gt;<i> by not having started as public.
</I>
I agree, and  I'm not sure everybody here is quite aware of how
urgent it is to open up, simply because we haven't been in the
position of somebody from the &quot;outside&quot;.

So I'll make a case for opening up, addressing the concerns that
Ed mentioned in a previous post.

&gt;<i> Everyone who expresses an interest is invited to join the list,
</I>&gt;<i> so there is no pre-filtering mechanism.
</I>
The very fact that we require somebody to write us an email before
we let them join, gives the impression, that we are an exclusive
club. Even if we aren't keeping anybody out, that isn't apparent
for somebody new. From their point of view, we could just as well be
ignoring everybody. So effectively, we are pre-filtering. Who knows
how many valuable members we have lost, because people couldn't see
what we were doing, and thus felt no inclination to join.

&gt;<i> But while we are still such a small group, I like having some
</I>&gt;<i> individual contact with people before they join the list so that
</I>&gt;<i> I can ensure that they will introduce themselves.
</I>
Of course it's nice to know who you're dealing with, and I would
hope that every new member would introduce themselves before
writing to the mailing list. I think this is something we can
encourage through the presidents each of us has made so far.
Most people who want to join a community, try to follow the customs
if they want to be accepted, so I don't think it's that much of a
problem. All we have to do, is state our customs, and what is
expected of new members.
See: <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/growth.html#codifying-tradition">http://www.producingoss.com/en/growth.html#codifying-tradition</A>

And even if they don't, why should we judge a member for anything
other than their contribution? Even if they don't introduce
themselves, it should still become evident who that person is,
from their behaviour on the mailing list.

&gt;<i> The other reasons for keeping it closed were to control spam
</I>Maybe this can help:
<A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/mailing-lists.html#spam-prevention">http://www.producingoss.com/en/mailing-lists.html#spam-prevention</A>

I'm aware that this is a slight burden for you Ed, and I agree we
should wait to open up, before you find the time to set up a spam
filter.

&gt;<i> and to provide a bit of identity protection for members of the
</I>&gt;<i> list during this fragile startup stage.
</I>
I think we're passed the fragile stage and know each other more or
less, and think we could handle a certain influx of new members. I
can hardly imagine somebody barging in here and trying to dictate
how we proceed, with any success.
See: <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/setting-tone.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/setting-tone.html</A>
Concerning Identity protection, all I can say, is that this is an
open source project, and nobody has to reveal their identity. For
all I know, everybody here could be talking under an alias, so I
don't think that is much of a concern.

&gt;<i> And at some point I would like to make the wiki public, which will
</I>&gt;<i> then also bring the whole world into the project. But I tend to be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about that sort of move until we have a critical mass
</I>&gt;<i> within the group.
</I>In that case, we should at least define, in what state the wiki has
to be, before we open it up, so we have a goal to work towards.
Actually I think it would be enough to state those goals clearly,
in order to open the wiki. Once they are stated, the world can
participate in implementing them.

&gt;<i> In any event, in the past day three more people have expressed
</I>&gt;<i> interest and one of them has asked to join the list, so you should be
</I>&gt;<i> hearing from them soon.
</I>Again, how many people Didn't we here from, because their impression
was, that we were a closed off group? A new member might want to get
an impression of the people on the mailing list, before she formally
introduces herself, and that is currently not possible. Asking to join
is already to some extent, a commitment for a potential new member. Not
everybody may be willing to make that commitment, without first finding
out who is in the community.

Finally I would like to say, that we will eventually open up the list,
the question is only when. If we still want to keep it closed, please
state what has to happen, for the list to be opened.


Manuel
