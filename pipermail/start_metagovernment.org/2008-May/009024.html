<PRE>Back in the day, when command lines were replaced by windows, UI was exactly
that: User Interfaces. These days, the industry prefers the term &quot;User
eXperience&quot; to describe the environment in which the application is being
used. My point isn't to correct anyone from typing &quot;UI,&quot; as the term still
applies to all the buttons and windows on desktop; but, for our discussion,
I believe it is just as important to consider the &quot;user environment&quot; as it
is to discuss the code.

The first thing that comes to mind is the necessity of both mobile and
public computing (which includes ATMs &amp; kiosks as well as library
terminals). This means that iPod interfaces aren't secondary considerations,
but just as critical to include everyone without a personal laptop. For
example, the medical application I'm currently working on is primarily meant
to run in a cross-platform browser. However, as the product must also be
accessible through a mobile device, I designed a highly &quot;modular&quot; UI that
displays a certain number of &quot;blocks&quot; depending on the size of the screen.

So my question is: how do we envision Metascore as an aspect of people's
lives? Is this a Microsoft Visual Studio meant for &quot;hardcore legal code
developers,&quot; a social network for people to connect with others in their
community, or an account manager that provides access to all the laws and
finances in their district? With all the talk of Wiki it sounds as though
we're designing an enormous law book that people can use, in part or whole,
in their own community.

</I>&gt;<i> are a few advantages to text over a binary database format:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Plaintext plays better with the DVCS, especially:
</I>&gt;<i>  * Delta storage means much smaller footprint
</I>&gt;<i>  * Merging works (working with files that can't be merged and change
</I>&gt;<i>   often, in a DVCS, is a nightmare, which means we would otherwise have
</I>&gt;<i>   had to write a tool to merge databases)
</I>&gt;<i> - Generic tools that exist on every developer's computer, specifically
</I>&gt;<i>  a DVCS and a text editor, are sufficient to read and manipulate the
</I>&gt;<i>  entire data model, thus making the data independent of
</I>&gt;<i>  Metascore. This has many advantages, like being able to debug, to
</I>&gt;<i>  validate the data and to participate in a discussion from a computer
</I>&gt;<i>  where you cannot install Metascore.
</I>&gt;<i> - It is much easier for the power user to automate tasks and for the
</I>&gt;<i>  developer to create scripts and tools that manipulate the data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, it helps make the data independent from Metascore, which
</I>&gt;<i> is a 'very' good thing.
