<PRE>Communities will inevitably form around tags. Whether or not we
make them an explicit entity in the system or not. If all legislation
concerning a village gets a specific tag, then everybody in that
community will notice it, effectively gathering the community
around that tag. The community is there, the only difference, is
that we might not make that explicit in the system. The
community might even go so far as writing statement papers,
and letting it be signed with the PGP-Keys of its members,
without any explicit support from the system. They just claim to
be that entity. If this is the case, what kind of support do they
even need, that we should offer?

I'm not sure where the idea of scoring users came from, I was
thinking more along the lines, of scoring their contributions. If
somebody writes or edits legislation, which is accepted, and
participates in a discussion, where others recognize her
contributions. We might compute an aggregate user score out
of those scores, if seems useful, but I would rather have
every contribution scored by its merit, rather than indirectly
rating it by rating a user.

If filtering is something we offer users, to help them cope with
the load of information in the system. They can tweak their
personal filter and use information provided by the scoring
system, however they see fit. As is stated on the website, this
will be sort of like the system used on slashdot, at least in
principle, although obviously much can be tweaked here. Even
so, the system there works surprisingly well, given its simplicity,
maybe because of that, I'm not sure.

The biggest problem with the slashdot system that I see, is that
it uses a chronicle order for comments. That is the messages
written first are read first and somebody may never read the
most insightful comment to the story, if it comes up late in the
discussion. Threads should of course be held together, but
disjoint threads should be ordered by relevance. I'm not sure
how well this will work in practice though, I haven't seen it
implemented anywhere.

Users should also be encouraged to read and rate threads that
are new, or have received little visibility, so every message
receives a minimal amount of rating. The rating mind you, is not
of the form, &quot;I agree with what is said in this message&quot;,
although that might also be an option, but rather, &quot;I think this is
worth reading/a valuable thread for this discussion&quot;.
