</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not understanding why we need this? When you say

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is an intriguing concept!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, here are some ideas on how it might work:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All messages, keys, files or resources in general, are
</I>&gt;<i> stored on the network. That is, they are replicated across
</I>&gt;<i> multiple nodes, which serve the resources they have to
</I>&gt;<i> clients that request them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Or the distributed revision control system way: every client has it ALL.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All resources have a name and hash, ensuring that a
</I>&gt;<i> receiver can verify the integrity of a resource, no matter
</I>&gt;<i> which source it came from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Handled by DRCS.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, every resource may have any number of tags,
</I>&gt;<i> referencing a revision, bill, law, community, or general topic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every member of a community has a PGP-Key with which
</I>&gt;<i> messages can be signed and encrypted. This enables resources
</I>&gt;<i> to be made available to a user and just that user, by
</I>&gt;<i> encrypting them with his public key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
 Signing them, you mean.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Votes can be held anonymously, by allowing tokens to be
</I>&gt;<i> sent from a central authority, to all members of the
</I>&gt;<i> community. The vote and token are encrypted together with,
</I>&gt;<i> the public key of the authority. Votes are then sent to
</I>&gt;<i> this authority, which is the only one who can read them.
</I>&gt;<i> Results are published publicly, and are verifiable by
</I>&gt;<i> every user. So long as the authority can be trusted not
</I>&gt;<i> to track which tokens were sent to which users, this
</I>&gt;<i> system will be anonymous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why do we need anonymous votes? Forgetting the fact that it is impossible in
a non-public ballot (network sniffing), I don't see any need for it in our
system. On the contrary, in a system where every citizen has the power of a
senator, I think every citizen's votes should be made just as public.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Note: This does not solve the problem of political
</I>&gt;<i> persecution, since we have no control over who may be
</I>&gt;<i> forcing somebody to vote a certain way. If this is a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, votes should be held in a traditional pen and
</I>&gt;<i> paper fashion, since only a voting booth in a public
</I>&gt;<i> setting, can guarantee that protection.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Police covers political persecution.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Servers aggregate, index and cache the resources available
</I>&gt;<i> on the net. They provide scoring for messages, based on
</I>&gt;<i> the data they receive from users and provide faster access
</I>&gt;<i> to the data of the community, than if all information had
</I>&gt;<i> to be retrieved from different nodes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pros:
</I>&gt;<i>    - Scales very well with community size
</I>&gt;<i>    - No need for servers (although they provide helpful
</I>&gt;<i>      services and much better performance)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Less Administration overhead
</I>&gt;<i>    - All data is available on the net and can be independently
</I>&gt;<i>      verified by every member of the community
</I>&gt;<i>    - Very secure against malicious users
</I>&gt;<i> Cons:
</I>&gt;<i>    - More complex to implement and understand
</I>&gt;<i>    - Potentially slower than a client server solution
</I>&gt;<i>    - Requires dedicated client software, rather that just
</I>&gt;<i>      a standard browser or e-mail client.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Client software must be made for every device
</I>&gt;<i>    - Accessibility issues
</I>&gt;<i>    - Potential to be spammed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nothing can be spammed in a system where nothing is anon, at least not more
than once - as spamming users WILL face consequences and you cannot spam
without revealing your true identity in a way that cannot be detected with
100% precision (by verifying signatures).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats as far as I can think right now. Much more to be thought
</I>&gt;<i> out here.
</I>&gt;<i>
