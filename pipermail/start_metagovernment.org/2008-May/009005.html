<PRE>Hi,

I don't like it. I don't feel there's any merit to scores that say &quot;I
half support this decision&quot;. For such a small group, even for
beta-testing, I'd support a system where you need X% of the members to
vote &quot;+&quot; and 0% of the members to vote &quot;-&quot;, with no time limit (it is
decided the moment X% voted &quot;+&quot; and all &quot;-&quot; votes, if any, were
already removed, provided that there were at least 72 hours to comment
on the latest revision).

But
 * You were the first to offer a system,
 * It achieves the purpose of consensus based decision making
 * There's always a third suggestion that's better than the second,
and if we open this we will never decide on how to decide
 * A system similar to my own is already in testing in my design
document's writing process
 * This system doesn't protect itself, so we can try other systems
after we get a feel for how this one works

So I feel it makes lots of sense to agree to your suggestion.

I propose a change, and that is that ALL negative votes are weighted
x10 (otherwise it is a majority rule decision process with veto rights
for everyone, not a consensus decision process).

However, with or without the amendment, you have my
*********
+10
*********
I am fully behind you on this.

It will be interesting to see how this works out.
