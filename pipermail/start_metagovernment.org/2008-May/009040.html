</I>
This is an experiment. You can clone my repo, and if you see that I
don't pull from you, you can say so on the ml and I'll be discredited.
But I'm trying to run an experiment about how well a design can be
done, including discussions, within a version controlled text file,
exploiting version control's advantages (like Attribute).

&gt;<i>  &gt;From the Unix philosophy:
</I>&gt;<i>     Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Mercurial does revision control, and it does that well. You're trying to
</I>&gt;<i>  implement something on top of it, that it obviously isn't suited for.
</I>
I'm using git for VC and that only. Would you say that using pgsql for
writing a discussion system is wrong because pg is a database and not
a bbs?

&gt;<i>  &gt; Wiki systems have proven that a discussion can reasonably be held
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; within a text file under version control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I would say that wikis use discussion pages in the wiki format, not
</I>&gt;<i>  because that is a particularly good format for discussions, but because
</I>&gt;<i>  programmers are lazy and implementing the discussion page just like
</I>&gt;<i>  wiki page is easier to implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The discussions on a wiki can be edited. They are not a reproduction of
</I>&gt;<i>  the actual discussion that has taken place, but are cleaned up over
</I>&gt;<i>  time to only contain relevant information. So the discussion may be held
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;reasonably&quot; well, but I think we need more than that. We're talking
</I>&gt;<i>  hundreds of people writing in one text file. It just seems ridiculous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  That would be fine for making a summary of the decisions that lead to a
</I>&gt;<i>  certain decision, or elaborating legislation, that might otherwise be
</I>&gt;<i>  hard to penetrate. What it isn't suited for, is recording what has
</I>&gt;<i>  actually been said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Pulling and pushing, between repositories, implies an agreement with
</I>&gt;<i>  the contents of them. You are agreeing that certain messages are part
</I>&gt;<i>  of the discussion, and allowing them into you're repo when you pull. In
</I>&gt;<i>  a wiki, this isn't much of a problem because everybody shares the
</I>&gt;<i>  same repo. With a distributed system, this introduces unnecessary
</I>&gt;<i>  overhead.
</I>
&gt;<i>  A repository is fine for legislation, because we are actually evaluating
</I>&gt;<i>  something which we want agreement upon. Discussion however just happens,
</I>&gt;<i>  it's there, no matter what I think of it. People can rate it and ignore
</I>&gt;<i>  it, but it should be recorded and be available to everybody, not just
</I>&gt;<i>  those that happen to pull from a certain repository.
</I>
As I said, the actual use of this system will have to be
central-repository-based or tiered, with people talking to repos that
interface with the central repo. So discussion CAN be sanely held,
just like in a wiki. And even though there are advantages to building
a BBS, there are great advantages to having the same system do
document writing and discussion. You can see that great in wikis. What
it means is that you have ONE LESS SYSTEM TO LEARN when you approach
the software at first.

I really like that discussion will be edited to only show what's
relevant to a branch. Remember that there are branches and multiple
heads and a browser that lets you easily browse the history (unlike
wikipedia, where I think it's very wrong that moving back in time is
so hard). I think it would be a great discussion system, more powerful
than anything we have today for accompanying document writing with
discussion.

If you'd agree to move this discussion to the repo, we can together
test if I'm right (even though the browser that makes it REALLY neat
doesn't exist yet).
