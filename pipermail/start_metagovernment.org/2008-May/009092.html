<PRE>&gt;<i> *** RESOLUTION 1 ***
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>
There seems already to be a lot of support for opening the project up. It is
already pretty open de facto (anyone who wants to join, can) but that's
still a barrier and transparency has its merits in proving that we are (or
at least want to be) what we say we are. Thus, I'm willing to get behind it.
R1+

Resolution 2 strikes me as more difficult to get behind right away, though,
for a couple reasons.
1) The resolution speaks of these things as &quot;customs&quot; when they really
haven't been established as such in the community *yet*. (Pedantic I know,
but we don't want any disagreement between the history and what we claim the
history to be.)
2) What qualifies as &quot;something to show&quot; and being ready for &quot;official
endorsement&quot;? This leaves the idea that I should already have a complete,
&quot;ready to pass into law&quot; resolution before proposing it, which would mean
fudging some of the variables that I know will need more community
discussion before submitting it. Is the correct course of action merely to
do this and then explicitly provide a neutral vote for my own proposal?
Feels kludgy.
3) If there are philosophical discussions going on at all (implied by your
use of &quot;before&quot; and not &quot;rather than&quot;), I think everyone should have a
voice. Of course, there is the astroturfing angle... but I think notability
of a person within the community will be taken into account *by* the
community without needing us to put it into code like this.

- Chris

P.S. For clarity's sake, should we rename the resolution on making
resolutions (the current R1, R1.1,  to being 0, 0.1, &amp;c to keep them from
clashing with this R1 and R2? Having two Resolution 1s confuses things a
tad.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A link from the www.metagovernment.org main page will be set up that

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These community rules would be posted, stating them to be nothing but
</I>&gt;<i> non-binding customs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Every new member should introduce himself, where he comes from,
</I>&gt;<i> what is his occupation and how he relates to the project.
</I>&gt;<i>  * Members of the project are busy people, and care should be taken to
</I>&gt;<i> not waste their time with excessive discussion of unimportant things
</I>&gt;<i> on the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>  * No member holds more power than another, and no member should.
</I>&gt;<i>  * The community strives to be ran the way the metagovernment we

</I>&gt;<i> Since we want to pass this quick, let us not dabble with bureaucracy

</I>&gt;<i> In addition, here is another proposal, independent of the first,
</I>&gt;<i> including opinions of mine that I would love accepted but am not sure
</I>&gt;<i> have as much consensus as those in the first and I'd be less bothered

</I>&gt;<i> These community rules will be posted, in addition to any others and
</I>&gt;<i> with the same disclaimer that they are non-binding customs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * The community favors personal initiatives as a way of action. If
</I>&gt;<i> you want something done, do it and ask for help when you need it, but
</I>&gt;<i> under your flag. When it is at a stage where you already have
</I>&gt;<i> something to show and if you want official endorsement, offer it as a
</I>&gt;<i> resolution.
</I>&gt;<i>  * New members should contribute in actions before they start
</I>&gt;<i> contributing philosophy - where philosophy is the participation in the
</I>&gt;<i> far-fetched discussions and actions is something like helping write
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki, helping with the design of Metascore, helping with gathering
</I>&gt;<i> people and resources for the project, collecting or processing data
</I>&gt;<i> for research, or anything else that would advance the current state of
</I>&gt;<i> the project.
