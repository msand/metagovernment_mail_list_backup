<PRE>Hello Aur,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I have been thinking carefully about your question.
The first thing I would like to point out is that my expertise in in tags.
Not in the scoring system. I know how to set up a tag system, in a way that
similar comments/laws appear near. And in a way that no single person is in
charge.

So IF we have a system that gives a good scoring system, then I can organise
a system to put tags, so that the position emerges, and then I can work to
intersect the two things together.
so that people who get a good score in an area will have their score affect
a neighboring area.

But no, my expertise is not on making a scoring system and a voting system
di per se. On that I am just someone very interested in the question, and
who might have been thinking about the issue, but not more than an amateur.

I think that there is no way that we can get something where people vote, if
we do not let people decide who is in and who is out.
You see, we like it or not, there are meetings where you are not allowed to
go (the closed door meetings),
meetings where you can go but not speak, meetings where you can speak but
not vote. And meetings (or democracies) were you can vote but not speak.

I might not like it, but I have no say over who is going to be the next
president of the US, but living in this world that decision will affect me
indirectly a lot.

It might not feel fair, but this is the nature of things.
Now do you think that US citizen would be willing to have a system that does
permit to people around the world to have an equal saying on who is going to
be the next president of the US?
Com'on.

Giving external people a smaller vote weight is Ed's desperate tentative to
keep everybody in, while letting people still have the impression, or the
knowledge, that in the end no decision will be imposed on them.

So you need to have a system that can start small, that can be used for a
limited community, and such that the people in that community are allowed to
decide how much weight do external people have.

We are here speaking about the 'voting' time. Or the rating time.

Let us suppose that I have a family with a wife and 3 kids. We decide to
organise our family life using MG. So for every issue we write it on the
internet, and we find solutions, and we apply them. I think it would be
ingenuous to hope that we are going to permit to someone on the other side
of the world to dictate to us what we should do. Imagine 6 kids somwhere
else, telling us what we should do, and we would then go and do it? Are you
joking? Or we would have to ask for even more people to join in to balance
them? Where would our personal responsability go? Our actions before words
if we need to get a cometee through half of the world just to decide if the
toilet paper should be white or pink.
So people outside might be able to see, maybe to speak, but of course not to
vote, or at leats their vote would be much much MUCH smaller weighted than
ours.
Something that would have an effect only if we are exactly in balance.

And finally you ask if something is needed 'or' something else is  more
elegant. Hmm?
Generally shorter things are considered more elegant. But elegance comes
after being able to function.



Hope this helped somehow,
Pietro
