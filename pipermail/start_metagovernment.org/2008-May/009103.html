<PRE>R1-, or a -8 on my scale. I support the idea, but prefer a different  
implementation (another reason for a nuanced scoring system and for  
having consensus scores and/or synthesis scores).

First, I do not see &quot;vast support&quot; for opening up. If we are to count  
the (now) 15 members of the list, a small percentage has spoken in  
favor of opening the list. So how do we define a quorum? How many  
people need to be in favor of something before it goes into effect?  
Both I and Aur suggested using a significant percentage of people who  
have participated in the last month, but in retrospect that does not  
seem realistic. Clearly this is a central issue we need to define for  
Metascore to succeed.

My strongest reason for objecting to opening the list is one of  
emphasis. I very much want this group to open up, but I do not think  
that e-mail is an appropriate mechanism for large-scale participation.  
This is not like a typical list server where one can only read  
selected threads: in order to keep up with the project, one really  
needs to read almost all the messages on the list. Wider participation  
means more list traffic, which means more reading for everyone, which  
can result in *less* participation by several valuable members.

Instead, I propose that we open up the wiki &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/</A> 
 &gt; soon but not immediately. (The main obstacle right now for me is  
time: I just need to spend a few hours studying how to properly secure  
MediaWiki, and I have not yet had those hours. I intend/hope to have  
it secure by June 7.)

Here is why I believe the wiki is superior:

1. Discussion can be expansive, yet people can keep up with topics of  
interest. Instead of everyone having to read every single post, people  
can simply track the areas of the wiki that interest them (and/or use  
MediaWiki's other tracking mechanisms). We simply have to be careful  
to wikilink where appropriate.

2. Everyone can introduce themselves in a push manner, instead of  
pull. That is, people can simply post a user profile as I will be  
doing shortly at:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore</A>

3. Wiki's are vastly superior to list servers at promoting  
collaboration. A list server is inherently discussion-oriented, and  
thus leads to dispute. A wiki is inherently collaborative and leads to  
synthesis and consensus.

4. The wiki is more conducive to inclusion and participation. If we  
open up the list server archives, then a dedicated person such as  
Pietro will be able to sift through the postings, but most people will  
simply balk at the wall of messages. A wiki, however, is much easier  
to get started in.

Another objection I had to opening up the list server was that we do  
not yet have a formal organization, However, I am starting to  
formulate a way we might be able to proceed without any formal  
organization, even if we have financial needs. I am not sure I even  
want that, but I think it is worth exploring. I will present more on  
that later.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Every new member should introduce himself, where he comes from,
</I>&gt;<i> what is his occupation and how he relates to the project.
</I>&gt;<i> * Members of the project are busy people, and care should be taken to
</I>&gt;<i> not waste their time with excessive discussion of unimportant things
</I>&gt;<i> on the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> * No member holds more power than another, and no member should.
</I>&gt;<i> * The community strives to be ran the way the metagovernment we

</I>&gt;<i> with the same disclaimer that they are non-binding customs:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The community favors personal initiatives as a way of action. If
</I>&gt;<i> you want something done, do it and ask for help when you need it, but
</I>&gt;<i> under your flag. When it is at a stage where you already have

</I>&gt;<i> resolution.
</I>&gt;<i> * New members should contribute in actions before they start
</I>&gt;<i> contributing philosophy - where philosophy is the participation in the
</I>&gt;<i> far-fetched discussions and actions is something like helping write
