<PRE>Thanks for sharing this Aur,
Could we get a forum/mailing list combo up and running. ie. a mailing list which publishes posts to a forum (a forum which posts to a mailing list according to member's email preferences - messages, digests, allow opt in/out of threads etc)?
Paul

ps. I've not managed to keep up with recent posts due to a number of competing demands on my time. But I hope to keep dipping in and out over the next few weeks until I can dedicate a bit more time.

Subject : [Start] My discussion with Rob Peters

Hi all,

I will paste here a long discussion between me and Rob Peters, one of
the commentors on the Sourceforce board.


It is of some interest to the group, especially his first message. My
messages are less interesting since my positions are already well
known.


Warning again: you don't have to read this and it is long.

Hello Peter,

I am Aur Saraf, a contributor to the Metascore project.

As I believe in actions before words and in putting something out
there, I've started designing a possible Metascore implementation
(different in many ways from Ed's ideas, most of them meant to either
simplify the interface or make it quicker to build).

There is a bit of design work left and then we can start playing with
the implementation until we have something that works. In the
meantime, the design document development process itself is used as
testing ground for all the ideas that can be tested without requiring
me to first write code.

Want to help?

Hello, Aur.

Thank you for your letter.

As you know from my posts on SourceForge, I am intrigued by this
project and by what it is attempting to accomplish. However, I have
some grave concerns that will keep me from being involved in it.

You are attempting, with MetaGovernment, to accomplish something that
has not been successfully accomplished in over 200 years: create a new
type of government. The only &quot;new&quot; governments humans have created
since the French Revolution / American Revolution is Communism, and
that has been largely disastrous. I hope that you can do better!

I think you need to take a long and hard look at why MetaGovernment
currently has no discussion forum. I think the lack of one is fatal,
and may already have doomed your project. You claim that
MetaGovernment (may I abbreviate that to MG?) is about the wisdom of
the masses forming policy, but your lack of a forum indicates that you
do not truly believe this.

In my opinion, your success lies in the software development term of
&quot;eating your own dog food&quot;. This means to use your product to develop
your product.

As an example, imagine you would like to build a hammer. You have no
tools at all, and have nothing to pound the hot iron with, so at first
you can only make an iron bar. However, you can now use that iron bar
to pound the hot iron of your next hammer. This second hammer is much
better than an iron bar and allows you to create a much better third
hammer. As each hammer improves, they allow you to eventually craft
exquisite hammers that are unsurpassed. Now, to apply this to
MetaScore (MS), is it true that the best decisions will be reached
only when as many people as possible have had a chance to add their
wisdom? Do you really believe that? Then surely MS itself, being a
fantastically complex and challenging group of decisions would benefit
from having as many people as possible contributing. If MS will work
to create good government, surely it will work to create a good MS,
yes?

It is true that MetaScore does not exist yet, but forums exist, and
they are the basis of MS, are they not? Surely having one is
therefore better than not having one. And as people come and learn
and contribute, surely the advances to MS can be used on that forum
and will benefit the project. After all, if the advances made by MS
do not benefit the community that is developing MS, then they are
useless and need to be changed. Surely the best possible thing that
could be done to advance the purposes of a fully functioning MS is a
partially functioning MS! Remember that if you have no hammer, you
cannot make a beautiful hammer unless you first make a poor hammer.

Therefore, I think your best chance of success lies in implementing
the most important part of MS immediately and open a forum to begin to
gather the wisdom of how best to build MS. With that single step,
which could be done by you overnight, you have moved yourself more
than half way to your goal.

Then, as advances and features are added to MS, apply them immediately
to the MS forum. Each advance will amplify your efforts, making
progress faster and faster. How do I know that will happen? Because
if it doesn't happen, MS is broken! It must happen. It is the
purpose of MS. If progress does not improve, you are doing it wrong
and must change it.

Discussing ratings systems and legislation creation algorithms is all
well and good, but you're missing the forest for the trees.
MetaGovernment is showing a fundamental disconnect from the ideas it
espouses.

I honestly believe that if you open a forum on the MG web site, you
will have more help than you will know what to do with. Many people
are dissatisfied with the way they are governed, and would love to
help. The current &quot;Members-Only&quot; mentality of MG will do nothing but
ensure MG's continuing insignificance.

I apologize for the length of this letter. I am certainly willing
(and eager) to discuss anything I have written here, and even if I
cannot convince you to open a free and open forum immediately, I hope
you will at least consider my words and see if there is any wisdom in
them.

Kind regards (and hopeful of your success),
Rob Peters


Hello Rob,

First of all, may I forward this letter to the Mg mailing list?


Our decision to keep the list closed stems from a few arguments made
by others. Myself, I don't care much, as long as *everyone* who asks
to join gets an account. It could be changed quite quickly - the only
reason it wasn't yet is that there's no consensus on either option and
nobody on the list cares enough.

Soon, a wiki will be opened on the site and most discussion will be
moved to it - making the discussion as public as can be.



Iterative design that starts from a forum system is, IMHO, the wrong
way to go for Ms. The forum features are far less important than the
DVCS features, and the backend of a forum is a bad idea for a system
that should be as transparent and as trustworthy as Ms should. I am
iteratively designing a possible Ms away from a DVCS: First, I set up
a DVCS repo for discussion of my design, and the format of the
discussion is approximately the format of the datafiles that my design
proposes for Ms, but instead of software doing the bookkeeping, we
designers are doing it manually. Soon I will start writing hooks for
the DVCS to do some of the bookkeeping, and eventually we will end up
with a prototype of the described software - which all the while will
be in continuous testing because it will be used to write the design
document.

I don't believe in design-by-comittee - I think the best designs come
when one individual has a vision and only accepts contributions from
others that he thinks fit his initial vision. That is why I started a
design effort for Ms that I write mostly alone and invited anyone
interested to contribute, to fork or to compete against it with their
own design effort.


My issues right now are things like:
* How to display a living DVCS revision tree as a discussion in a way
that would be easily navigable
* How to filter out irrelevant discussion effectively
* How to store ratings in a DVCS in a way that would be lightweight
to store and calculate but also lightweight to verify


But mostly, I am awaiting some outside contributions because I think
I've been working too far away from the community.


Please have a look at the design document that I linked, I think
you'll find it to be a great exercise in &quot;eat your own dog food&quot;.


If you join the ml, you can try and convince the other guys to open it
up (we prefer an ml to a forum because it is much more accessible and
much easier to use well), though I think it's better to concentrate
efforts on making the wiki ready for public consumption.

Thank you for your reply, Aur.

Please feel free to forward my original message (and this one, should
you so choose) to your mailing list.

The thing that makes a DVCS a poor choice in my mind is that it is not
easy to set up or use for the non-technical. For example, I wouldn't
feel comfortable setting up the software necessary to contribute to
the DVCS you are currently using (which is why I will likely continue
to communicate only to you), and I have built my own computers and do
some coding in Python and Java. If I am hesitant, how will the
non-technical contribute? How will the statisticians and
mathematicians and political scientists and bureaucrats whose insight
Metagovernment so desperately needs contribute?

I also encourage you to reconsider some of your presuppositions for
not using a simple forum. You claim that the level of transparency
and trust that are currently offered by forums not sufficient. Is
this true? Is the number of people you are excluding from your
project because they do not know how to (or are unwilling to) install
a DVCS greater than or less than the number of people you are losing
because they are not satisfied with the level of transparency or trust
offered by a standard forum?

As an aside, I find your aversion to &quot;design-by-committee&quot; curious. I
thought that was the point of Metagovernment? Every one with a say.
You are certainly correct, however, that a single, inspired leader can
accomplish a great deal.

I see the whole Metagovernment process as being very evolutionary.
Many designs and ideas will be put forward, and only a few will
survive. I therefore think a good use of the Metagovernment
community's time might be to design a system that allows this
evolutionary process to happen as quickly as possible (which is why I
find the current exclusivity so discouraging). Metagovernment has
never been done before, so I don't know how it's possible for anyone
to say how it should be done. History shows over and over that only
repeated failure will give us the knowledge we need to accomplish a
task of this magnitude. We need to allow these failures to happen as
quickly as possible.

I think the simplest and quickest way to get started is simply open a
forum. Then, I would add to each user account a &quot;prestige&quot; value and
give each member one vote per day (votes cannot be stockpiled). Votes
for your forum posts add or subtract from your prestige. The amount a
vote adds or subtracts from your prestige is determined by the
prestige of the person who casts it. If you have a high prestige and
you vote for me, my prestige climbs higher than if a low-prestige
votes for (or against) me. All my posts have a rating that is
determined by my prestige. Viewers of the forum may filter posts
based on their prestige rating. Simple. The basis (a forum) has been
refined already and can be set up in less than 10 minutes using any
one of dozens of excellent software packages. The rest has been
mostly done by Slashdot and their system can be used as a template. I
would think a competent programmer could have the whole thing sorted
out in a week.

Having said all that, I do wish you the best in your plans, Aur. I
enjoy our current discussion and hope it continues. I have other
projects that must take my free time, but what you are doing is of
such surpassing importance that I imagine I will keep my fingers in
this pie as long as I am able.

Kind regards,
Rob
