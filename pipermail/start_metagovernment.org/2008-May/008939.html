<PRE>&gt;<i>  particular community the force of law? That is, how can a government
</I>&gt;<i>  have the ability to enforce laws if participation in the government is
</I>&gt;<i>  voluntary?
</I>
Participation may be voluntary, but if the jurisdiction of a government is
uncontested, they should have the ability to enforce their laws. Same as
with every other government right now. If you live in a certain jurisdiction,
you have to abide by the laws there, or try to change them.

If multiple communities have power over a certain area, it should be made
clear, which is the higher government body. If their legislation conflict
one another they should of course resolve that issue, for clarities sake.
In any case, it should be clear, which community has more authority.

That of course doesn't answer your question of who has authority, it just
assumes there is a hierarchy of communities with authority. Establishing
that hierarchy will be something we may help with, but ultimately I would
say, that is essentially a question the respective communities have to
solve. Be it through dialog, forming a new community or outright war.
I'm not sure we can do much about this.
