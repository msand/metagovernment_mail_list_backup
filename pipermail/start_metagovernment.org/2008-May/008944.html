Indeed, here are some ideas on how it might work:

All messages, keys, files or resources in general, are
stored on the network. That is, they are replicated across
multiple nodes, which serve the resources they have to
clients that request them.

All resources have a name and hash, ensuring that a
receiver can verify the integrity of a resource, no matter
which source it came from.

Additionally, every resource may have any number of tags,
referencing a revision, bill, law, community, or general topic.

Every member of a community has a PGP-Key with which
messages can be signed and encrypted. This enables resources
to be made available to a user and just that user, by
encrypting them with his public key.

Votes can be held anonymously, by allowing tokens to be
sent from a central authority, to all members of the
community. The vote and token are encrypted together with,
the public key of the authority. Votes are then sent to
this authority, which is the only one who can read them.
Results are published publicly, and are verifiable by
every user. So long as the authority can be trusted not
to track which tokens were sent to which users, this
system will be anonymous.

(Note: This does not solve the problem of political
persecution, since we have no control over who may be
forcing somebody to vote a certain way. If this is a
problem, votes should be held in a traditional pen and
paper fashion, since only a voting booth in a public
setting, can guarantee that protection.)

Servers aggregate, index and cache the resources available
on the net. They provide scoring for messages, based on
the data they receive from users and provide faster access
to the data of the community, than if all information had
to be retrieved from different nodes.

Pros:
    - Scales very well with community size
    - No need for servers (although they provide helpful
      services and much better performance)
    - Less Administration overhead
    - All data is available on the net and can be independently
      verified by every member of the community
    - Very secure against malicious users
Cons:
    - More complex to implement and understand
    - Potentially slower than a client server solution
    - Requires dedicated client software, rather that just
      a standard browser or e-mail client.
    - Client software must be made for every device
    - Accessibility issues
    - Potential to be spammed

Thats as far as I can think right now. Much more to be thought
out here.

Manuel
