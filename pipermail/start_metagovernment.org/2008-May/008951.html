<PRE>I don't disagree with simple -- as long as the system is customizable 
(whether internally or externally), then users can do whatever they want 
with it -- provided they have the skills.

I would just suggest that we keep the participants' needs and wants in 
mind (and allow their needs/wants to be decided by consensus) rather 
than impose our vision of government on them.

</I>&gt;<i>     This being said, I think it's important that we not impose *our*
</I>&gt;<i>     view of
</I>&gt;<i>     the ideal government on communities by developing the software in a
</I>&gt;<i>     particular way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Example, if we don't think there should be political parties, we
</I>&gt;<i>     should
</I>&gt;<i>     make this happen by not supporting them (thus, forcing users to
</I>&gt;<i>     adapt to
</I>&gt;<i>     our model of government). Much better would be to leave that
</I>&gt;<i>     decision to
</I>&gt;<i>     the people, to let the decision to have or not have parties be reached
</I>&gt;<i>     in consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It seems to me that the revolutionary concept is the enabling of
</I>&gt;<i>     direct
</I>&gt;<i>     democracy, or any style of participatory government. But these choices
</I>&gt;<i>     shouldn't be forced on communities before they have been made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I do think the conversation of possible implementations is helpful,
</I>&gt;<i>     because if the software is to support a wide range of government types
</I>&gt;<i>     and community types, we will want to consider these communities in
</I>&gt;<i>     building it. To that end, I would make two proposals:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     1) we begin to list the types of communities that might find such a
</I>&gt;<i>     software package useful, and identify any particular needs a community
</I>&gt;<i>     might want, such as:
</I>&gt;<i>        - non-profit/for-profit organization (example: Lake Sunapee
</I>&gt;<i>     Protection Society in NH, US)
</I>&gt;<i>        - a part of an existing government (example: City Transportation
</I>&gt;<i>     Authority)
</I>&gt;<i>        - organizational structure of a political party (example:
</I>&gt;<i>     Democratic
</I>&gt;<i>     party in US)
</I>&gt;<i>        - political party running on platform of direct democracy (example:
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;senator on-line&quot; in Australia)
</I>&gt;<i>        - alumni association of an educational institution
</I>&gt;<i>        - a department within an educational institution (example: Math
</I>&gt;<i>     Department)
</I>&gt;<i>        - metagovernment of a geographical region with force of law
</I>&gt;<i>        - worker's union
</I>&gt;<i>        - shadow-government / polling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     2) set up an on-line survey to solicit information about potential
</I>&gt;<i>     organizations and their members. We might ask what tools their
</I>&gt;<i>     organization might use (example -- do they have a budget), what
</I>&gt;<i>     type of
</I>&gt;<i>     organization it is, what size, how likely to adopt framework, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>     Also,
</I>&gt;<i>     of users, we might ask about likely frequency of participation, their
</I>&gt;<i>     knowledge of encryption, what concerns they may have (security,
</I>&gt;<i>     transparency, lack of trust in a scoring system, etc), what
</I>&gt;<i>     limitations
</I>&gt;<i>     they perceive in the current system of organization, any handicaps we
</I>&gt;<i>     will want to support, etc...  remember that the system not only has to
</I>&gt;<i>     be trustworthy, but it also has to gain the trust of its users, so
</I>&gt;<i>     their
</I>&gt;<i>     initial perceptions matter to some extent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We might want to wait on the second of these, and begin to develop the
</I>&gt;<i>     first internally but, eventually .... this kind of thing might be
</I>&gt;<i>     useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in simple, flexible solutions. I believe that the main enemy 
</I>&gt;<i> of the software developer is featuritis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that if our system is simple enough, it will be able to work 
</I>&gt;<i> the same on any scale (see MediaWiki) and if it is open enough, things 
</I>&gt;<i> like parties can be implemented by helper tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
