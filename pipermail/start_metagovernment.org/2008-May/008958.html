What, is a truck driver's intelligent idea about pistons worth less
than a doctor's? The dream that is driving me to contribute here is
that one day, Locke and Demosthenes (of Ender's Game fame) will rise.
Wonder kids who are smart enough to lead the world into a new era (I'm
19. As a kid, which is up to last year, I never felt kids got enough
respect for their ideas. I think it harms them and I want to fix
that).

So I write &quot;I am not a doctor, but here's a smart idea&quot; and if it IS
smart people vote for it and if it isn't they don't. He writes &quot;I'm a
doctor. It is essential that you vote for THIS because I have
experience and can tell you THIS IS HOW IT GOES IN PRACTICE&quot;. He might
(or might not :P) get more &quot;mob&quot; votes because of that. In practice,
if a really bad idea gets voted, the doctors association will publish
an urgent warning to the public and ask everyone to vote it down. Just
like you have people in wikipedia who spend hours refreshing the
&quot;latest changes&quot; page and fixing spam... I'm betting the jackpot on
there being far more concerned citizens than mischievous citizens.

&gt;<i>  If we create a system in which anyone can participate, then people who
</I>&gt;<i>  participate more in a particular area should(?) have more say in that
</I>&gt;<i>  area. This way, we allow anyone to add their ideas to the betterment
</I>&gt;<i>  of a community, but the active members of the community are the ones
</I>&gt;<i>  whose ideas are most respected.
</I>
Sorry, I just don't see why, and as someone who is building a personal
career as a consultant on fields he never touched before, I STRONGLY
disagree with your logic. I think voting can regulate it all.

&gt;<i>  &gt; * When thinking about the software, I strive in this order for:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;   * Simplicity of the interface
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;   * Flexibility of the interface
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;   * Flexibility of the data model
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  +1!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I think your ideas below are very much on the right track. Clearly I
</I>&gt;<i>  need to learn more about DRCS. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRCS#Distributed_revision_control">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRCS#Distributed_revision_control</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   seems like a nice start, but I'd like to see Git in action to get a
</I>&gt;<i>  feel for it. I looked briefly at <A HREF="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=summary">http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=summary</A>
</I>&gt;<i>   but I do not have enough context in which to understand it.
</I>
Try to use mercurial (which is used in this project, right?) for some
serious lifting... For example, try uploading this design document to
mercurial (I wanted to but don't have mercurial installed and can't
right now), then get a working copy, branch it. fix some things as you
see fit, branch the old to another branch, fix it to strive in a
different direction (for example, one branch for each scoring
method)... Then commit the whole thing. It will drive you crazy, but
when you're done you'll get it quite well.

&gt;<i>  &gt; There would also be markup for voting, that is comprised of a line
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; containing SSN of voter, rank given by voter and a crypto signature of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the string legislationname-branchname-revisionnumber-rankgiven. That
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; means, of course, that a revision's initial score is that of the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; revision before it - which is in my opinion a correct behavior. We
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; COULD have the engine reduce a tiny bit of score for each new
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; revision, to make it harder to jump-on-the-bandwagon with a tiny
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; change and have YOUR version selected over the one everyone voted for
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; by merit of a handful votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This is similar to the idea of thresholding I had proposed for the
</I>&gt;<i>  other side: once something becomes a law, it should take more than a
</I>&gt;<i>  slight change of score to remove it from law again. We don't want laws
</I>&gt;<i>  flapping on and off with every vote.
</I>
Yes, it is... How could I have forgotten that? It is in fact exactly
the same thing, I think.

&gt;<i>  Well, we still need the math to determine a consensus score; that is,
</I>&gt;<i>  at what point does something become a law? This is complicated by the
</I>&gt;<i>  fact that it is an open, inclusive system. If anyone can participate
</I>&gt;<i>  in any community, then what sets the threshold for any particular
</I>&gt;<i>  community? Can it be a floating number based on recent past scores?
</I>&gt;<i>  That is, could it be something like: the top-scoring 1% of all
</I>&gt;<i>  resolutions in a community become laws?
</I>
Lets start from the simplest possible: 90% of votes in favor, at least
1% of the community participates, sends a proposed legislation to
&quot;prerelease&quot;. If after one week at least 90% of the votes are
positive, it is law.

And lets make the math very modular (maybe even scripted) so we can
later experiment with it once the platform exists.

&gt;<i> Some issues I would like to have clarrified:

</I>&gt;<i>  If we imagine the olpc as the most basic system, storage

The interface can work in a mode where it checks-out every file when
needed, I think.

&gt;<i>  2. How specifically do you plan to do interaction with other

</I>
I can see no escape from there being an accepted &quot;main&quot; repo, but
someone else might see that escape later on, and our solution will
already lend itself easily to that escape.

&gt;<i>  3. How do discussions work in this context? How would
</I>&gt;<i>  I write you a message and be sure you pull from a
</I>&gt;<i>  repository which has that message?
</I>
Assuming my simplistic solution, we'll both be updating to/from the
main repo, unless we're a small team in a university or something,
upon which case we already know its enough to update to/from the
faster university mainframe. (Same for city etc').


I think this is ripe enough a design to start playing with code (not
coding! playing with code)... Does anyone disagree?
