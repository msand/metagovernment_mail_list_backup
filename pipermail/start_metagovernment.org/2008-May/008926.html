<PRE>I have mentioned metagovernment to my own community council (one of 3 &quot;Transition Towns&quot; in Scotland which aim to be carbon neutral) and it is something they are keen to investigate when we start generating some more actionable outputs. On that note I would quite like a metagovernment.org email address. I don't have any specific need of it yet but would like to not have to scurry to put one in place when the time comes. Is that possible Ed?

Also can I confirm how others are describing the role we are playing at the moment? I suppose in some senses we are Founding Committee Members or something like that. Again this is probably slightly ahead of time but I don't want to have to quickly figure something out when the time comes.

Paul
