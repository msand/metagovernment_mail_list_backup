</I>&gt;<i> This being said, I think it's important that we not impose *our* view of
</I>&gt;<i> the ideal government on communities by developing the software in a
</I>&gt;<i> particular way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example, if we don't think there should be political parties, we should
</I>&gt;<i> make this happen by not supporting them (thus, forcing users to adapt to
</I>&gt;<i> our model of government). Much better would be to leave that decision to
</I>&gt;<i> the people, to let the decision to have or not have parties be reached
</I>&gt;<i> in consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the revolutionary concept is the enabling of direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, or any style of participatory government. But these choices
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be forced on communities before they have been made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do think the conversation of possible implementations is helpful,
</I>&gt;<i> because if the software is to support a wide range of government types
</I>&gt;<i> and community types, we will want to consider these communities in
</I>&gt;<i> building it. To that end, I would make two proposals:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) we begin to list the types of communities that might find such a
</I>&gt;<i> software package useful, and identify any particular needs a community
</I>&gt;<i> might want, such as:
</I>&gt;<i>    - non-profit/for-profit organization (example: Lake Sunapee
</I>&gt;<i> Protection Society in NH, US)
</I>&gt;<i>    - a part of an existing government (example: City Transportation
</I>&gt;<i> Authority)
</I>&gt;<i>    - organizational structure of a political party (example: Democratic
</I>&gt;<i> party in US)
</I>&gt;<i>    - political party running on platform of direct democracy (example:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;senator on-line&quot; in Australia)
</I>&gt;<i>    - alumni association of an educational institution
</I>&gt;<i>    - a department within an educational institution (example: Math
</I>&gt;<i> Department)
</I>&gt;<i>    - metagovernment of a geographical region with force of law
</I>&gt;<i>    - worker's union
</I>&gt;<i>    - shadow-government / polling
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) set up an on-line survey to solicit information about potential
</I>&gt;<i> organizations and their members. We might ask what tools their
</I>&gt;<i> organization might use (example -- do they have a budget), what type of
</I>&gt;<i> organization it is, what size, how likely to adopt framework, etc. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> of users, we might ask about likely frequency of participation, their
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of encryption, what concerns they may have (security,
</I>&gt;<i> transparency, lack of trust in a scoring system, etc), what limitations
</I>&gt;<i> they perceive in the current system of organization, any handicaps we
</I>&gt;<i> will want to support, etc...  remember that the system not only has to
</I>&gt;<i> be trustworthy, but it also has to gain the trust of its users, so their
</I>&gt;<i> initial perceptions matter to some extent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We might want to wait on the second of these, and begin to develop the
</I>&gt;<i> first internally but, eventually .... this kind of thing might be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I believe in simple, flexible solutions. I believe that the main enemy of
the software developer is featuritis.

I believe that if our system is simple enough, it will be able to work the
same on any scale (see MediaWiki) and if it is open enough, things like
parties can be implemented by helper tools.
