I think it's important to separate the vision for the software from the 
various visions for implementation .. whenever I've spoken about the 
project, I approach it from the software .. while discussing the various 
ways it could be usefully implemented. Obviously the software 
development needs to keep the implementations in mind, but in this area 
I would like to see the software impose as few limitations on possible 
implementations as possible. A community should be able to define itself 
and implement the software in the way it sees most fit for self-governance.

Is this consistent with what others are thinking?
