<PRE>This makes a lot of sense, but pls be aware that not everyone on the
list has an equal degree of programming experience; not everyone knows
what is more feasible and what ideas are not. But, I would nonetheless
agree that we should each probably put together a description of how
we see the site operating so that we can compare each complete vision
to the others and find some sort of common ground between them.

This might be best done in some sort of wiki, so that they are all in
the same place.

Or, should be all be posting to the repository? Do we have a consensus?

&gt;<i> Hi all.

</I>&gt;<i> I want to clarify something, because of an email I received from Manuel.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This thread, as well as two others I opened about my design, deal with
</I>&gt;<i> a design proposal that *I* am writing, that I will want to suggest to
</I>&gt;<i> the community once it is ready, and I hope that there will be other,
</I>&gt;<i> radically different, design proposals written by other people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Because I do not believe in design-by-committee. It is a
</I>&gt;<i> well-known meme in programming circles that design-by-committee
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work. I think the only solution would be for each of us to
</I>&gt;<i> fork his own design document, where he is the sole decider, he is the
</I>&gt;<i> one who has a vision and knows where he is taking the design, and
</I>&gt;<i> others give him feedback and suggestions that he chooses to
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate if they fit with his vision... And when we're all done, we
</I>&gt;<i> all propose our versions as resolutions and try to reach consensus
</I>&gt;<i> about which is best or how to synthesize them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I ask definitive questions, set definitive answers or generally
</I>&gt;<i> act like a know-it-all, I am talking about MY design, for which I have
</I>&gt;<i> a vision that will only be fully expressed in words once I'm done. I
</I>&gt;<i> thought that was apparent because at the beginning of the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> of my design I stated that, and these threads were stated to be about
</I>&gt;<i> it... In other threads I try to be much less benevolent-dictator-like.
</I>&gt;<i> I saw that Manuel has a different design document in the works in his
</I>&gt;<i> repo, and I invite anyone to fork my design and change and finish it
</I>&gt;<i> as he sees fit (and I wouldn't state anything absolute about it, just
</I>&gt;<i> give him friendly suggestions), and would love that to happen as it
</I>&gt;<i> would test my ideas about non-linear discussion/editing that are
</I>&gt;<i> relevant to the final result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sorry if I sounded like I'm taking control of the whole Metascore
</I>&gt;<i> design - in a community that has a goal to be leaderless I don't thing
</I>&gt;<i> that anyone should, and I am definitely not qualified.
