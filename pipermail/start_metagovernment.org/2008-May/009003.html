<PRE>I propose that we begin experimenting on ourselves by using a scoring  
system in our internal communications. My proposal appears between the  
two sets of *****.

RESOLUTION
*****
I propose a slightly less geeky scale than the Apache project (which  
we discussed in a previous thread): that people vote by expressing an  
integer score from -10 to 10. And that unless there is compelling  
reason to do otherwise, scores are accepted for 72 hours. At the end  
of 72 hours, the scores are simply added together, and a positive  
score means approval. To reproduce Apache's veto, I also propose that  
a vote of -10 be tallied as -100. People can express a score with an  
explanation, or simply a score with nothing else. If anyone votes -10,  
then the resolution is stalled until that person can be convinced to  
change their mind (probably by the group changing the resolution in  
some way). A change to the resolution resets the 72-hour clock. Unless  
they say otherwise in their proposal, let us automatically assume that  
an author of a resolution gives it a +10.
*****

We are such a small group that this is overkill: we do not really need  
such a nuanced system. But I think it will be helpful to try it on  
ourselves and see what happens.

So... please give my above proposal a score. Or give an explanation  
why you do not wish to use this system (which I will consider to be a  
-10).
