<PRE>Manuel - I'll try to reword your comments into a form I can work with a bit more easily. Let me know if these are OK.
* every member of the community is not on the same level when it comes to deciding what
direction the community is going to take.
* we tend to have a &quot;view&quot; of what government is and how it works, which excludes other more fit for purpose alternatives.
* those who have gained position and status within a hierarchy often have to work hard to defend their role from various threats and are very likely to defend it against &quot;dilution&quot; to a more equitable system.
* we do not have convincing arguments and case studies which clearly demonstrate the advantages of alternative models of governance.
* traditional command and control systems are not efficient, produce poor decisions, and lack engagement and &quot;ownership&quot; by their stakeholders.
* most people are simply not aware that alternative governance models exist
* people that know of the existence of alternative governance models often remain unconvinced that they can be implemented successfully
* we are not able to easily convince anyone of anything unless we have credible data and experience to support our claims.
* our project does not yet have much awareness or recognition

Are the above wordings OK?
Regards,
Paul

As I've said numerous times, for me the most important aspect of
this project, is not the software, but our way of thinking about
government. What we're asking for is to put every member of a
community on the same level, when it comes to deciding what
direction the community is going to take.

Very few CEO types or in fact any organizations with a hierarchy,
will immediately adopt our model. Those making the decisions, will
find ways to keep the status quo. I mean they've spent their carriers
trying to get where they are, they're not about to give that away.

What we need are convincing arguments, data, case studies. We
need to show that our system is more efficient, can produce better
decisions, and invoke a greater sense of personal responsibility
in individual members of the community.

This is a matter of education and as far as I'm concerned, the most
important task for the Metagovernment Organization. It is currently
however not our top priority, and can in fact hardly be undertaken,
without previously acquiring some data.

I think the only realistic approach is an incremental one.

Aur is right, when he says that the software is hard. Therefore we
should start out with something that may not fulfill all our
criteria on every level, but will at least be useful for our own
discussions, as well as any other community wishing to use an open
source government model.

Using this prototype, I hope we can gain some publicity and
recognition, and grow our community to a level where we can start
working on more lofty goals.


Manuel
