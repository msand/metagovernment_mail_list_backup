<PRE>I would also be interested to know the list's response to the idea of
allowing users to approve/disapprove of parts of legislation and
comments by highlighting the particular text they wish to rate.

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  I would like to hear what some other members of this group think about
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt;  this...
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I have allot of issues with this discussion. Sorry in advance, for the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; wall of text. Here's a heads up, but please bear with me.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - Voting allows everybody to participate, even those without a thorough
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; understanding of the subject.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - Scoring is intended to filter discussions for valuable contributions,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; rather than suppress members who have not established themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - The effort required to participate in a discussion, weeds those out who
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; shouldn't be participating anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Again it seems that voting has become the default means for
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; making a decision. And again I would like to point out, that voting is a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; very bad for a number of reasons. If a member of the community can't
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; even coherently articulate their opinion, and contribute to a discussion,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; hopefully making a better proposal, or rejecting the existing proposal
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; with a valid argument, there is no reason, for that member to have any
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; say in a discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Allowing people to vote encourages mob rule. If a certain opinion is
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; represented on the news as being urgent, and people are allowed to vote,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; we have effectively implemented mob rule.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; The reason I see for a scoring system, is not to reduce what any member
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; of the community has to say on a certain topic, but to extract the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; valuable contributions, from a discussion among 2000 people. I think we
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; can all agree, that even with just 20 people, all eagerly participating
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; in a discussion, there is a need for some filtering mechanism, let alone
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the amount of people that would participate in a discussion over an
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; issue relevant to an entire nation.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; What scoring does, is not to reduce the say any member has, based on
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; their track record, but it allows the messages of any individual user to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; be rated, purely based on their merit. If the truck driver actually does
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; have something relevant to say concerning heart surgery, the few members
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; of the community that will initially see his message, will recognize
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; this, rate it positively, thereby publishing it to a larger audience.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Analogous can be said for an old senile heart surgeon, who may have made
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; valuable contributions in the past, but lately can hardly gain any
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; support. His messages will never make it to a wider audience.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Nowhere here is there any need for a vote. Most of the time, a decision
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; will emerge from the discussion, which all can agree upon. Once that
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; decision moves on in its life cycle, and is proposed to be merged into
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the main repository, as law. More people will see it, they can read the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; discussions that occurred surrounding it. Ideally there will be a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; summary of the discussion, making the reasons clear, that lead to this
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; particular choice of legislation.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; If somebody can then articulate a good reason against the legislation,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the community can go back to the drawing board.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; Voting shifts the focus away from making the best decision for the
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; community, allowing each voter to evaluate a decision, purely based
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; on the effects it will have on the individual member himself. If he
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; feels somehow mistreated, by some proposed legislation, he can make
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; himself heard, in the form of a veto.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; There may be cases, where no decision can recognized as the best decision
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; for the community (which should be the basis upon which a decision is
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; evaluated). This shouldn't occur too often, if the discussion is held
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; properly, the relevant facts and clearly formulated consequences of a
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; proposal, should make the right decision obvious to everybody. This may
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; not be the case, if facts are scarce and a decision is mostly a judgment
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; call. If that is the case, the people can vote for all I care.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I'll take the position of a tech snob here for a second, just for
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; arguments sake: If people are willing to vote, it shows a lack
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; of technical understanding in a subject. For one reason or another, they
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; are unable to evaluate the facts presented to them and make there
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; decisions based upon that. When making software in an open source
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; community, the right decisions can mostly determined, based on their
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; technical merit. The decisions that do come down to a vote, are the most
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; banal things you could imagine. Those that everyone feels obligated to
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; pitch in on, because it is basically a judgment call. As anecdotes of
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; this, I offer:
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/bikeshed-full.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; And a more concrete example
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; - <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; The latter case shows, that on the most banal decision, the syntax for
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; how to write a conditional expression in one line, no consensus can be
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; achieved. Simply because it doesn't make that much of a difference, so
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; there is no technical merit to judge decisions by.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; I could go on, but I've taken enough of your time.
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt;
