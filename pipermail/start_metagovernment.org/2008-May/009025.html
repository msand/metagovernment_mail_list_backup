Those four who scored it a -3 were not opposed enough to the  
resolution to give it a more negative score; so it passes. If they  
were more against it, they could have each given it a -4, and the  
resolution would have failed, even though they were in the minority.

&gt;&gt;<i> (In your system, that would be close to a veto unless everyone else

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea of consensus is that everyone should mildly agree, or at
</I>&gt;<i> least almost everybody wildly agree. Isn't it?
</I>
But multiplying negatives by 10 means that any slight disagreement is  
a very strong vote against the bill. I could, however, see multiplying  
negatives by X, and then let X be tweaked until a good definition of  
consensus is found in the wild.

I am not a mathematician and am not sure which would be preferable: a  
scale that ranges from negative to positive or a scale that ranges  
from a low number to a high one. But by making adjusters for the  
stars, I think what you are proposing comes out to something like  
-100, -5, 0, 5, 10.

But ***=0 doesn't seem to make sense, does it?

I think that may be true in limited scenarios, but we are talking  
about something that many people would be participating in frequently  
and regularly. After regularly using a nuanced scoring system for even  
a few days, people would start to make nuanced scores. Systems like  
IMDB seem to do very well with a 10-point scale, because their regular  
users are familiar with 10-point rating. Example:
<A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411061/ratings">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411061/ratings</A>
