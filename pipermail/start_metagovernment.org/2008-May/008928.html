<PRE>I don't see any need for parties.

In highschool I thought about how it would be for a modern direct democracy
(vote on every issue, athens style) to work.

What I envisioned would happen is that most people would read the papers to
get advice from columnists on how to vote on different issues that they
don't know much about, and eventually some columnists would develop a
following of people that just open the paper and read the table of issue /
vote and go to the voting machine and vote that. Those columnists would
become similar to today's &quot;party leaders&quot;.
Why is this better than indirect democracy? Because people can change
loyalty anytime, not just once every four years. And because people need to
do the minimum of checking the table each morning, and thus are encouraged
to get more involved.

If we don't allow parties, eventually someone will automate them from
outside - that is, write a tool that goes to
socialistparty.org/howtovote.txt and registers all those votes on your name
once a day. But not many will use it, and most will be more involved. Most
will read the papers, or blogs, and even though most of the time they will
listen to one or two columnists that they follow, they will notice if there
are other things happening and will be free to change their minds at any
time on any issue.
