</I>
This is where our systems differ slightly I think. You seem to want to
allow anyone to post anything and have users personally filter out the
content they don't want to be exposed to. I want to have rules as to what
type of post is allowed and enforce posting penalties to users that don't
follow the rules. In my system, the UI would warn when it suspected that a
post may be breaking one of the rules. In this way, I don't see a need to
put them in different classes, but maybe you can give me an example.

&gt;<i> It's not an issue of complexity, it's a marketing problem: I looked
</I>&gt;<i> over the site and saw that nothing was in the voting phase and sort of
</I>&gt;<i> lost interest because of that.  I'm also planning to skip all the
</I>&gt;<i> truly local issues because it's impossible to generate any traction
</I>&gt;<i> with a focus that narrow...
</I>
Fair enough, I could put something in the voting phase, but it seemed
ingenuous as there wasn't a real discussion that took place to warrant it
being there. You can still cast an early vote by way of propping (upvote)
though it's not official, just helps gauge the level of interest in the
proposal.

&gt;<i> And, yes, I have a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> questions, the big one of course is how this is any different from any
</I>&gt;<i> other forum where the same kind of discussions *could* happen but for
</I>&gt;<i> some reason never do...
</I>
Seeing as you didn't respond to my reply to this question, I'll assume is
was satisfactory. Any other questions?

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That said, I think you must be very careful when making the call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; between what is &quot;social engineering&quot; and what is &quot;emergent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; phenomenon&quot;. Most of the things on there IMHO are actually the latter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; whereas you seem to consider them to be the former. Worse, I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; any social engineering *solutions* to these problems discussed, either
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; on that page or in the design of the system other than maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;education&quot;, and I'm doubtful that that'll be enough, even if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; could achieve it (which you can't).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whether &quot;social engineering&quot; or &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot;, both are issues to

</I>&gt;<i> behavior (instituting punishments, for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The *solutions* to deal with these tactics other than awareness, mostly
</I>&gt;<i> come
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from the transparency of accounts and the rules to posting. Fake accounts
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can not spam post nonsense in order to minimize a real post, accounts
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be linked to real identities and posting will need to be authentic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributing statements. The forum algorithms to post ranking will
</I>&gt;<i> assist in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; promoting proper posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed: The trolls will hate it because it might expose them to real
</I>&gt;<i> world consequences and therefore refuse to participate (all the while
</I>&gt;<i> ranting about censorship). I still don't understand why so many
</I>&gt;<i> newspapers and other organizations just shut down their forums rather
</I>&gt;<i> than just change to require some sort of authentication. I can see why
</I>&gt;<i> most forums don't do this, though: it's because they're designed to
</I>&gt;<i> sell eyeballs, not facilitate discussion...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; You also have the same &quot;bootstrapping&quot; problem we all face: How to get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the system complete enough so that people can actually see how it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; works (i.e., having proposals actually in the voting phase) without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; having any proposals that have gone through the entire process yet..
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think the process is too complicated for ordinary users to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand. Propose, discuss, adjust, vote. Just need a handful of active
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users to go through and contribute to a few ideas so I can move them to
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting stage. The users of this mailing list would almost be enough to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; achieve this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not an issue of complexity, it's a marketing problem: I looked
</I>&gt;<i> over the site and saw that nothing was in the voting phase and sort of
