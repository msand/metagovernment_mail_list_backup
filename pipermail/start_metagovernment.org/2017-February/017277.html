</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, I think you must be very careful when making the call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between what is &quot;social engineering&quot; and what is &quot;emergent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phenomenon&quot;. Most of the things on there IMHO are actually the latter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whereas you seem to consider them to be the former. Worse, I don't see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any social engineering *solutions* to these problems discussed, either
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on that page or in the design of the system other than maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;education&quot;, and I'm doubtful that that'll be enough, even if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could achieve it (which you can't).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether &quot;social engineering&quot; or &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot;, both are issues to
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining a mutually productive forum and so we should be aware of the
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities they pose. Why the need to determine a difference between them
</I>&gt;<i> if they can both be problematic?
</I>
Because the solutions would be very different (i.e., they'd require
different &quot;classes&quot; of social engineering countermeasures, as defined
in the Matchism manifesto
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/social-engineering/">http://www.matchism.org/social-engineering/</A>). Emergent things can
probably be fixed by just changing the UI (e.g., making searching and
sorting easier), ie. class 1 or maybe 2. Trolls, however, require a
firmer touch (class 3) where you actively try to change *their*
behavior (instituting punishments, for example).

&gt;<i> The *solutions* to deal with these tactics other than awareness, mostly come
</I>&gt;<i> from the transparency of accounts and the rules to posting. Fake accounts
</I>&gt;<i> can not spam post nonsense in order to minimize a real post, accounts will
</I>&gt;<i> be linked to real identities and posting will need to be authentic
</I>&gt;<i> contributing statements. The forum algorithms to post ranking will assist in
</I>&gt;<i> promoting proper posts.
</I>
Agreed: The trolls will hate it because it might expose them to real
world consequences and therefore refuse to participate (all the while
ranting about censorship). I still don't understand why so many
newspapers and other organizations just shut down their forums rather
than just change to require some sort of authentication. I can see why
most forums don't do this, though: it's because they're designed to
sell eyeballs, not facilitate discussion...

&gt;&gt;<i> You also have the same &quot;bootstrapping&quot; problem we all face: How to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the system complete enough so that people can actually see how it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works (i.e., having proposals actually in the voting phase) without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having any proposals that have gone through the entire process yet..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think the process is too complicated for ordinary users to
</I>&gt;<i> understand. Propose, discuss, adjust, vote. Just need a handful of active
</I>&gt;<i> users to go through and contribute to a few ideas so I can move them to the
</I>&gt;<i> voting stage. The users of this mailing list would almost be enough to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve this.
</I>
It's not an issue of complexity, it's a marketing problem: I looked
over the site and saw that nothing was in the voting phase and sort of
lost interest because of that.  I'm also planning to skip all the
truly local issues because it's impossible to generate any traction
with a focus that narrow...

    Scott
