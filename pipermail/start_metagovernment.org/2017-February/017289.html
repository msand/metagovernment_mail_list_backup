This kind of hair-splitting goes on in the Open Source market all the
time and I fail to see the point: Once you've released something under
a fairly permissive open source license (MIT, Apache, etc.) there's
basically nothing the &quot;IP owner&quot; can do to prevent you from competing
with them. If you release under GPL or some variant of that they might
retain some control over commercial use, but that'd also dramatically
shrink the potential market for the product (most companies won't
touch GPL licensed software).

This rule definitely applies to our purposes (i.e., creating a
decisionmaking system that is designed to replace some component of
actual government): No one is going to trust your system if they don't
have free reign to look at it, modify it, and fork it if necessary,
which requires some sort of open source license and a complete absence
of patent protection for it.

&gt;<i> I do not really care. But you might develop something and your users end up

</I>
Patent I think is a separate issue, the proper way to solve that one
being to eliminate software patents (this is in my proposal queue
already ;-)  But with few exceptions IP in open source licensing is a
copyright issue, not a patent issue.
