Best thing on there I think is the description of the failure modes of
forums in general, although it maybe seems a little too reminiscent of
&quot;troll bingo&quot; (search Google images to see some cards):

That said, I think you must be very careful when making the call
between what is &quot;social engineering&quot; and what is &quot;emergent
phenomenon&quot;. Most of the things on there IMHO are actually the latter
whereas you seem to consider them to be the former. Worse, I don't see
any social engineering *solutions* to these problems discussed, either
on that page or in the design of the system other than maybe
&quot;education&quot;, and I'm doubtful that that'll be enough, even if you
could achieve it (which you can't).

You also have the same &quot;bootstrapping&quot; problem we all face: How to get
the system complete enough so that people can actually see how it
works (i.e., having proposals actually in the voting phase) without
having any proposals that have gone through the entire process yet...

&gt;<i>  <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhqWIoUbvVc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhqWIoUbvVc</A> is my promo video for now. Let
</I>&gt;<i> me know thoughts.
</I>
There's a typo in the end credits. And, yes, I have a lot of
questions, the big one of course is how this is any different from any
other forum where the same kind of discussions *could* happen but for
some reason never do...
  Regards,
    Scott
