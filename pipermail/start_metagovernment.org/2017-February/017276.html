</I>&gt;<i> That said, I think you must be very careful when making the call
</I>&gt;<i> between what is &quot;social engineering&quot; and what is &quot;emergent
</I>&gt;<i> phenomenon&quot;. Most of the things on there IMHO are actually the latter
</I>&gt;<i> whereas you seem to consider them to be the former. Worse, I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> any social engineering *solutions* to these problems discussed, either
</I>&gt;<i> on that page or in the design of the system other than maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;education&quot;, and I'm doubtful that that'll be enough, even if you
</I>&gt;<i> could achieve it (which you can't).
</I>
Whether &quot;social engineering&quot; or &quot;emergent phenomenon&quot;, both are issues to
maintaining a mutually productive forum and so we should be aware of the
possibilities they pose. Why the need to determine a difference between
them if they can both be problematic?

The *solutions* to deal with these tactics other than awareness, mostly
come from the transparency of accounts and the rules to posting. Fake
accounts can not spam post nonsense in order to minimize a real post,
accounts will be linked to real identities and posting will need to be
authentic contributing statements. The forum algorithms to post ranking
will assist in promoting proper posts.

&gt;<i> You also have the same &quot;bootstrapping&quot; problem we all face: How to get
</I>&gt;<i> the system complete enough so that people can actually see how it
</I>&gt;<i> works (i.e., having proposals actually in the voting phase) without
</I>&gt;<i> having any proposals that have gone through the entire process yet..
</I>
I don't think the process is too complicated for ordinary users to
understand. Propose, discuss, adjust, vote. Just need a handful of active
users to go through and contribute to a few ideas so I can move them to the
voting stage. The users of this mailing list would almost be enough to
achieve this.

&gt;<i> There's a typo in the end credits. And, yes, I have a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> questions, the big one of course is how this is any different from any
</I>&gt;<i> other forum where the same kind of discussions *could* happen but for
</I>&gt;<i> some reason never do...
</I>
I noticed the typo, thanks. The big question indeed and obviously I don't
have the definitive answer yet. However, I believe it *will* happen for a
number of differences but mainly because of the focus that my forum is
centered on, it does not get hung up on advocacy or complaining, it does
not focus on the *news*. My forum is designed around results, coming up
with solutions and plans on how to achieve them. This direct focus on
action encourages users that their efforts will not be wasted, it's more
than just discussion, things might change as a result of their
contributions.

Keep em coming. Cheers
