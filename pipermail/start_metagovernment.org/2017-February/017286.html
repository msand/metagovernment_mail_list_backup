<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, I&#8217;m curious what you think of &quot;Rule 5 a.&#8221; in the, [Rules for Participation]. Does the term &#8220;non-exclusive&quot; mean a registrant will still have an equal right and license to implement their own entry, regardless of what GCF might do with it?

I agree. 

It&#8217;s not about money and intellectual property rights. It&#8217;s about whether a proposal can still be developed by anyone other than GCF&#8230;.once it&#8217;s been submitted. Seems like you&#8217;re in the dark on this as well.

Below is the email I received on the 10th. It says,  &quot;There have also been minor amendments to the submission requirements including formatting and criteria. These will be published next week. &#8220;   I&#8217;ve not received anything else from them since.



February 10, 2017

To the Shapemakers and participants of the Global Challenges Prize 2017 - A New Shape Remodelling Global Cooperation.
This notice is to inform you that the dates of the competition have been changed due to an increasing interest in the competition.

The Global Challenges Foundation is thrilled with the attention the competition has received, and would thus like to extend the opportunity for more entrants to participate and further develop their proposals.

There have also been minor amendments to the submission requirements including formatting and criteria. These will be published next week. 

Please note the following changes to the key dates: 

Registration will be open until March 31, 2017

Applications can be submitted from April 1, 2017

The final submission deadline is extended until September 30, 2017.

Shortlisted candidates will be invited to a judging day in Stockholm in April 2018, after which the final results will be announced.
