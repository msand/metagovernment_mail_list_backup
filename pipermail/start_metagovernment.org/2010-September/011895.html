</I>I don't understand, obviously... I submitted over the weekend, two
proposals, for generation 9.

When I go to the question page for generation 8, there is the option for me
to add another proposal, and it has my two new proposals below that,
presumably waiting for the question to be moved to the next round.  My only
options are to (wait or) delete or edit them.

Have I missed a step?

Regards,

MM

PS  I already shared the contents of one on the list here  - the set of
criteria I applied.  I can share the Proposed Alternative also, if desired.
