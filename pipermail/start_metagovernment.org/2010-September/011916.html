<PRE>Hello,
so the good news is that the University has agreed to pay for the PdF
Europe conference starting in 3 days time in barcelona. The US version
of the conference is the biggest conference on the topic and this
should too be quite big.It is so big that it only has invited
speakers, and as such I could not present any work (which is why I did
not expect the Uni to pay for the trip).

It will be an incredible event with lots of possibilities to network.
I wonder how frustrating will it be to go there without being allowed
to speak. But I hope I can still enjoy the presentations.

I believe the conference will be broadcasted, so people on the net can
follow it too.

Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. on the other side no one so far has added anything to the &quot;how
should we call what we are doing&quot; question. Com'on it's only one extra
day.
