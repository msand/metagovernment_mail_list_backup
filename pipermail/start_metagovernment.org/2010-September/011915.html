<PRE>Sorry, I am late.

I also like the ideas.
Especially the idea of the discussion on how the various website and
interface should come out. God knows if we need that.


A related question was asked some time ago on VgtA:
How might a non-programmer participate in metagovernment?

You might want to read the answer to get some extra ideas.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> An early and limited version of this existed before the site went wiki (and

</I>&gt;<i> into the wiki but sorely needs updating and expansion (it also has no links
</I>&gt;<i> to it). But you may find it a useful starting point.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm writing from my phone so linking is difficult, but just look for: FAQ
</I>&gt;<i> Also look at the page entitled &quot;map&quot; which is a links-only version of such a
</I>&gt;<i> guide. I agree that q&amp;a would be more effective for people who don't want to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been thinking about what I and others who are not directly involved
</I>&gt;<i> with development of software can do to help advance the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> project. One idea I have returned to is a Q&amp;A section for the website which
</I>&gt;<i> anyone could edit. I see this as serving several important purposes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
</I>&gt;<i> transparency?&quot; etc. The vast majority of this information is already on the
</I>&gt;<i> site, but this way of organising it may help to a) guide first-time visitors
</I>&gt;<i> through the concept in steps, and b) help people to find specific
</I>&gt;<i> information they are looking for. It is no accident that corporations love
</I>&gt;<i> to use Q&amp;A sections to explain tricky issues. I once translated one aimed
</I>&gt;<i> specifically at a large number of people who were about to be made
</I>&gt;<i> redundant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have about
</I>&gt;<i> what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people be
</I>&gt;<i> influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;, &quot;How can one be sure that
</I>&gt;<i> the system is safe from hackers?&quot;, &quot;Who will have the power to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> that decisions are implemented in the real world?&quot;, &quot;Won't there be a bias
</I>&gt;<i> towards the views of people who spend all their time on the internet?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These two points both go back to the discussion we had about the front page
</I>&gt;<i> of the site and people's immediate reactions to the idea. The next two are
</I>&gt;<i> about how it might help us - people who are already participating in the
</I>&gt;<i> project:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer. One
</I>&gt;<i> problem with the mailing list is that a certain issue will be discussed,
</I>&gt;<i> then fall by the wayside as we move on to something else. A Q&amp;A could
</I>&gt;<i> provide us with a prominent place for issues under discussion. e.g. &quot;Do
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot; I actually
</I>&gt;<i> found this question on the page entitled &quot;Anonymous interactions within the
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment&quot;, but I don't think I would have come across this page at all
</I>&gt;<i> without searching for the term &quot;anonymity&quot;. If such questions had greater
</I>&gt;<i> visibility on the site then multiple positions on the issue could be
</I>&gt;<i> displayed and updated to reflect the current state of the debate, and we may
</I>&gt;<i> spark some new ideas in the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; Pietro recently said about how a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion forum might be implemented in Vilfredo: &quot;I don't want to code
</I>&gt;<i> something wrong, because once it is coded it will take longer to pull it
</I>&gt;<i> off.&quot; So let's have a place where we - both project developers and those on
</I>&gt;<i> the sidelines - can gather and refine our ideas about how things should look
</I>&gt;<i> when they are coded. This would be a resource which different projects could
</I>&gt;<i> draw upon, so that hopefullly various concepts will be tried out and we can
</I>&gt;<i> see what works well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my questions at this point are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Do you think a Q&amp;A section would serve these purposes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Would it be easy enough to integrate into the site from a technical
</I>&gt;<i> standpoint?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Or is there a better way of addressing the issues I have described above?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paul
