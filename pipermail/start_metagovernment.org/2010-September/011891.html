<PRE>*Hi again --- -thought I would post my views on criteria, which I submitted
under as a proposal.**-MM*Criteria for the ideal phrase
Currency/popularity of terms in a phrase are not suitable criteria, pro or
con.

Novelty of a term is not desirable for the sake of novelty.

Prefixes or terms that suggest and limit to the online world are inadequate
to the task, even tho we acknowledge that we are working in the Internet
era, and tools/platforms of this era have changed the game and made all this
possible.  Such connotations tend to mislead the user as to the
applicability of the tools and philosophy.  They also suffer from stylistic
novelty/currency/fashion trends.

The terms and phrase should evoke something timeless.

Neologisms should give us pause.

The phrase should suggest the widest applicability for this philosophy and
practice - e.g.  encompassing online/offline/both.  For &quot;offline&quot; the
recognition is that online tools or capacities may support offline processes
or work. Also, encompassing issues of governance processes for numerous
domains, contexts and issues
