Hi Michel,
I am really sorry, but I cannot find any proposal submitted by you.

On the last generation of this question we had 9 proposal, of which 2
coming from previous generations and 7 new. We had in total 4 authors
(Vilfredo, Ed, Thomas and Battocchia), you can find the list of the
proposal in the page:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53</A>
which shows the full history of the question.

Also if I go back in time (same page), I still do not find any
proposal proposed by you. Are you sure you submitted it?

Maybe you could submit your two proposals now at this stage. We are
after all at the writing phase, so this is the best moment to propose
new ideas. We will read them, and vote for them when the voting phase
arrives.

&gt;<i> In a round where my proposals are among the options, I would possibly
</I>&gt;<i> withdraw support for something I previously supported, as my own ideas have
</I>&gt;<i> become more focused.
</I>&gt;<i> Does that make sense?
</I>
Sure. Just avoid to follow the strategy of only voting for your
proposals a priori. Really read all the proposals and vote for the
viable alternative. A good rule of thumb is that your influence on the
discussion is the highest if you vote for about half of the
alternatives. So if you find yourself voting for everything or for
none you are not having any influence on the discussion. If you vote
for only one or all but one you are essentially holding the rest of
the group at a gun point (&quot;ONLY THIS!&quot;, or &quot;ALL BUT THIS!&quot;), but if
you vote for about half you spread your influence through the whole
discussion.

On the other hand I do sometimes find myself voting for many/all
proposals. I consider this meaning that the discussion has reached a
point where I basically don't care. Everything that has been proposed
is ok for me.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Furthermore, if I could come up with a little tweak that would make

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;e-Governance&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can see how this part of the process would work with other types of
