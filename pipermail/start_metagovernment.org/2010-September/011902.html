<PRE>Hi all,

I was wondering if there are any data standards for online voting.

I have been following the OStatus standard.  This was an important milestone
opening up options fo replacements for Twiter that allowed folks to control
their data and identity while enabling Federation.

You can see more about Ostatus here at <A HREF="http://ostatus.org/specification">http://ostatus.org/specification</A>

It seems like the various projects, and especially the commercial ones, go
to great lengths to talk about features, current or planned, but there are
few if any unifying standards besides what language they are built in.

I must be bringing up an old conversation here as I am sure many have been
over this ground before.

When I read Ed's posts, though, I wonder to myself how mych of our theory of
how voting can/should.must work is being put into standards that can endure
over time.

If our voting system was dog food, standards for the voting system itself is
what I would use the voting system to vote on.

Ostatus covers a wide range of territory, from users to interoperability.

What would our standards deal with?
