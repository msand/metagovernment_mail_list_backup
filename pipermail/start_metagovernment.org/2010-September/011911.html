<PRE>Another generation has passed, and the discuss-voting on the name of
the beast is going on.
We now have 5 proposal in the Pareto Front. Three of them are genuine
proposals, while the others are one a proposal suggesting that the
question should be rewritten, and another a meta suggestion trying to
define the criteria for the ideal phrase. If any of those two proposal
would win, the result would probably be to close the question, and
open a new question with the suggestion voted included in the question
itself. Also it should be noted that all the proposals are now
explaining themselves. We have left in the past the simple phrases,
and now side by side to each phrase we have a shord description,
sometimes with link, explaining (or trying to convince) why that
phrase is the ideal phrase.

Also in this generation we have the phenomena of the Key Persons. This
time we have three key persons that are being invited to contribute in
a special way to the process. While everybody is invited to add their
proposals, and try to compromise between existing proposals, and
change existing proposals those people are directly asked to try a
specific task. And it will not always be possible, and it will
probably never be easy.

The three Key Persons for this generation are: vilfredo (i.e. myself),
HarryStottle and Michael Allan.

I have to work and write an alternative proposal respect to proposal
1648: the &quot;Criteria for the ideal phrase &quot;
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1648">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1648</A>

Michael Allen also should work on the same proposal 1648 (I now wonder
if it would make sense to offer a wiki for this kind of situation.
Surely I want to make a special page where key persons can just go
there and find an edit box already completed with the proposal they
are invited to modify.)

Also Michael Allen should work on proposal 1644: The Free Democracy proposal.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1648">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1648</A>

While HarryStottle should work on the &quot;Open Stewardship&quot; proposal
(1650: <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1650">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1650</A> ).

Even if you are not one of those unfortunate who has been singled out
by the algorithm to work more, don't be lazy and try to propose new
things.

Cheers,
Pietro
