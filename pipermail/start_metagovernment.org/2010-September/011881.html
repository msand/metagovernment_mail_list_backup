<PRE>For anyone who missed Pietro's reply below, I would recommend reading  
it, as it is quite fascinating. Particularly this excerpt:

&gt;<i> Why is this important? Because in the past this has been used to
</I>&gt;<i> control how people vote. In Italy for  a long time we had the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to write 4 preferences next to the vote. This was used by
</I>&gt;<i> the Mafia to control who voted for whom. Fascists also used a similar
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general the way it works is that the mafia man organises a number
</I>&gt;<i> of combinations all favorable to his (supported) party. Then gives to
</I>&gt;<i> each person instructions to vote in that way. If a person does not
</I>&gt;<i> vote in that way it is easy to spot because that combination is not
</I>&gt;<i> present in the box.

</I>&gt;<i> I think this list is severely under estimating the amount of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who cares the information around the vote, if I can understand if a
</I>&gt;<i> person has voted as I have asked just by checking if that vote
</I>&gt;<i> combination is present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been educated to think of voting as giving one preference  
</I>&gt;<i> out of a list.
</I>&gt;<i> This is called Plurality Rule:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Theory">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Theory</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that is pretty safe. Because if number of people is &gt;&gt; number of
</I>&gt;<i> options we can safely assume that each option gets voted at least
</I>&gt;<i> once.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in voting theory we use the whole list of all the options, in the
</I>&gt;<i> order in which the person likes them. If there are n options I would
</I>&gt;<i> list them all from the one I like most to the one I like least. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem with this is that if we have n options there are n factorial
</I>&gt;<i> possible lists, that is n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)...3*2*1.
</I>&gt;<i> For n = 10
</I>&gt;<i> 10!=3628800
</I>&gt;<i> If instead you use approval voting (like Vilfredo, but also like the
</I>&gt;<i> UN in deciding the next secretary of the UN - I think :-) -), then the
</I>&gt;<i> number of options go down to 2^n. But this is still too much.
</I>&gt;<i> 2^10=1024.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not to mention that Vilfredo because it does not sum votes is based on
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that not all possible combinations are being voted. Or the
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto Front would be the whole set. And you can throw the system down
</I>&gt;<i> the trash.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, we are working on systems where the possibilities for
</I>&gt;<i> people to vote generally outnumber the number of people present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I am not even considering what happens when a person writes a  
</I>&gt;<i> proposal...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why is this important? Because in the past this has been used to
</I>&gt;<i> control how people vote. In Italy for  a long time we had the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to write 4 preferences next to the vote. This was used by
</I>&gt;<i> the Mafia to control who voted for whom. Fascists also used a similar

</I>&gt;<i> vote in that way it is easy to spot because that combination is not
</I>&gt;<i> present in the box.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is sad to say, but I am afraid that plurality rule is the situation
</I>&gt;<i> that gives best anonimity to people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In italy then they changed the voting law. In that occasion math
</I>&gt;<i> professors wrote a document explaining how keeping the 4 preferences
</I>&gt;<i> made it possible to people to buy and sell votes. Unfortunately what
</I>&gt;<i> we had after that was a systen where people not express preferences
</I>&gt;<i> anymore. And as a result the person in charge of the list and putting
</I>&gt;<i> the names in the list for a party had absolute power over who get's
</I>&gt;<i> elected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For all this I am now thinking that maybe we should just give up any
</I>&gt;<i> pretense of anonimity. Or just accept the system we have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe real democracy is possible, but anonymous real democracy might
</I>&gt;<i> be too much to ask from this universe; sorry if this sounds like bad
</I>&gt;<i> news.
