<PRE>Hi!

Does that mean the proposals I submitted are not accepted into the
discussion?  I offered two, per the instructions... one about the criteria,
one offering something I suggest is new/different and suitable.

In a round where my proposals are among the options, I would possibly
withdraw support for something I previously supported, as my own ideas have
become more focused.

Does that make sense?
