<PRE>Hey Thomas, (sorry for the delay)

I made the terminology changes (&quot;namegiver&quot;, &quot;donation&quot;) that we
agreed to previously.

I also re-summarized and re-titled my position.  If you like these
changes, we could repeat them for the entire poll.  We could also
clarify that the contract is supposed to be a general template for use
in any number of name transfers (not one in particular).

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3860&amp;a=3891">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3860&amp;a=3891</A>

Note: We haven't agreed to frag 5 yet.  I'm guessing the proper
procedure is to patch it into your draft anyway, and then *undo* or
amend whatever parts you disagree with?  That way there's still a good
chance (some day) of automatically piecing together the
genealogy/authorship from the revision history.

&gt;<i> &gt; Thomas wants to protect the domain name from extinction, in case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the [namegivers] disagree and veto the transfer before takes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place.  I say let the name die and start over ASAP with a new one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and new [namegivers]).
</I>

</I>
I guess nothing could stop them.  As long as all namegivers agree to
do something with the domain name, and no *other* laws/contracts are
broken along the way, then they can do as they please.  I'm not a
lawyer, but I think *any* contract can *always* be amended or
deprecated by mutual assent of the concerned parties.  (Otherwise, it
would be a strange world.)

&gt;<i> @ this last remaining diff: Maybe I had a different position in the
</I>&gt;<i> past, but right now an amandable contract seems not so very
</I>&gt;<i> trustworthy to the voters, doesnt it?
</I>
If what I said above is correct, then the amendment clause goes
without saying.  It's redundant.  Should we remove it?

I think I finally understand this thing (it makes my head spin): The
public (the voters) are not party to the contract.  They should not
place trust in the contract itself (which is always amendable) but in
the namegivers.  All it takes is a single namegiver to side with them,
and they can use his veto to prevent back-pedalling on the donation.
They can prevent the name (and the time, effort and money they
contributed to it) from being stolen for other purposes.

They can only do that at the cost of destroying the name.  But (you
were right all along) the namegivers can together ressurect the domain
name.  Nothing can prevent them from doing so.

Strange conclusion: it doesn't really matter *what* the contract says.
It's only a statement of intent and some pre-canned procedures for
resolving differences along the way.  All that really matters is *who*
the namegivers are.

It's looking good, I think.  All we have to do is polish up the
phrasing, then we can prepare a copy for signing.
