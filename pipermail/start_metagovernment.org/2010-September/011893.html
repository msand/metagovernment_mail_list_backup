<PRE>Hi Paul,
I think you summed it up very well.

Indeed what I am asking is not an easy job. But then no one said it was.

What Vilfredo is trying to do is to integrate different point of views.
The keyplayer is a math tool that is trying to pinpoint on where more
easily a convergence might be met. Those are not the only points, or
the only way. Just the lowest hanging fruits.

Of course you can instead explain why you will not vote for ... .
You could do this through Vilfredo by starting the &quot;proposal&quot; with:
&lt;bold&gt; COMMENT &lt;/bold&gt;
as we have done in the past. So people know that this is something
that should be read but not voted.
Then if your points are convincing you might be able to get people not
to vote for those proposals. But it is not automatic that this will
take those proposals off the Pareto front. Remember that the Pareto
front is a math construction based on set theory. We do _not_ sum
votes. So taking away a person from a question in the Pareto front
might or might not get the question out of the Pareto front.

In other words you do not need to convince everybody but only some
particular people.

So we could, in future, implement the opposite work. Find out who are
the people who are keeping a question from being dominated. If the
first are the key people, those would be the &quot;lock people&quot; ( :-p ).
And if you can convince a lock people to give up their support you
would also have succeeded in getting the Pareto front smaller. Again
there is no assurance that lock people might be there, but with so few
voters, quite often they will be.

For question 1633 the supporters are MichaelMaranda, Vilfredo and Ed
Pastore. Now Michael Maranda is a lock person (LP) because if he would
not support 1633, then 1633 would be dominated by 1638 (free
democracy). Vilfredo is not a LP for 1633, and Ed is a LP because if
he does not support 1633 that would be dominated by 1632
(Collaborative governance). So you could try to convince Ed or
Michael.

At the moment I think we are not ready to implement the the lock
person system. Since Vilfredo only permits interaction through the
voting phase, and no discussion. But all this is giving us suggestion
on how the discussion should be implemented...

NOTE: even if you succeed in working with the LP, this would shrink
the Pareto front, but it would not move any proposal nearer to be
supported by everybody. In other words in Vilfredo the game is in
convincing people to vote for something more than in convincing people
not to vote for something. And this is why we work on the key people.
The key people (you for example) are the people that, if convinced,
would make a proposal (1633, or a clone of it)  nearer being
universally supported. So if you could try to make a clone of 1633 and
change it so that it would be supported by you, this will be a real
progress toward consensus. While working with the LP would yes shrink
the pareto front, but would not progress any proposal toward
consensus.

And for all this I still invite you not to give up on trying to come
up with a viable alternative on the proposal you did not vote for.
But it is hard work!

Cheers,
Pietro
