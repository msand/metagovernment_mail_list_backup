<PRE>Dear all,
the question on the better phrase about open democracy has now passed
another phase.

There are a few things that are interesting about this situation.
First of all the pareto front is quite spread, 5 elements out of 9.
Showing that we are effectively having a hard time in finding a
sinthesis. Part of this is because the nature of the question
eliminates the possibility to write a long answer that tries to
include more proposals. But there is another element on which I would
point your attention: the key players.

If you look at page:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53</A>

You can see on the last generation that it says:
Key Players (proposals they should work on):
MichaelMaranda  ( 1638 )
Ed Pastore  ( 1632 1640 )
Thomas  ( 1632 1633 )
Michael Allan  ( 1638 )
PSabin  ( 1633 1640 )

What does this mean? It means that each of those people
(MichaelMaranda, Ed Pastore, Thomas, Michael Allan, and PSabin) were
&quot;responsible&quot; for keeping the pareto front from shrinking of one
element. In other words, if only they voted in a different way
accepting a particular proposal, the pareto front would have been
smaller and our problem simpler.

So near each name you will find link (sometimes two). The link
represent the prroposal that those people did not accept, but we all
wish they did accept.

So now Vilfredo is getting proactive inviting those people to work
exactly on the proposal they did not like.

So I (as the Vilfredo spokeperson :-) ) am inviting
MichaelMaranda to rewrite the proposal 1638, literally the proposal that says

**********
Free Democracy

Because it frees our current democracy from many restrictions. And it
makes the people who hear it think about it, because most see
democracy itself as something free (compared to the Monarchy,...). So
they dont go into the trap: &quot;Ah, I know, e-Governance is where I can
go to the White House page and make a comment (which nobody reads
anyway).&quot;
**********


in a way that he can approve it as well. If he does it in a way that
keeps enough of the original flavour, his new proposal will have the
support of the old supporters for proposal 1638, plus the support of
MichaelMaranda, thus shrinking the pareto front.

Also Michael Allan should work on the same proposal.

Ed and Thomas should rewrite the 1632:

**********
&quot;Collaborative governance&quot;
**********


Ed should also work with PSabin on 1640:

**********
&quot;The question is ill defined:

&quot;is there a better phrase than 'open source democracy'?&quot; for what?

Depending on the context different phrase can be used. The difficulty
of this question to reach an agreement is related to this. If it is
important it should be rephrased, for example:

In the group MG we are trying to achieve a sort of open source
democracy. A democratic state where people can collaborate, interact,
deliberate using the internet, and in a way that the rules of
democracy can themselves be modified and get better.

How should we call it?
**********

and Thomas and PSabin should work on the

&quot;
**********
e-Governance


This phrase is a nice transformation of &quot;e-Democracy&quot; to further imply
that it is not simply an electronic add-on to existing
(representative) democracy processes, but rather is an expansion of
the &quot;e&quot; concept to actual governance.

See this description in Wikipedia (emphasis added):

Whilst e-Government has traditionally been understood as being
centered around the operations of government, e-Governance is
understood to extend the scope by including citizen engagement and
participation in governance. As such, following in line with the OECD
definition of e-Government, e-Governance can be defined as the use of
ICTs as a tool to achieve better governance.
**********

While two voters (Vilfredo/me and battocchia) have for one time an
easy time, and are not invited to do any extra work.

Of course, in addition to what said before each of us is invited to
try to synthesize two or more proposal into a single proposal.



Good work!
