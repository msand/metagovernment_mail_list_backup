<PRE>I really like the idea, Paul.

An early and limited version of this existed before the site went wiki  
(and before several philosophical transformations). That page got  
transcribed into the wiki but sorely needs updating and expansion (it  
also has no links to it). But you may find it a useful starting point.

I'm writing from my phone so linking is difficult, but just look for:  
FAQ

Also look at the page entitled &quot;map&quot; which is a links-only version of  
such a guide. I agree that q&amp;a would be more effective for people who  
don't want to read all that.

&gt;<i> I've been thinking about what I and others who are not directly  
</I>&gt;<i> involved with development of software can do to help advance the  
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment project. One idea I have returned to is a Q&amp;A section  
</I>&gt;<i> for the website which anyone could edit. I see this as serving  
</I>&gt;<i> several important purposes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks,  
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. &quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by  
</I>&gt;<i> radical transparency?&quot; etc. The vast majority of this information is  
</I>&gt;<i> already on the site, but this way of organising it may help to a)  
</I>&gt;<i> guide first-time visitors through the concept in steps, and b) help  
</I>&gt;<i> people to find specific information they are looking for. It is no  
</I>&gt;<i> accident that corporations love to use Q&amp;A sections to explain  
</I>&gt;<i> tricky issues. I once translated one aimed specifically at a large  
</I>&gt;<i> number of people who were about to be made redundant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have  
</I>&gt;<i> about what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g.  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Won't people be influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;,  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;How can one be sure that the system is safe from hackers?&quot;, &quot;Who  
</I>&gt;<i> will have the power to make sure that decisions are implemented in  
</I>&gt;<i> the real world?&quot;, &quot;Won't there be a bias towards the views of people  
</I>&gt;<i> who spend all their time on the internet?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These two points both go back to the discussion we had about the  
</I>&gt;<i> front page of the site and people's immediate reactions to the idea.  
</I>&gt;<i> The next two are about how it might help us - people who are already  
</I>&gt;<i> participating in the project:
</I>&gt;<i> 3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer.  
</I>&gt;<i> One problem with the mailing list is that a certain issue will be  
</I>&gt;<i> discussed, then fall by the wayside as we move on to something else.  
</I>&gt;<i> A Q&amp;A could provide us with a prominent place for issues under  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion. e.g. &quot;Do anonymous interactions have a place within the  
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment?&quot; I actually found this question on the page entitled  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Anonymous interactions within the metagovernment&quot;, but I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> think I would have come across this page at all without searching  
</I>&gt;<i> for the term &quot;anonymity&quot;. If such questions had greater visibility  
</I>&gt;<i> on the site then multiple positions on the issue could be displayed  
</I>&gt;<i> and updated to reflect the current state of the debate, and we may  
</I>&gt;<i> spark some new ideas in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented,  
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. &quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; Pietro recently said about  
</I>&gt;<i> how a discussion forum might be implemented in Vilfredo: &quot;I don't  
</I>&gt;<i> want to code something wrong, because once it is coded it will take  
</I>&gt;<i> longer to pull it off.&quot; So let's have a place where we - both  
</I>&gt;<i> project developers and those on the sidelines - can gather and  
</I>&gt;<i> refine our ideas about how things should look when they are coded.  
</I>&gt;<i> This would be a resource which different projects could draw upon,  
</I>&gt;<i> so that hopefullly various concepts will be tried out and we can see  
</I>&gt;<i> what works well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my questions at this point are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Do you think a Q&amp;A section would serve these purposes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Would it be easy enough to integrate into the site from a  
</I>&gt;<i> technical standpoint?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Or is there a better way of addressing the issues I have described  
</I>&gt;<i> above?
</I>&gt;<i>
