<PRE>Apart from the question of anonymity, I want to continue to push for  
my model of distributed administration. I expound on it as the last  
part of this thread in terms of protection of authenticated  
identities, but more generally, I think it is the best way to protect  
a governance system from corruption by administrators.

</I>
It could in a mixed discussion and voting system. Though prominent  
systems in this project seem to be leaning away from that model.

&gt;&gt;<i> The second is the trust metric. There are numerous ways trust can be

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow users

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trust of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others in the community gets proportionally greater power within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community. Yes, one person could develop several trusted personas,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Someone trying to set up a botnet of numerous, inter-trusting

</I>
That might work... but it just as likely (or probably more likely)  
would subject all co-conspirators to being downgraded to spammer status.

&gt;<i> I guess it's not all-or-nothing though.  You could just as easily
</I>&gt;<i> integrate that solution into one where some individuals opt-out of

</I>&gt;<i> them and wish to remain anonymous themselves.
</I>
Yes, a mix of identified and anonymous provides a nice cross-check  
(among other seeming benefits).

&gt;&gt;<i> The third is my system of distributed administration. In terms of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anonymous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting, it would mean that users would have to authenticate to the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> back-end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, but then could present an anonymous persona to the front- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> end. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems open to administrator corruption, which is where distributed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration comes in. Any software would have any number  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instances, each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of which would have independent administrators. Each instance would  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checksum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the others, such that any deviation from the neutral standard  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community of administrators) would be removed from the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administration trunk.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't a rogue or otherwise compromised administrator reveal
</I>&gt;<i> everyones identity at any point?
</I>
I don't think so. As a close analogy: in modern network administration  
systems, a user's password is never knowable by the administrators.  
The password is encrypted with software-internal logic, and an admin  
cannot ever reveal it. The admin can change it and take over the  
account, but it would be immediately evident to the user that the  
password had been changed.

Likewise, an anonymous persona associated with an authenticated real  
identity could be protected by internal logic. The admin might be able  
to find out all the authenticated real identities, but (in a well- 
constructed system) should not be able to match them to particular  
anonymous personas.
