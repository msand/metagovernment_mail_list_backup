The problem of inertia with our current models of governance tend to
condense smaller issues into large, controversial yes/no votes.
Online voting systems need not follow this pattern.  By eliminating
the ability for a minority group to dictate the singular form of the
vote and another minority group to effect a choke-hold on the entire
process, I believe we will see a greater number of &quot;tweaks&quot;, and a
smaller number of &quot;reforms&quot;.

At this point the establishment traditionalist will appeal to
absurdity that you can't have millions of votes on millions of tiny
issues, because no-one could possibly keep track of them all.  But I
can't think of any instance where this process would not be
self-regulating.  If an issue does not get beyond a threshold of
attention in the form of voter participation, then should it not be
automatically rejected?

What happens to a society which is now making smaller choices
regularly instead of large choices every 4-5 years?  If those votes
are public, then that society will become more tolerant.  Here is why
I think this - voters will become accustomed to not being able to
please all the people, all the time.  If your friends try to persuade
you to vote one way, and your family another - you're going to have to
make a choice to snub at least one of those groups.  Let's take the
worst case scenario from a democratic perspective - a weak willed
individual who cares more about minimizing personal drama.  If they
always side with the same group, then that will alienate the other
group.  So do they mix it up a little and share voting affiliation -
is the social calculation that risking a small offense to Group A
better than definitely offending Group B?  Once both groups are
acclimatised to being snubbed some of the time, does this not give the
individual cover to express more of their true intent?

Now what if we consider that an individual may be a member of a
half-dozen peer-groups (work colleagues, drinking buddies, friends +
family of significant other, etc)?  What if we consider that there is
membership crossover between potentially all of these groups?  That
every individual, except from the most extreme, will be going through
the exact same dilemmas?  In practice I think this will work itself
out much as it does in real life interactions - my vegetarian friends
don't douse me in red paint, or treat me any differently, should I
order meat at a restaurant.  I believe the fear of social-coercion,
especially in light of smaller issues, is overstated.


With regards Pietro's comment with regards organised crime - at what
point does decreasing the size of issues, start making it too costly
to intimidate a large enough section of the population into voting
your way each time?

You can't direct all of your victims to vote the same way on a large
number of small issues, because that statistically abnormal pattern
would stick out for the whole world to see.  You can try staggering
your victims to hide this, so that sometimes they vote against each
other, but then you need to increase the size of your pool in order to
maintain the same electoral effectiveness.
