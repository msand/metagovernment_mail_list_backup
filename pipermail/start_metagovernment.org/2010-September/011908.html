I was pointing to a couple of projects which have been most active on  
the list recently.

Votorola explicitly intended to outsource discussion, based on the  
idea that people form their own public discourse communities already,  
and trying to force a new one on them may be counter-productive. So  
their engine is designed to interoperate with external inputs as much  
as they can accommodate. (However, I think I recently saw them talking  
about reversing that position and in-sourcing discussion capabilities.)

Vilfredo also is set up as a pure decision engine. People have hacked  
in discussion in the form of comment-proposals, but these can break  
the flow of the pareto front. It works much better (as it is currently  
built) if people discuss outside the context of the voting itself,  
such as I did with my post about Free Democracy.

I too would like to eventually see close affiliation between  
discussion and voting, since I think it can greatly help push people  
toward synthesis.
