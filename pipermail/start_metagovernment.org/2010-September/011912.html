<PRE>I've been thinking about what I and others who are not directly involved
with development of software can do to help advance the Metagovernment
project. One idea I have returned to is a Q&amp;A section for the website which
anyone could edit. I see this as serving several important purposes:

1) To explain what is quite a complicated idea in bite-sized chunks, e.g.
&quot;What does the name Metagovernment mean?&quot;, &quot;What is meant by radical
transparency?&quot; etc. The vast majority of this information is already on the
site, but this way of organising it may help to a) guide first-time visitors
through the concept in steps, and b) help people to find specific
information they are looking for. It is no accident that corporations love
to use Q&amp;A sections to explain tricky issues. I once translated one aimed
specifically at a large number of people who were about to be made
redundant.

2) To anticipate and counter some of the preconceptions people have about
what Metagovernment is and how it would (not) work, e.g. &quot;Won't people be
influenced to vote a certain way by the media?&quot;, &quot;How can one be sure that
the system is safe from hackers?&quot;, &quot;Who will have the power to make sure
that decisions are implemented in the real world?&quot;, &quot;Won't there be a bias
towards the views of people who spend all their time on the internet?&quot;

These two points both go back to the discussion we had about the front page
of the site and people's immediate reactions to the idea. The next two are
about how it might help us - people who are already participating in the
project:

3) To present questions which have more than one competing answer. One
problem with the mailing list is that a certain issue will be discussed,
then fall by the wayside as we move on to something else. A Q&amp;A could
provide us with a prominent place for issues under discussion. e.g. &quot;Do
anonymous interactions have a place within the metagovernment?&quot; I actually
found this question on the page entitled &quot;Anonymous
interactions&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment</A>&gt;within
the metagovernment&quot;, but I don't think I would have come across this
page at all without searching for the term &quot;anonymity&quot;. If such questions
had greater visibility on the site then multiple positions on the issue
could be displayed and updated to reflect the current state of the debate,
and we may spark some new ideas in the process.

4) To imagine parts of the project which have not been implemented, e.g.
&quot;How will discussion take place?&quot; Pietro recently said about how a
discussion forum might be implemented in Vilfredo: &quot;I don't want to code
something wrong, because once it is coded it will take longer to pull it
off.&quot; So let's have a place where we - both project developers and those on
the sidelines - can gather and refine our ideas about how things should look
when they are coded. This would be a resource which different projects could
draw upon, so that hopefullly various concepts will be tried out and we can
see what works well.

So my questions at this point are:

- Do you think a Q&amp;A section would serve these purposes?

- Would it be easy enough to integrate into the site from a technical
standpoint?

- Or is there a better way of addressing the issues I have described above?
