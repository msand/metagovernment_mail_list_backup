<PRE>Pietro, what you're asking us to do here appears problematic to me. Please
correct me if I've misunderstood.

I should work on a proposal I don't like, but I need to keep all of its
current voters on board as well. For example, it's difficult to see how I
could make a change to the proposal &quot;e-Governance&quot; which would be meaningful
enough to make me want to vote for it without making it into a new proposal
entirely (and risk losing all its supporters).

Furthermore, if I could come up with a little tweak that would make
&quot;e-Governance&quot; more acceptable to me, or if I could come up with a good
enough argument to make myself accept the proposal as it is, then there's a
strong chance that a proposal I prefer - &quot;Collaborative governance&quot; - will
be eliminated in the next round, as it will then be dominated by
&quot;e-Governance&quot;.

I can see how this part of the process would work with other types of
questions where there is more room for synthesis or compromise, but in this
case we are faced with having to pick from a set of discrete options.

Would it help if we were asked to come up with the reasons why we are *not*
endorsing the proposals we haven't voted for? Because this is something that
isn't currently visible on the question page and might help to advance the
process - by having people vote for *fewer* options and shrinking the pareto
front in this way.

Paul
