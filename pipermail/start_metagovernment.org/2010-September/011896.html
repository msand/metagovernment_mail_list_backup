<PRE>Hi Michael,
ok so you have submitted the proposals. You are just waiting for them
to be evaluated by the community. This is ok.

Vilfredo works in a metronome fashion, with a phase of writing being
followed by a phase of evaluating. Phases usually last many days to
make sure everybody have a chance to write their proposal(s) and
evaluate others. During the writing phase no one has access to the
proposals written by others, nor can anyone evaluate them. Similarly
during the evaluation phase no one can write new proposals. Now we are
in the writing phase, so you have written your proposal and you are
just waiting for the phase to move on. All is ok. Your proposals have
not been censored or eliminated, they are just waiting that we all
write our proposals, too.

I would suggest that you do not write your proposals here. Vilfredo
keeps the proposals anonymous during the voting phase to make sure no
one votes on them based on sympathy or antipathy with the author.

All is ok, just wait. You will receive an email when the time to vote
has arrived.

Cheers,
Pietro
