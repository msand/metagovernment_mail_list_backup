<PRE>Sorry for the long delay. In the below response, you address the  
governmental aspect, but not the general criticism of public voting:  
self-censorship. These are distinct arguments.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-August/003057.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-August/003057.html</A>

This applies to people in completely free democracies, as it has  
nothing to do with politics directly. Imagine a vote on, say, the  
legalization of marijuana. Someone may wish to vote for it, but  
realize that a future employer may see them voting for it and make  
assumptions about them as a result. So they vote against it even  
though they want it to pass: because they fear the consequences of the  
public revelation of their vote. Or they abstain. Either way, the  
negative effect on the system is a direct result of the public voting.

&gt;<i> No system can absolutely guarantee either of these.
</I>
I don't think absolute guarantees are possible for anything, not even  
for public voting identities. I'll give an example below.

In the status quo, voter fraud, miscounting, voter ignorance, etc.  
lead to a very large margin of error. I've seen estimates of 2% to  
even 5% in stable, major democracies. The Unites States' Bush-Gore  
election was an absolute catastrophe from a technical standpoint. So I  
would be happy with a system which can improve on that. I don't think  
perfection is going to be achievable.

</I>
Again, I don't think we need to offer an absolute guarantee.

Also, people in repressive regimes expressing dissent do not have an  
expectation of complete safety. They currently use online services  
knowing full well that they may be persecuted for those acts. If they  
choose to participate in an online vote, they understand there is risk  
involved.

&gt;<i> Whatever the strength of (2), it will be diminished if the
</I>&gt;<i> authentication process is administered in a society that does not
</I>&gt;<i> respect rights of free speech and free association.  We'll often
</I>&gt;<i> suspect that it's not real people who are voting, but rather the
</I>&gt;<i> state's security apparatus.
</I>
But again, a trust metric can correct for this fairly well. I am not  
saying it would be easy to implement, but measuring a circle of trust  
can readily indicate who is trying to rig the system. If almost  
everyone in one country is avidly up-trusting each other but nobody  
outside that country is, then the larger community may wish to  
disregard all of that country's votes. But if there are also a handful  
of identities from that country which seem to not be involved in that  
self-feeding circle and which do have ties to outside people, then  
those would be likely to be real, dissident people.

&gt;<i> Putting these together: the vulnerable dissident can neither vote
</I>&gt;<i> safely in private, nor could we trust his vote, if he did.  So it's
</I>&gt;<i> truly hairy.  (OTOH public voting cannot be corrupted, it can only be
</I>&gt;<i> suppressed wholesale, by force.)
</I>

Directed force can corrupt public voting. Imagine a public delegated  
voting system where an important vote is coming up. Someone kidnaps a  
key player (someone who has been delegated a lot of votes) and coerces  
them to reveal their password. That party then logs on as the key  
player and explains that she has undergone a change of heart and is  
changing her vote. The vote passes in the kidnapper's favor, and  
irreversible action is taken based on that vote (say, an old building  
is demolished). Then the kidnapper could release the kidnapped person,  
and still the result of the vote is done.

Separately, self-censorship is a corruption of public voting, since it  
means people are not voting the way they actually want to.
