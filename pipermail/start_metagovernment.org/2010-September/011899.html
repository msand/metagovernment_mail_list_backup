<PRE>Yes Ed, I completely agree! It's beautiful, isn't it? And it also 
immidiatly sort of provokes the question &quot;Why &quot;free&quot;? Isn't democracy 
itself free?&quot; So it makes people think.

For me it was just the next logical step in the direction you and Mike 
were going with your conversation about &quot;Real Democracy&quot;. It claimed to 
be more real than the current democracy and also provoked thinking. 
&quot;Free&quot; just makes it a bit more clear, how the real democracy is more 
real than the current one.

</I>&gt;<i> It works wonderfully in prose. For example, &quot;If you are disappointed

</I>&gt;<i> than voting for another representative who they know will also let 
</I>&gt;<i> them down. It would be nice if they could at least see a glimmer of 
</I>&gt;<i> hope on the horizon.)
