<PRE>Thank you for clarifying.  I am content to wait, the best outcomes are not
rushed.

Keep up the good work -- -there are many nuances I have not yet appreciated
nor understood!

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> ok so you have submitted the proposals. You are just waiting for them
</I>&gt;<i> to be evaluated by the community. This is ok.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo works in a metronome fashion, with a phase of writing being
</I>&gt;<i> followed by a phase of evaluating. Phases usually last many days to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure everybody have a chance to write their proposal(s) and
</I>&gt;<i> evaluate others. During the writing phase no one has access to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals written by others, nor can anyone evaluate them. Similarly
</I>&gt;<i> during the evaluation phase no one can write new proposals. Now we are
</I>&gt;<i> in the writing phase, so you have written your proposal and you are
</I>&gt;<i> just waiting for the phase to move on. All is ok. Your proposals have
</I>&gt;<i> not been censored or eliminated, they are just waiting that we all
</I>&gt;<i> write our proposals, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that you do not write your proposals here. Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> keeps the proposals anonymous during the voting phase to make sure no
</I>&gt;<i> one votes on them based on sympathy or antipathy with the author.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All is ok, just wait. You will receive an email when the time to vote
</I>&gt;<i> has arrived.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Hi!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Does that mean the proposals I submitted are not accepted into the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; discussion?  I offered two, per the instructions... one about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; criteria,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; one offering something I suggest is new/different and suitable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hi Michel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am really sorry, but I cannot find any proposal submitted by you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand, obviously... I submitted over the weekend, two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals, for generation 9.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When I go to the question page for generation 8, there is the option for
</I>&gt;<i> me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to add another proposal, and it has my two new proposals below that,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presumably waiting for the question to be moved to the next round.  My
</I>&gt;<i> only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; options are to (wait or) delete or edit them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Have I missed a step?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MM
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS  I already shared the contents of one on the list here  - the set of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; criteria I applied.  I can share the Proposed Alternative also, if
</I>&gt;<i> desired.
