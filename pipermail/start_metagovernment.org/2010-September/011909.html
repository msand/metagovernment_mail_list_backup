<PRE>Speaking from Vilfredo,
I have resisted inserting a discussion inside Vilfredo because I do
understand how important it would be to have it added in a really
meaningful way.

As a mathematician I have a sort of red light in my head that goes on
when my intuition tells me that there is an interesting solution to a
problem, and that I don't know it. The light has been on ever since
from when we built vilfredo. I know the discussion will eventually be
introduced with a complete integration. With people not voting for
something being allowed to explain why, and give feedback. With people
being invited to make new versions in particular instances. You can
see a pre pre proto version of this in the algorithm that calculates
the key people, and in the mail I wrote few days ago about the &quot;lock&quot;
people.

I don't want to code something wrong, because once it is coded it will
take longer to pull it off.

But I strongly support the idea that the discussion and the voting
should be integrated. Just in the right way. Which is out there... .
And is waiting to be brought to light.

Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Votorola explicitly intended to outsource discussion, based on the idea that
</I>&gt;<i> people form their own public discourse communities already, and trying to
</I>&gt;<i> force a new one on them may be counter-productive. So their engine is
</I>&gt;<i> designed to interoperate with external inputs as much as they can
</I>&gt;<i> accommodate. (However, I think I recently saw them talking about reversing
</I>&gt;<i> that position and in-sourcing discussion capabilities.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo also is set up as a pure decision engine. People have hacked in
</I>&gt;<i> discussion in the form of comment-proposals, but these can break the flow of
</I>&gt;<i> the pareto front. It works much better (as it is currently built) if people
</I>&gt;<i> discuss outside the context of the voting itself, such as I did with my post
</I>&gt;<i> about Free Democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I too would like to eventually see close affiliation between discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> voting, since I think it can greatly help push people toward synthesis.
