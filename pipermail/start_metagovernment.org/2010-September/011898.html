<PRE>There are more than one ways to push toward synthesis. Instead of re- 
writing the Vilfredo proposal I didn't vote for, I am instead writing  
here to lend rhetorical support to a proposal that has been growing on  
me.

The more I see it, the more I like the sound of &quot;Free Democracy.&quot; It  
embodies everything we stand for, it borrows from the great tradition  
of Free Software and from the origins of American democracy (&quot;freedom&quot;  
and &quot;liberty&quot; were very often-used words by Thomas Jefferson), and it  
has a great ring to it.

It works wonderfully in prose. For example, &quot;If you are disappointed  
with the rule of representatives, isn't it time you considered Free  
Democracy?&quot; (The U.S. is coming up on our bi-annual national  
legislative elections, and people here are radically upset with their  
current representatives, and yet are trapped into doing nothing more  
than voting for another representative who they know will also let  
them down. It would be nice if they could at least see a glimmer of  
hope on the horizon.)

So in the next round of the question on Vilfredo,
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53</A>
I am considering collapsing my vote down to just &quot;Free Democracy,&quot; and  
I invite others to consider the same, and also to debate or support  
this idea in this thread.
