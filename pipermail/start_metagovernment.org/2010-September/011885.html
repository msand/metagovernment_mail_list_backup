I'm surprised you remember me, but thanks :-)


&gt;<i> The first is like the SlashDot approach: simply allowing completely

</I>&gt;<i> contributions to be elevated to as much prominence as the community thinks
</I>&gt;<i> they deserve. Of course, this applies better to discussion than to voting.
</I>
Could it apply to voting, at all?


&gt;<i> The second is the trust metric. There are numerous ways trust can be
</I>&gt;<i> calculated, but it all comes out to the same basic principle... allow users
</I>&gt;<i> to create non-identifying personas, and then have those personas prove
</I>&gt;<i> themselves within the community. Any persona which has gained the trust of
</I>&gt;<i> others in the community gets proportionally greater power within the
</I>&gt;<i> community. Yes, one person could develop several trusted personas, but
</I>&gt;<i> that's not necessarily corruption: each of those personas has proven itself
</I>&gt;<i> within the community (and can be downgraded by the community at any time).
</I>&gt;<i> Someone trying to set up a botnet of numerous, inter-trusting personas would
</I>&gt;<i> not be able to prove themselves outside of their own sphere, and thus all of
</I>&gt;<i> their input would collapse to that of one participant.
</I>
I would attack it like this -- I'd analyse existing groups of a
similar size to the one I wished to spoof, work out a plausible ratio
of internal and external validations and instruct my group of
co-conspirators to have their alternate personas follow that pattern.

I guess it's not all-or-nothing though.  You could just as easily
integrate that solution into one where some individuals opt-out of
anonymity and provide a real-life validation point for those who trust
them and wish to remain anonymous themselves.


&gt;<i> The third is my system of distributed administration. In terms of anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> voting, it would mean that users would have to authenticate to the back-end
</I>&gt;<i> system, but then could present an anonymous persona to the front-end. This
</I>&gt;<i> seems open to administrator corruption, which is where distributed
</I>&gt;<i> administration comes in. Any software would have any number instances, each
</I>&gt;<i> of which would have independent administrators. Each instance would checksum
</I>&gt;<i> all the others, such that any deviation from the neutral standard (the
</I>&gt;<i> community of administrators) would be removed from the administration trunk.
</I>
Couldn't a rogue or otherwise compromised administrator reveal
everyones identity at any point?
