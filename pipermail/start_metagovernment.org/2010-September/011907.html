&gt;<i> Hi. I stumbled upon this page:

I don't see the harm in several of us applying for fellowships. If  
nothing else, it may raise awareness of the project and/or with our  
general themes with people there. I'll try if I get an opportunity  
(though note that the latest rolling deadline just passed on 9/7, so  
that gives us until 11/26 to figure out any more sophisticated  
approach).

I'm not sure there is a way for other than an individual to apply

&gt;<i> By the way, regarding to the democracy.org NGO, I exhausted my ways of

Is there something I can do to help push this any further? Did you  
hear back from Mr. Lewis? It seems that if the domain is registered to  
a person who has passed, someone should be able to petition for it to  
be released. Though his estate should be able to transfer it to  
someone else directly.
