<PRE>&gt;<i>  My approach that is not implemented because of limited resources (programming expenses) is to change this current system with this:
</I>&gt;<i> I select a part of the proposal or a spot in the proposal or solution I want to change or I can even start a new solution. THis action create an area called discussion area, where I am the &quot;owner&quot;. The discussion area is like a forum and next to it there is the synthesis area, every single participant (as soon as you enter your point of view you become a member) of the discussion have right to edit  in the synthesis area of the discussion. 
</I>

There may be code you can use or collaboration that can help you get this done. The Votorola team developed the &#8220;difference bridge&#8221; which I believe would suit here. I don&#8217;t see where I can reference it, but they should be able to help.

Also the Candiwi project was building a wiki with voting and discussion on each paragraph. Their site is offline now, but the source code is still available:
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/candiwi/candiwi/src">https://bitbucket.org/candiwi/candiwi/src</A>

But I still put forth that the relaters aren&#8217;t necessary. I haven&#8217;t fully understood their process in Airesis, but I know that democracy shouldn&#8217;t be funneled through individuals (who decides who gets to be a relater?). Why can&#8217;t any number of members of the community fulfill that role as they please? In other words, if the relaters are necessary, do they have to be solitary individuals? Can&#8217;t they be any number of people?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current way is one or more relater obliged to incorporate into the proposal the contribution that are being evaluated positively by the participant during the debate time frame. At the same time there is another evaluation that is the readiness of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> This obligation and the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the relater(s) are the weak spot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A contribution is a text with amendment, correction, ideas, concept that can be evaluated with a + or a - or a neutral vote, (we use smiley). If a contribution get a number of positive evaluation the relater will integrate the contribution in the selected area where the contribution is placed.
</I>&gt;<i> The integration is subjective! Here is the weakness! The relater may have misunderstood the sense of it, or use poor language into the integration etc etc.

</I>&gt;<i> 2 cases, either you agree or you don't agree and as we want to build an amendment or a solution or a simple rephrase we kick out who disagree, we need to complete our little process productively so is a work of consensual debate. Let's imagine a moderation. If the discussion is held with openness the person who disagree will have the chance to convince the colleague and change their vision with arguments. If he fail to do so he will be kicked out (taken away the right to edit the synthesis), he can open another discussion area where he will &quot;rule&quot; and look for consensus on his point of view. In this case we will have two antithetic position that will generate two different solution.  Somehow after some time the synthesis will be exhausted and the discussion will be closed, now the synthesis will be evaluated and will get from the beginning the positive evaluation from the peole that participate end eventually from other that read the synthesis and agree with it. The relater will now integrate the synthesis in the proposal AS IS! The work is a collective work!
</I>&gt;<i> If there is an antithesis that receive sufficient  positive evaluation this will be Integrated in the proposal as a different solution. When there is no more solution and open discussion it is also the time that people will evaluate the readiness of the proposal and we will go to the final vote. In case of two solution we are going to decide by majority if there is more than two solution we use the Schulze vote.

But then how many times do you read RRO or looked at the math issues around allocating seats in the US House.  The history there says a lot more then the math itself.  And it says to me that Jacopo is more likely to have the right directionality but at the moment is caught up in statistics but might not be able to critique Gauss's critique of Guassian distributions.

</I>&gt;<i> Max
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the delay, Jacopo. I think I better understand your approach now. Some of the other systems here take a similar approach, but with less distinction between the debate and the vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the relaters are a potential weak-spot, then one option would be to remove them. What Votorola does, for example, is simply have all participants act in the function of your relaters, and they also have no distinction between the small votes (like/dont-like/dont-know) and the &#8220;main&#8221; vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Their approach is to allow anyone to submit a proposal, and to have participants vote for whatever proposal they support. If no one proposal is clearly winning, then it is up to the proposers to work to try to convince the supporters of the other proposals to support their proposal. Usually the way to do this is to incorporate parts of other proposals or to build syntheses in order to make new proposals that work for competing interests.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The weakness of this approach is that it can involve a lot of reading, which hurts participation. The weakness of the Airesis approach, as you note, is that it is dependent on one person (never a good thing for real democracy). Also, in Airesis I see much less opportunity for synthesis. What if there is big disagreement on a proposal, and the only way to get everyone board is to propose something radically different from what is being worked on. How does that happen?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;d be very interested in hearing others&#8217; perceptions on the above critique and on how to approach these issues.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment the proposal building is the responsibility of one or more relaters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The proposal start with a problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tobacco is proven bad for health
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> School does not sufficiently adapt to new technology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second step is to define an objective:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we help discourage people from smoking?  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we best teach our children?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Third step is to identify a solution from the proposed ones:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1We raise the tax on tobacco
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2We prevent smoking in public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3 We rise tobacco tax and prohibit smoking in public.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In each of this step you may have something to say, in fact we are writing a bill
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis give you the chance to make a contribution in each of this step, is specially important in the last step where different solutions may be proposed or multiple solutions may be packaged.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you say, is called contribution, can be related to a paragraph or can be a new solution and will be evaluated by the participants in the debate. they can give 3 different evaluation: Like ,Don't Like , Don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In Airesis the debate may be hold in temporary anonymity, so that we are not influenced by our preconception or the presence of a leader. If chosen that feature you will be given a fictitious name and a temporary avatar. At the end of the debate real names and avatar will be displayed. Many time we find to agree with our most declared enemy!!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As soon as you evaluate one contribution you will be shown the result of the other evaluations for that contribution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may comment on a contribution and the owner of the contribution may edit his contribution turning the evaluation back to zero for new evaluation. (here is where I think Airesis can be enhanced to find a better methodology to build synthesis removing part of the &quot;weight&quot; of the relater) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The relaters  will pick the best evaluated contribution and edit the paragraph accordingly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each participants in the debate may indicate if the debate need to be carried on  or if should be continued (this value is taken into consideration by the quorum that is chosen for that proposal) but some of this proposal may have a fixed closing date.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In Airesis depending on the type of proposal, different model,  are proposed by a wizard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Usually the final result is a set of very smart consensus build solutions packaged in a way that schulze algorithm  help find the best to come up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately the quality of the relaters is the weak point and we are working on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is proven by statistical data that a poor relater may turn of participation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We are looking at way to prevent that. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Done in this way the stakeholder have plenty to say and if they are not saying nothing the will see anyway the best solution emerge. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We prefer to have stakeholder take action and participate in the debate rather than have them delegate their vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Compared to Liquidfeedback we are way advanced, in liquidfeedback is more of a competition between proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The system is designed to bring up excellence and promote knowledge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There still the danger to change the good construction of a proposal if a large and organized group of participants act to damage a proposal. Nothing compared to what we see in delegated political system under the action of lobbyist.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I admit I still don&#8217;t fully understand Airesis, but my impression so far is that it may emphasize voting a bit too much. Please correct me in whatever way I am misapprehending.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Government and governing bodies outside of government make a vast array of decisions that affect out life. It can decide questions like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should we build a swimming pool in this city park?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should we send troops to country X to intervene in a massacre?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should we ban texting while driving?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should we have schools teach a particular new curriculum?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should we raise the tax on tobacco?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Those are just random examples. The array of decisions is seemingly infinite. And you can easily be a stakeholder in ever single one of those. But you cannot reasonably vote on all of those decisions with a fully informed opinion. It is impossible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I agree that delegation is not the answer. I think the real problem and the real answer here is that we are asking the wrong questions. All of the above are yes/no questions. They assume that there can only be two choices, and they invite ignorant participation (anyone can say yes or no to those for any number of reasons).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, those above questions could be stated as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we affordably make this park serve the community better?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we effectively intervene in the massacre in country X?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we address safety issues with texting while driving?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we best teach our children?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we help discourage people from smoking?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For each of those questions, it is not a matter of voting yes or no, but of building solutions that can get everyone to vote for them. The process may be much longer, but the result would be orders-of-magnitude better. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn&#8217;t that a much stronger, more workable, more persistent form of democracy? One that builds solutions for everyone?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do not exclude delegation is proven from the experience of the pirate party in Germany that use LQFB that the function created less participation.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Participation mean effort and effort mean time and energy. In today world we do have little time to spare (at least in Italy) because we are busy surviving. Now it does not imply that every one should participate in proposal making but it should be on the final decision making. If you are not willing to even know what is decided it mean that you deserve to live the consequences of your absence. My and  the Airesis development team idea is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be modified and developed as we learn from experience and different methodology)  I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought up.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not be in the agenda!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent that (easy to do) 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Efficiency:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy (Airesis Team) is to analyze each problem and then brake it down in to smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in synthesis by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The second strategy is to use different voting system for different solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For that we will choose the mathematical formula that show to give the best result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm  and so forth. The participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is fundamentally a right but we live in a delegated democracy, the fundamental question is: is functioning? My answer is NO! 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So, the rules of the game are set, we work to see if there is a way of making them better.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot be present during the vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a rarity.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for each sub-prolem rather than vote a single bill with hundred decision in it. Civic education should become obligatory.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see what you think:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted subversive effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns. People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example, thus circumventing your restrictions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation. But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see what other people may say.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If your question is about some sort of Karma to apply to the users, i believe the best way is statistical information of the activity, in Airesis.eu, for example, we start to collect data about users participation based on the vote they receive in the contributions that are posted in the different proposals.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
