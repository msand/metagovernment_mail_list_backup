<PRE>RRO allows an agreement to substitute one motion for another.  It is a bit
like an amendment to a motion.

Anyway the math says you cannot have a consistent and dynamic system with
all votes being equal.  I suppose this is so obvious that you do not need
any math.  But then how many times do you read RRO or looked at the math
issues around allocating seats in the US House.  The history there says a
lot more then the math itself.  And it says to me that Jacopo is more
likely to have the right directionality but at the moment is caught up in
statistics but might not be able to critique Gauss's critique of Guassian
distributions.

But Ed is right to focus on how to make big shifts.

Sorry for the delay, Jacopo. I think I better understand your approach now.
Some of the other systems here take a similar approach, but with less
distinction between the debate and the vote.

If the relaters are a potential weak-spot, then one option would be to
remove them. What Votorola does, for example, is simply have all
participants act in the function of your relaters, and they also have no
distinction between the small votes (like/dont-like/dont-know) and the
&#8220;main&#8221; vote.

Their approach is to allow anyone to submit a proposal, and to have
participants vote for whatever proposal they support. If no one proposal is
clearly winning, then it is up to the proposers to work to try to convince
the supporters of the other proposals to support their proposal. Usually
the way to do this is to incorporate parts of other proposals or to build
syntheses in order to make new proposals that work for competing interests.

The weakness of this approach is that it can involve a lot of reading,
which hurts participation. The weakness of the Airesis approach, as you
note, is that it is dependent on one person (never a good thing for real
democracy). Also, in Airesis I see much less opportunity for synthesis.
What if there is big disagreement on a proposal, and the only way to get
everyone board is to propose something radically different from what is
being worked on. How does that happen?

I&#8217;d be very interested in hearing others&#8217; perceptions on the above critique
and on how to approach these issues.

Dear Ed

The heart of Airesis is the proposal building... then there is the vote.
The vote become secondary If the proposal building is carried in the
optimal way (and we have open issue here in Airesis on the methodology)
At the moment the proposal building is the responsibility of one or
more relaters.
The proposal start with a problem:
Tobacco is proven bad for health
School does not sufficiently adapt to new technology

The second step is to define an objective:
How can we help discourage people from smoking?
How can we best teach our children?

Third step is to identify a solution from the proposed ones:
1We raise the tax on tobacco
2We prevent smoking in public
3 We rise tobacco tax and prohibit smoking in public.

In each of this step you may have something to say, in fact we are writing
a bill
Airesis give you the chance to make a contribution *in each of this step*,
is specially important in the last step where different solutions may be
proposed or multiple solutions may be packaged.

What you say, is called contribution, can be related to a paragraph or can
be a new solution and will be evaluated by the participants in the debate.
they can give 3 different evaluation: Like ,Don't Like , Don't know

In Airesis the debate may be hold in temporary anonymity, so that we are
not influenced by our preconception or the presence of a leader.
If chosen that feature you will be given a fictitious name and a temporary
avatar. At the end of the debate real names and avatar will be displayed.
Many time we find to agree with our most declared enemy!!

As soon as you evaluate one contribution you will be shown the result of
the other evaluations for that contribution.
You may comment on a contribution and the owner of the contribution may
edit his contribution turning the evaluation back to zero for new
evaluation. (here is where I think Airesis can be enhanced to find a better
methodology to build synthesis removing part of the &quot;weight&quot; of the
relater)

The relaters  will pick the best evaluated contribution and edit the
paragraph accordingly.
Each participants in the debate may indicate if the debate need to be
carried on  or if should be continued (this value is taken into
consideration by the quorum that is chosen for that proposal) but some of
this proposal may have a fixed closing date.

In Airesis depending on the type of proposal, different model,  are
proposed by a wizard.
Usually the final result is a set of very smart consensus build solutions
packaged in a way that schulze algorithm  help find the best to come up.

Unfortunately the quality of the relaters is the weak point and we are
working on it.
Is proven by statistical data that a poor relater may turn of participation.
We are looking at way to prevent that.

Done in this way the stakeholder have plenty to say and if they are not
saying nothing the will see anyway the best solution emerge.
We prefer to have stakeholder take action and participate in the debate
rather than have them delegate their vote.
Compared to Liquidfeedback we are way advanced, in liquidfeedback is more
of a competition between proposal.
The system is designed to bring up excellence and promote knowledge.
There still the danger to change the good construction of a proposal if a
large and organized group of participants act to damage a proposal. Nothing
compared to what we see in delegated political system under the action of
lobbyist.

Regards
Jacopo

PS please test the system and help us to figure out missing features and
enhancing existing.

</I>&gt;<i> I admit I still don&#8217;t fully understand Airesis, but my impression so far
</I>&gt;<i> is that it may emphasize voting a bit too much. Please correct me in
</I>&gt;<i> whatever way I am misapprehending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Government and governing bodies outside of government make a vast array of
</I>&gt;<i> decisions that affect out life. It can decide questions like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Should we build a swimming pool in this city park?
</I>&gt;<i>    - Should we send troops to country X to intervene in a massacre?
</I>&gt;<i>    - Should we ban texting while driving?
</I>&gt;<i>    - Should we have schools teach a particular new curriculum?
</I>&gt;<i>    - Should we raise the tax on tobacco?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are just random examples. The array of decisions is seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> infinite. And you can easily be a stakeholder in ever single one of those.
</I>&gt;<i> But you cannot reasonably vote on all of those decisions with a fully
</I>&gt;<i> informed opinion. It is impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I agree that delegation is not the answer. I think the real problem
</I>&gt;<i> and the real answer here is that we are asking the wrong questions. All of
</I>&gt;<i> the above are yes/no questions. They assume that there can only be two
</I>&gt;<i> choices, and they invite ignorant participation (anyone can say yes or no
</I>&gt;<i> to those for any number of reasons).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, those above questions could be stated as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - How can we affordably make this park serve the community better?
</I>&gt;<i>    - How can we effectively intervene in the massacre in country X?
</I>&gt;<i>    - How can we address safety issues with texting while driving?
</I>&gt;<i>    - How can we best teach our children?
</I>&gt;<i>    - How can we help discourage people from smoking?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For each of those questions, it is not a matter of voting yes or no, but
</I>&gt;<i> of building solutions that can get *everyone* to vote for them. The
</I>&gt;<i> process may be much longer, but the result would be orders-of-magnitude
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isn&#8217;t that a much stronger, more workable, more persistent form of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy? One that builds solutions for *everyone*?

</I>&gt;<i> is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and
</I>&gt;<i> this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;<i> In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include

</I>&gt;<i> modified and developed as we learn from experience and different
</I>&gt;<i> methodology)  I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i> When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the
</I>&gt;<i> participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not

</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency:
</I>&gt;<i> There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy
</I>&gt;<i> (Airesis Team) is to analyze each problem and then brake it down in to
</I>&gt;<i> smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;<i> So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in synthesis
</I>&gt;<i> by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;<i> The second strategy is to use different voting system for different
</I>&gt;<i> solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway
</I>&gt;<i> or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For
</I>&gt;<i> that we will choose the mathematical formula that show to give the best
</I>&gt;<i> result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm  and so forth. The
</I>&gt;<i> participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is fundamentally a

</I>&gt;<i> If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arguments for it and see what you think:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subversive effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thus circumventing your restrictions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what other people may say.
