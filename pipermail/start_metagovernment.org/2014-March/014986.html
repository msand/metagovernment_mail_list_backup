<PRE>Just been playing with a &quot;Private Conversation&quot;, as a result of which 
I've just sent this to the developers:
*************
Just spent 45 mins creating a private conversation which I intended to 
send to you and a few others with a view to encouraging feedback and 
positive developments.

Overall I'm impressed but one MAJOR failing seems to be that, having 
created it, I saw NO way to obtain its absolute url or any other way to 
&quot;save&quot; it. As a result I have no way back to it, and no way to send you 
or other people to it.

Fortunately, as an experienced hack myself, I anticipated this potential 
problem and made sure I backed myself up as I went. Here, therefore, is 
the &quot;timeline&quot; of comments I made. I look forward to future 
developments!

************** My &quot;timeline&quot;

Harry - 48 minutes ago
As a passionate supporter of &quot;debate engineering&quot; (a fundamental 
requirement for genuine democracy) I welcome all attempts at improving 
our ability to hold intelligent Dialogue. I congratulate the authors of 
Incoma for this exciting attempt. They've got a lot of things right.

Unfortunately they've got a few things wrong as well so this is at 
attempt to see if the Incoma engine can be used to convey such thoughts 
back to its creators.

Harry - 47 minutes ago
First problem: How do we Undo a &quot;rating&quot;?
We may have accidentally upvoted the wrong &quot;thought&quot; or we may have 
changed our mind. I see no way to change the rating.

Harry - 42 minutes ago
How do we delete a comment/thought?
I can see an argument for blocking such deletions if the thought has 
been &quot;connected&quot; to by others but if it remains unconnected, the author 
(only) should be allowed to delete it.

Harry - 38 minutes ago
On creation of this Thread (my first), I was warned that if I make it 
editable (which I have) then ANYONE who contributes to it can edit ANY 
of the comments.

That's bizarre and presumably arises from the fact that, so far, the 
Incoma Authors are not mandating registration, so they have no way of 
knowing who is editing what. That needs to be fixed pronto if you want 
people to start taking it seriously.

ONLY the author of a comment should be permitted to edit a comment.

Harry - 34 minutes ago
This is an example of the need to be able to delete your own comments. I 
pointed out the need to be able to change Type of Reply and Type of 
Connection. Then found out how to do both. Tried to delete this 
unnecessary comment. Found I couldn't so had to amend it instead.

You'll see I've had to repeat this comment as a reply to the comment 
I've &quot;connected&quot; this one to because I can't delete this instance.


Harry - 24 minutes ago
Note there is no clue to the order in which these comments were made. 
Yet if you read them in the wrong order, it renders the conversation 
incoherent.

Why not - for nodes at the same level at least - display a number which 
reflects the order in which the comments were added?

Harry - 18 minutes ago
This is an example of the need to be able to delete your own comments. I 
pointed out the need to be able to change Type of Reply and Type of 
Connection. Then found out how to do both. Tried to delete this 
unnecessary comment. Found I couldn't so had to amend it instead.

Note, also that the first para appears in another note directly linked 
to the initial thought instead of the parent this one links to. 
Obviously I should have been able to delete the original version of this 
thought when I realised where I should have put it and corrected it.

Insteady, I've had to put a clumsy &quot;connection&quot; from the original to the 
comment I really wanted it to link to. Wouldn't take many errors like 
that to make the whole thing unreadable

Harry - 16 minutes ago
I note, also that as soon as I reply to even my own comments, they are 
immediately &quot;rated&quot;.

An author should not be able to rate their own comments!

Harry - 10 minutes ago
If we were using Incoma for &quot;serious&quot; debates, I would want to mandate 
comments as a requirement for rating. In other words you wouldn't be 
able to upvote or downvote another comment without saying why

This should (at least) be an option for the &quot;owner&quot; of the conversation 
to stipulate when they create it.

Harry - 8 minutes ago
Again, probably because there is, as yet, no registration required, the 
system is a SPAM magnet and can easily be abused to place commercial 
messages, links to malware and trolling.

Needs fixing before serious use

Harry - 5 minutes ago
Even after registration, we will no doubt still suffer some abuse (esp 
Trolling) and it would be useful to have both an abuse indicator (so we 
could label comments as abuse to warn others) and also a filtering 
system so users could choose not to see posts (enough users have) 
labelled as abuse

Harry - 39 seconds ago
Filtering is partially implemented by the ability to show/hide types of 
connection or thought. If &quot;abuse&quot; became a label, the legend panel could 
easily hide all such comments labelled &quot;abuse&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Questions that immediately leapt to mind after trying the tutorial in

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1 How do you undo a rating (eg error or change of mind)?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2 Some of the terms need explaining (eg &quot;equivalence&quot;)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from known trolls, commercial interests, sock puppets etc)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4 Would it be possible to mandate comments as a condition of rating?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can't downvote/upvote without explaining why)
