<PRE>Hi Ed hi Max hi everyone
I try to give another example. and how I would limit the power of the
relater
Given the problem given the objective we start to work on the solution.

The current way is one or more relater obliged to incorporate into the
proposal the contribution that are being evaluated positively by the
participant during the debate time frame. At the same time there is another
evaluation that is the readiness of the proposal.
This obligation and the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the relater(s) are the weak spot.

A contribution is a text with amendment, correction, ideas, concept that
can be evaluated with a + or a - or a neutral vote, (we use smiley). If a
contribution get a number of positive evaluation the relater will integrate
the contribution in the selected area where the contribution is placed.
The integration is subjective! Here is the weakness! The relater may have
misunderstood the sense of it, or use poor language into the integration
etc etc.

On the other hand it can be exactly the opposite you have a smart dedicated
relater that do an excellent work! we can't rely e-democracy on luck!

 My approach that is not implemented because of limited resources
(programming expenses) is to change this current system with this:
I select a part of the proposal or a spot in the proposal or solution I
want to change or I can even start a new solution. THis action create an
area called discussion area, where I am the &quot;owner&quot;. The discussion area is
like a forum and next to it there is the synthesis area, every single
participant (as soon as you enter your point of view you become a member)
of the discussion have right to edit  in the synthesis area of the
discussion.
2 cases, either you agree or you don't agree and as we want to build an
amendment or a solution or a simple rephrase we kick out who disagree, we
need to complete our little process productively so is a work of consensual
debate. Let's imagine a moderation. If the discussion is held with openness
the person who disagree will have the chance to convince the colleague and
change their vision with arguments. If he fail to do so he will be kicked
out (taken away the right to edit the synthesis), he can open another
discussion area where he will &quot;rule&quot; and look for consensus on his point of
view. In this case we will have two antithetic position that will generate
two different solution.  Somehow after some time the synthesis will be
exhausted and the discussion will be closed, now the synthesis will be
evaluated and will get from the beginning the positive evaluation from the
peole that participate end eventually from other that read the synthesis
and agree with it. The relater will now integrate the synthesis in the
proposal AS IS! The work is a collective work!
If there is an antithesis that receive sufficient  positive evaluation this
will be Integrated in the proposal as a different solution. When there is
no more solution and open discussion it is also the time that people will
evaluate the readiness of the proposal and we will go to the final vote. In
case of two solution we are going to decide by majority if there is more
than two solution we use the Schulze vote.

The end

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the delay, Jacopo. I think I better understand your approach
</I>&gt;<i> now. Some of the other systems here take a similar approach, but with less
</I>&gt;<i> distinction between the debate and the vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the relaters are a potential weak-spot, then one option would be to
</I>&gt;<i> remove them. What Votorola does, for example, is simply have all
</I>&gt;<i> participants act in the function of your relaters, and they also have no
</I>&gt;<i> distinction between the small votes (like/dont-like/dont-know) and the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;main&quot; vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Their approach is to allow anyone to submit a proposal, and to have
</I>&gt;<i> participants vote for whatever proposal they support. If no one proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> clearly winning, then it is up to the proposers to work to try to convince
</I>&gt;<i> the supporters of the other proposals to support their proposal. Usually
</I>&gt;<i> the way to do this is to incorporate parts of other proposals or to build
</I>&gt;<i> syntheses in order to make new proposals that work for competing interests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The weakness of this approach is that it can involve a lot of reading,
</I>&gt;<i> which hurts participation. The weakness of the Airesis approach, as you
</I>&gt;<i> note, is that it is dependent on one person (never a good thing for real
</I>&gt;<i> democracy). Also, in Airesis I see much less opportunity for synthesis.
</I>&gt;<i> What if there is big disagreement on a proposal, and the only way to get
</I>&gt;<i> everyone board is to propose something radically different from what is
</I>&gt;<i> being worked on. How does that happen?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be very interested in hearing others' perceptions on the above

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you say, is called contribution, can be related to a paragraph or can

</I>&gt;<i> they can give 3 different evaluation: Like ,Don't Like , Don't know
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Airesis the debate may be hold in temporary anonymity, so that we are
</I>&gt;<i> not influenced by our preconception or the presence of a leader.
</I>&gt;<i> If chosen that feature you will be given a fictitious name and a temporary
</I>&gt;<i> avatar. At the end of the debate real names and avatar will be displayed.
</I>&gt;<i> Many time we find to agree with our most declared enemy!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as you evaluate one contribution you will be shown the result of
</I>&gt;<i> the other evaluations for that contribution.
</I>&gt;<i> You may comment on a contribution and the owner of the contribution may
</I>&gt;<i> edit his contribution turning the evaluation back to zero for new
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation. (here is where I think Airesis can be enhanced to find a better
</I>&gt;<i> methodology to build synthesis removing part of the &quot;weight&quot; of the
</I>&gt;<i> relater)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The relaters  will pick the best evaluated contribution and edit the
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i> Each participants in the debate may indicate if the debate need to be
</I>&gt;<i> carried on  or if should be continued (this value is taken into
</I>&gt;<i> consideration by the quorum that is chosen for that proposal) but some of

</I>&gt;<i> Is proven by statistical data that a poor relater may turn of

</I>&gt;<i> We are looking at way to prevent that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Done in this way the stakeholder have plenty to say and if they are not
</I>&gt;<i> saying nothing the will see anyway the best solution emerge.
</I>&gt;<i> We prefer to have stakeholder take action and participate in the debate
</I>&gt;<i> rather than have them delegate their vote.
</I>&gt;<i> Compared to Liquidfeedback we are way advanced, in liquidfeedback is more

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever way I am misapprehending.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Government and governing bodies outside of government make a vast array
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of decisions that affect out life. It can decide questions like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Should we build a swimming pool in this city park?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Should we send troops to country X to intervene in a massacre?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Should we ban texting while driving?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Should we have schools teach a particular new curriculum?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Should we raise the tax on tobacco?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Those are just random examples. The array of decisions is seemingly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> infinite. And you can easily be a stakeholder in ever single one of those.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But you cannot reasonably vote on all of those decisions with a fully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> informed opinion. It is impossible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I agree that delegation is not the answer. I think the real problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the real answer here is that we are asking the wrong questions. All of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the above are yes/no questions. They assume that there can only be two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choices, and they invite ignorant participation (anyone can say yes or no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to those for any number of reasons).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead, those above questions could be stated as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - How can we affordably make this park serve the community better?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - How can we effectively intervene in the massacre in country X?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - How can we address safety issues with texting while driving?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - How can we best teach our children?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - How can we help discourage people from smoking?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For each of those questions, it is not a matter of voting yes or no, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of building solutions that can get *everyone* to vote for them. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process may be much longer, but the result would be orders-of-magnitude
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Isn't that a much stronger, more workable, more persistent form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy? One that builds solutions for *everyone*?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified and developed as we learn from experience and different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methodology)  I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be in the agenda!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that (easy to do)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Efficiency:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Airesis Team) is to analyze each problem and then brake it down in to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in synthesis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The second strategy is to use different voting system for different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we will choose the mathematical formula that show to give the best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm  and so forth. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making them better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be present during the vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rarity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each sub-prolem rather than vote a single bill with hundred decision in it.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> arguments for it and see what you think:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> subversive effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thus circumventing your restrictions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what other people may say.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know if I understand correctly your question but I think the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> answer relies in the fact that each user vote ONE time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> therefore a good E-Democracy platform should have a strong certification

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If your question is about some sort of Karma to apply to the users, i
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> believe the best way is statistical information of the activity, in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis.eu &lt;<A HREF="http://airesis.eu/">http://airesis.eu/</A>&gt;, for example, we start to collect data
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about users participation based on the vote they receive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the contributions that are posted in the different proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The analysis of the activity based on big numbers will permit us to

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> post that question here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> s
