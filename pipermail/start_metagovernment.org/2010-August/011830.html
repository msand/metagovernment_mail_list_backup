<PRE>Thomas and Alex,

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3813&amp;a=3683#_1">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3813&amp;a=3683#_1</A>

Here you are telling the public that they're not allowed to do
anything commercial with the domain name.  So if they need to lend a
sub-domain to a helpful business firm (say), they'll have to keep that
a secret from the caretakers till *after* the ownership transfer.

But it's the public's domain name.  The whole idea is to transfer the
ownership to them.  So we shouldn't pretend that we can still somehow
retain control over it, or dictate usages, when actually we cannot.

I think I can finally answer (sorry for the delay): You're saying that
the caretakers can't agree to transfer the name to the public, at
least not within a reasonable span of time.  Months go by, and still
they are arguing about it.

The public won't wait around for 2 years.  They will quickly get a new
domain name (and new caretakers) and try again.  So we should make it
clear that we don't expect them to wait forever:

Also, I think we should allow the caretakers to resolve their
differences and reach a new agreement in the first place, as an
alternative to vetoing the whole contract:
