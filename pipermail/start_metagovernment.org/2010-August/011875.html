<PRE>Branding/rebranding would imply that we have a new wine to sell, or an
old wine in a new bottle.  But I believe we have an *old* wine in an
*old* bottle and we just invented (or reinvented) the corkscrew.

I want to share a post of Alex Rollin's, because I think it's
brilliant and apropos: *

&gt;<i> I would like to add in though that my recent experience tells me
</I>&gt;<i> that I simply do not have enough of a command of the vocabulary of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;real democracy&quot; process to be much help in educating others.  I
</I>&gt;<i> may be usefully underselling myself but I also feel that &quot;involving&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> others in a process means we, I, provide others with a guide to the
</I>&gt;<i> tools and vocabulary I'm using and perhaps even make some, or a
</I>&gt;<i> whole lot, of room for them to customize the language so they are
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I want to give a big heartfelt +1 to any scenario that aids small
</I>&gt;<i> groups in grabbing hold of real democracy locally, in person, so
</I>&gt;<i> that the online process makes sense.  ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of learning is needed for this &quot;natural&quot; mode to feel natural
</I>&gt;<i> again.  Small group &quot;real democracy games&quot; could go a long way in
</I>&gt;<i> that effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think one of the tricks here is for us to make something ideal,
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, possible, and real, for the first time.. Ever?  Well, I
</I>&gt;<i> think you knpw what I mean.  Not just make it real, but share the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for others to go throigh the process of inventing it for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves, from scratch, whenever they need to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking of the quote &quot;not one is free until all are free.&quot;  we
</I>&gt;<i> could do to keep this in mind.  The meekest amongst us still have
</I>&gt;<i> the tools and skills to participate.  In addition each has access to
</I>&gt;<i> a democraric &quot;artiste&quot;, those who can help them turn their work into
</I>&gt;<i> art.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was in a meeting today and could feel the wish welling up in me
</I>&gt;<i> that the group could continue to do business online and i also know
</I>&gt;<i> that while they might discuss online, this is not the same as
</I>&gt;<i> democracy.  The bridge for this group, though, will more than likely
</I>&gt;<i> be made in person before being taken online.
</I>

Alex probably knows what I'm going to propose (I only hope he can
forgive the metaphor).  The thing to do is to carry the bottle into
the meeting and uncork it.  Just get right to it, without ceremony.
It'll be awkward at first (lots to learn) and you'll have to make
shift (paper cups, straws, or whatever).  But it *should* work.

Enough of the metaphor (apologies).  Democracy is not wine in a
bottle, it's something entirely different (something better, we hope).
But what Alex seems to be suggesting (here and in his later posts) is
that if you haven't actually tried it, then you cannot speak of what
it *really* is.  You simply don't know.  You are trapped in the past.

I think there's only one way to escape.  Rebranding won't help.  What
you must do is:

  1. Carry the tools of democracy (the real tools) to wherever they
     *could* work.

  2. *Make* them work.  Learn first hand what the future is like.

  3. Carry what you learned back to the tool builders.  Work together
     with them.

Or am I wrong?  Is there another way?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't remember exactly where the thread is at the moment, but recently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael and I debated on this list for a while and synthesized the term
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;real democracy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The nice things about this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. It contains the word democracy, which seems important and which is much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more resonant than &quot;governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. It implies that everything else branding itself as some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;democracy&quot; is a lesser imitation... which is only too true.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I re-added this and one other (&quot;electronic direct democracy&quot;) to the
