Dear Bob Howard,

I'm Mat&#237;as, from Metagovernment Project (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>). We are
a group that supports the development and use of Internet
tools which enable the members of any community to fully participate in the
governance of that community. The Internet promises to be the future of
democracy; there is a flourishment of projects with this line of thought,
specially in the United States, as can be seen in this list:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/related.">http://www.metagovernment.org/related.</A>

I've read at democracy.org that you are listening for ideas to support,
with both your non-profit status and/or website. I'm writing to you
because we have an interesting one: Metagovernment would like to build a hub
point for all the projects that work to embetter democracy, worldwide. We
want these projects to share their experiences between them, to communicate
and aid each other, to set a portal so they can present them to the public.
We would like, also, to raise
donations and help them providing them resources.

To accomplish this task we have in mind, a fine place in the Internet is
required,
something like &quot;edemocracy.org&quot;. I saw what is behind such an important
domain... nothing;
it's for sale for a huge price. Then I tried similar ones, and found you. At
a second stage, we should
create a 501c3 too. What you are offering suits more than perfect to what we
want to do: NGO and domain. Good!

Could we talk further?

Greetings,
Mat&#237;as
