<PRE>This group has had several debates over the issue of anonymous voting;  
most recently the long thread starting here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-May/002850.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-May/002850.html</A>

Personally, I have been on both sides of the debate over time.  
Originally, I was deeply in favor of anonymity because I see it as an  
inherent feature of internet communication (take SlashDot, for  
example). Then I moved to the other side when thinking about more  
recent internet norms, where individuals are expected to stand by  
their net personality.

I still give a lot of credence to both of the above. There are very  
good arguments on both sides of the issue. But looking at recent news  
stories, I am reminded that authoritarianism is a real and present  
threat not to be lightly discounted. I am a harsh critic of so-called  
democracies such as the United States, but these societies do enjoy  
freedoms which should not be taken lightly.

The most evident recent example is the United Arab Emirates, where the  
government banned Blackberry phones because the authoritarians feel  
threatened by the fact of communication relaying through servers out  
of their control. The UAE is not alone: there are plenty of other  
authoritarian governments out there. A person who speaks up on one of  
our voting systems might face real and dire consequences.

Likewise, there are plenty of other examples outside of national  
governments. Think, for example, of corporations which can sometimes  
wield unreasonably harsh power. It is entirely imaginable that  
employees of a corporation might be fired, demoted, or otherwise  
punished for voting against the interests of their employer.

And when you consider the permanence of web-based public actions (that  
something recorded once is often archived and mirrored such that it  
can never be repressed), there ensue all kinds of additional  
ramifications for individuals. For example, imagine trying to apply  
for a job somewhere, and then having that company look into your  
voting history. Companies already read credit scores and some now do  
deep web searches; it is completely reasonable to expect they would  
evaluate public voting as well.

I know anonymous voting adds a substantial layer of complexity in  
instances where the system is trying to maintain authentication. But I  
think that eventually it will be absolutely necessary; at least as  
some kind of option.
