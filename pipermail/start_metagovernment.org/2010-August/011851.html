No.  The system would have two goals in regard to the identity of the
registrant:

  1) Authenticate it - real person, not a bot or sock puppet
  2) Hide it - nobody knows who that person is

No system can absolutely guarantee either of these.

Whatever the strength of (1), we could not offer any absolute
guarantee that people's identities would not be cracked.  It's hard to
imagine what kind of assurance we could give, especially to those who
would be most in need of it.

Whatever the strength of (2), it will be diminished if the
authentication process is administered in a society that does not
respect rights of free speech and free association.  We'll often
suspect that it's not real people who are voting, but rather the
state's security apparatus.

Putting these together: the vulnerable dissident can neither vote
safely in private, nor could we trust his vote, if he did.  So it's
truly hairy.  (OTOH public voting cannot be corrupted, it can only be
suppressed wholesale, by force.)
