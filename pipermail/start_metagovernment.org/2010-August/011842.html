That should be easy to prototype.  It's been floated in the past in
the context of the Pirate Party (I think) that their various branches
might each post a registration list on the Web.  The party's
pollservers would then combine them into their local, server-specific
voter lists.  (I think every pollserver needs to support this, so no
problem.)

But don't you guys use _in-registration.xml, that's an intermediate
list on the input side.  Here's an example of a registration list on
the output side, for use by pollservers (just 2 voters in this one):
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/_snap_report/readyTrace-1/_mountedTrace/Tor.xml">http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/_snap_report/readyTrace-1/_mountedTrace/Tor.xml</A>

Broad concepts of the registration framework are defined here:

I only meant that you should float the most crucial/difficult design
problem in a *discussion* thread.  I didn't see anything that looked
deeply problematic in your list, tho, no showstoppers *and* crucial
(but I really don't know your domain).

Re: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/P2P/Poll_Decision_Conditions">http://u.zelea.com/w/P2P/Poll_Decision_Conditions</A>

We already spoke about those, and they seem to be the biggest concern
and a poor mesh with the current design.  Current design: free speech
= no meta-rules on voting; and pollservers have now evolved into
stupid databases of raw votes for external processing by other
servers.  That, plus the complexity and specialized/bespokedness of
these rules points to a layered solution implemented in code external
to the pollservers.

OTOH, all vote eligibility is scripted.  So it's anything goes if you
can somehow impl. your rules by rejecting votes at the count stage.
Even for our primary use case (eligibility based on residency, and
authenticated by trust network) none of it is hardcoded into the
Votorola pollserver.  It's all scripted by the admin, mostly here I
think: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/poll.js">http://zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/poll.js</A>
(Or that could be just another example of code external to
pollservers.  All of the functionality in pollwiki/streetwiki belongs
to the category, too.)

But it's crucial to start w/ talk of problems not solutions, and
dialogue it in a thread.

Hope this is more helpful,
