<PRE>Hi all,

I wrote to Perry Walker at the new economics foundation (nef) to ask about
the Crowd Wise tool that the foundation has been developing (I described
this in a previous message), and to introduce Metagovernment. He has since
joined this mailing list and replied with some more information on the work
of the nef.

He told me that the testing of Crowd Wise has been at live events, whilst
the online consensus tool being developed by the nef is still at prototype
stage and not ready for public use.

He also sent me an example of &quot;Open Up&quot;, which is a tool to help individuals
form an opinion on a complex issue by presenting information and arguments
on the issue and having the user rate the arguments and add their own. See
<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/projects/open-up">http://www.neweconomics.org/projects/open-up</A>

Finally, Perry asked if one of us would like to meet in London to have a
chat and give him a better idea of what Metagovernment is all about. I'm in
Berlin myself and won't be in London for a while. Do we have any takers?

Paul
