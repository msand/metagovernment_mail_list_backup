<PRE>Hey Mike,

I see no problem in the case you describe: a caretaker withdrawing his 
pending veto and then re-announce it, over and over.
Actually this is what you force a caretaker to do, if you not allow him 
to take back his veto, once it came into effect. Plus: every other 
caretaker can easily end this process by putting in his veto and let it 
come into effect.

But again, why should the caretakers (together with the 1000 voters) not 
be able to resolve a veto even after it is in effect for 2 years 
already? I can see no problem in this either.

Thomas
