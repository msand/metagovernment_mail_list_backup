Most people don't do whatever they want and then face the consequences  
(in fact, people who do so are usually classified as criminals). For  
significant decisions, the typical human thinks through the  
consequences first, and then considers whether or not the desired  
action is worth the consequences.

Authority is the *threat* of violence (violence in the any sense of  
the term: from physical harm to limitations of freedom to violations  
of other rights). It is anticipatory. Almost all authority is wielded  
without having to apply violence, because the subjects know the  
violence is a possible consequence of misbehavior.

So it is very reasonable to expect that people will censor themselves  
simply out of the possibility that there might be some negative  
consequence in some possible future scenario.

Additionally, the above does not take into account real, physical  
violence applied by authoritarian regimes. Such governments are not  
swayed by investigative journalism. Does the UAE care about perception  
of its Blackberry decision?

In one of the links you provide, you suggest that voting is a  
reflection of the society, so it is reasonable that an oppressive  
society would show repressive voting (like the Soviet Union, where the  
Communist party always got 99% of the vote). But our systems, by their  
very nature, push against the artificial limits of national borders.  
People in repressive regimes might not be expected to show democratic  
votes on local or national issues, but what about on global or non- 
localized issues? Why should they be disenfranchised from those votes  
simply because they live in a place where public participation could  
lead to persecution?

Sure, our softwares might be banned in places like the UAE, but we  
should at least be _available_ to people who leave the country  
temporarily or who are willing to run the software subversively. With  
regards to democracy software, I try to take a neutral stance on all  
political issues and philosophies... except for authoritarianism. It  
is entirely inconsistent with our core principles.
