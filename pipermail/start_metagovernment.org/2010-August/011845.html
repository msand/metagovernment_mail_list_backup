Nice to hear from you again, Richard!

Yes, this project has proposed at least three (non-exclusive)  
solutions...

The first is like the SlashDot approach: simply allowing completely  
anonymous input, but giving it significantly less weight. This demotes  
those users from the level of trusted participant, but allows good  
anonymous contributions to be elevated to as much prominence as the  
community thinks they deserve. Of course, this applies better to  
discussion than to voting.

The second is the trust metric. There are numerous ways trust can be  
calculated, but it all comes out to the same basic principle... allow  
users to create non-identifying personas, and then have those personas  
prove themselves within the community. Any persona which has gained  
the trust of others in the community gets proportionally greater power  
within the community. Yes, one person could develop several trusted  
personas, but that's not necessarily corruption: each of those  
personas has proven itself within the community (and can be downgraded  
by the community at any time). Someone trying to set up a botnet of  
numerous, inter-trusting personas would not be able to prove  
themselves outside of their own sphere, and thus all of their input  
would collapse to that of one participant.

The third is my system of distributed administration. In terms of  
anonymous voting, it would mean that users would have to authenticate  
to the back-end system, but then could present an anonymous persona to  
the front-end. This seems open to administrator corruption, which is  
where distributed administration comes in. Any software would have any  
number instances, each of which would have independent administrators.  
Each instance would checksum all the others, such that any deviation  
from the neutral standard (the community of administrators) would be  
removed from the administration trunk.
