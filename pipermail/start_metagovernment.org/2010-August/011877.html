<PRE>Also everyone is encouraged to take a look at the history of this  
question:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=53</A>

If you see something in the history that you like, please re-enter it.  
There is nothing wrong with reviving a proposal, especially if the  
participation has changed. Participation on this question has been  
spotty, but hopefully we can ramp it up for this round. The last  
voting round had six respondents, and I think we could get higher.

Also note in the history some inputs that people entered as proposals,  
but which were meant more as discussion items, or helpful ideas. They  
are:

- phrase should indicate that the new form of government is online, or  
on the internet.
- phrase should identify 'democracy' as the form of government.
- phrase should encompass a variety of methods for generating proposals.
- The perfect phrase should both be snappy, easy to memorise, but with  
big potentiality.
- phrase should describe a system that can change or evolve more  
frequently than other methods
