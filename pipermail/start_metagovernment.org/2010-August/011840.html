</I>
It could be implemented in Votorola, or one of the other common
pollservers (when we have those).  Maybe the best approach is:

  1) Pick the decision rule that seems to be the most crucial.
  2) Step back, and ask, &quot;What problem is this rule meant to solve?&quot;
  3) Start a brainstorming thread that discusses first the *problem*,
     then the possible solutions.

This would give us a better understanding from both perspectives: what
you hope to implement in your domain; while also looking at the
existing design of the toolset/systems.

&gt;<i> At the moment I am working on something very similar, and the reason it
</I>&gt;<i> might be interesting to you is that I believe that these incremental steps
</I>&gt;<i> are an exhibit of decoupling in Votorola.  I understood what you were saying
</I>&gt;<i> before about decoupling, but I thought we had different conclusions about
</I>&gt;<i> it.  This is an example of how I would recommend it be used.  Use time and
</I>&gt;<i> voter lists (qualifications on activity).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Alex.rollin-GmailCom/G/p/owdo">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Alex.rollin-GmailCom/G/p/owdo</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
Thomas and I have confused everybody, because (despite the thread
title, and the poll description) the issue of our positions (if Thomas
agrees) is no longer the long-term ownership of the domain name.  We
only care about the transfer of control to the public.  What happens
*after* the transfer is a separate issue, a separate poll.  So it is
decoupled, in that sense.

Things I would like to do to clarify this (if consensus looks
possible):
  1) Rename &quot;caretaker&quot; to &quot;namegiver&quot;
  2) Rename &quot;supersession&quot; to &quot;donation&quot;
  3) Make purpose/scope clearer in the poll description/title.
But the immediate problem is lack of consensus on this very purpose.

On decoupling in general: I really believe we must discuss the
problems we are trying to solve, before looking at detailed solutions.
So just as for the decision rules above, I recommend starting a new
thread with a question like this: &quot;In situation S, we can forsee that
X will happen?  Isn't X a *problem*?  Don't we need a solution for
it?&quot;
