<PRE>If there is a goal, or a state of desired sophistication, that is required
by the early caretakers, for the end user/owners, that needs to be declared.
 This means that if there is a veto the user/owners know why.

In some cases a sufficient group of users may never emerge.

If this is also not OK by the custodian, then you can bet that the
user/owners will figure it out.  They will attack it and try to meet the
goals, or feel unable, back away, bad mouth it and leave.

The eternal board veto is common in many types of organizations.  I am
working on this UK stuff at the moment.  Some companies take money to sell
shares, and write it in their rules that they will not pay dividends until
the feel like it.  Nothing the users/investors can do can change this if the
board/leadership power is locked up behind a similar wall.  In some cases
this is OK.  It makes most people uncomfortable, I think, in some way, but
it helps keep the conversation clear.  It says &quot;we are going this way, not
that way.&quot;

It's possible to outline the goals for the caretaker.  I say do it.  You are
doing it.  Say:

*Endowment that ensures domain name is paid, with hosting, for 100 years.
That money can only be used for those purposes.
*User/possessor organization can take possession but ownership belongs to
caretaker or their assign
*Caretaker stil has the right to review financial records of the
user/possessor
*Poor management of the funds allows the caretaker to take back possession.

This kind of stuff seems ugly, but it should be written in plain english if
it is being considered.  If we are going to discuss, then let's discuss the
important stuff, no?  The possessor relationship, by the way, is common in
Europe.  People just get access, not ownership, of stuff. Especially land.
 It's okay for us, as little people's, to make lines in the sand in this
way.  Helps us to focus.

&gt;<i> Hey Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see no problem in the case you describe: a caretaker withdrawing his
</I>&gt;<i> pending veto and then re-announce it, over and over.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually this is what you force a caretaker to do, if you not allow him to
</I>&gt;<i> take back his veto, once it came into effect. Plus: every other caretaker
</I>&gt;<i> can easily end this process by putting in his veto and let it come into
</I>&gt;<i> effect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But again, why should the caretakers (together with the 1000 voters) not be
</I>&gt;<i> able to resolve a veto even after it is in effect for 2 years already? I can
</I>&gt;<i> see no problem in this either.
