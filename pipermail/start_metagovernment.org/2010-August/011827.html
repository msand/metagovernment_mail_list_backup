<PRE>I came across this website today which I think could be of interest to this
list.

<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/">http://www.neweconomics.org/</A>

I like their motto: &quot;economics as if the people and the planet mattered&quot;

In the section on &quot;democracy and participation&quot;, the organisation describes
a collaborative decision-making tool it has developed called Crowd Wise.

This bears many similarities to the tools being discussed and developed
here, except perhaps in the counting method, and it is already being tested
(this autumn the 1500 members of a London community football club will be
invited to use the tool). It seems that this is largely happening through
physical meetings. Although a Q&amp;A says that the foundation has &quot;already
developed a free tool for online consensus voting&quot;, I can't find this on the
website.

Here's a section of the description of Crowd Wise:

In stage one, beginning with an open question, which could be anything from
&#8216;what should we spend our money on next year&#8217; to &#8216;what&#8217;s the best way to
tackle urban poverty?&#8217;, Crowd Wise invites participants to work together to
create and refine possible answers. This is a collaborative process, where
answers can be merged, split or refined by anyone, in order to create the
most interesting, wide ranging and appealing range of possibilities.

Then, instead of voting for their favourite, each participant is asked to
rate each idea from best to worst. This reflects that in complex issues,
people&#8217;s views are rarely black and white. Rather, they may love some
options, be able to live with others and find a few completely unacceptable.
Votes are then counted (using a system called the de Borda count) in a way
which identifies which option has the broadest support. Looking at the
results, it&#8217;s easy to tell how much support each option has.
