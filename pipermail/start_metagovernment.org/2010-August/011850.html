I thought we were going to maintain G/p/owdo as a generic template for
all sorts of domain name transfers:

It makes sense because the same transfer problem will recur, for
example, whenever an area of the central wiki goes independent
(becomes a separate streetwiki/pollwiki).  In each case, the transfer
contract can be nearly identical, but the subsequent terms of
ownership cannot.  So the terms of ownership must be separately
polled.

&gt;<i> &gt; Things I would like to do to clarify this (if consensus looks

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   1) Rename &quot;caretaker&quot; to &quot;namegiver&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   2) Rename &quot;supersession&quot; to &quot;donation&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is good.
</I>
OK, but they're big changes so I'll hold out for a possible consensus
(and agreement on point 3 too) before making the changes, just to
avoid confusion.  Our diff:

Thomas wants to protect the domain name from extinction, in case the
caretakers disagree and veto the transfer before takes place.  I say
let the name die and start over ASAP with a new one (and new
caretakers).

I guess G/p/owdo settles nothing if there's no domain name to
transfer.  Before choosing a name to hang on the effort, we'll
probably wait to see who's actually working in it (day to day grind).
The workers will be the ones to choose the name (and caretakers) I
imagine.
