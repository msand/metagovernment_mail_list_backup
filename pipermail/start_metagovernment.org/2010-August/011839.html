Ah, but the spotlight will shine even more brightly on them, as the
statistical history of their hiring biases is made a public record.
Example: Manager M starts working in division D.  Henceforth 90% of
new employees hired in D turn out to be voting for the same candidates
in issues I, J, K.  Investigative journalism then uncovers the hidden
reasons for this.)

I think this and the other problems you mention were addressed in the
election methods list, last year.  Here's a summary of the arguments
and rebuttals (note, Kristofer Munsterhjelm is a voting expert):

&gt;<i> I know anonymous voting adds a substantial layer of complexity in  
</I>&gt;<i> instances where the system is trying to maintain authentication. But I  
</I>&gt;<i> think that eventually it will be absolutely necessary; at least as  
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of option.

The same EM thread touches on the theoretical problems/justifications
of private voting as an option.  The relevant posts are:

So I think you're right, we'll probably want it as an option.  But
it'll be hairy.  Some practical implementation notes here (yet to be
fleshed out): <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Proxy_blind">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Proxy_blind</A>
Speaking of hairy:

  1. We implement it as an option.
  2. Everyone filters the private votes out of their results.

People will trust the public votes more, because - on top of the
theoretical problems associated with a private vote in public contexts
(is it rational? what does it mean?) - it's harder to verify.

So if people do *want* it in the primaries (not in the general
elections, they will remain secret ballot) and if we can make it
*work*, then I agree we'll end up implementing it.  But it doesn't
look at all promising.
