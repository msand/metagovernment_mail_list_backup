<PRE>Hello.

I think this list is severely under estimating the amount of
information that is passed by the vote itself.

Who cares the information around the vote, if I can understand if a
person has voted as I have asked just by checking if that vote
combination is present.

We have been educated to think of voting as giving one preference out of a list.
This is called Plurality Rule:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Theory">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Theory</A>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system</A>

 And that is pretty safe. Because if number of people is &gt;&gt; number of
options we can safely assume that each option gets voted at least
once.

But in voting theory we use the whole list of all the options, in the
order in which the person likes them. If there are n options I would
list them all from the one I like most to the one I like least. The
problem with this is that if we have n options there are n factorial
possible lists, that is n!=n*(n-1)*(n-2)...3*2*1.
For n = 10
10!=3628800
If instead you use approval voting (like Vilfredo, but also like the
UN in deciding the next secretary of the UN - I think :-) -), then the
number of options go down to 2^n. But this is still too much.
2^10=1024.

Not to mention that Vilfredo because it does not sum votes is based on
the fact that not all possible combinations are being voted. Or the
Pareto Front would be the whole set. And you can throw the system down
the trash.


In other words, we are working on systems where the possibilities for
people to vote generally outnumber the number of people present.

And I am not even considering what happens when a person writes a proposal...

Why is this important? Because in the past this has been used to
control how people vote. In Italy for  a long time we had the
possibility to write 4 preferences next to the vote. This was used by
the Mafia to control who voted for whom. Fascists also used a similar
system.

In general the way it works is that the mafia man organises a number
of combinations all favorable to his (supported) party. Then gives to
each person instructions to vote in that way. If a person does not
vote in that way it is easy to spot because that combination is not
present in the box.

It is sad to say, but I am afraid that plurality rule is the situation
that gives best anonimity to people.

In italy then they changed the voting law. In that occasion math
professors wrote a document explaining how keeping the 4 preferences
made it possible to people to buy and sell votes. Unfortunately what
we had after that was a systen where people not express preferences
anymore. And as a result the person in charge of the list and putting
the names in the list for a party had absolute power over who get's
elected.

For all this I am now thinking that maybe we should just give up any
pretense of anonimity. Or just accept the system we have.

Maybe real democracy is possible, but anonymous real democracy might
be too much to ask from this universe; sorry if this sounds like bad
news.

Pietro
