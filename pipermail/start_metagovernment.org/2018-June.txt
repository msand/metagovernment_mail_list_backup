This is an area I'm very interested in too because these measurements
can help us with the *empirical* process of choosing features of
social and political systems. It always raises a red flag for me when
some amateur social engineer (aka SJW) says we need to, for example,
increase gender equality because this claim is usually merely a result
of their own biases and personality type, This is as an extremely poor
guide: The exact same kind of bias leads a different group of people
to facilitate the selection of authoritarian leaders who will seek to
*increase* inequality. But when you can show that increasing gender
equality (or reducing power distance, or changing a variety of other
social/cultural features) leads to increased subjective well-being
(SWB) of *all* people (not just women) in a culture it means it's good
social engineering practice to add that to the to-do list.

I think we mostly differ in emphasis: I'm not that interested in
having increasing SWB as a goal in itself, but only in using it to
help make decisions about what social/cultural norms to promote and
which to suppress. For example, this (rather formidable) paper claims
that increasing gender equality and decreasing power distance leads to
higher SWB:

Right: We should probably stick to the current technical term for this (SWB).

This is certainly better than a single question on a paper and pencil
survey, but still doesn't deal with the reporting bias issue.

Sorry, not really. This is a hot research topic, but the most
convincing evidence for me is anecdotal: My wife is from Taiwan and
even after 30 years together I'm still regularly surprised by how
different our perspectives are on what's important in life. A lot of
it is just the usual male/female differences, but cultural factors are
an even bigger issue. If you ask an Asian if they're "happy", they're
as likely as not going to respond "What difference does that make?"
and this attitude will of course be reflected in their responses on
questionnaires. Veenhoven, as is the case with most researchers
(especially in psychology), along with most of his subjects are WEIRD
(Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic
http://www.matchism.org/refs/Henrich_2010_WeirdestPeople.pdf) and they
really don't deal with east Asians or people in small-scale societies
much or very well. The issue is maybe a little better if you use SWB
instead of "happiness", but bias remains. Fortunately the research is
useful for making social engineering decisions even if you can't use
it to directly compare countries/governments/customs/etc.

I think it's more complicated than that: It's not just a matter of
vocabulary, it's just that people in some countries (and I'll avoid
the issue of whether it's genetic or cultural) just don't *think*
about the question "Am I happy?" as much as we WEIRD people do. This
leads to all kinds of systematic biases most importantly that they
tend make lifestyle choices that may exchange "happiness" for money or
family relationships or increasing their chances having a better next
life or whatever. Once they've made a choice like that any claims that
there are systematic cross-cultural differences in happiness (or even
SWB) become completely bogus. But, again, this is only a problem if
you try to set "increasing SWB" as a goal: It's not a problem if you
just use SWB assessments as a tool to help choose among alternative
social engineering tweaks.

But it's not just the measurement that's flawed, it's the underlying
philosophical claim that "happiness is what needs to be optimized". By
doing that you've taken it upon yourself to decide for The People what
it is that needs to be optimized, whereas (of course) I say what needs
to be optimized is *also* something that The People need to decide on
(in aggregate, since different people will choose to optimize
different things). And what gets optimized will be an emergent
property of the decisions they make on individual proposals, not
something they have to philosophize about and decide on first.

ok, not happiness, not SWB.
The most precise name is "affect balance". It is based on the assumption
that we have affects, that we can give them moral value and that the brain
can sum the moral values in one number. Is this more crosscultural?
Anyway, I may do philosophical decisions, I just would like to provide one
more search engine. Your philosophical decisions might be more problematic,
bacause your system needs local decision-making monopoly.
What do you think?

Subject: [MG] GCF competition results
Message-ID: <CACobxW2rhQ4JLwiQtsd5B3yPeP69HrKPaZMkwMbNXYx6ykCN=Q@mail.gmail.com>

The results of the GCF have been posted:
https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/awardees

I've read the winning proposals, and skimmed several others, and
unfortunately they all make the "Next System" competition winners look
like models of precision by comparison: Such frantic handwaving I've
never seen, at least outside postmodernist screed. I was particularly
disappointed by the "AI" entry, expecting it to flesh out exactly
*how* AI would be used to refine proposals (a tantalizing promise in
the abstract). Unfortunately the full submission contains exactly zero
additional information as to how any of it would work. The other two
winners are just UN tweaks (Argh!). None of the entries address the
fundamental flaws in misrepresentative-based decisionmaking, and yet
the 3 winners were awarded $600K each to spend on their Tahitian
vacations. But at least that means most of the prize money was
withheld and so they'll be able to run the contest again at some
point. With that in mind I sent them the following critique about a
month ago, a submission they acknowledged but I haven't heard anything
back from them since.

But I have to say overall I'm very encouraged: If that's the best of
the competition, the members of this group have a much better chance
of achieving disruption than anyone else working in this area because
at least we have *some* idea of what works and what doesn't. We also
have a definite preference for engineering over handwaving, which
seems to be relatively rare if the entrants in all of these
competitions is any guide. I recommend we redouble our efforts because
if we don't come up with a better system and get it implemented, it's
abundantly clear that no one else will either...
  Regards,
    Scott

To whom it may concern:
While I was not terribly surprised that my GCF entry (Matched Proxy
Augmented Direct Democracy, or MPADD) was not selected as a finalist
(I didn't follow the rules!), I was surprised and very disappointed in
the quality of the entries that were selected. My analysis of them
just confirms my assessment going into this process that there are
serious flaws in both the rules as stated and the process the GCF used
to judge the entries, flaws that virtually guarantee that none of the
finalists will be capable of eliminating, or even partially
correcting, the serious flaws in our existing decisionmaking systems.
Hopefully you can use this criticism to improve the process for the
next time the contest is held.

1) There is a fundamental flaw in the rules that ensures that you
never received (or at least could not accept) the only proposals that
actually could effect any change in public policy decisionmaking. The
problematic paragraph is flawed in so many ways that I must quote the
whole thing:

"The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented
within the foreseeable future. This requires that it be acceptable to
major states and the wider international community. A significant
measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement
eliminates models that rely on time-consuming and controversial
changes in the political system of individual states, e.g. models that
postulate that all states should be democracies."

This insistence on deferring to those with an inherent strong
preference for the status quo is fundamentally incompatible with the
expectation that the decisionmaking process can be changed. My entry
explicitly rejected this requirement (likely leading to its
disqualification), but I note that many of the finalists implicitly
plan to replace/bypass the existing decisionmakers without specifying
how they'd achieve this. While I acknowledge that this is a
politically sensitive area it my considered opinion is that attempt to
hide the fact that it is our goal to replace existing governments or
at least substantially reduce their power is not only dishonest but
leads to handwaving and poor design because it eliminates the need to
define how and when the transition in power will occur. Should any of
these proposals actually accrue any power leaving this transition
unspecified is also risking repeating the mistakes of Nazism and
Marxism/Leninism that led to the deaths of millions.

This rule is also based on a naive interpretation of political power
("a significant measure of civic acceptance"? Seriously?): A system
capable of replacing our existing public policy decisionmaking systems
globally and at all levels could easily be built by a small group of
volunteers (it would be a small fraction of scale of the Linux
project, for example), would require cloud computing resources that
would cost significantly less than the GCF prize amount to operate
each year, and could take over these duties within months of its
release. What remains is merely a marketing problem: Once a majority
of The People *believe* that the new system is the legitimate
government, it simply becomes that. No need for the drama of a violent
overthrow of any existing governments or even having to ask for their
approval (though it would of course be wise to have a plan for how to
deal with the minority that will resist the transition).

2) The rules specify that the contest is about decisionmaking, but
many accepted entries are actually economic models.

It might be sufficient to just specify this distinction more clearly
in the rules, but the judges too should brush up on this difference:
It seems reasonable to me to just completely reject any proposal that
emphasizes economic models, particularly those designed merely to
*fund* projects, to effect change when they leave the decisionmaking
model underspecified or in some cases even completely unspecified. It
should be obvious as to why: A functioning decisionmaking system can
bring unimaginable economic resources to bear on a problem whereas
even the most powerful economic system can be shut down with a simple
vote by a decisionmaking system that considers the new system to be a
threat to its power.

3) Many entries include proposals that have already been shown to be
unworkable or irrelevant (e.g. anything relying on blockchain
technology or Liquid Democracy).

These issues have been debated many places (slashdot, reddit, etc.),
but the most recent debates I've participated in are on the
Metagovernment mailing list (see the February and March 2018
archives):
http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/

And on the DemocracyEarth whitepaper GitHub project:
https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues

They are also discussed in some of my own projects, including the Help
system for proxyfor.me (https://www.proxyfor.me/) and in the Matchism
manifesto (http://www.matchism.org/system)

4) The judges are academics and organizational experts rather than
social engineers or visionaries and so are biased toward things that
seem familiar to them.

While one might think that having experience in government or in an
NGO would qualify one as a judge, in my considered opinion the
opposite is actually the case: These individuals have devoted their
careers to figuring out ways of gaming the system rather than having
the freedom to design a new one from scratch and so can only see new
proposals from the very narrow perspective of their own hardened
appraisal of how difficult it is to change the system from within.
Disruption *always* comes from outside, and that's also where you'll
find the best judges of technology that is designed to disrupt (e.g.,
next time ask those who have successfully instigated disruptions in
other industries to be your judges).

5) Biased toward handwaving and against functioning systems.

My guess is that the anonymity requirement was an attempt to acquire
legitimacy by imitating blind peer reviews in academia, but this is a
bad idea for two reasons. First, academia doesn't *actually* work that
way (authors and reviewers can usually figure out who everyone is
because, being experts in the field, they know who's working on what).
Secondly, these are not experiments or theories, they're supposed to
be *social engineering* proposals. And as anyone who's worked in
engineering, or technology in general, can tell you, a working
prototype is worth a mountain of handwaving proposals. By excluding
this information from the judging, particularly when you only have
managers and academics as judges, you've virtually guaranteed that the
winning proposals will be those that superficially appear to be
solutions but have fundamental flaws that make them completely
unworkable (which is my assessment of *all* of the finalists in this
round). Next time, you should *encourage* the entrants to submit
working prototypes or at least published work that fleshes out the
models and then bias the judging toward those ideas that have proven
to be workable or at least implementable.

6) No public debate forum available during entry preparation, leading
to obviously unworkable entries because they never received feedback
that would correct obvious errors and oversights (e.g., as specified
in #3 above).

Even the GCF web site seems to operate as a closed system with no
opportunity for discussion or even feedback (the email this message
was sent to is the only personal email address I found on the entire
site!) Though public debate does provide the opportunity for
time-wasting trolling, it is also by far the most efficient way to
identify deeply flawed and other crackpot ideas. If a proposal can
survive a debate in a public forum it has a vastly better chance of
being viable and implementable. And the time to do this is during
proposal preparation, not after judging as you seem to propose now.

7) It kind of bothered me that the rules seem to indicate that winner
could just take the 5 mil and retire to Tahiti. I would have liked to
see the "prize" be more like funding for a grant proposal, with a
specific work product promised. It would seem reasonable to me to do
that for this year's "winners" too: Have them prepare a proposal for
how much they need and what they'll produce if they get that, then
fund based on this additional information. I would recommend against
what seems to be the current plan which looks to me like attempting to
create ad-hoc groups to make mash-ups of the proposals and then try to
implement those Frankenproposals...

If anyone would like to discuss any of these items I remain at your service.

You can read the whole thing at:
https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-guidelines-on-measuring-subjective-well-being_9789264191655-en#page1

It's wide ranging document with a *lot* of (tedious) detail on how to
do surveys (i.e., the kind of stuff you learn in graduate school in
psychology/political science/public policy/etc.) But it does address
this issue of cultural differences in responses and the various
analogs of SWB, so it's worth skimming for anyone interested in this
stuff. Again, IMHO it's good stuff for evaluating social engineering
design, but I still don't see how setting SWB as a *goal* is really
going to get you anything near what we'd get from simply empowering
The People to make the public policy decisions that affect them.

I think this is why I consider myself more as a social engineer than
as a philosopher. Research and philosophizing can help you out when
you get stuck, but if the way forward to implementation is clear,
they're merely a distraction.

And it seem that it is philosophy that divides us. It is difficult to talk
about personal philosophy, it is scary and may be painful. I hope we are
both ready for it.
I see persons more as emotional beings. In my opinion the whole
"rationality" thing is here just to serve emotions.
Also I am not entirely in the "idea of progress", progress is meaningless
if you do not enjoy life while progress is done. If we push too strong for
progress, I think that we believe that we will enjoy life later. So the
idea of enjoyment and emotions is there in "progress", just in an odd way.
And Eudaimonia feels like progress. Is it like progress?

I will try to sum it up again.
1. Objective existence is meaningless.
2. Subjective existence is meaningful if is felt as positive, felt like a
positive affect.

Is there anything else that gives existence meaning? Why optimize anything
else that is not "the meaning"? :)

Kind regards

This is Haidt's proposal, and I think it is well supported by the
neuroscience:  I just finished Sapolsky's "Behave: The Biology of
Humans at Our Best and Worst" (book club) and it cites Haidt and
provides a lot of background as to why this is a good model for human
behavior. I wouldn't go so far as to use the term "serve", but would
agree that we waste a *lot* of our intellectual capabilities, perhaps
even a majority, on justification/rationalization and in figuring out
ways to game our social systems.

BS: Look into this thing called "delayed gratification". It's the main
thing that separates successful humans from the rest. "No pain, no
gain" is the modern athlete's cliche for this, and I believe it's a
useful rule of thumb in almost every domain.

Why I like "eudaimonia", at least as Plato and other early
philosophers conceived of it, is that it least has an element of
objective assessment to it. The problem with using SWB as a metric,
and especially with using it as a goal, is that it doesn't provide any
check on exploitative behavior (or lack of virtue, as Plato would call
it). For example, in a society that allows slavery, you can have very
high SWB because those who are not slaves benefit from the production
of those who are. And of course the SWB of slaves doesn't enter into
the equation because, well, they're not people. Even that OECD report
mentions at least twice how the Israeli's SWB scores reflect how
they've gamed the system by not counting the unimaginable suffering
they continuously inflict on the Palestinians. But the same goes for
SDAPs in all domains (organized crime, misrepresentative democracy,
the US advertising and financial services industries, any country with
a large immigrant labor force, etc.): The people within the exploiting
group have high SWB scores whereas those they are exploiting are a
minority and usually a substantially undercounted minority. The old
usage of eudaimonia has a correction for this because what is a good
life also includes social feedback on whether the individual's
behavior is/was good for the group, not just for themselves. I believe
people (at least neurotypicals) internally do this calculation
automatically and this will be reflected in their decisionmaking even
if it's hard to quantify in a survey. Which, again, is why I recommend
that we concentrate on fixing the decisionmaking system and that
increasing "happiness" will just be an emergent phenomenon of using a
system that actually reflects the preferences of the majority.

I think this is a good idea.  But what would be the result:  search
results that lead you to more happiness sites?  Is that quantifyable
by text analysis?

Hi Marxos,
thank you. The result is a search engine that is trying to provide you with
results that will make you and other users happy in long-term.
Text analysis may be useful when there is no user with the site or page
(page = search result under analysis) in her history. Then you may try to
guess the content effect by other pages on the site or by e.g. searching
for some keywords like "subjective well-being", affect, happiness,
university, etc.
Does it make sense?

As for the Tree of Life, there is a lot of ideals, still I have not seen
any studies that show, that this is what raises your affect balance in
society in long term. But one thing I am sure, these ideas will find some
specific group of users and will make them happy and maybe even support
happiness of other not so idealistic users.
What do you think?

Scott,

I was hoping that you will reply even to the email I will repost now :)
I will try to sum it up again.
1. Objective existence is meaningless.
2. Subjective existence is meaningful if is felt as positive, felt like a
positive affect.

Is there anything else that gives existence meaning? Why optimize anything
else that is not "the meaning"? :)

Other replies are inline...

My main goal is not succes. I just wanted to say that the if the average
affect balance is not higer with delayed gratification than it is not worh
it. But it guess it will be quite often that the delayed gratification will
make your average higher.

Well cannot automate eudaimonia measurement and correct it by affect
balance, but I can automate affect balance measurement and correct the
algorithm by eudaimonia.
I know there is mo where the basic algorithm needs to be modified, but I
got not summary yet.

This ended up in my spam folder, not sure why. Good on you for sending the
letter. And agree with the disappointing results.

As for the measurement and goal distinction. I am not sure what to expect...
In the first phase, the goal of the Positive Affect Search Engine is
simple. Maximize affect balance of individual users.
Next, we will see if it will hurt the common sense of justice, equality.
Whether there will be some detrimental stable social formations, that will
resist the power of the basic algorithm, etc.

Well, to return your job... Do you think that designing systems for
societies with different psychological health is different?

So, I was thinking again :D and ...
I could even make it that the user will be able to switch philosophy(goal)
of the search engine slightly. Like she may need to focus on her average
personal or total personal affect first and she may switch to public
average affect later.
Still, imho, at first the options will mean pretty much the same, because
the sampling and computation error is likely to be more significant than
the difference between the goals.
What do you think?

Michal

Subject: [MG] Any thoughts on shadowing a local government?
Message-ID: <CACobxW0+cFOFwwoSURb=tuwodTdUFGs1g13t_e+Z3oHpXU=_6w@mail.gmail.com>

I've got proxyfor.me updated to the latest versions of the frameworks
and the bugs fixed and am setting it up to do a shadow of a local
government for the next round of beta testing. Any of you have any
experience or suggestions for how/where to do this?

Some of the issues/constraints:
1) It's of course got to be an English-speaking area (I've got a
design for wiring in automatic translation, but that will have to wait
for some future version).

2) One of the things I plan to test is the proposal of allowing people
to collect their name off of the public voter rolls to do
authentication (I'm planning to allow people outside the area to
participate, but to keep the votes separated (registered in the
locality vs. other)). In Colorado that database is available for $50
(it's *much* more expensive in most other states, and many of them
require you to contact *each county* to build a statewide list).
Colorado also has an easy-to-use web site that will allow people to
look up their registration. I'm thinking to key off of the voterID
field, which is something no one would know or be able to spoof unless
it's their own registration (they use their name, zip, and birthday on
the State's site to look up their voterID, and the birthday isn't in
the public database). Unless of course they bought the database
themselves: I'm thinking to check for fraud via that by recording some
sort of device fingerprint to make sure that no more than a few
account creations come from any one machine. There are several
libraries out there that do this, and if a machine is flagged we then
use that to block entire IP address ranges. Given the massive number
of attacks against matchism.org from Russia and Ukraine  I've had to
deal with (they've even cracked all of the CAPTCHA routines!) I'm
tempted to just ban those entire countries from accessing proxyfor.me
until we're ready to replace their governments with new ones that
aren't so tolerant toward, or even directly engaging in, this sort of
antisocial behavior.

3) The locality has got to have good public information sites,
including all the handouts that the local council members use to make
their decisions.

4) Choosing a combined city+county is appealing because ultimately
we'll get to dealing with the revenue side (budgeting), and the
majority of that comes from property taxes which are set by counties.
Surprisingly there are only a couple dozen examples of this in the US,
so I may have to work around this somehow eventually.

5) Even so, I'm going to have to extensively prune the list of
proposals: As is the case for the US congress the majority of things
voted on at the City/County level are non-substantive (like
recognizing national hot-dog day!) and there's no need to waste The
People's time on that crap.

I'm mostly looking at Denver (around 700K population), which meets all
the requirements above, but would like to consider others even if they
don't. The tradeoffs seem to be that big cities have a lot more varied
topics, but most of that relates to managing concessions (Denver city
council spends almost half of its time dealing with the airport and
the various sports and entertainment venues they own). That's boring
and IMHO not something the government should be micromanaging anyway
(i.e., the management itself should be contracted out). Boulder
(population 100K) would actually be almost ideal because of the
manageable size combined with a high participation rate (more people
typically show up for Boulder city council meetings than in Denver
despite the huge population difference, and Boulder has the most
awesome access to documents of any city I've seen), but I frequently
have to deal with the City of Boulder for various reasons (mostly
related to our rental properties) and so am somewhat reluctant to
paint a target on my back...

Any other factors or places I should consider?
  Regards,
    Scott

dealing with anti-socials is a real thing, however they to need to be

As you consider translating in other languages, i can share the experience
of Airesis.
Language files remain separated from software in a paraghraph numbered file
that when posted on crowdin translation specifically designed web site,
this permit us to receive a lot of volunteer translators and we where able
to translate in 13 languages at no cost. If proxyfor.me is opensource, the
crowdin service is free.
I will suggest also to consider registering domain for the specific
language where will be used, in italian proxyfor.me does not mean nothing
and will not be considered with that name

Ciao

I considered this, but ruled it out as too unwieldy: Not only do you
have to translate the proposal but *all* of the supporting material
*and* all of the posts anyone makes about it. Worse, unlike automated
translation we inherently can't trust human translation because of the
inevitable bias introduced (perception influenced by personality type
at best, deliberate attempts to mislead at worst). I've even ruled out
coding the language in the URL as you sometimes see
(https://www.whatever.org/en/someurl) because bookmarks and marketing
become a nightmare if you do that. Instead the translation will be
automatic for *each* URL with target language set as a user preference
selected from a toplevel menu in the menu bar. Chrome already
automatically does a serviceable job at this now when navigating
around in a site in a different language and we can make this even
more seamless in a site designed to support it. We even have multiple
choices of translators now: AWS just introduced their own alternative
to Google Translate. Automatic translation isn't perfect and I'm sure
it's better for us English speakers than for everyone else (I've used
it a fair amount lately, mostly reading about the Rousseau and LQFB
systems), but it'll continue to get better and, after all, we've got
to consider this a long-term project ;-)

Unlike, say, "Airesis" which makes sense in every language ;-) We may
need to do this eventually, but they'll all have to be simple
redirects to be used for marketing, not actual mirror sites...

    Scott

PS: I'm kind of surprised that no one has posted any horror stories
about dealing with the core problem in my post: How to shadow an
existing government. Is it really the case that no one has done this
yet?

PPS: To save a little space I'll reply to harold here:

Dealing with anti-social *individuals* I think is a relatively easy
problem compare with dealing with coordinated attacks by
organizations, especially state-sponsored groups. If any of these DD
systems gains enough traction to start to be seen as a reasonable form
of government the attacks it will have to withstand from autocratic
regimes will make what the Russians did in the 2016 US election look
like "pong" by comparison.
