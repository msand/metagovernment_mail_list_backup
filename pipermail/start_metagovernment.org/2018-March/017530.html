&gt;<i> Thanks for posting this. I've added <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">support at united.vote</A> to the CC list as sort of an invite to participate here.
</I>Frankly, this list is too obscure to expect people to come here. True, there is a small number of prolific and eloquent posters here. But their effort would be much better spent by discussing DD and LD elsewhere. Reddit would be by far a better place.

&gt;<i> 1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I realized this...
</I>Do you even go out and vote in elections? If so, you do have preferences, which means you can select a better representative. &quot;I trust exactly zero&quot; ? Sorry, this is just BS.

&gt;<i> 2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a serious Catch-22 issue
</I>What is the problem? You do not want to pay $1 or you do not have a separate credit card with a small credit limit for situations like this? Sorry, this is just BS.

&gt;<i> but IMHO you have to err on the side of not putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this means making the system security very weak.
</I>You should really talk to people outside of this list to learn what they think about such an attitude. Your site is polluted by bot votes. Is that your preference?


&gt;<i> 3) This project reminds me a lot of <A HREF="http://placeavote.com/">http://placeavote.com/</A> (now defunct) 
</I>
It means you do not get it. PlaceAVote had exactly zero LD implemented. LD is central to United Vote.

&gt;<i> and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes relying on US house/senate bills 
</I>
A real world aspect of the system is good, not bad. I do not want to vote on giving more rights to primates (your toy bill).

&gt;<i> (which are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them) 
</I>
LD addresses this. And you are making a mistake of trying to change the world to fit your tool, as apposed to designing a tool suitable for the real world. I agree with Matteo on that.

&gt;<i> Given that I've done a relatively fresh critique of &quot;Liquid Democracy&quot; for the DemocracyEarth project, I'll just link to that. 
</I>
Thanks, I will check it later.
Sergey



Again, IMHO ifyou're working in this area but don't have that Kling paper completely
memorized, or if you haven't built specific remedies for the flaws
they found in LQFB into your project, you're just wasting everyone's
time:

&gt;<i> Dear Members of the Metagovernment list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to bring to your attention a liquid democracy project that is
</I>&gt;<i> currently taking shape thanks to the effort of United Vote
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://united.vote/">https://united.vote/</A>). I am in no way affiliated with this organization,
</I>&gt;<i> but I do think it is a great and badly needed initiative. The project is
</I>&gt;<i> very real, there are candidates
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/dsernst/videos/10215788744381644/">https://www.facebook.com/dsernst/videos/10215788744381644/</A>) who are running
</I>&gt;<i> for office on a liquid democracy platform developed by United Vote. To my
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge, this is the most significant attempt at infusing liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> into the US politics. United Vote site lets you vote on any congressional
</I>&gt;<i> bill (<A HREF="https://united.vote/legislation">https://united.vote/legislation</A>), either directly or via proxies. The
</I>&gt;<i> votes of constituents are used to grade their representatives
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://united.vote/legislators">https://united.vote/legislators</A>) with the goal of creating transparent
</I>&gt;<i> accountability records. This is only the first phase of the project. The
</I>&gt;<i> second phase will aim at making the votes binding by electing candidates
</I>&gt;<i> that will pledge to follow the decisions of their constituencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I encourage you to take a look at the site (<A HREF="https://united.vote/">https://united.vote/</A>), better
</I>&gt;<i> yet register, better yet get ID verified to start voting, delegating or
</I>&gt;<i> becoming a delegate representing other people. You can get a good idea of
</I>&gt;<i> how the site works even without registration. If you are not a US citizen
</I>&gt;<i> you can still register to see the system from a user perspective. However,
</I>&gt;<i> to become an eligible proxy (delegate) you would need to go through the ID
</I>&gt;<i> verification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can discuss the project with its founder, David Ernst, for example, on
</I>&gt;<i> Reddit (<A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/liquidvote/">https://www.reddit.com/r/liquidvote/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please share your opinion about the project and experience with the site.
