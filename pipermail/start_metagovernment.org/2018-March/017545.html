&gt;<i> Other than a few wingnuts like Rand Paul and Bernie that I'd likely each assign some weight to if I could split by topic area (Paul for defense, Bernie for social program reform, Warren for regulation, etc.) 
</I>
So, even you can find it useful. Delegation by topics is not currently implemented, I think it should, and hope it will be. But again, it is not limited to the members of Congress. Anyone can be your delegate.

&gt;<i> Life is too short to spend weeks or months of it trying to undo an identity theft.
</I>I did not expect such level of cowardice from a revolution advocate :)

&gt;&gt;<i> I do not remember that. You may be confusing something. PlaceAVote did not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have an ID verification, they only had plans for it.
</I>
&gt;<i> Nope, they actually did this: <A HREF="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/congress-is-broken-that-doesnt-mean-tech-can-fix-it/">https://www.wired.com/2015/10/congress-is-broken-that-doesnt-mean-tech-can-fix-it/</A>
</I>
What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV? This may end in an embarassement.

&gt;<i> My father (a social psychologist) actually ran a system like proxyfor.me (albeit matching people to existing representatives rather than to each other) back in the 1970s because he recognized even back then that people are incapable of picking appropriate representatives for themselves. He's helped me with this one some because here it is more than 40 years later and he still hasn't given up hope that eventually people will see the light ;-)
</I>Great story. Too bad such a system looks too opaque for me to ever want to use.

&gt;<i> And you're saying you prefer them to the example proposals in proxyfor.me? Who's a liar now?
</I>I was not saying anything about proxyforme. I only said your statement of me never carefully looking at congressional bills was absolutely false. Basically, a lie.

&gt;<i> Don't get me started on this because one of the things that's been taking up enormous amount of my time the past few months has been both my wife's and my doctor's failures to properly diagnose and treat endocrine/hormone problems we have (e.g., in her case I believe that probably 90% of the cases of Hashimoto's out there aren't diagnosed until too late and the thyroid has been irreparably damaged or completely destroyed: My wife, on the other hand, thanks to my insistence on going outside the insurance system to get a proper diagnosis and treatment, is getting treatment early enough that we're hoping that the damage can actually be completely reversed). I've also had a few close friends die of cancer recently that should have been diagnosed months or even years earlier but their doctors dropped the ball.
</I>Sorry to hear about your calamities, but very deep level of involvement is not suitable for most people. Even you were not running the tests on your own, though you had to switch (or nudge?) your doctor. More like switching a representative when you do not trust him/her.

&gt;<i> As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have the time to invest in understanding them that I do. And on the rare occasion they do order extra tests its invariably to cover their asses in case I die rather than because they actually understand what is required to diagnose or treat any particular disease.
</I>Your are atypical. You would be a great delegate who is digging for truth and can help other people understand it.

&gt;<i> And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you think that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it with an hour or so's effort.
</I>Do you see a difference between being able and wanting to do something? In most cases I will not have time to do it. Occasionally? Quite possible.
