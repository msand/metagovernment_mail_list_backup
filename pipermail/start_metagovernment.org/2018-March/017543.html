Hey, you were the one that brought up blockchain as if it had
something to do with public policy decisionmaking. Now you admit you
don't have answers to fundamental questions about how it would work or
even what relevance it has to what this list is for?

&gt;<i> Most people know nothing of crypto. Many people such as your self are very skeptical to varying degrees. And many people are investing billions of dollars worth of resources and enormous effort into it. If you disagree with that last group of people, then I guess you don&#8217;t need to chime in on this thread. That&#8217;s okay.
</I>
How big is the gambling industry? Is that any correlation with its
utility or value to society?

</I>&gt;<i> That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking for: a better solution than benign authoritarianism. Crypto was designed to be decentralized and therefore democratized, and it faces an issue of not being able to democratize in how it evolves.

And I'm helping you with that: I say don't think about it because it's
just a waste of your (and everyone else's) time because it has exactly
zero to offer toward solving any the problems we face...

&gt;<i> In other words, I&#8217;m asking for brainstorming, not debate on tangential issues.

You gotta have a brain and at least some passing familiarity with the
technology to brainstorm about it. Since you can't respond to even my
most basic questions about how blockchain is relevant to
decisionmaking, I too wonder why you even brought it up...
