<PRE>I removed United Vote from the conversion, it is turning into spamming

&gt;<i> Did you read the article? 4th paragraph.
</I>Of course I read your paragraph. Do you understand difference between what people promise and what they do?
Now answer my questions, do not ignore them: What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV?


&gt;<i> Hey, it was you that made the comparison that they were &quot;better&quot; somehow than the ones in proxyfor.me. If you want to walk that back, no problem.
</I>Again, do not be a liar. If you do not know how to quote I can do it for you:
Scott: &gt; I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US congress votes on.

Me: This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

Sorry Scott, it is better just to stop this discussion.
Sergey
PS: do not answer the questions I asked you to answer. It is pointless and only brings frustration.
