Brilliant! These are the kinds of marketing opportunities you just
can't buy. Unfortunately I'm not ready to take advantage of this one
because proxyfor.me is sleeping while I perform surgery on it...

The two big wins are:
1) It reinforces the belief in The People that you actually *can*
predict someone's preferences and behavior using data you collect
about them.

2) It clearly demonstrates why shared logins with social media
services are a really bad idea. In the case (though the article isn't
nearly as clear about this as it should have been) what the data
provided was a way to identify likely Trump voters so that the Trump
campaign could manipulate them into acting as &quot;recruitment bots&quot;
(using them to spread information (and in many cases disinformation)
about both of the presidential candidates).

I'll have to add this example to the documentation to help people
really understand why they'll want to use different names for the
proxyfor.me account any other service they use. It's going to be
pretty embarrassing for those who will come to be known as &quot;Chumps for
Trump&quot;, especially when that looming shitstorm that will bring him
down hits...

    Scott
