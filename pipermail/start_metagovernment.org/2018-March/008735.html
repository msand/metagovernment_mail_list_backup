<PRE>Dear Members of the Metagovernment list,

I would like to bring to your attention a liquid democracy project that is currently taking shape thanks to the effort of United Vote. I am in no way affiliated with this organization, but I do think it is a great and badly needed initiative. The project is very real, there are candidates who are running for office on a liquid democracy platform developed by United Vote. To my knowledge, this is the most significant attempt at infusing liquid democracy into the US politics. United Vote site lets you vote on any congressional bill, either directly or via proxies. The votes of constituents are used to grade their representatives with the goal of creating transparent accountability records. This is only the first phase of the project. The second phase will aim at making the votes binding by electing candidates that will pledge to follow the decisions of their constituencies.

I encourage you to take a look at the site, better yet register, better yet get ID verified to start voting, delegating or becoming a delegate representing other people. You can get a good idea of how the site works even without registration. If you are not a US citizen you can still register to see the system from a user perspective. However, to become an eligible proxy (delegate) you would need to go through the ID verification.

You can discuss the project with its founder, David Ernst, for example, on Reddit.

Please share your opinion about the project and experience with the site.
