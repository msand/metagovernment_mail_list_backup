Clearly the citizenry is capable of producing good and actionable ideas, as seen with the Lafontaine Park plan, and clearly it&#8217;s better to listen before than to deal with the firestorm of post-proposal punditry.

So why not take steps towards meaningful consultation, with a modern spin? For all the talk about technology and smartphones driving us apart, maybe we can finally find a way for them to make us more cohesive.

Oh, and if this sounds far-fetched and idyllic, a U.K.-based company has been toying with a similar concept for a few years. In Scandinavia, in-depth public consultation is the norm when it comes to urban planning.

It&#8217;s doable. The question is whether we as a society want to actively participate in shaping our city.
