r/democracy is busy, but mostly not related to decisionmaking systems.
The others are about as active as this list (which is to say, not very
;-)

You apparently didn't understand my comment: There *aren't* 535
choices as most of those people vote the equivalent of party line.
Other than a few wingnuts like Rand Paul and Bernie that I'd likely
each assign some weight to if I could split by topic area (Paul for
defense, Bernie for social program reform, Warren for regulation,
etc.) I don't see any benefit to being able to delegate to any of
them. Indeed, things would certainly be worse if I had to delegate all
my votes to any one of those three...

Braver man than I: I can count the number of companies that have my
credit card on one hand. I use Paypal for everything else, but even
then avoid buying anything from a site I don't already know (I buy a
lot of stuff through small-fry through ebay and amazon, of course, but
then, they never get my payment info). Life is too short to spend
weeks or months of it trying to undo an identity theft.

Nope, they actually did this:

&gt;&gt;<i> I still like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voter rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily detect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you allow people to create multiple accounts it completely invalidate any

</I>
In a fully operational system, sure. But how do you get there if you
turn most people off before they even get to the main site? Do you
think Avaaz and change.org lose sleep over this? I don't plan to
either: As long as we avoid obvious gaming of the system we can have
both low barriers to entry *and* some faith in the outcome of the
decisions actually being representative. I expect to add challenges
gradually, like making people reply to one of the weekly emails or log
into the system to keep their account active, or maybe forcing them to
make a comment or citation once in awhile if they don't do this by
habit: Once they're on the site there's all kinds of things we can
check to make sure it's not a bot or hacker casting votes.

&gt;&gt;<i> You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just made-up data used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for bootstrapping.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are the bots yours? Do you have trouble finding human users? I remember how
</I>&gt;<i> you were predicting that you would have hundreds of user right after you
</I>&gt;<i> launch your system. What happened?
</I>
Mostly I stopped marketing it when I discovered some fundamental flaws
in the design of Angular 2 having to do with routing (it was basically
impossible to route people to specific proposals using a URL, a
necessary feature to market it to issue-based voters). That limitation
in Angular has been fixed now, but I haven't had the time to port to
the newest release of it yet.

&gt;&gt;<i> Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia, BTW,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;BTW&quot; :) Is it my fault somehow? You are the one who takes security as an
</I>&gt;<i> afterthought.
</I>
No offense intended, I was just pointing out that Facebook and the
Democratic party aren't the only ones that are having trouble with the
Russians...

&gt;&gt;<i> Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At some point you have trust
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people elected using the old system to
</I>&gt;<i> follow the new one. I for one believe it's naive to think that will ever
</I>&gt;<i> actually happen
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Far higher chances than for a matchism-like system succeeding, IMHO.
</I>
Far higher chance of it becoming as popular (or more) than LQFB or
Rousseau, for sure. But history is littered with products and
movements that didn't actually ever really amount to anything because
of fundamental flaws that their creators didn't see or weren't able to
fix. Go big or go home, I say. If it takes me 20 or 30 years for all
these half-assed attempts to fail and proxyfor.me to rise to the top,
that's fine. My father (a social psychologist) actually ran a system
like proxyfor.me (albeit matching people to existing representatives
rather than to each other) back in the 1970s because he recognized
even back then that people are incapable of picking appropriate
representatives for themselves. He's helped me with this one some
because here it is more than 40 years later and he still hasn't given
up hope that eventually people will see the light ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> congress votes on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.
</I>
And you're saying you prefer them to the example proposals in
proxyfor.me? Who's a liar now?

&gt;&gt;<i> They're horrible! I've run some of them through Word's analysis tools and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they frequently come out at grade levels above 20 (that's a PhD). I found
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one that came out a 25, which is *two* PhDs ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is why you may need representatives who can explain the bills to other
</I>&gt;<i> people. This happens all the time in real live. You resort to opinion of
</I>&gt;<i> experts all the time (doctor office, car repair, etc), but you are free to
</I>&gt;<i> choose an expert or change it at any time.
</I>
Ah, an elitist. Attitudes like that display a profound ignorance about
how the world actually works. Certainly anyone that trusts a doctor to
diagnose anything more complicated than the common cold is a fool:
They're certainly less trustworthy even than car mechanics are (and
that ain't saying much). Don't get me started on this because one of
the things that's been taking up enormous amount of my time the past
few months has been both my wife's and my doctor's failures to
properly diagnose and treat endocrine/hormone problems we have (e.g.,
in her case I believe that probably 90% of the cases of Hashimoto's
out there aren't diagnosed until too late and the thyroid has been
irreparably damaged or completely destroyed: My wife, on the other
hand, thanks to my insistence on going outside the insurance system to
get a proper diagnosis and treatment, is getting treatment early
enough that we're hoping that the damage can actually be completely
reversed). I've also had a few close friends die of cancer recently
that should have been diagnosed months or even years earlier but their
doctors dropped the ball.

But back to the writing of bills, I submit you're naive about them as
well: It's not that they're just inherently hard to understand, it's
that they're *intentionally* hard to understand because that's part of
how gaming the system works in misrepresentative democracy. The trick
is to make them so hard to follow that most people give up such that
the author can easily manipulate people into voting for something they
don't really understand based on trust/charm/log rolling/etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate enough and far more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting to most people. Have you ever studied the petition sites
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really interested in?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are again trying to change the world to fit your tool. Many bills are
</I>&gt;<i> bound to be technical and hard to understand. Just like when doctors discuss
</I>&gt;<i> among themselves how to treat your illness, you might not understand most of
</I>&gt;<i> their conversation.
</I>
As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests
and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have
the time to invest in understanding them that I do. And on the rare
occasion they do order extra tests its invariably to cover their asses
in case I die rather than because they actually understand what is
required to diagnose or treat any particular disease.

And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you
think that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it
with an hour or so's effort. I've spent a *lot* of time doing this
kind of thing (my lawyers hate me as much as my doctors do ;-) and
haven't come across anything they've written that can't be vastly
simplified if they'd take the time (which of course not only do they
not have any incentive to do, they actually *benefit* by making things
more complicated because of the job security it provides).

&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working inside the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lots of changes were achieved by evolution. I will live a revolution to you.
</I>
In politics?  I can't think of anything, really. Certainly our current
governments work no better now than they did 200 years ago. And this
despite massive improvements in technology that should have made
everything much better.  Trump and our current polarized do-nothing
congress I think are convincing evidence that government is actually
*worse* now than it was 200 years ago, at least in the US.
