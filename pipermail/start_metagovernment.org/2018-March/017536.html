Yeah, and that's really the least of the problems, the biggest one
being that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. I have yet
to see anyone answer even my most basic questions as why blockchain
provides anything useful at all to EDD:

1) Since you have to trust the executive branch to actually
*implement* any of the decisions made using the system, why is it so
much to ask to trust it to run the decisionmaking system itself?

2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
the vote data?

3) Even if you don't believe #2 is a requirement (and I'd like to see
the handwaving you'll need to do to come up with an alternative that
supports delegation), surely having the ability to verify your *own*
vote in a centrally managed system is sufficient to detect tampering
by the executive branch?

4) To operate at scale, the system must be able to manage billions of
transactions in a relatively short period of time (certainly less than
24 hours). No blockchain system can do this, a flaw that is
fundamental to the design of the architecture. How do you propose to
get around this?

And just to round out the collection, I *also* happen to believe that
blockchain is inappropriate to even use for &quot;currency&quot; for reasons #1
and #4 and furthermore because it effectively prohibits implementation
of &quot;fiat currency&quot;, a tool that is necessary to manage the economy
(inflation, recession, etc.) IMHO blockchain's only use is as
commodity to be used for speculation (actually, I'd just call it
gambling), maybe as a way of reducing the risk of criminal activity,
and definitely as a way to waste a whole lot of energy thereby making
it a significant contributor to climate change. It's simply delusional
think about it as being &quot;money&quot;.

Actually the *most* amazing thing about blockchain is how completely
obvious people are to the fact that it only has any value because we
*believe* it has value, and yet that is the very same belief process
that allows governments to exist. Why is it so hard to believe that we
can change or replace the government if you can believe in something
that is far more fantastical like the &quot;value&quot; of a bitcoin?

  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;<i> P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which
</I>&gt;<i> details this exact problem:
