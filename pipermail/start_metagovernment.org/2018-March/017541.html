<PRE>Not everything has to be debated here. The issues you raise are debated all over the internet, and it&#8217;s pointless to overrun my question with these topics, when it is a legitimate and serious question. Please leave room for others to comment.

Most people know nothing of crypto. Many people such as your self are very skeptical to varying degrees. And many people are investing billions of dollars worth of resources and enormous effort into it. If you disagree with that last group of people, then I guess you don&#8217;t need to chime in on this thread. That&#8217;s okay.

That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m asking for: a better solution than benign authoritarianism. Crypto was designed to be decentralized and therefore democratized, and it faces an issue of not being able to democratize in how it evolves. People want to solve this, and I&#8217;m asking this group for help thinking of solutions to this. 

In other words, I&#8217;m asking for brainstorming, not debate on tangential issues.
