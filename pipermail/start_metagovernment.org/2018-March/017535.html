&gt;<i> Frankly, this list is too obscure to expect people to come here. True, there

</I>
Except that none of the relevant subreddits there are even as active
as this list..

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house representatives

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you even go out and vote in elections? If so, you do have preferences,
</I>&gt;<i> which means you can select a better representative. &quot;I trust exactly zero&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, this is just BS.
</I>
Not at all: I can certainly pick &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, but
expanding that to &quot;the lesser of 535 evils&quot; is hardly an improvement,
especially when if you did a cluster analysis on the voting records of
the 535 it would probably collapse down to less than a handful of
choices, none of which are anything like me (because people like me
don't run for office). Why should I have to settle for the &quot;lesser of
4 evils&quot; if we're going to all the trouble to create a new system?

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a serious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Catch-22 issue
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the problem? You do not want to pay $1 or you do not have a separate
</I>&gt;<i> credit card with a small credit limit for situations like this? Sorry, this
</I>&gt;<i> is just BS.
</I>
Ever hear of &quot;identity theft&quot;? Who are these guys to ask for some of
my most sensitive financial information? And no, I don't have a &quot;small
limit&quot; card for something like this, and frankly I'd have to
discourage anyone else from doing things like that because it's just a
really bad idea: Having someone's full credit card info gives a lot
more capability than just maxing out that credit card. If I had to do
something like this I'd do what PayPal and the other on-line banks do
(make a small deposit into a person's bank account and require them to
verify the number). PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a
very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. I still
like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter
rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one
actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily
detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).

&gt;&gt;<i> but IMHO you have to err on the side of not putting unnecessary hurdles in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> front of participants even if this means making the system security very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weak.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should really talk to people outside of this list to learn what they
</I>&gt;<i> think about such an attitude. Your site is polluted by bot votes. Is that
</I>&gt;<i> your preference?
</I>
You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you
take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just
made-up data used for bootstrapping. But I will admit that bot attacks
from outside are a real problem and I struggled a bit before coming up
with a reliable solution to the attacks on the Matchism forums.
Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts
promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia,
BTW, but stopping the attacks was trivial once I figured out all
&quot;captcha&quot; tests had been cracked: All you have to is ask a very simple
question that the scripts that those bot farms use can't answer. Sure,
we'll need something more sophisticated once a site becomes popular
enough that people actually start to see real power in it, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) This project reminds me a lot of <A HREF="http://placeavote.com/">http://placeavote.com/</A> (now defunct)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It means you do not get it. PlaceAVote had exactly zero LD implemented. LD
</I>&gt;<i> is central to United Vote.
</I>
That's the only difference, though, and hardly enough to make it
usable by &quot;normies&quot;. I really tried to use PlaceAVote but even I, a
real policy wonk, couldn't get past the horrible writing of the bills
that appeared on it. Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At
some point you have trust people elected using the old system to
follow the new one. I for one believe it's naive to think that will
ever actually happen: The only way we're going to get power is to take
it, not beg the existing governments to give it to us.

&gt;&gt;<i> and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes relying on US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> house/senate bills
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A real world aspect of the system is good, not bad. I do not want to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> giving more rights to primates (your toy bill).
</I>
I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US
congress votes on. They're horrible! I've run some of them through
Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels
above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is
*two* PhDs ;-) The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate
enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied
the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really
interested in?

&gt;&gt;<i> (which are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LD addresses this. And you are making a mistake of trying to change the
</I>&gt;<i> world to fit your tool, as apposed to designing a tool suitable for the real
</I>&gt;<i> world. I agree with Matteo on that.
</I>
IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by
working inside the system. For example the entire technology business
is now based on the kind &quot;disruption&quot; that is impossible to achieve if
you're willing to accept the legal and social constraints The Powers
That Be would try to impose on you. A study of how the various
communist, fascist, anti-colonial, and Arab Spring revolutions were
achieved one comes away with a clear impression that toppling a
government is a lot easier than you'd think. And I imagine it'll be
even easier when you have a complete and functional replacement
already up and running when you ask people to make the switch.

    Scott
