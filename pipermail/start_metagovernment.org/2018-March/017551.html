I don't see why: It's mostly stuff that's directly relevant to that
project. But since apparently none of us has received a response I
think it's safe to assume that they're not interested in discussing
their project.

&gt;&gt;<i> Did you read the article? 4th paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course I read your paragraph. Do you understand difference between what
</I>&gt;<i> people promise and what they do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now answer my questions, do not ignore them: What does this article have to
</I>&gt;<i> do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID
</I>&gt;<i> verification? Did you really use PaV?
</I>
My recollection is that they did, mostly because I remember thinking
how expensive it must have been, but I'll admit that my recollection
is fuzzy because this was many years ago and I only spent an hour or
two playing with it. It's gone now anyway so it's kind of academic at
this point. They clearly *intended* to do snail-mail based
authentication. I intend to use public voter rolls. United.vote use of
credit cards seems to me to be worse than either of those because
many, if not most, people (including myself) simply won't do it. Even
worse, and I Iooked this up, even in the US fully 30% of adults don't
even *have* a credit card! By comparison less than 10% aren't
registered to vote and that percentage is significantly lower in some
states (those with same day registration, motor/voter, etc.) I've also
been thinking that getting teenagers involved is a crucial target
market: Even in the US less than 20% of people under the age of 18
have a credit card. Again, like voter fraud, obsessing about fake
accounts before it's even been shown to be an issue is just shooting
yourself in the foot IMHO.

&gt;&gt;<i> Hey, it was you that made the comparison that they were &quot;better&quot; somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than the ones in proxyfor.me. If you want to walk that back, no problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, do not be a liar. If you do not know how to quote I can do it for
</I>&gt;<i> you:
</I>
Yeah, but you did it wrong: You didn't go back far enough. Here's the
relevant statement you made:

&gt;&gt;<i> and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes relying on US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> house/senate bills
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A real world aspect of the system is good, not bad. I do not want to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> giving more rights to primates (your toy bill).
</I>
This clearly implies that you prefer the impenetrable bills the US
congress deals with to something simpler and yet still very relevant
to the operation of the modern world. This means you'd prefer
something like the following because it's &quot;real world&quot;:
<A HREF="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text</A>

Hint: It's the most recently passed bill by the US Senate. It's 30,132
words and according to MS Word's readability check has a reading ease
of 23 (out of 100) and a grade level of 16 (college graduate). And
that's after ignoring hundreds of grammatical errors. And I'll
guarantee you that not a single member of the House or Senate has or
will ever read the entire thing (they have staff for that, albeit most
of them will only check a few sections of it to make sure their pet
project isn't affected somehow). And this is far from the worst
example I could have picked (take a look at a budget bill sometime if
you really want to be horrified). Which is why I maintain that using
*anything* produced by our existing misrepresentative democracies as
input into an EDD will doom that project.
  Regards,
    Scott
