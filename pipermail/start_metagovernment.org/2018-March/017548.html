It's *completely* different: If my identity is compromised I could
lose thousands of dollars, the ability to do anything that requires a
good credit score (buy a house or car, rent an apartment, etc.), and
will have to waste dozens or hundreds of hours trying to fix it. If my
personality profile gets out about all I have to fear is that Trump's
team (or the Russians, or whoever) will target me with ads that
encourage me to spread fake news.

No, it only requires that people realize that the rest of us already
know what your personality is (even if you don't take the test, I can
tell just by looking at your posts/likes/etc.) so there's no point in
even trying to hide this stuff. And there's really no danger to
disclosing it other than maybe making it easier for advertisers to
target you. In which case the problem is with our blind acceptance of
advertising as a social engineering tool and there's no point in
quibbling over minor tweaks in how effective it is...
