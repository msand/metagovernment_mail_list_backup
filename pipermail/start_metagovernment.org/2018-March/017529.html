<PRE>Thanks for posting this. I've added <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">support at united.vote</A> to the CC list
as sort of an invite to participate here.

Unfortunately I ran into a couple of deal breakers before I even
finished registration:

1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house
representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I
realized this...

2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a
serious Catch-22 issue, but IMHO you have to err on the side of not
putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this
means making the system security very weak. There'll be plenty of time
to add security later on, especially if the upgrade path is designed
in.

3) This project reminds me a lot of <A HREF="http://placeavote.com/">http://placeavote.com/</A> (now
defunct) and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes
(prioritizing authentication rather than the social
media/participation aspects, relying on US house/senate bills (which
are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them) instead
of custom proposals, etc.). That failure was a damned shame because
they had more money to burn (over $500K) than any other EDD project
I've investigated.

Given that I've done a relatively fresh critique of &quot;Liquid Democracy&quot;
for the DemocracyEarth project, I'll just link to that. Again, IMHO if
you're working in this area but don't have that Kling paper completely
memorized, or if you haven't built specific remedies for the flaws
they found in LQFB into your project, you're just wasting everyone's
time:

&gt;<i> Dear Members of the Metagovernment list,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to bring to your attention a liquid democracy project that is
</I>&gt;<i> currently taking shape thanks to the effort of United Vote
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://united.vote/">https://united.vote/</A>). I am in no way affiliated with this organization,
</I>&gt;<i> but I do think it is a great and badly needed initiative. The project is
</I>&gt;<i> very real, there are candidates
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/dsernst/videos/10215788744381644/">https://www.facebook.com/dsernst/videos/10215788744381644/</A>) who are running
</I>&gt;<i> for office on a liquid democracy platform developed by United Vote. To my
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge, this is the most significant attempt at infusing liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> into the US politics. United Vote site lets you vote on any congressional
</I>&gt;<i> bill (<A HREF="https://united.vote/legislation">https://united.vote/legislation</A>), either directly or via proxies. The
</I>&gt;<i> votes of constituents are used to grade their representatives
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://united.vote/legislators">https://united.vote/legislators</A>) with the goal of creating transparent
</I>&gt;<i> accountability records. This is only the first phase of the project. The
</I>&gt;<i> second phase will aim at making the votes binding by electing candidates
</I>&gt;<i> that will pledge to follow the decisions of their constituencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I encourage you to take a look at the site (<A HREF="https://united.vote/">https://united.vote/</A>), better
</I>&gt;<i> yet register, better yet get ID verified to start voting, delegating or
</I>&gt;<i> becoming a delegate representing other people. You can get a good idea of
</I>&gt;<i> how the site works even without registration. If you are not a US citizen
</I>&gt;<i> you can still register to see the system from a user perspective. However,
</I>&gt;<i> to become an eligible proxy (delegate) you would need to go through the ID
</I>&gt;<i> verification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can discuss the project with its founder, David Ernst, for example, on
</I>&gt;<i> Reddit (<A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/liquidvote/">https://www.reddit.com/r/liquidvote/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please share your opinion about the project and experience with the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
