&gt;<i> I am not asking for the solution to all the problems of blockchain. There are many. And that&#8217;s because it is in it's absolute infancy, compared to banking and government, which are extremely mature and nuanced. Blockchain has a lot of issues to work out, so the code needs to be able to evolve.
</I>
But why even bother to work on obscure problems when even fundamental
things don't work or aren't possible?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So for the code to evolve best, it should be done democratically. That&#8217;s why I asked my question. How can the evolution of the code happen through a democratic process, instead of being controlled by whomever controls the most nodes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is a problem all open source developers face. AFAIK it always
comes down to a trusted individual/team that makes the final call. In
proxyfor.me ultimately it will be the executive branch and if the
people don't like they just vote up the &quot;replace the manager&quot; proposal
and start over with a new one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding your points:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. I don&#8217;t understand this. What does the executive branch have to do with cryptocurrency, which is inherently global?
</I>
It has to do with the supposed benefit primary benefit of blockchain
which is that it's distributed. But my claim is that is no benefit at
all because the *implementation* of a decision has to be accomplished
by the executive branch (i.e., a central authority). And if you trust
the executive to actually do what you tell them, why is it so hard to
trust them to run the decisionmaking system itself? Poof: the supposed
main advantage of blockchain disappears in a puff of smoke.

&gt;<i> 2. Open voting isn&#8217;t necessarily a problem with governance of the versioning of crypto (share whatever ideas you have for this, please); but that is entirely separate from the trust relationships in currency exchanges.
</I>
If you're not using encryption to hide the votes, why do you need
blockchain at all?

&gt;<i> 3. This isn&#8217;t about some executive branch. It&#8217;s about who decides which version of software to run for any particular cryptocurrency.
</I>
Are we talking about a monetary system or a decisionmaking system?

&gt;<i> 4. Someone else&#8217;s problem. There are already more evolved chains like holochain in development.
</I>
You don't worry even a little about investing a lot of time and effort
into something that has a huge fundamental flaw that turns out to be
unsolvable? I prefer to have the whole design in my head before I
start working on something, thank you very much...

&gt;<i> As for the value of crypto; remember that gold was the standard for ages, and it has no inherent value either. There&#8217;s no point debating this; there are tons of articles about it and it&#8217;s not relevant to this question. I want to see crypto evolve in a democratic way so that it can turn into something that is much, much better than blockchain. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m asking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But why? What problem does it solve that you can't solve a lot easier
some other way? Or is this just a fanboy thing?

    Scott

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, and that's really the least of the problems, the biggest one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. I have yet
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to see anyone answer even my most basic questions as why blockchain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides anything useful at all to EDD:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Since you have to trust the executive branch to actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *implement* any of the decisions made using the system, why is it so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much to ask to trust it to run the decisionmaking system itself?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the vote data?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Even if you don't believe #2 is a requirement (and I'd like to see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the handwaving you'll need to do to come up with an alternative that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supports delegation), surely having the ability to verify your *own*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote in a centrally managed system is sufficient to detect tampering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the executive branch?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) To operate at scale, the system must be able to manage billions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactions in a relatively short period of time (certainly less than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 24 hours). No blockchain system can do this, a flaw that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fundamental to the design of the architecture. How do you propose to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get around this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And just to round out the collection, I *also* happen to believe that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blockchain is inappropriate to even use for &quot;currency&quot; for reasons #1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and #4 and furthermore because it effectively prohibits implementation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of &quot;fiat currency&quot;, a tool that is necessary to manage the economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (inflation, recession, etc.) IMHO blockchain's only use is as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> commodity to be used for speculation (actually, I'd just call it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gambling), maybe as a way of reducing the risk of criminal activity,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and definitely as a way to waste a whole lot of energy thereby making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it a significant contributor to climate change. It's simply delusional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think about it as being &quot;money&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actually the *most* amazing thing about blockchain is how completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious people are to the fact that it only has any value because we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *believe* it has value, and yet that is the very same belief process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allows governments to exist. Why is it so hard to believe that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can change or replace the government if you can believe in something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is far more fantastical like the &quot;value&quot; of a bitcoin?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> details this exact problem:
