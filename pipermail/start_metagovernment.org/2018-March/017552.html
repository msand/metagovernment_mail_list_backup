</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, and that's really the least of the problems, the biggest one
</I>&gt;<i> being that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. I have yet
</I>&gt;<i> to see anyone answer even my most basic questions as why blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> provides anything useful at all to EDD:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Since you have to trust the executive branch to actually
</I>&gt;<i> *implement* any of the decisions made using the system, why is it so
</I>&gt;<i> much to ask to trust it to run the decisionmaking system itself?
</I>One problem I can think of is the deletion / censoring of data, this 
needs to be externally monitored and verified in a both centralized and 
decentralized systems. The crucial part being to witness in what order 
do additions to the immutable persistent storage happen, and maintain 
consensus of this. No proof of work needed, this is actually strange 
form of consistency, the cost of censoring/double-spend is merely 
related to the amount of money/hardware/energy you're willing to invest 
(probably within the budget of US/RUS military etc), rather than 
consensus on what changes happened when. I've made a proposal based on 
&quot;proof of communicating witnesses&quot; 
<A HREF="https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/issues/18#issuecomment-349709686">https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/issues/18#issuecomment-349709686</A> 
but later on I found <A HREF="https://www.radixdlt.com/">https://www.radixdlt.com/</A> which does essentially 
the same thing. Monitoring and maintaining consensus can be relatively 
fast and cheap, given the time it takes to calculate hashes and the 
round-trip-time latency of communicating this globally.

Alternatively, if simply distributed databases and a decentralized web 
is wanted, one can use <A HREF="https://datproject.org/">https://datproject.org/</A> and 
<A HREF="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/">https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/</A> as a gossip protocol. No blockchain needed. 
Can try it today with the <A HREF="https://beakerbrowser.com/">https://beakerbrowser.com/</A>

And I don't see a problem with distributed ledgers and democratic 
processes. Its up to people what system they use, not how many nodes a 
blockchain / consensus network has.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
</I>&gt;<i> voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
</I>&gt;<i> the vote data?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Even if you don't believe #2 is a requirement (and I'd like to see
</I>&gt;<i> the handwaving you'll need to do to come up with an alternative that
</I>&gt;<i> supports delegation), surely having the ability to verify your *own*
</I>&gt;<i> vote in a centrally managed system is sufficient to detect tampering
</I>&gt;<i> by the executive branch?
</I>I hope the previous paragraph makes it clear that we need to monitor 
that all data remains immutable, not only our own.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) To operate at scale, the system must be able to manage billions of
</I>&gt;<i> transactions in a relatively short period of time (certainly less than
</I>&gt;<i> 24 hours). No blockchain system can do this, a flaw that is
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental to the design of the architecture. How do you propose to
</I>&gt;<i> get around this?
</I>Have you heard about directed acyclic graphs? E.g. the Tangle used in 
<A HREF="https://iota.org/">https://iota.org/</A>
They can scale much nicer than the traditional blockchain with nakamoto 
consensus.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And just to round out the collection, I *also* happen to believe that
</I>&gt;<i> blockchain is inappropriate to even use for &quot;currency&quot; for reasons #1
</I>&gt;<i> and #4 and furthermore because it effectively prohibits implementation
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;fiat currency&quot;, a tool that is necessary to manage the economy
</I>&gt;<i> (inflation, recession, etc.) IMHO blockchain's only use is as
</I>&gt;<i> commodity to be used for speculation (actually, I'd just call it
</I>&gt;<i> gambling), maybe as a way of reducing the risk of criminal activity,
</I>&gt;<i> and definitely as a way to waste a whole lot of energy thereby making
</I>&gt;<i> it a significant contributor to climate change. It's simply delusional
</I>&gt;<i> think about it as being &quot;money&quot;.
</I>Fiat currency or quite similar systems can for sure be built on 
distributed immutable log like systems as long as the participants agree 
on the rules. You can do it without any 
proof-of-work/stake/space/elapsed-time, if a web of trust exists among 
the actors taking part of the economy.
E.g. <A HREF="https://duniter.org/en/">https://duniter.org/en/</A> implements the Universal Dividend, as 
specified by the theory called Relative Money Theory.
<A HREF="https://duniter.org/en/theoretical/">https://duniter.org/en/theoretical/</A>
<A HREF="http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/">http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually the *most* amazing thing about blockchain is how completely
</I>&gt;<i> obvious people are to the fact that it only has any value because we
</I>&gt;<i> *believe* it has value, and yet that is the very same belief process
</I>&gt;<i> that allows governments to exist. Why is it so hard to believe that we
</I>&gt;<i> can change or replace the government if you can believe in something
</I>&gt;<i> that is far more fantastical like the &quot;value&quot; of a bitcoin?
</I>While something doesn't have universal acceptance as a method of 
payment, or sufficiently easy liquidity, it shouldn't be considered 
&quot;actual&quot; money. And in no case does it have any value like assets or 
commodities do, you cannot estimate the value of them or predict if the 
current irrational market price is above or below that value, only 
speculate on the future exchange rates of the limited collectible(s). 
Essentially the difference between investments and trading, the tools 
used in one fail miserably in the other.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> details this exact problem:
