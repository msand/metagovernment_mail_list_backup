<PRE>There is an antidemocratic governance problem in cryptocurrencies as they exist now. When a new iteration of a cryptocurrency&#8217;s software is introduced, it becomes established when the majority of nodes switch to that new iteration. This node-based governance method biases the system toward monied influence because individuals and organizations with more financial capital can support a greater number of nodes, a problem that is compounded by increasing centralization of mining due to the advent of massive ASIC data centers.

Put simply, the problem is that the &#8220;voting&#8221; rule for version-adoption is one vote per computer rather than one vote per individual. There is a need for a cryptocurrency governance system in which software evolves according to democratic will, i.e., the preferences of the majority or consensus of individual users.

I suspect that part of the solution is to build a mechanism for both decision-making and version-control that is programmed right into the blockchain&#8217;s code. Ideally this mechanism would be built so deeply into the code that it cannot be refused by nodes. But this is just my guess, and I can&#8217;t figure out how it would take shape while maintaining the decentralized and secure nature of crypto. I am hoping that this group might be able to hash out a better solution.

Ideas?


P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which details this exact problem:

P.P.S. Sorry I haven&#8217;t been around much; but I am still caught up in my personal projects. Though I am increasingly convinced that cryptocurrency is the most promising avenue to democratizing governance. It just would help to figure out the above. :)
