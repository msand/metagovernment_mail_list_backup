The Civil Constitution

Civil is founded on the principle that a free and open press is an essential element of the foundation of a free, fair, and just society; and in the belief that global change in technology, economics, and politics have altered the basic conditions that provide for its fulfillment of that purpose.

Civil&#8217;s platform is intended to be operated and governed by its participants&#8212;citizens and journalists alike&#8212;while protecting Civil&#8217;s core values and purpose. Civil is a community with a specific purpose and an ethical position&#8212;these establish the side-constraints on the operational and governing power of the community over individuals and groups within it. Therefore the Civil Journalism Ethics Guideline, a constitution that lays out Civil&#8217;s core values and purpose.

Specific interpretations of the core values and purpose will be the work of the community, operating according to a transparent governing framework. That framework will include provisions for the community to change this document as needed to better promote the core values and purpose of Civil.
