<PRE>I believe that putting together the best ideas is the key, decisions must
be addressed with specific criteria depending on the subject matter.
lets say we need to generate a very articulate proposal, then I will
consider a platform based on Airesis. But the shortcoming in Airesis is
that it give to much power to the redactor, by using vilfredo I can have
redactors that need to go through a consensus process for the paragraph
that need to be integrated in the proposal, once the proposal is completed
with different solution and must go to the vote, people can choose to cast
their vote or having a proxyforme AI type of engine do it.
If the decision is an amount (example, a compensation for x service) a
median like algorithm engine can be used.
I envision also a  multilanguage real time translating service when the
decision is between two or more states.
Responding to some of Scott's remarks, I believe that even if participants
access with their G or FB account they must be registered unequivocal
users. The blockchain or other crypto is not necessary because the system
is centralized but it may be used as proof of identity.
I believe the system should be transparent and community controlled and the
state government as we know today will be outlaw.
Somewhere it must start and the process is not straight forward otherwise
will be a revolution and from a revolution cannot start the implementation
of a fully democratic process.
We must go stage by stage, regarding local to global this is also a process
and I believe will be happening once the model is proven doing good
somewhere, then people will start to demand to use it more and more. But we
are entering into fanta-politics and I prefer to concentrate in practical,
user-friendly,  well defined method, understandable by all, usable by all,
accessible platform, secure and faire.

I hope I answer to some doubt.
Ciao
jacopo
