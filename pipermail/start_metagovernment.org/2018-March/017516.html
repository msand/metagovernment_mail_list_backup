Mine either...

Me too although I expect that I'm going to find them very
disappointing based on who the judges are: Given that they're all
&quot;work within the system&quot; types their preferences are going to be far
too conservative and none of them are likely to have a
social-engineering perspective on things.

&gt;<i> Apparently, they will be posted at some point.

It's well done (albeit with too many typos and awkward phrasings, but
neither I nor the judges would be likely to hold that against them),
and I really like the way they've used the Gitbooks platform.

&gt;<i> Haven't fully examined it yet but figured might be something worth
</I>&gt;<i> discussing.
</I>
Agreed.  Here's my take on it:

1) The deal breaker: Voluntary delegation with no assist in even
identifying appropriate proxies. We've already seen how that doesn't
work (both in the LQFB system and in the Google liquid voting system).

2) No correction for SDAPs and their much higher interest in being
&quot;representatives&quot; (i.e., the people who will end up running things are
the same people we have now).

3) I don't think I follow the required 1% &quot;membership&quot; fee. 1% of
average income should be more than enough to run the government itself
but does that mean that to join the &quot;parks&quot; group I've got to pony up
$300 (1% of the average income in the US)? If I don't come up with the
$300 I don't get to vote on anything?

4) The voting system is underspecified. Voting seems to be open (no
secret ballot), but there is no mention of this or who and how they do
the counts or the authentication.

All in all it seems to me to be no improvement over what we have now
other than sort of implying that the international level is a
representative democracy that works the same as all lower levels.

Oh well, at least it's not based on blockchain ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
