</I>
But only if they vote, which was one of the problems that caused LQFB
to fail to work: Too few people delegated, and when they did, they
often delegated to people who didn't vote (dead end) or were simply
poor choices (because the delegate had a poor vote correlation).

Delegating by domain could potentially allow a smaller pool to provide
better representation, I'd agree, but at the expense of vastly more
complexity and even lower likelihood that the delegates you end up
choosing would actually cast a &quot;correct vote&quot; for you. It also
promotes the delusion that people are capable of choosing good
representatives when all the evidence says that they simply aren't
able to do this this (references in the proxyfor.me help system).

</I>
Not cowardice exactly, but I'm all about enjoying my leisure time
(i.e., just lazy enough to want to expend a little effort to save
myself a lot of work down the road).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do not remember that. You may be confusing something. PlaceAVote did
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have an ID verification, they only had plans for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nope, they actually did this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/congress-is-broken-that-doesnt-mean-tech-can-fix-it/">https://www.wired.com/2015/10/congress-is-broken-that-doesnt-mean-tech-can-fix-it/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you
</I>&gt;<i> keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV? This may
</I>&gt;<i> end in an embarassement.
</I>
Did you read the article? 4th paragraph.

&gt;&gt;<i> My father (a social psychologist) actually ran a system like proxyfor.me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (albeit matching people to existing representatives rather than to each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other) back in the 1970s because he recognized even back then that people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are incapable of picking appropriate representatives for themselves. He's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helped me with this one some because here it is more than 40 years later and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> he still hasn't given up hope that eventually people will see the light ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great story. Too bad such a system looks too opaque for me to ever want to
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>
Like FB (the matching algorithms for which are vastly more
complicated) or indeed the vast majority of our other technology you
don't have to understand it to find it useful. In your case I'd assume
that you'll just rely on others to actually take the time to
understand how it works and raise the red flag if there's something to
be worried about. Not that any of our efforts to show how dangerous FB
is have gained much traction...

&gt;&gt;<i> And you're saying you prefer them to the example proposals in proxyfor.me?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Who's a liar now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was not saying anything about proxyforme. I only said your statement of me
</I>&gt;<i> never carefully looking at congressional bills was absolutely false.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, a lie.
</I>
Hey, it was you that made the comparison that they were &quot;better&quot;
somehow than the ones in proxyfor.me. If you want to walk that back,
no problem.

&gt;<i> Sorry to hear about your calamities, but very deep level of involvement is
</I>&gt;<i> not suitable for most people. Even you were not running the tests on your
</I>&gt;<i> own, though you had to switch (or nudge?) your doctor. More like switching a
</I>&gt;<i> representative when you do not trust him/her.
</I>
I did have to change doctors. Twice. And it is sort of similar to
changing representatives, but it's actually more like proxyfor.me
where the calculated vote is only a default suggestion that can be
easily overridden by casting a direct vote (take charge of your own
health!). This simply isn't an option in any of these &quot;within the
system&quot; proposals. Even in the Rousseau system (Italian Five Star
Movement) they have a lot of problem with &quot;representatives&quot; failing to
do what they're directed to do, and they even have a contract with a
$100K plus penalty to handle this situation.  United.vote doesn't even
have that, or any faint hope of gaining anything like it.

&gt;&gt;<i> And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it with an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hour or so's effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you see a difference between being able and wanting to do something? In
</I>&gt;<i> most cases I will not have time to do it. Occasionally? Quite possible.
</I>
Great: That's exactly what all these delegate/representative systems
are designed to support. But (another) difference between proxyfor.me
and all the others is that there are social engineering techniques
applied to the bill/proposal creators to provide an incentive to make
the proposals the best they can be (both effective *and*
intelligible). The others seem to not even recognize that this is a
serious issue: LQFB proposals were of uniformly poor quality, as is
the case for most of the petitions on sites like change.org and
avaaz.org. US congressional bills are much better in the &quot;effective&quot;
area, but at the very high cost of being mostly unintelligible, even
if you're a lawyer.  You can have both, but you need to structure the
system such that it provides incentives to ensure this.

Imagine this: Every bill proposed in the US congress has a &quot;score&quot;
that everyone who reads it can contribute to. Maybe 50% on readability
50% on estimated effectiveness (number of loopholes, etc.). The author
of the top-rated proposal each month/session/whatever gets some sort
of bonus. It'd also be a great item to use in your re-election
campaign. But now we voters don't even keep track of how many bills
any member even introduces, let alone gets passed, let alone how often
a law needed to be revised because it had flaws that didn't become
apparent until they started implementing it...
