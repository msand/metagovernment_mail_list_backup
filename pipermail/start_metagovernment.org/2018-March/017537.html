     &gt; Except that none of the relevant subreddits there are even as active as this list.
You probably only looked at r/liquiddemocracy and r/DirectDemocracy . They happened to be small, but the topics of LD and DD are often discussed in different subs: r/democracy and r/futuristparty . They have many more posts than this list. You guys sometimes are going for weeks without a message. I think their people are much more likely to stumble upon your sub and join a discussion. But maybe I am wrong. Do you have many newcomers here? I was not following for the last 1.5 years.


&gt;<i> Not at all: I can certainly pick &quot;the lesser of two evils&quot;, but expanding that to &quot;the lesser of 535 evils&quot; is hardly an improvement,
</I>You see no difference between 2 choices and 535 choices? That's new to me. I though that N+M choices are always better (or not worse) than N choices. Plus your delegates are not at all limited to the congress members. You can delegate to anyone. If you succeed in properly registering, I will include you in my list of delegates. Promise.

I absolutely see a huge difference between 2 and hundreds of choices. Many other people do too. Your opinion is a bit atypical.
You can also vote directly.

&gt;<i> Ever hear of &quot;identity theft&quot;? Who are these guys to ask for some of my most sensitive financial information? 
</I>
Should I stop using online banking and online purchasing now? Or what? I am using it all the time. Still doing fine.

&gt;<i> PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. 
</I>
I do not remember that. You may be confusing something. PlaceAVote did not have an ID verification, they only had plans for it.

&gt;<i> I still like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).
</I>If you allow people to create multiple accounts it completely invalidate any results your system produces.

&gt;<i> You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just made-up data used for bootstrapping. 
</I>
Are the bots yours? Do you have trouble finding human users? I remember how you were predicting that you would have hundreds of user right after you launch your system. What happened?

&gt;<i> Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia, BTW, 
</I>
&quot;BTW&quot; :) Is it my fault somehow? You are the one who takes security as an afterthought.

&gt;<i> Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At some point you have trust people elected using the old system to
</I>follow the new one. I for one believe it's naive to think that will ever actually happen
Far higher chances than for a matchism-like system succeeding, IMHO.

&gt;<i> I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US congress votes on.
</I>This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

&gt;<i> They're horrible! I've run some of them through Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is *two* PhDs ;-)
</I>That is why you may need representatives who can explain the bills to other people. This happens all the time in real live. You resort to opinion of experts all the time (doctor office, car repair, etc), but you are free to choose an expert or change it at any time.

&gt;<i> The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really interested in?
</I>You are again trying to change the world to fit your tool. Many bills are bound to be technical and hard to understand. Just like when doctors discuss among themselves how to treat your illness, you might not understand most of their conversation.

&gt;<i> IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by working inside the system. 
</I>
Lots of changes were achieved by evolution. I will live a revolution to you.
Sergey
