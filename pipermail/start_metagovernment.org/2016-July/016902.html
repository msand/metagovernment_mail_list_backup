<PRE>Thank you Pietro I will definitely check my GPS when I travel nex time,
regarding the allowance extra speed I did not know that, in the Varese area
when I travel over 50KM/h on a 50Km/h the speed detector are clearly
indicating  points on your licence so I figure IS enforced.
Peace
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Just to add my two cents,

</I>&gt;<i> actually find it out. They make them say 140 when in reality you go to a
</I>&gt;<i> lower speed. So to get the actual speed you are much better off getting the
</I>&gt;<i> speed from a navigator. Add to this that not only the speed limit is 130,
</I>&gt;<i> the speedometer are biased, but also there is a certain amount of speed
</I>&gt;<i> that you are allowed to go over the speed limit without getting a ticket
</I>&gt;<i> (also by law). Add all this out and you get that you are quite secure if
</I>&gt;<i> you go with your speedometer at 140 km/h. This does not mean that people
</I>&gt;<i> are not following the laws. Only that they know the laws so well that they
</I>&gt;<i> know when they can push and when they cannot.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; Yesterday a discussion was started on italian parlament about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cannabis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; legalization, after a burst the discussion was postponed to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> september!!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; This is far on the suboptimal range
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Agreed, but I also wouldn't consider it a total failure: At least it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in the queue. Don't know how productive the Italian parliament is, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; if it's like the US they're lucky to get *anything* done in any given
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; week. Tabling measures like this pending further refinement or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; research seems to me completely reasonable, though I agree that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; also often done merely to avoid criticism and possible repercussions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; US policy on gun control usually falls into this category: Politicians
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; are simply afraid to introduce gun control measures because the risks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to themselves personally are so high compared to the potential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; rewards. A direct democracy won't suffer from this problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Are you really so optimist? The proposed law is now in a very clear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> text and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; does not have incongruencies. After reading the opposing party and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opposing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; delegate commentary and proposed modifications, I envision an outcome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; will create a not clear law that will be open to interpretation leaving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; potential user in danger to be illegal anyway! This is seen in all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; siituation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, I guess it'd be hard to call me an optimist WRT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misrepresentative democracy, but I do see that at least they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *considering* the issue (unlike gun control in the US congress). What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you really need is a referendum system: That's what got marijuana
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legalized here in Colorado. Certainly the legislature would never have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passed such a law on their own. But a referendum is a form of direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy, albeit very limited (hard to get things on the ballot,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't have more than a couple of them on each ballot (which means only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a couple per year can be considered), etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for example speed in the highway is set at 130 KM h, car are mostly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (90%)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; traveling at 140 and very ulikely get fined but this cruising speed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; police the right to stop you all the time if they want.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; if the speed is set at 50 people will cruise on that road at 60 and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; if you travel at law speed you'll get honk by other cars for slowing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; traffic!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This too is a social engineering problem: As it turns out, people pay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> little if any attention to the posted speed limit. They could just get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rid of all of those signs and it would have negligible effect on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speeds *or* accident rates (they've actually done experiments that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> show this), though of course it would have a huge impact on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> funding of police departments ;-) This is sort of unrelated to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue of direct democracy, but the solution to this problem is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require civil engineers (who design the roads) to actually study
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychology as it applies to road design (which for the most part they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't now). There are ways to give people visual cues to what the safe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speeds are (narrowing lane widths, necking down intersections, etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but these are only rarely used now, and only in the most progressive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communities (e.g., these sorts of things are a big deal here in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Boulder now).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; representative democracy is a total failure given the state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; today as a model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It's the worst system except when compared to all the others (tyranny,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; feudalism, oligarchy, etc.) I agree that it's severely broken, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; we're still alive and we have the ability to discuss replacement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; systems here in the open, so I say it can't be all bad...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Discussing in the open is, in democratic ruled world, considered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but i believe that is just possible because the system is so well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; selfmaintained by its rules that it became almost a tiranny. i hope i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; explained properly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not completely sure I follow, but if you're talking about the impact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of SJWs, I completely agree. In fact I'm trying to think up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> experiments to isolate this personality characteristic, which I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe to be the elusive Left Wing Authoritarian that Altemeyer could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> never seem to pin down.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is like the speed example above.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; we are (in Italy) never in total legality for any given reason (rules)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; wise. construction wise, licence wise exetera so that IF we are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nuisance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to the sistem we can be prosecuted for a number of reasons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and we call it freedom!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have a thing here called &quot;complaint-based enforcement&quot; which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presents similar problems: The city council passes all kinds of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arbitrary laws that they don't enforce except if a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighbor/customer/employee complains. This causes everyone to live in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fear that something they've done will get them busted. It's like a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lightweight version of the Stasi IMHO, and is incompetent social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering for sure (lots of stress induced, very little benefit to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the people as a whole).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
