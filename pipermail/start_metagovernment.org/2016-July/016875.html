Check your spam filter: I think there's something peculiar about his
posts that triggers spam filters. Another one ended up in mine just
this morning.

&gt;<i> I do not have high expectations, but maybe someone will pay attention to

</I>
Hadn't seen your posts previously (guess I'm still relatively new
here), but agree 100% with your reasoning. The only thing I'd add is
that it also essential to help people *choose* appropriate delegates.
The Matchsys proposal (buried in the manifesto on matchism.org) is
that delegates by matched by personality profile, much the way
computer dating works. The data collection for this is relatively
straightforward as there are very well researched personality tests
that psychologists use that are not overly burdensome to complete
(e.g., there's a 10-question version of the Big-5 inventory that only
takes a couple of minutes to fill out).

What's *not* helpful IMHO is to allow &quot;virtual&quot; delegates that
represent the positions of political parties, corporations, PACs,
nonprofits, etc. because that just introduces a strong bias toward
corruption into the process and actually gets away from the essential
humanness exhibited by individuals that disappears when mob effects
take over (my theory is that our mob-forming instincts evolved in the
EEA to facilitate resource-acquisition attacks on neighboring bands:
Since these effects are no longer required in modern society and
because they facilitate aggression and tribalism they need to be
suppressed or at least not encouraged by the voting system).

One thing you (and I guess I) gloss over is that delegation requires
open voting, which some people object to (fortunately for us the
research shows that it's mostly the least informed voters who don't
want their votes published, references for this provided on
matchism.org). My matching proposal also means that personality type
information will be accessible, at least at the server level. My guess
is that this won't be a problem for most people either (e.g., they'll
offer up their party affiliation at the drop of a hat), but it is
something we need to handle carefully.
  Regards,
    Scott
