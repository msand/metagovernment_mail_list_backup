<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Focusing the attention of the entire population of the earth on 
those 2 or 3 proposals then leaves all of the other millions of 
public-matter decisions per week entirely free to be made by 
government-body hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top 
capitalists, without individuals of the general public having any formal 
role in the actual decision-making at all.

 &gt;Scott&gt; Seems we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement here: 
You seem to be advocating a collectivist economy where the government 
micromanages all production *and* all expression. My view is that the 
purpose of government is limited to regulation. That requires only a 
small fraction of the resources and although it might naturally have a 
little more slop it in (usually regulation doesn't kick in until *after* 
someone has figured out how to game the system), it is vastly more 
efficient and vastly easier to implement.

Ned&gt; I will begin by noting that you did not respond to what I actually 
said. Rather, you leaped to philosophy and to guesses about what I 
advocate. (We really do need better software tools through which to 
work. Tangential flights of fancy can be useful/valuable, if they are 
explicitly recognized as such and usefully separated out and organized. 
Software can help with that.)

Do you agree/disagree that &quot;Focusing the attention of the entire 
population of the earth on those 2 or 3 proposals then leaves all of the 
other millions of public-matter decisions per week entirely free to be 
made by government-body hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top 
capitalists, without *individuals* of the general public having any 
formal role in the actual decision-making at all.&quot;? (And why, if you 
have a why.)

If you wish to discuss the &quot;fundamental philosophical disagreement&quot; that 
you feel you have glimpsed, by all means please do fire up other threads.

I agree that there are fundamental philosophical disagreements between 
us, but those differences are not at all what you have posited. Applying 
old and vague social system terms (such as &quot;collectivist economy&quot;) to 
new social system designs that are nothing like the old designs really 
doesn't work -- it totally confuses people, and actually prevents them 
from seeing and understanding the new design. That appears to have 
happened to you in this instance.

The &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern sets up &quot;collectivist democracy&quot;: 
The demos makes decisions as a single huge entity.

In contrast, the &quot;propose recursively&quot; design pattern sets up 
&quot;individualist democracy&quot;: Individuals and small teams participate in 
decision-making on equal footing as autonomous, independent entities, 
interacting with one another. The demos as a single huge entity plays no 
role in decision making.

You have never seen &quot;individualist democracy&quot; successfully operating at 
population scale. For whatever reasons, I suspect that you will never 
accept that &quot;individualist democracy&quot; can successfully operate at that 
scale until you have seen at least one actual demonstration of it doing 
so. (Have I mentioned that I will be really glad when we get to the 
testing phase, and past the competitive chest-beating phase?)

(You have also never seen &quot;collectivist democracy&quot; successfully 
operating at population scale, but for some reason that does not seem to 
have convinced you that it therefore cannot. You think that little 
tweaks such as switching from representatives to proxies, and presenting 
concise, objective, unbiased little blurbs at Point-Of-Vote can Save The 
Day.) (When we get to the testing phase, we shall see whether that is 
indeed the case.)
