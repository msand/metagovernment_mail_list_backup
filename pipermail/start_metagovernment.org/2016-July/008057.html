<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; The main purpose of population-scale voting (from the 
perspective of the elites) is to give individual citizens the 
illegitimate feeling that they are making a difference, when in fact 
their contribution (as individuals and as a body) is so minuscule as to 
be negligible.

 &gt;Scott&gt; Agreed, although I think it's actually it's worse than that: 
Almost all population-scale voting is for &quot;representatives&quot;, which IMHO 
means the individual's contribution is even less than negligible since 
they don't get to specify the pool of candidates that they have to 
choose from.

Ned&gt; Hmmm... You have surprised me. I see this point as a fatal problem 
for any social system design that uses population-scale voting to make 
decisions (including the Iteration#1 Matchism design), but you clearly 
do not.

How do you expect to persuade people that they should spend the time to 
cast those 2 or 3 votes per week through the Matchsys, when your 
position is that doing so has an effect so minuscule as to be 
negligible? (Telling them that the effect has been raised from &quot;even 
less than negligible&quot; to negligible, through the elimination of voting 
for representatives, may not be enough.)

In global-scale &quot;collectivist democracy&quot;, individual citizens have 
negligible political power because each citizen is casting one vote of 
billions. (It really does not matter whether that vote is cast directly 
or through a proxy. It is still just one vote of billions.)

And, (in global-scale collectivist democracy) The People (that single 
huge collectivist decision-making entity comprised of all voters) also 
has only negligible political power because it is not capable of making 
enough decisions to even begin to effectively manage all of the 
government-bodies and corporations and capitalists in the global-scale 
social system. (Testing will show that 2 or 3 decisions per week by The 
People will produce effects so minuscule as to be negligible. But don't 
just take my word for it. Let's test.)
