<PRE>Hi Matteo Martini,
Great post. (I do not see you original post somehow, but I see what you wrote in it). You are right, all direct democracy projects have failed so far. The worst thing, people are extremely non-critical about their projects, they pretty much refuse to discuss correctness of their strategy, what can go wrong, if they are realistic in their expectations, what are possible alternatives, etc. I tried to engage people many times in such a discussion. All I hear back: just come and participate in our project, we need get people involved. This includes Airesis and Metagovernment.

 I told people time and again, that the only hope to scale direct democracy is to have a very flexible system of vote delegation. This is the key. But nobody listens. 

This is what I wrote to Jacopo Tolja more than 2 years ago:
=========================================================================
I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see what you think:

1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted subversive effort.

2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns. People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).

3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example, thus circumventing your restrictions.

I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation. But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see what other people may say.=========================================================================

I do not have high expectations, but maybe someone will pay attention to this reasoning.
Thanks!

 Hi I have been involved in direct democracy for almost ten years now and collaborated with a few projects, worked on some of them and saw how they have been developed and how they failed

&#8203;Hi Matteo, nice to hear from you!&#160;
It's so good to discorver italians involved in eDem (so rare!) and you are giving me the chance to stop lurking on this ml.&#160;
I've also been involved directly in most of the italian eDem projects (some of the links contain my interviews/opinions):&#160;- Rousseau, 5 Star Movement's eDem platform (<A HREF="http://bit.ly/R0USSEAU">http://bit.ly/R0USSEAU</A>)&#160;- Partito Liquido, eDem in primetime TV show from Michele Santoro's Servizio Pubblico (<A HREF="http://huff.to/2adVrim">http://huff.to/2adVrim</A>)&#160;- eDem voting platform for Umberto Ambrosoli (<A HREF="http://bit.ly/2a1yFqH">http://bit.ly/2a1yFqH</A>)&#160;- Parelon, a LiquidFeedback fork (<A HREF="https://www.parelon.com">https://www.parelon.com</A>)&#160;- Permanent Assembly of the Italian Pirate Party&#160;&#8203;(<A HREF="http://bit.ly/2admesq">http://bit.ly/2admesq</A>)&#8203;&#8203; &#8203;
What about your projects? Let's share some experiences!&#160;
Best,
Carlo

(My thoughts about your statements will follow...)&#160;
 As all direct democracy projects developed so far have failed.

&#8203;I must agree with you in terms of organization, policies and communication strategies behind and at the top of the projects.&#160;But I think the softwares are ok. &#8203;
 No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent of the global populations

Hopefully, no one is interested in a global anarco-fascist cyber dictature.&#8203;.. ;)&#160;
 Hundreds of projects have been developed and on one has been used until now.

&#8203;The experiences I described above have been used, I'm a direct witness, even if with some functional issues... &#8203;&#160;
 Still, people do not listen to this fact and they keep develop new projects and they keep failing Vilfredo has failed.

&#8203;I'm not optimistic about Pietro's project, even if I know he's improuving year after year his software.Imho if he will work on design/UX we could really try the potential of Vilfredo.&#8203;&#160;
 Airesis has failed

&#8203;It depends on the groups.&#160;I know that some 5 Star Movement groups on Airesis are doing very good numbers in terms of participation.I think that the problem for Airesis is certification and the absence of proxy voting (delegation).&#8203;
 Votorola has failed

&#8203;Did Votorola really started? Please share some links with an online demo if possible, I'd really appreciate... I'm really curious about their concrete implementation. &#8203;
 LQFB has failed

&#8203;I totally disagree. I personally implemented the Partito Liquido instance and we had thousand of people voting on the platform.&#160;As I sad, my opinion is that the problem is not about the software, it's about the objectives, rules, statutes, constitution of the assembly, communication, etc.&#8203;
 and so many others Others are in development now, I predict they will fail as well Matchism will fail Blinap will fail

&#8203;Do you have some links of these projects? Never heard about it.In exchange I suggest you to have a look at:- Loomio: <A HREF="https://www.loomio.org&#160;&#160;-">https://www.loomio.org&#160;&#160;-</A> OpenVote:&#160;<A HREF="https://openvote.com&#160;-">https://openvote.com&#160;-</A> NationBuilder (US only): &#8203;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/voterfile&#160;&#160;&#8203;-">http://nationbuilder.com/voterfile&#160;&#160;&#8203;-</A> Democracy OS: &#8203;<A HREF="http://democracyos.org&#160;&#160;&#8203;-">http://democracyos.org&#160;&#160;&#8203;-</A> Placeavote (US only): <A HREF="https://placeavote.com&#160;&#8203;">https://placeavote.com&#160;&#8203;</A>
 the saddest thing of all, is that like it happened with the developers of other direct democracy system, the developers of Matchism and Blinap will become so tired, so depressed that I suspect they will quit with direct democracy completely Here are the five steps of the typical direct democracy project      
   -   The creative phase: the single or group proponents of the project gather and start to discuss about the project. A document is written, and a site is opened. 
   -   euphoric phase: the group starts to involve other people, the project is developed, people work hard. The atmosphere around the project is euphoric .New functionalities are added every day. 
   -   The stagnation phase: the project fails to get much traction. People are starting to get frustrated and there is a deep gulf about the big expectations and the poor results.   
   -   The decline phase: the group accuses the public at large of being lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the governments of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is little or no self-criticism about why the project is not going as planned.  People start to leave the project. 
   -   The death phase: the once big group is now very much slimmed down and only a few people survive. There are no major addition and changes to the project in months. The project is not being discussed upon in the media anymore. In a few months or years, the project is  definitely shelved for good. 
  
   At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern, no one excluded.  It is yet to be seen if there will ever been one direct democracy project to be used on permanent  basis.    Votorola is now at step 5  Airesis at step 4  Matchism, Blinap at step 1-2  Why new developers do not listen to old developers who failed?  Why they do not study why other system failed and instead build a new system also doomed

&#8203;I really hope to have more time soon to better analyse your opinions and give you a ore accurated feedback.&#8203;
