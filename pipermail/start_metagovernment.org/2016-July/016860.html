Got two different versions of this message. I picked this one to respond to...

&gt;<i> -&gt; As long as you will want to solve all world problems, and include small
</I>&gt;<i> decisions in your project you will always fail!
</I>
Why? Did Tesla start out making a two wheeled car, or Apple a phone
that only did talk and text? When designing a product you have to
analyse what the market needs and will accept, then scale your product
(and your organizations capabilities) to match.

&gt;<i> Look at the other projects, see how they failed and try to understand why
</I>
IMHO most fail not because they were too ambitious but because they're
too timid. Loomio in particular I think has put themselves in a
straightjacket by failing to claim their product is a viable form of
government that was designed to *replace* existing organizations not
just augment them (e.g., it ought to already be possible to replace an
HOA board with Loomio group, yet they don't even seem to have an
example of anyone having done that yet).

I think it's even more important to study systems that succeeded but
then went off the rails. For example, Marx created a very elegant and
egalitarian system, only to have his design languish for decades,
mostly because people thought it too difficult to implement (sounds
like you: &quot;It will fail!&quot;). Unfortunately decades later a bunch of
authoritarians seeking to create a dictatorship seized on Marx's
ideas, but rather than implement them the way they were designed, used
them more like a marketing tool to convince people to get behind the
new system (which of course didn't work, partly because it was a bad
design (didn't match human nature) but mostly because it was
implemented wrong). Which tells me two things:

1) Be careful: People will die as the result of a transition to a new
system and we can only hope to minimize the cost of the transition,
not eliminate it.

2) Be complete: If you leave a lot of stuff underdefined (as Marx did)
some jerk like Lenin will come along and fill in the holes with his
own mostly SDAP preferences. We *do* have to consider what our
existing political establishment will think of our systems and how
they will fight against them. That includes having a strategy that not
only pisses off the lawyers, but also pits most of the rest of the
population against them.

&gt;<i> -&gt; Again, complicated
</I>&gt;<i> You do not need to create a responsive site that works with Ipad Iphone etc.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a difficult thing to do
</I>&gt;<i> Even if you have money
</I>&gt;<i> You should be working only with a common laptop
</I>&gt;<i> This should be more than enough at the beginning
</I>
Again, that's the Tesla motorcycle. You have to design for what the
market wants, and they don't want a laptop-only app anymore. In fact
in this market, I'd drop the laptop and *only* support phones if a
choice had to be made (at least in the US, apps are already twice the
market share of web for advertising, meaning that's where people are
spending at least 2/3 of their time)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;  Move-on is one of the few platform that achieved SOMETHING
</I>&gt;<i> It is somehow having a small impact on the system
</I>
Small to insignificant. Half the things Avaaz and MoveOn promote don't
pass, and most of the rest would have passed without their
participation at all. As a social engineer I can't make the claim
these organizations have no value: They reduce stress by giving people
the *feeling* they're making a difference in the world, even though
objectively there is no significant positive effect and there are
likely significant negative effects. Although this stress-reduction is
a positive benefit, it's more like the effect of drugs (including
alcohol), giving to charity, going to church, etc. and so shouldn't be
considered as a way to make a positive contribution to the operation
of the government or society in general.

&gt;<i> I do not understand where they would be siphoning energy away from since
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can build a better platform if we want
</I>
And will all those millions of Avaaz and MoveOn contributors use it,
or will they decide that they already have an outlet that allows them
to make a contribution and so ignore anything controversial or hard to
learn or use? My guess is that the vast majority will do the latter,
which means that Avaaz and MoveOn are actually an impediment to
changing our political systems.

&gt;<i> And no one has been as successful as MoveOn if I may..
</I>&gt;<i> Move On strenghtening the oligarchies? Are you serious?
</I>
Definitely: By deferring to them (&quot;Oh, please please please do just
this one little thing for us!&quot;) they actually reinforce the perception
that we The People are weak and that we do not have the power to
override the oligarchs. That's just wrong and definitely part of the
problem rather than part of the solution.

We of course must put disclaimers on our designs and our prototype
systems that clearly indicate that they're not ready to run the world
yet, but we must also make it clear that that's what they're
*designed* to do and that it is inevitable that eventually they will.
  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Just my two cents..
