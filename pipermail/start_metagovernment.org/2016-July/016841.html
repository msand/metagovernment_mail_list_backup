<PRE>
You guys are making it all so complicated..
Random participation, millions of decisions to be taken, etc. etc.
People do not like to use complicated stuff..
Look at Twitter, look at Facebook, this is what we need to emulate
All direct democracy software so far failed, no one is used at a global 
level
People need to ask themselves why, ee do not need to be driven by tour 
own gigantic ego into projects that have all failed
We need to get back to Earth and look at things how they are
We do not need to create a new system of politics from scratch, I would 
be MORE than happy if we could just affect it in a positive way on a 
selected range of issues, not millions

Just my two cents..

;)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You have focused in your list of 75 grievances mostly on atrocities
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> committed by national governments. It would be possible to write another
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> list of grievances, just as long and substantive, focused on atrocities
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> committed by multi-national corporations, and a third list focused on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> atrocities instigated by top capitalists (that effectively own both the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> corporations and the national governments).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, and let's not forget atrocities committed by various religious
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> organizations, and by gangsters (organized crime). Again, I consider
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all of these to be a distraction and things that will largely be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> solved incidentally to achieving our main goal of facilitating &quot;good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> government&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> National governments and multi-national corporations and top capitalists
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> make tens of millions of public-matter decisions per year (decisions that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> affect the public). The decisions that produce the atrocities are among
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those tens of millions. (Not all of the decisions produce atrocities, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reliably filtering out those that do requires passing all of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through the direct democracy filter.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seems like a big project: Review every decision that anyone makes that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could affect another person?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The attention of the entire population of the earth can be focused on (at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> most) only 2 or 3 proposals per week (according to Scott's guess -- in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> practice, no population in history has ever come anywhere near that many
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> full-quorum direct democracy decisions-per-week).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> True, but I didn't just pull that number out of my ass: When you look
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at the number of votes held by our elected representatives at *all*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> levels, it's in that ballpark, at least after you subtract out the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> redundancies. For example, our Republican-controlled congress has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voted to repeal Obamacare over 60 times in the last 4 years. An even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more important example is that my local city, county, and state have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each passed multiple conflicting laws regarding fracking. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something that's bound to happen when you have overlapping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> jurisdictions: Our current 4-level system was designed when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information was transmitted on horseback and there's simply no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> justification for keeping it other than inertia. We could cut out at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> least half the votes (not to mention about half of the personnel and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other overhead) simply by getting rid of the levels of states and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> counties which IMHO no longer have any real purpose.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Focusing the attention of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the entire population of the earth on those 2 or 3 proposals then leaves
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the other millions of public-matter decisions per week entirely free
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be made by government-body hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> capitalists, without individuals of the general public having any formal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> role in the actual decision-making at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Seems we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement here: You seem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be advocating a collectivist economy where the government
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> micromanages all production *and* all expression. My view is that the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> purpose of government is limited to regulation. That requires only a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> small fraction of the resources and although it might naturally have a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> little more slop it in (usually regulation doesn't kick in until
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *after* someone has figured out how to game the system), it is vastly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more efficient and vastly easier to implement.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The main purpose of population-scale voting (from the perspective of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elites) is to give individual citizens the illegitimate feeling that they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are making a difference, when in fact their contribution (as individuals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as a body) is so minuscule as to be negligible.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed, although I think it's actually it's worse than that: Almost
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all population-scale voting is for &quot;representatives&quot;, which IMHO means
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the individual's contribution is even less than negligible since they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't get to specify the pool of candidates that they have to choose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Speaking abstractly, there are two competing decision system design
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> patterns
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through which to effect direct democracy:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> propose -&gt; vote
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> propose recursively (nobody votes)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the last Vilfredo round we did was a pretty convincing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> demonstration of why that, or any other recursive or consensus based
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system, is not viable for population-scale decisionmaking. It's simply
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> too inefficient.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Your design is a variation of the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern. I see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reason to think that it will work any better than any of the other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variations of that design pattern. At population scale, all of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> variations bump into the &quot;Too Few Decisions&quot; problem: 2 or 3 direct
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> democracy decisions per week is not enough to manage or even
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> significantly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> influence the operation of a population-scale social system.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, it's plenty if all you need to do is make regulatory decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and a few personnel decisions (e.g., hiring the top-level manager, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> firing someone at any level). I'll admit that it does rely pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> heavily on powerful and highly productive managers (the executive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> branch), but we already have those. For example I think both Bush and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Obama have convincingly shown that the US President can get stuff done
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even when congress can't actually agree on *anything*. The fact that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> both made a great number of really bad decisions I think is because we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chose the wrong people (i.e., we were limited to choosing among
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> politicians rather than being able to select among qualified managers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and social engineers), not because there's anything inherently wrong
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with having a powerful executive branch of government.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (Note on nested jurisdictions: When an individual chooses to focus on 2
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> or 3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> local matters in a particular week rather than on global matters, that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reduces the &quot;sheer numbers&quot; that are available to make those 2 or 3
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions at the global level that week. Since sensible people will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand that casting 1 vote of thousands on an issue has greater
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> effect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than casting 1 vote of billions on an issue, sensible individuals will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inclined to focus on local matters more than global matters. This will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reduce the number of decisions per week that can be made at the global
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> level, thereby exacerbating the already fatal problem that 2 or 3 global
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> influence
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the operation of a global social system.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I disagree: I envision that the *majority* of decisions will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> global and that local decisions will be primarily personnel-oriented.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having a zillion different sets of local laws the way we do now is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just ludicrous and leads to endless squabbling and court cases as each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Locality reinvents the legal wheel. As is my recommendation for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> business-related contracts we ought to have one standard contract that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the parties might change one or two clauses in to fit the particular
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> situation, the collection of local ordinances that differ from the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> standard should run to a few pages (they're literally book sized now).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Of course the lawyers aren't going to be happy with that (I figure we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can get by with probably 5 or 10% of the number of lawyers we have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now), but we've let them run the show for far too long now and they've
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> made a real mess of things.
