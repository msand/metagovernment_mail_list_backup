<PRE>I assume you posted this here in hopes of receiving feedback on how to
improve it, in which case I'm happy to oblige ;-)

1) The first half of the paper is merely distraction and should be
published separately. My prediction is that most people will stop
reading before they even finish that section. Worse, I don't even see
any claim (let alone support for a claim) that a direct democracy will
actually reduce the incidence of most of those sorts of atrocities. I
suspect it will, but certainly wouldn't be willing to stake the worth
of my project on this. People already know our governments are
dysfunctional so IMHO there's no need to even document this. There are
plenty of problems other than preventing atrocities (particularly by
the military) that a properly functioning government can solve. I
would argue that solving small problems that affect billions is a
vastly more important goal than preventing atrocities that might
affect tens/hundreds/thousands of people. Most of your items are
actually better evidence that we need to eliminate militaries or
institute mass anti-tribalism education campaigns than anything to do
with government.

2) You sort of gloss over the issue of open voting. You'll find a
handful of references on the subject on matchism.org: Studies show
that *most* people are willing to have their positions on the issues
and their votes published, but that there is a vocal minority who
oppose it. As it turns out, that minority also happens to be the least
informed about the issues (i.e., they may be more concerned with
protection against looking like fools than with any sort of
privacy/coercion/vote buying/etc. issues).

3) Your proposed delegation system I think is under-developed (the
same goes for every other proposal I've seen, notably including
&quot;liquid democracy&quot;). This is a key component of the current proposal
on matchism.org, where they key issue of *finding* appropriate
delegates is dealt with (i.e., they're found by psychologically
matching people, much the way that dating services like eHarmony
work).

4) Although I'd agree that it's an empirical question (and there is
far too little empiricism in this field today), I'm skeptical that
virtual delegates (e.g, encouraging the formation of special-issue
parties) won't just result in the system devolving back into the one
we have now (e.g., people who vote the party line, single-issue
voters, etc.). IMHO the trick to building a robust direct democracy is
to work hard to decouple every vote rather than providing *any* sort
of aggregation system. My example is that while it's perfectly
predictable that people will vote for Hitler (or Trump) when they feel
their resources are being threatened (it's a well-documented
psychological phenomenon), they probably *won't* vote to approve a
purchase order for Zyclon-B to be used on some minority group. The
trick, therefore, is to design the system to suppress aggregation of
power to the greatest degree possible. Political parties and your
virtual delegates work against that goal.

5) In my proposed system I share your concerns about the vote
counters/policy implementers gaining too much power and then becoming
impossible to remove. I propose a simpler solution: Make them actual
government employees and create a system such that *any* government
employee can be removed from their position by popular vote in the
relevant jurisdiction. I suspect that this will become a very popular
component of my system when I get around to implementing it (there are
certain judges and police chiefs that I'm sure nearly everyone will
actually *enjoy* firing!)

Finally I'd recommend publishing this as a web page rather than as a
PDF. My experience has been that few people will actually read a
multi-page PDF, but they will jump around on a web site and absorb at
least *some* of it.

I look forward to seeing the next revision, and feel free to use any
of the ideas here or on matchism.org. I don't even expect credit: my
major fear being that people will implement my ideas badly and set the
field back than that attributions somehow get lost...
  Regards,
    Scott
