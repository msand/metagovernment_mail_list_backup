Perhaps my expectations were too high, then. I assumed that because it
was associated with the Metagovernment project that it somehow was
actually intended to *be* a component of (if not a replacement for our
existing) government.

&gt;<i> In my view, Vilfredo (as a team tool) performed admirably
</I>&gt;<i> (I was impressed), and was not in any way responsible for the fact that the
</I>&gt;<i> team of participants happened to be a herd of cats.
</I>
You've obviously not spent very much time on FB or the various
newspaper opinion forums. We're lightweights compared to what you see
on those, which are more like a herd of wolverines.

&gt;<i> I would not hesitate to
</I>&gt;<i> employ Vilfredo again in future Mission:Impossible situations such as that
</I>&gt;<i> one. What you see as inefficiency I see as us learning thoroughly that we
</I>&gt;<i> (the members of the team) were not even close to being &quot;on the same page&quot;.
</I>
I think I could have figured that out without spending many hours over
many weeks in an environment that I found very frustrating. But that's
only probably one third of the problem with Vilfredo (and all other
&quot;collaborative&quot; tools I've looked at, for that matter). The two larger
problems are:

1) The &quot;last man standing&quot; outcome, where the most stubborn person
gets their way because everyone else just gives up.

2) The fact that along the way the proposals get so watered down that
they won't even be effective at achieving the original goal, rendering
the entire process a waste of time.

&gt;<i>     3. You appear to have a peculiar idea of what constitutes efficient
</I>&gt;<i> population-scale decision-making. Making a single global-scale decision
</I>&gt;<i> through Matchsys puts 6 billion people to work to make that single decision.
</I>&gt;<i> If we say that the living wage cost of that participation is $1 for each
</I>&gt;<i> individual, that puts the living-wage cost at $6 billion for that single
</I>&gt;<i> decision. And, the quality of the decision will be that which $1 buys --
</I>&gt;<i> poor quality. Matchsys pays $6 billion for each $1 decision. That does not
</I>&gt;<i> seem to me to be very efficient decision-making. (In testing, Blinap will
</I>&gt;<i> beat the socks off of Matchsys, with respect to both measures of efficiency
</I>&gt;<i> and measures of decision quality.)
</I>
I don't have a sense yet of what the actual input will be, and it will
surely depend on the issue. For deciding our policy on abortion I'd
expect near full direct participation rates, and I think most people
are already prepared to make that decision without investing a lot of
time on research. For deciding what kind of bridge to build over a
nearby river, I'd expect actual participation rates to be orders of
magnitude lower, with proxies taking on nearly all of the effort to
understand the issue and most people just relying on their
determination. I'd therefore dispute your efficiency claims, with the
two systems actually being in the same ballpark for most day-to-day
types of decisions. But I think it'd be useful to discuss the
differences:

1) Matchsys proxies are psychologically matched, and yet people can
also override these selections by doing selection based on voting
record or level of expertise or any other measure they chose. In
Blinap, proxies are chosen at random.

2) Matchsys proxies can be changed at any time, or over-ridden if the
individual feels sufficiently prepared to make a direct vote. No
option for this in Blinap (i.e., Blinap requires individuals to trust
that the proxies represent an individuals preferences at least on a
statistical basis).

3) Matchsys proposals will be produced by experts, probably most
commonly by the Managers themselves. Blinap proposals are prepared by
amateurs, albeit presumably amateurs without the kinds of agendas we
see in our current misrepresentative democracies (e.g., the need to
curry favor with donors or potential after-office employers, etc.) The
proposal quality, and more importantly the implementation
effectiveness, will therefore be much higher with Matchsys. As I
stated in response to your &quot;make Italy better using Airesis&quot;
suggestion, IMHO the success of these projects will actually depend
*more* on the quality of the proposals than on the quality of the
software used to vote on them. Given what I've seen in the statutes in
government at all levels, quality writing and logic (let alone social
engineering expertise) is extremely rare even among the ranks the
lawyers and businessmen who make up the bulk of our existing
misrepresentative governments. Expecting Joe Sixpack to come up with
(or even help refine) proposals is just delusional.
