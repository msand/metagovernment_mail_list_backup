<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i>Ned&gt; And also, the answer to your implicit  question (&quot;Is that possible?&quot; [to make all public-matter decisions 
</I>democratically]) needs to be an actual demonstration, not just words. (I 
will be really glad when we get to the testing phase for Blinap and the 
Matchsys and Matteo's decision system, and past the competitive 
chest-beating phase that precedes the testing phase.)

&gt;<i>Scott&gt; I think I disagree: We (including I)  don't even know enough yet to create a viable [decision] system, and 
</I>it'd be a great waste of resources to build something complete only to 
find that we'd overlooked some key fact out there in the world and so 
ended up off in the weeds.
Ned&gt; The problem for that approach is (for example): I have been 
presenting you with key facts that (I think) show the Matchsys design to 
be off in the weeds, and you have been presenting me with key &quot;facts&quot; 
that (you think) show the Blinap design to be off in the weeds, without 
success. Competitive chest-beating is not effective. Actual testing is 
required, however wasteful it may be.

&gt;<i>Scott&gt; I'm all for building prototypes, but  everything I've seen in this area so far is so far off the mark that 
</I>even building a prototype is probably not the best use of our limited 
time and energy.

Ned&gt; If you look at the process of developing decision system designs as 
being just another application of the process of developing software 
system designs generally, you will see that building prototypes needs to 
be a modular matter, down to a very fine-grained level. We need to make 
it easy to build lots of prototypes, in such a way that we can readily 
re-use the parts to build still more prototypes. We need to be able to 
easily assemble new prototypes from already existing parts, and then 
test the new prototypes to failure (fast), and then throw away the 
failed prototypes with little loss. And, we need elaborate test-beds 
capable of thoroughly and realistically (and harmlessly!) testing those 
successive prototypes to failure (fast).
Competitive chest-beating does not add anything to our knowledge base. 
Testing widely diverse prototypes does.

The question is: What is the best way (fast, thorough, harmless) for us 
to learn what we need to learn about global decision system design? (I 
submit that iterating among reading literature and amateur armchair 
designing and competitive chest-beating is not the best way.)
