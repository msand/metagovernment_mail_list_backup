Hi

I have been involved in direct democracy for almost ten years now and 
collaborated with a few projects, worked on some of them and saw how 
they have been developed and how they failed

As all direct democracy projects developed so far have failed.

No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent of 
the global populations

Hundreds of projects have been developed and on one has been used until now.

Still, people do not listen to this fact and they keep develop new 
projects and they keep failing

Vilfredo has failed.

Airesis has failed

Votorola has failed

LQFB has failed

and so many others


Others are in development now, I predict they will fail as well

Matchism will fail

Blinap will fail

the saddest thing of all, is that like it happened with the developers 
of other direct democracy system, the developers of Matchism and Blinap 
will become so tired, so depressed that I suspect they will quit with 
direct democracy completely


Here are the five steps of the typical direct democracy project


 1.

    The _creative phase_: the single or group proponents of the project
    gather and start to discuss about the project. A document is
    written, and a site is opened.

 2.

    _euphoric phase_: the group starts to involve other people, the
    project is developed, people work hard. The atmosphere around the
    project is euphoric .New functionalities are added every day.

 3.

    The _stagnation phase_: the project fails to get much traction.
    People are starting to get frustrated and there is a deep gulf about
    the big expectations and the poor results.

 4.

    The _decline phase_: the group accuses the public at large of being
    lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the
    governments of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is
    little or no self-criticism about why the project is not going as
    planned. People start to leave the project.

 5.

    The _death phase_: the once big group is now very much slimmed down
    and only a few people survive. There are no major addition and
    changes to the project in months. The project is not being discussed
    upon in the media anymore. In a few months or years, the project is
    definitely shelved for good.


At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern, no 
one excluded.

It is yet to be seen if there will ever been one direct democracy 
project to be used on permanent

basis.

Votorola is now at step 5

Airesis at step 4

Matchism, Blinap at step 1-2


Why new developers do not listen to old developers who failed?

Why they do not study why other system failed and instead build a new 
system also doomed
