Unfortunately &quot;humanism&quot; is rather undeveloped as philosophy in
general, let alone a political philosophy. It's mostly defined by what
it's not: &quot;A system of morals specified by God&quot; (the latter of course
*actually* being &quot;A system of morals specified by amateur social
engineers&quot;, the religious leaders who write &quot;bibles&quot; having no
particular training in psychology or engineering). Any prescriptions
that are associated with humanism all seem to me to be sort of fuzzy
leftism that blindingly ignore the fact that there are substantial
differences in personality characteristics among individuals.

&gt;<i> Along these lines, another book I recommend to help extricate oneself

It's still relevant, even though it's coming up on 40 years old.
Reading it you get &quot;infected&quot; by the meme that humans are just robotic
vehicles designed for gene propagation. Realizing this makes it much
easier to examine each of our Clinations and rationally pick and
choose which ones we're going to deprecate and which we're going to
run with.

&gt;<i> About psychopaths, I am in the middle of the book . Just a few quick ideas,
</I>&gt;<i> that seem as a solution to me: Provide effective decision-making. Make sure
</I>&gt;<i> the legitimate decisions are respected. Make the game repetitive.
</I>&gt;<i> For the game to be repetitive other players do have to remember them. That
</I>&gt;<i> means a small stable group IMHO. As much as I remember system science
</I>&gt;<i> recommends the same - short feedback loops. True?
</I>
Yes, although that is difficult with many public-policy decisions
because they take years or even decades to become complete enough to
evaluate. But for me, the *most* important thing is population
weighting of all decisions: Psychopaths, like the other components of
our current SDAP-based leadership systems, are a small minority of the
population and it may be sufficient to limit their power by making
them easily removable/replaceable. I have no aspiration to remove all
them from positions of leadership (or indeed to eliminate the
leadership positions they use to make the rest of us miserable)
because I believe that is impossible. They're the only ones who
actually *want* to run the government, after all. See my response to
Ned's post for more on this.

    Scott
