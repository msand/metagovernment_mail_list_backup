<PRE>&gt;<i> -&gt;  Wrong example.
</I>&gt;<i> Musk invested some billion dollars in Tesla, do you have some billions of
</I>&gt;<i> dollars to invest?
</I>&gt;<i> Apple invested some billion dollars in the Iphone, do you have some billions
</I>&gt;<i> of dollars to invest?
</I>
Don't think it'll cost that much, but the point is if you design your
system to accommodate your current budget, you're doing it wrong (the
usual answer in the tech business is angel investors or VC, but it's
also possible to bootstrap if you know what you're doing).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Look at the other projects, see how they failed and try to understand why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO most fail not because they were too ambitious but because they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too timid. Loomio in particular I think has put themselves in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straightjacket by failing to claim their product is a viable form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government that was designed to *replace* existing organizations not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just augment them (e.g., it ought to already be possible to replace an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HOA board with Loomio group, yet they don't even seem to have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example of anyone having done that yet).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; ?? I dont understand
</I>
Seems clear enough to me. Perhaps read the archives on our previous
discussions of Loomio.

&gt;<i> -&gt; Again
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong example
</I>&gt;<i> It took some 70 years from the publication of the Communist manifesto to the
</I>&gt;<i> October revolution
</I>
And that's mostly because of &quot;it can't work&quot; mentalities like yours.
Fortunately technology has made our job a lot easier than Marx's.

&gt;<i> If you have some 70 years of work to give please go ahead
</I>
I have no idea how many years it will take. Could take a hundred.
Could take 5. All I do know that our current system is deeply flawed
and that it will eventually be replaced. We can hurry the process
along some by having informed discussions on the issues, and then
using what we know to build software to support these new systems.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; Again, complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You do not need to create a responsive site that works with Ipad Iphone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is a difficult thing to do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Even if you have money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You should be working only with a common laptop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This should be more than enough at the beginning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again, that's the Tesla motorcycle. You have to design for what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market wants, and they don't want a laptop-only app anymore. In fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in this market, I'd drop the laptop and *only* support phones if a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choice had to be made (at least in the US, apps are already twice the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> market share of web for advertising, meaning that's where people are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spending at least 2/3 of their time)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;  You have to give the market the product they want
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly
</I>&gt;<i> No one in the market today needs or wants matchism nor Bitglub
</I>&gt;<i> This is why they fail
</I>
I doubt you understand Matchism well enough to make that claim, but
just to play along, if you're so smart, what *do* they want?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt;  Move-on is one of the few platform that achieved SOMETHING
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is somehow having a small impact on the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Small to insignificant. Half the things Avaaz and MoveOn promote don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass, and most of the rest would have passed without their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participation at all. As a social engineer I can't make the claim
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these organizations have no value: They reduce stress by giving people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the *feeling* they're making a difference in the world, even though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objectively there is no significant positive effect and there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely significant negative effects. Although this stress-reduction is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a positive benefit, it's more like the effect of drugs (including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alcohol), giving to charity, going to church, etc. and so shouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered as a way to make a positive contribution to the operation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the government or society in general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; Small to insignificant????
</I>&gt;<i> Funneling thousands of people into supporting a joint action is
</I>&gt;<i> insignificant?
</I>
Yes, if that &quot;joint action&quot; is essentially mental (and/or emotional)
masturbation. Again, MoveOn and Avaaz have *NO EFFECT* on how
governments actually operate. Indeed, if MoveOn could even affect the
political party they generally support Bernie would be the democratic
candidate instead of Hillary: Man, they really blew that call...

&gt;<i> Please let us know what YOU have done better than them
</I>
I expected better from you than &quot;nannynannybooboo&quot; arguments.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And no one has been as successful as MoveOn if I may..
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Move On strenghtening the oligarchies? Are you serious?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely: By deferring to them (&quot;Oh, please please please do just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this one little thing for us!&quot;) they actually reinforce the perception
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we The People are weak and that we do not have the power to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> override the oligarchs. That's just wrong and definitely part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem rather than part of the solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What?
</I>&gt;<i> Deferring to the oligarchs by using MoveOn?
</I>
Exactly: If you don't see how this works, try reading it again until you do.

&gt;&gt;<i> We of course must put disclaimers on our designs and our prototype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems that clearly indicate that they're not ready to run the world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yet, but we must also make it clear that that's what they're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *designed* to do and that it is inevitable that eventually they will.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Scott

This is not an academic exercise: Our lives are literally in danger,
and most people don't even see it coming.
