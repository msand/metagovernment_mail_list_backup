Look at the other projects, see how they failed and try to understand why

</I>-&gt; Again, complicated
You do not need to create a responsive site that works with Ipad Iphone etc.
This is a difficult thing to do
Even if you have money
You should be working only with a common laptop
This should be more than enough at the beginning

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People need to ask themselves why, ee do not need to be driven by tour own

</I>&gt;<i> There are lots of reasons for this, ego isn't one of them. Without a

</I>&gt;<i> nothing will ever get done. This is therefore not a valid criticism.
</I>
-&gt; We are full of visionaries here
All the people writing in this forum are somehow visionaries
And noone of us has been able to create a software of general use
We have all failed
&gt;&gt;<i> We need to get back to Earth and look at things how they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We do not need to create a new system of politics from scratch, I would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> MORE than happy if we could just affect it in a positive way on a selected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> range of issues, not millions
</I>&gt;<i> We already have these things. Move-On and Avaaz and other
</I>&gt;<i> petition-oriented sites do exactly what you propose. But they're
</I>&gt;<i> non-binding and don't even make any claims to being a *replacement*
</I>&gt;<i> for government rather than just a minor add-on to it. And that's why
</I>&gt;<i> they're commonly derided as being examples of &quot;slacktivism&quot;. IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> they're actually making things worse by siphoning off energy that
</I>&gt;<i> should be used to encourage development of new systems: People are
</I>&gt;<i> being deceived into thinking they're making in a difference when in
</I>&gt;<i> fact what they're really doing is strengthening the oligarchies that
</I>&gt;<i> are running things now. Is that really what you're advocating?
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>-&gt;  Move-on is one of the few platform that achieved SOMETHING
It is somehow having a small impact on the system
I do not understand where they would be siphoning energy away from since
anyone can build a better platform if we want
And no one has been as successful as MoveOn if I may..
Move On strenghtening the oligarchies? Are you serious?

&gt;&gt;<i> Just my two cents..
