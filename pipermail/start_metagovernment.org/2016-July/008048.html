<PRE>Dear Jacopo, you are entirely set up at this point to run an experiment 
that can potentially falsify my empirical claim that 2 or 3 direct 
democratic decisions per week is not enough to manage or even 
significantly influence a population-scale social system. Unlike myself 
and Scott and Matteo, you have the necessary software already up and 
running (Airesis). To run the experiment (which is not &quot;just&quot; an 
experiment -- if the procedure goes well, your efforts will do great 
good for Italy, and for the world as proof of concept) you would start 
putting up &quot;Make Italy Better&quot; proposals, one after another, on Airesis. 
(Since you will want the proposals to remain available for both 
modification and for voting for an extended period, you may have to 
tweak some of the proposal parameters.)

To the extent that the quality of the proposals is high enough, people 
will be attracted to participate (as proposers and/or simply as voters). 
The proposals themselves are your advertisements. At the point that 
enough people are participating, you will be able to start putting the 
proposals on official ballots. (Airesis can handle proposing 
independently, and can stockpile the proposals until enough people are 
involved to meet the &quot;signatures required&quot; to start putting them on 
official ballots.)

I really think that this experiment is definitely worth running, and 
that Airesis is the best software available that I have seen to use in 
running it.


</PRE>
