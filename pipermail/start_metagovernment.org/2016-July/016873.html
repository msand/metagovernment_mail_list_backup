</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thank you for the reply.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. I did post here hoping to receive a feedback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1)  If people will stop to read after half a section it would be just a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing!
</I>&gt;<i> Before they get to any of the meat of your proposal? Is your goal to
</I>&gt;<i> promote direct democracy, or just send people screaming in the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite direction from anything to do with government?
</I>-&gt; If you cant read a 30 page document and you are an activist then you 
are a loser
&gt;&gt;<i> Frankly speaking, the vast majority of the people are simply not interested
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to work even one hour per week to do something for DD, they are just lazy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and expect to receiveonly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good thing if they go away as soon as possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any project, at the beginning only the 1% of the real activists must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involved, not the lazy ones.
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, although I wouldn't consider this a criticism of people (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't use the term &quot;lazy&quot;: It's more appropriate to understand
</I>&gt;<i> that they've just rationally decided to spend their limited resources
</I>&gt;<i> elsewhere).
</I>-&gt; They rationally spend their time watching the Superbowl or listening 
to Taylor Swift rather than trying to avoid war crimes in afghanistan
&gt;&gt;<i> So, if they are not even interested to even read a short document of 20
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pages, fine, let them go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not believe know their governments are bad, otherwise their would move
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their buttocks and do something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please tell me in good faith, how many US citizens would say that their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government is a major sponsor of war crimes?
</I>&gt;<i> I think everyone knows this. The problem is actually that they
</I>&gt;<i> consider these crimes as collateral damage (or perhaps even necessary)
</I>&gt;<i> in the process of protecting their own resources. In most cases to
</I>&gt;<i> change this perception you need to condition tribalism out of people.
</I>&gt;<i> That's far more difficult than simply changing their political system.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is why I believe that focusing on atrocities or other negatives
</I>&gt;<i> is counterproductive.
</I>-&gt; They dont
Ask any of your friends about Operation Menu or Suharto
&gt;&gt;<i> Or any Italian?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or any English?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or Iranian?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think in any country in the world, most of the people do not know/care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the fact that their govts are responsible of atrocities abroad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I completely disagree about the fact that &quot;solving small problems that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affect billions is a vastly more important goal than preventing atrocities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that might affect tens/hundreds/thousands of people&quot; but if you really think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so, then you should tell this to, for example, the families of the victims
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of 9/11.
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I'm mostly a utilitarian and so consider small suffering by
</I>&gt;<i> billions to be vastly more significant than great suffering of a few
</I>&gt;<i> thousand. Getting a riled up by terrorism IMHO is a serious mistake
</I>&gt;<i> and leads directly to bad decisions (like the Iraq war). There are
</I>&gt;<i> certain personality types (mostly authoritarians) who believe the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite, but as is discussed (ad nauseum) on matchism.org even though
</I>&gt;<i> those kinds of people make up the majority of our government, they are
</I>&gt;<i> actually a minority of the general population.
</I>-&gt;  I am happy to heat this
Give up everything you dont need, live on 1000$ per month and give the 
rest to poor people in West Africa
&gt;&gt;<i> After all there have been less than 3 thousand victims in that day.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would suspect that if you tell to any American/English/Italian that 9/11
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacks were not so important as only 3000 people died their reaction
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against you may not be that of a kiss in the cheek
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Be careful ;)
</I>&gt;<i> You obviously don't have the same FB friends I do: This comes up all
</I>&gt;<i> the time and that is exactly their reaction: 10 times as many people
</I>&gt;<i> die in car accidents and are killed by guns in the US *every year*. If
</I>&gt;<i> we spent what the war in Iraq costs on those two other problems orders
</I>&gt;<i> of magnitude more people could be saved and suffering decreased
</I>&gt;<i> proportionally. Your obsession with these outlier events is simply
</I>&gt;<i> irrational.
</I>-&gt; The only irrational thing here is your failure to understand that you 
can try to avoid gun deaths and car accidents ar the same time and the 
one does not exclude the other
&gt;&gt;<i> It would be difficult for anyone to &quot;prove&quot; that direct democracy can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent wars, what we can see is that with the spread of the internet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people are more informed and it is easier to take action than 50 years ago
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One thing I agree upon is that it may be good to put a remark at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning of chapter one saying, if you are not interested skip to part 2
</I>&gt;<i> That would help. But again I think it would help more to make *direct*
</I>&gt;<i> ties between how DD would prevent each class of atrocity, and then put
</I>&gt;<i> the atrocity list at the end instead of the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3)  I agree that the delegate thing is under developed, but trying to create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a match-system for finding delegating people within the application would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a huge mistake, IMHO
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People want a n application that is easy to use and not complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They are too lazy to try to use something which is more complicated than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Facebook
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And any such system would be a hell to program, which means it would not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even come out well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So everything which is not necessary must be left out.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if you seen the recent eHarmony commercials but this
</I>&gt;<i> issue is directly addressed by them now. Potential user says: &quot;Who has
</I>&gt;<i> time to fill out all those forms?&quot; Old guy who started the company
</I>&gt;<i> says &quot;Do you want fast or forever?&quot;. We have to do what works,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of the development and marketing costs.
</I>-&gt; commercials are designed to screw up people
that is the point

we dont have 70 years to wait for solve gloal warming
&gt;&gt;<i> 5)  Allowing people to removing their leader when they do not want it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anymore without restrictions would result in chaos
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you cant change a leader every two weeks
</I>&gt;<i> I run into this argument all the time when pitching electronic direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, and I'm actually surprised to hear it coming from a
</I>&gt;<i> supposed proponent. What your argument boils down to is that people
</I>&gt;<i> are too stupid/emotional/irrational to be trusted with decisions at
</I>&gt;<i> that level. I'm sure you're wrong, but would concede that it's an
</I>&gt;<i> empirical question. We'll just have to see if people really are that
</I>&gt;<i> stupid and maybe go back to representative democracy if it turns out
</I>&gt;<i> they are.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>-&gt;  I never said that people are stupid
I have just said that you cant vote out a government anytime
Look at how many time Obama has been under 50% if approval rate in the 
last 8 years
Imagine if every time he was voted out
