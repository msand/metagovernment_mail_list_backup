I submit that no revolution has ever occurred that *didn't* go through
this phase, and usually for many years. Discussing your ideas
proposals in public is by far the best way to discover where the holes
are, and which features resonate with others.

As for citing literature, although I generally agree that most great
products have a single visionary at their core, none of us are working
in a vacuum here and there are &quot;shoulders of giants&quot; available to
stand on. If you're not going to take advantage of them, I think
you're putting yourself at a severe disadvantage to those of us who
do.

    Scott
