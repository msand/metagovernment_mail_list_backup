<PRE>Thank you Ned for the supporting words I am in it, but communication and
lack of starting support are making the project very hard to be launch, I
am waiting for Mr Michelangelo as founder of the Accademia of Comunication
of Milano to help the project by putting a team of students guided by some
professional to produce some comunication material and strategy to be
posted on line with sufficient impact to begin the word of mouth to drive
participation.
I request the people involved in airesis.it/italia to start a chain to
involve a critical mass of participants but there is very mild responce.
Alone and with survival priorities I can make it happen, I need team work
to be able to bring the project to a fruitful pilot level.
Cross your finger.
Peace
J

&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo, you are entirely set up at this point to run an experiment
</I>&gt;<i> that can potentially falsify my empirical claim that 2 or 3 direct
</I>&gt;<i> democratic decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly
</I>&gt;<i> influence a population-scale social system. Unlike myself and Scott and
</I>&gt;<i> Matteo, you have the necessary software already up and running (Airesis).
</I>&gt;<i> To run the experiment (which is not &quot;just&quot; an experiment -- if the
</I>&gt;<i> procedure goes well, your efforts will do great good for Italy, and for the
</I>&gt;<i> world as proof of concept) you would start putting up &quot;Make Italy Better&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, one after another, on Airesis. (Since you will want the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals to remain available for both modification and for voting for an
</I>&gt;<i> extended period, you may have to tweak some of the proposal parameters.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the extent that the quality of the proposals is high enough, people
</I>&gt;<i> will be attracted to participate (as proposers and/or simply as voters).
</I>&gt;<i> The proposals themselves are your advertisements. At the point that enough
</I>&gt;<i> people are participating, you will be able to start putting the proposals
</I>&gt;<i> on official ballots. (Airesis can handle proposing independently, and can
</I>&gt;<i> stockpile the proposals until enough people are involved to meet the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;signatures required&quot; to start putting them on official ballots.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really think that this experiment is definitely worth running, and that
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis is the best software available that I have seen to use in running
</I>&gt;<i> it.
