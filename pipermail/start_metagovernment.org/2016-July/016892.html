</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you really so optimist? The proposed law is now in a very clear text and

</I>&gt;<i> potential user in danger to be illegal anyway! This is seen in all the
</I>&gt;<i> siituation,
</I>
Well, I guess it'd be hard to call me an optimist WRT
misrepresentative democracy, but I do see that at least they're
*considering* the issue (unlike gun control in the US congress). What
you really need is a referendum system: That's what got marijuana
legalized here in Colorado. Certainly the legislature would never have
passed such a law on their own. But a referendum is a form of direct
democracy, albeit very limited (hard to get things on the ballot,
can't have more than a couple of them on each ballot (which means only
a couple per year can be considered), etc.)

&gt;<i> for example speed in the highway is set at 130 KM h, car are mostly (90%)
</I>&gt;<i> traveling at 140 and very ulikely get fined but this cruising speed give the
</I>&gt;<i> police the right to stop you all the time if they want.
</I>&gt;<i> if the speed is set at 50 people will cruise on that road at 60 and so on,
</I>&gt;<i> if you travel at law speed you'll get honk by other cars for slowing the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic!
</I>
This too is a social engineering problem: As it turns out, people pay
little if any attention to the posted speed limit. They could just get
rid of all of those signs and it would have negligible effect on
speeds *or* accident rates (they've actually done experiments that
show this), though of course it would have a huge impact on the
funding of police departments ;-) This is sort of unrelated to the
issue of direct democracy, but the solution to this problem is to
require civil engineers (who design the roads) to actually study
psychology as it applies to road design (which for the most part they
don't now). There are ways to give people visual cues to what the safe
speeds are (narrowing lane widths, necking down intersections, etc.)
but these are only rarely used now, and only in the most progressive
communities (e.g., these sorts of things are a big deal here in
Boulder now).

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; representative democracy is a total failure given the state of the world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; today as a model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's the worst system except when compared to all the others (tyranny,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feudalism, oligarchy, etc.) I agree that it's severely broken, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we're still alive and we have the ability to discuss replacement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems here in the open, so I say it can't be all bad...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Discussing in the open is, in democratic ruled world, considered freedom,
</I>&gt;<i> but i believe that is just possible because the system is so well
</I>&gt;<i> selfmaintained by its rules that it became almost a tiranny. i hope i
</I>&gt;<i> explained properly.
</I>
Not completely sure I follow, but if you're talking about the impact
of SJWs, I completely agree. In fact I'm trying to think up
experiments to isolate this personality characteristic, which I
believe to be the elusive Left Wing Authoritarian that Altemeyer could
never seem to pin down.

&gt;<i> is like the speed example above.
</I>&gt;<i> we are (in Italy) never in total legality for any given reason (rules) tax
</I>&gt;<i> wise. construction wise, licence wise exetera so that IF we are a nuisance
</I>&gt;<i> to the sistem we can be prosecuted for a number of reasons.
</I>&gt;<i> and we call it freedom!
</I>
They have a thing here called &quot;complaint-based enforcement&quot; which
presents similar problems: The city council passes all kinds of
arbitrary laws that they don't enforce except if a
neighbor/customer/employee complains. This causes everyone to live in
fear that something they've done will get them busted. It's like a
lightweight version of the Stasi IMHO, and is incompetent social
engineering for sure (lots of stress induced, very little benefit to
the people as a whole).

    Scott
