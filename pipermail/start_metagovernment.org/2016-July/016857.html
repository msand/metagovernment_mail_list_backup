&gt;<i> Ned&gt; There appears to be a flaw in your reasoning. You cannot count the

</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
It's an assumption, to be sure. But assuming the opposite, that what
matters is the quantity of decisions rather than the quality, seems to
me and even bigger assumption. The Matchism proposal, unlike Blinap,
is actually completely flexible: The 2 or 3 proposals a week number is
not a hard and fast rule, but merely a design goal. Some weeks there
may be no votes, others may require a dozen or more. It mostly depends
on the quality of the Managers: If they are doing their jobs properly
there will be very little need to correct (or replace) them with
direct votes. But if we have to fire one there will probably have to
be several weeks of micromanaging until a suitable replacement can be
installed.

&gt;<i> Instead, first you must put your social system test design into full-scale
</I>&gt;<i> operation, and demonstrate that it works well. Then you count the number of
</I>&gt;<i> decisions being made. And then you will have a basis for claiming that, in
</I>&gt;<i> at least one instance, a social system that was working well was making that
</I>&gt;<i> number of decisions as it did so.
</I>
Work expands to fill the time allotted to it. Don't know if you've
ever served on a committee but a common problem is the &quot;where to put
the bike racks&quot; debate. I was on an HOA board once where the majority
of the one meeting was spent on this exact issue when the complex had
a million dollar maintenance backlog (mostly failing roofs and central
boilers) that trivial issues like these prevent decisionmaking on. In
fact Matchism itself grew out of my analysis of this particular
dysfunctional organization. You simply can't let the people get bogged
down in small decisions or they'll have no bandwidth remaining to
tackle the big ones.

&gt;<i> You have not demonstrated that the Iteration#1 Matchism social system design
</I>&gt;<i> will work well in full-scale operation. That is a fundamental fact. In order
</I>&gt;<i> to falsify my claim that &quot;2 or 3 direct democracy decisions per week is not
</I>&gt;<i> enough to manage or even significantly influence the operation of a
</I>&gt;<i> population-scale social system&quot;, you must demonstrate (1) that the Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> design works well in full-scale operation, and (2) that it does so while
</I>&gt;<i> making no more than 2 or 3 direct democracy decisions per week.
</I>
On the contrary: We have abundant proof that representative democracy
functions adequately (albeit suboptimally) with this number. The onus
is actually on you to prove that merely making *more* decisions will
make any difference in the quality of any of them.
