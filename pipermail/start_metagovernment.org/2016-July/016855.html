Minor correction: I don't even expect most people to vote on those 2
or 3 things, only to provide them with the capability of doing so if
they want. Most of the time they will delegate even these 2 or 3
decisions to people who are psychologically matched to them but have
taken the time to actually research and understand the issues. In that
case, for most people even their participation costs are negligible,
balancing the equation.

&gt;<i> In global-scale &quot;collectivist democracy&quot;, individual citizens have
</I>&gt;<i> negligible political power because each citizen is casting one vote of
</I>&gt;<i> billions. (It really does not matter whether that vote is cast directly or
</I>&gt;<i> through a proxy. It is still just one vote of billions.)
</I>
And yet most people take the time to vote now, even though it
generally requires several orders of magnitude more effort. Obviously
since people care enough in principle to do this, our main problem is
simply making it easier to vote their conscience (which presumably is
going to be the same as that of their psychologically matched
proxies). Once you do that, participation rates can easily approach
100% and people will actually get the government they deserve (i.e.,
one that, on the whole, matches them). Even better they will easily
grasp *how* that matching was done and feel that they have control
over how it was done, which is something they sorely lack now in our
current misrepresentative democracies.

    Scott
