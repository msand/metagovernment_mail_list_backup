</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Are you really so optimist? The proposed law is now in a very clear text
and does not have incongruencies. After reading the opposing party and
opposing delegate commentary and proposed modifications, I envision an
outcome that will create a not clear law that will be open to
interpretation leaving the potential user in danger to be illegal anyway!
This is seen in all the siituation,
for example speed in the highway is set at 130 KM h, car are mostly (90%)
traveling at 140 and very ulikely get fined but this cruising speed give
the police the right to stop you all the time if they want.
if the speed is set at 50 people will cruise on that road at 60 and so on,
if you travel at law speed you'll get honk by other cars for slowing the
traffic!



&gt;<i> &gt; representative democracy is a total failure given the state of the world
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; today as a model.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's the worst system except when compared to all the others (tyranny,
</I>&gt;<i> feudalism, oligarchy, etc.) I agree that it's severely broken, but
</I>&gt;<i> we're still alive and we have the ability to discuss replacement
</I>&gt;<i> systems here in the open, so I say it can't be all bad...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Discussing in the open is, in democratic ruled world, considered freedom,
but i believe that is just possible because the system is so well
selfmaintained by its rules that it became almost a tiranny. i hope i
explained properly.
is like the speed example above.
we are (in Italy) never in total legality for any given reason (rules) tax
wise. construction wise, licence wise exetera so that IF we are a nuisance
to the sistem we can be prosecuted for a number of reasons.
and we call it freedom!

cheers
