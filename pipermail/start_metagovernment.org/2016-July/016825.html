Seems like we have no choice. But this is all the more reason why the
new system must be designed to allow regular updates as new
information becomes available and the population's values shift as a
result. There's also a section on this &quot;moral progressivism&quot; on
matchism.com. The trick is not to get attached to any particular value
because *everything* must be subject to examination and change.

Along these lines, another book I recommend to help extricate oneself
from the zeitgeist and one's gut feelings is Dawkins' &quot;The Selfish
Gene&quot;. Not that it has much to say about public policy, but that it
provides a strong justification that the sources we have been using
for designing public policy, particularly our &quot;gut feelings&quot;, are
inappropriate for this purpose. Most of those things came into being
merely because they facilitated the propagation of genes, not because
they are somehow a good fit for designing a society that matches our
current needs. I'm (slowly) working on a new section for the Matchism
manifesto on this &quot;new covenant&quot; for decisionmaking.

&gt;<i> Sure, there is a risk that I apply my values too extensively, I will try to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate it. I am free to talk about those values.
</I>
I've toyed with the idea of actually labeling the sources used when
making a social engineering design decision, whether they be
best-guess placeholders as you describe, based on experimental data,
based on observational data, based on popular wisdom (&quot;everybody knows
that ...&quot;), or based on prescriptions from amateur social engineers
(religious texts, etc.). Doing this would give us some sort of
confidence interval for each policy decision which might make some of
them easier to revisit.
  Regards,
    Scott
