<PRE>(This is in response to Matteo's Direct Democracy Document. It also 
applies to Iteration#1 of the Matchism design.)

You have focused in your list of 75 grievances mostly on atrocities 
committed by national governments. It would be possible to write another 
list of grievances, just as long and substantive, focused on atrocities 
committed by multi-national corporations, and a third list focused on 
atrocities instigated by top capitalists (that effectively own both the 
corporations and the national governments).

National governments and multi-national corporations and top capitalists 
make tens of millions of public-matter decisions per year (decisions 
that affect the public). The decisions that produce the atrocities are 
among those tens of millions. (Not all of the decisions produce 
atrocities, but reliably filtering out those that do requires passing 
*all* of the decisions through the direct democracy filter.)

The attention of the entire population of the earth can be focused on 
(at most) only 2 or 3 proposals per week (according to Scott's guess -- 
in practice, no population in history has ever come anywhere near that 
many full-quorum direct democracy decisions-per-week). Focusing the 
attention of the entire population of the earth on those 2 or 3 
proposals then leaves all of the other millions of public-matter 
decisions per week entirely free to be made by government-body 
hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top capitalists, without 
individuals of the general public having any formal role in the actual 
decision-making at all.

The main purpose of population-scale voting (from the perspective of the 
elites) is to give individual citizens the illegitimate feeling that 
they are making a difference, when in fact their contribution (as 
individuals and as a body) is so minuscule as to be negligible.

Speaking abstractly, there are two competing decision system design 
patterns through which to effect direct democracy:

  * propose -&gt; vote
  * propose recursively (nobody votes)


Your design is a variation of the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern. I 
see no reason to think that it will work any better than any of the 
other variations of that design pattern. At population scale, all of the 
variations bump into the &quot;Too Few Decisions&quot; problem: 2 or 3 direct 
democracy decisions per week is not enough to manage or even 
significantly influence the operation of a population-scale social system.

(*Note on nested jurisdictions*: When an individual chooses to focus on 
2 or 3 local matters in a particular week rather than on global matters, 
that reduces the &quot;sheer numbers&quot; that are available to make those 2 or 3 
decisions at the global level that week. Since sensible people will 
understand that casting 1 vote of thousands on an issue has greater 
effect than casting 1 vote of billions on an issue, sensible individuals 
will be inclined to focus on local matters more than global matters. 
This will reduce the number of decisions per week that can be made at 
the global level, thereby exacerbating the already fatal problem that 2 
or 3 global decisions per week is not enough to manage or even 
significantly influence the operation of a global social system.)
