Again, I'm working from memory because a spec for Blinap doesn't seem
to be available anywhere. I found some stuff on Earthlink, but so many
of the links are broken it's hard to use that now.

And I must point out that you're being distinctly unhelpful here,
asking about &quot;why I think something&quot; and what it doesn't do or require
rather just telling us how it *does* work. From what I can tell (from
memory and the Earthlink bits), the server *does* randomly assign
proposals to small subsets of people/groups. This is sampling, whether
you understand it to be or not.

    Scott
