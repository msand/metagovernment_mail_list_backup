I consider this putting the cart before the horse: You can't design a

value system without first having not only really good idea of human

instincts and preferences but also the *distribution* of these

features in a population. Otherwise you end up with what he have now:

Values systems &quot;designed&quot; by amateur social engineers whose biases

certainly do not reflect those of the population as a whole. Indeed

even our current &quot;weighted democracies&quot; are a poor tool for doing this

sort of design, though I do agree with democratic principles in

general: IMHO the new value system will be an emergent phenomenon and

not something that someone designs up front (i.e., it's not really

engineering but more like setting up an environment where evolution

can occur and then providing a mechanism for preferential selection of

the characteristics that demonstrably best match humans).





Good. I take the evolutionary principle, I will apply the restrictions of sciences (sociobiology, system engeneering, etology...). After that I enter some marketing values (values of expected innovators, early adopters, and early majority) where I expect things to fade away. But there are still some spaces without prescription. Well, nobody is looking, I insert my values there because I do have to insert something there.
Is the recipe good?

Sure, there is a risk that I apply my values too extensively, I will try to eliminate it. I am free to talk about those values.

Regards
m.
