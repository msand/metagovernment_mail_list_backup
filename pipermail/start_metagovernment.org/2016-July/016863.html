Good luck with that..

Anyway, you are taking the issue from the wrong side, the problem is not 
the money, the problem is building a system that people use
Loomio was crowdfinanced fur 100.000 USD still they are not successful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Look at the other projects, see how they failed and try to understand why
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO most fail not because they were too ambitious but because they're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> too timid. Loomio in particular I think has put themselves in a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> straightjacket by failing to claim their product is a viable form of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> government that was designed to *replace* existing organizations not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just augment them (e.g., it ought to already be possible to replace an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> HOA board with Loomio group, yet they don't even seem to have an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example of anyone having done that yet).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; ?? I dont understand
</I>&gt;<i> Seems clear enough to me. Perhaps read the archives on our previous
</I>&gt;<i> discussions of Loomio.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; Again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Wrong example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It took some 70 years from the publication of the Communist manifesto to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> October revolution
</I>&gt;<i> And that's mostly because of &quot;it can't work&quot; mentalities like yours.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately technology has made our job a lot easier than Marx's.
</I>-&gt;  Oh man.. You are quite an arrogant do not you?
Let alone that Marxism ultimately did NOT work ;) there has been 
thousands and thousands of people who died in the fight Communists vs 
capitalists for 70 years.
And you are criticizing them as they did  not try hard enough?
I think you should quite less arrogant.
In any case, if you think you can do better, go ahead
&gt;&gt;<i> If you have some 70 years of work to give please go ahead
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea how many years it will take. Could take a hundred.
</I>&gt;<i> Could take 5. All I do know that our current system is deeply flawed
</I>&gt;<i> and that it will eventually be replaced. We can hurry the process
</I>&gt;<i> along some by having informed discussions on the issues, and then
</I>&gt;<i> using what we know to build software to support these new systems.
</I>-&gt;  Good, in one hundred years probably we will not need any system any 
more as human kind will be extincted by global warming or by a nice 
nuclear war with North Korea
But if you want to wait please wait
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; Again, complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You do not need to create a responsive site that works with Ipad Iphone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This is a difficult thing to do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Even if you have money
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You should be working only with a common laptop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This should be more than enough at the beginning
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Again, that's the Tesla motorcycle. You have to design for what the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> market wants, and they don't want a laptop-only app anymore. In fact
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in this market, I'd drop the laptop and *only* support phones if a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> choice had to be made (at least in the US, apps are already twice the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> market share of web for advertising, meaning that's where people are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spending at least 2/3 of their time)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt;  You have to give the market the product they want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No one in the market today needs or wants matchism nor Bitglub
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is why they fail
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt you understand Matchism well enough to make that claim, but
</I>&gt;<i> just to play along, if you're so smart, what *do* they want?
</I>-&gt;  I am not smart, I am average stupid
Which is PRECISELY the reason why I am telling you Matchism will fail
As I could not understand how it works and I left the site 5 minutes 
after having opened it
I can not spend hours reading that long salada of words
And as I quit with Matchism in 5 minutes so will do everybody else. 
Guaranteed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt;  Move-on is one of the few platform that achieved SOMETHING
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It is somehow having a small impact on the system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Small to insignificant. Half the things Avaaz and MoveOn promote don't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pass, and most of the rest would have passed without their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> participation at all. As a social engineer I can't make the claim
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these organizations have no value: They reduce stress by giving people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the *feeling* they're making a difference in the world, even though
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> objectively there is no significant positive effect and there are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> likely significant negative effects. Although this stress-reduction is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a positive benefit, it's more like the effect of drugs (including
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alcohol), giving to charity, going to church, etc. and so shouldn't be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> considered as a way to make a positive contribution to the operation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the government or society in general.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; Small to insignificant????
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Funneling thousands of people into supporting a joint action is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> insignificant?
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, if that &quot;joint action&quot; is essentially mental (and/or emotional)
</I>&gt;<i> masturbation. Again, MoveOn and Avaaz have *NO EFFECT* on how
</I>&gt;<i> governments actually operate. Indeed, if MoveOn could even affect the
</I>&gt;<i> political party they generally support Bernie would be the democratic
</I>&gt;<i> candidate instead of Hillary: Man, they really blew that call...
</I>-&gt;  Finding out that hundreds of people have the the same opinion as you 
do and they are commit to this is already something
Bernie would have not even got half the vote than he did today with the 
same platform 20 years ago.
But again, if you can do any better than that, why do not you go ahead 
and DO something useful?
Do your software have 1/1000 of the users that MoveOn has?
&gt;&gt;<i> Please let us know what YOU have done better than them
</I>&gt;<i> I expected better from you than &quot;nannynannybooboo&quot; arguments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And no one has been as successful as MoveOn if I may..
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Move On strenghtening the oligarchies? Are you serious?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely: By deferring to them (&quot;Oh, please please please do just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this one little thing for us!&quot;) they actually reinforce the perception
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that we The People are weak and that we do not have the power to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> override the oligarchs. That's just wrong and definitely part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem rather than part of the solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deferring to the oligarchs by using MoveOn?
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly: If you don't see how this works, try reading it again until you do.
</I>-&gt;  Again, you are patronizing without any authority to do so I thin
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We of course must put disclaimers on our designs and our prototype
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems that clearly indicate that they're not ready to run the world
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> yet, but we must also make it clear that that's what they're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *designed* to do and that it is inevitable that eventually they will.

Then, as you have said, let` s wait 100 years until the perfect system 
is found ;)
