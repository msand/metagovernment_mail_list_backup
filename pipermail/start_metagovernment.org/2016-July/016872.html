Apologies for the late reply, but I just found this message in my Spam
folder. This doesn't happen often (Gmail is actually astoundingly good
at flagging spam) but for some reason Metagovernment has gotten
flagged as a source of spam, so you all should check your spam folders
too and unflag them so that Gmail can get smarter.

&gt;<i> thank you for the reply.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I did post here hoping to receive a feedback

</I>
Before they get to any of the meat of your proposal? Is your goal to
promote direct democracy, or just send people screaming in the
opposite direction from anything to do with government?

&gt;<i> Frankly speaking, the vast majority of the people are simply not interested
</I>&gt;<i> to work even one hour per week to do something for DD, they are just lazy
</I>&gt;<i> and expect to receiveonly
</I>&gt;<i> Good thing if they go away as soon as possible
</I>&gt;<i> In any project, at the beginning only the 1% of the real activists must be
</I>&gt;<i> involved, not the lazy ones.
</I>
Agreed, although I wouldn't consider this a criticism of people (i.e.,
I wouldn't use the term &quot;lazy&quot;: It's more appropriate to understand
that they've just rationally decided to spend their limited resources
elsewhere).

&gt;<i> So, if they are not even interested to even read a short document of 20
</I>&gt;<i> pages, fine, let them go.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not believe know their governments are bad, otherwise their would move
</I>&gt;<i> their buttocks and do something
</I>&gt;<i> Please tell me in good faith, how many US citizens would say that their
</I>&gt;<i> government is a major sponsor of war crimes?
</I>
I think everyone knows this. The problem is actually that they
consider these crimes as collateral damage (or perhaps even necessary)
in the process of protecting their own resources. In most cases to
change this perception you need to condition tribalism out of people.
That's far more difficult than simply changing their political system.
Which is why I believe that focusing on atrocities or other negatives
is counterproductive.

&gt;<i> Or any Italian?
</I>&gt;<i> Or any English?
</I>&gt;<i> Or Iranian?
</I>&gt;<i> I think in any country in the world, most of the people do not know/care
</I>&gt;<i> about the fact that their govts are responsible of atrocities abroad
</I>&gt;<i> I completely disagree about the fact that &quot;solving small problems that
</I>&gt;<i> affect billions is a vastly more important goal than preventing atrocities
</I>&gt;<i> that might affect tens/hundreds/thousands of people&quot; but if you really think
</I>&gt;<i> so, then you should tell this to, for example, the families of the victims
</I>&gt;<i> of 9/11.
</I>
Sorry, I'm mostly a utilitarian and so consider small suffering by
billions to be vastly more significant than great suffering of a few
thousand. Getting a riled up by terrorism IMHO is a serious mistake
and leads directly to bad decisions (like the Iraq war). There are
certain personality types (mostly authoritarians) who believe the
opposite, but as is discussed (ad nauseum) on matchism.org even though
those kinds of people make up the majority of our government, they are
actually a minority of the general population.

&gt;<i> After all there have been less than 3 thousand victims in that day.
</I>&gt;<i> I would suspect that if you tell to any American/English/Italian that 9/11
</I>&gt;<i> attacks were not so important as only 3000 people died their reaction
</I>&gt;<i> against you may not be that of a kiss in the cheek
</I>&gt;<i> Be careful ;)
</I>
You obviously don't have the same FB friends I do: This comes up all
the time and that is exactly their reaction: 10 times as many people
die in car accidents and are killed by guns in the US *every year*. If
we spent what the war in Iraq costs on those two other problems orders
of magnitude more people could be saved and suffering decreased
proportionally. Your obsession with these outlier events is simply
irrational.

&gt;<i> It would be difficult for anyone to &quot;prove&quot; that direct democracy can
</I>&gt;<i> prevent wars, what we can see is that with the spread of the internet,
</I>&gt;<i> people are more informed and it is easier to take action than 50 years ago
</I>&gt;<i> One thing I agree upon is that it may be good to put a remark at the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning of chapter one saying, if you are not interested skip to part 2
</I>
That would help. But again I think it would help more to make *direct*
ties between how DD would prevent each class of atrocity, and then put
the atrocity list at the end instead of the beginning.

&gt;<i> 3)  I agree that the delegate thing is under developed, but trying to create
</I>&gt;<i> a match-system for finding delegating people within the application would be
</I>&gt;<i> a huge mistake, IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> People want a n application that is easy to use and not complicated
</I>&gt;<i> They are too lazy to try to use something which is more complicated than
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> And any such system would be a hell to program, which means it would not
</I>&gt;<i> even come out well
</I>&gt;<i> So everything which is not necessary must be left out.
</I>
I don't know if you seen the recent eHarmony commercials but this
issue is directly addressed by them now. Potential user says: &quot;Who has
time to fill out all those forms?&quot; Old guy who started the company
says &quot;Do you want fast or forever?&quot;. We have to do what works,
regardless of the development and marketing costs.

&gt;<i> 5)  Allowing people to removing their leader when they do not want it
</I>&gt;<i> anymore without restrictions would result in chaos
</I>&gt;<i> I think you cant change a leader every two weeks
</I>
I run into this argument all the time when pitching electronic direct
democracy, and I'm actually surprised to hear it coming from a
supposed proponent. What your argument boils down to is that people
are too stupid/emotional/irrational to be trusted with decisions at
that level. I'm sure you're wrong, but would concede that it's an
empirical question. We'll just have to see if people really are that
stupid and maybe go back to representative democracy if it turns out
they are.

    Scott
