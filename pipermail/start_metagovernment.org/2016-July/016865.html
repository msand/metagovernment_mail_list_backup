<PRE>Hi everyone I want to indicate the most important factor before the UI and
the quality of the proposal. Airesis has a good UI, can be better, but is
certainly one of the best around, work on all device because is responsive.
The quality of the proposal is important but the subject is far more
important. Given that, the main problem is marketing or for the sake in
this case I will prefer to say communication.
I only see the success of my &quot;experiment&quot; with Airesis if there is a major
massive campaign of communication.
We give so much importance to the wrong people just because they appear in
the news. I guess all of you are aware of the power of the mass media.
Where is the real power? I started airesis.it/italia group with the only
purpose to create first a critical mass.  But the critical, &quot;critical mass&quot;
cannot be created by herself if the basic survival condition are met. We as
human we easily forget even the most fundamental principles if the system
provide.
There is no sufficient &quot;critical&quot; brains around and we at MG are an
exeption.
Within the exeption we are not capable of taking a decision togeter!
Blinap, Matchism, are good and surely will work if implemented, I am sure
Ned and Scott agree with that. If there is some incongruence it will be
easily fixed during the trial time. But is missing the spark that create
the condition for implementation. That viral awareness that change the
perspective.
I am looking to figure out this specific gamechanger and as long as we have
&quot;panem et circenses&quot; the old but sure system will remain in place.
Please let's focus on what to do to change rather than how to do.
Peace
Jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear Jacopo, you are entirely set up at this point to run an experiment
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can potentially falsify my empirical claim that 2 or 3 direct democratic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly
</I>&gt;<i> influence a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; population-scale social system. Unlike myself and Scott and Matteo, you
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the necessary software already up and running (Airesis). To run the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experiment (which is not &quot;just&quot; an experiment -- if the procedure goes
</I>&gt;<i> well,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your efforts will do great good for Italy, and for the world as proof of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept) you would start putting up &quot;Make Italy Better&quot; proposals, one
</I>&gt;<i> after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; another, on Airesis. (Since you will want the proposals to remain
</I>&gt;<i> available
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for both modification and for voting for an extended period, you may
</I>&gt;<i> have to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tweak some of the proposal parameters.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I agree that such an experiment is worth doing, I must express a
</I>&gt;<i> high level of skepticism that it will amount to much unless Jacopo has
</I>&gt;<i> a large stash of resources hidden away that I haven't heard about. As
</I>&gt;<i> I study how these kinds of viral expansions work it occurs to me that
</I>&gt;<i> the quality of the proposals is actually *more* important than the
</I>&gt;<i> quality of the UI used to evaluate and vote on them. Exhibit A for
</I>&gt;<i> this situation is FaceBook, which IMHO still has a terrible UI for
</I>&gt;<i> what it does, and yet people find the content compelling enough to
</I>&gt;<i> overlook that. The problem for us is that public policy proposals tend
</I>&gt;<i> not to be as interesting, and that they have to be written in such a
</I>&gt;<i> way that they're actually implementable and legally enforceable.
</I>&gt;<i> Unless you happen to come across a lawyer who also possesses the
</I>&gt;<i> talents of a technical writer *and* the ability to popularize politics
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., like Carl Sagan or Bill Nye or Neil deGrasse Tyson have done
</I>&gt;<i> for science education) *and* really wants to work on this, it's going
</I>&gt;<i> to be really tough to get enough people interested in the proposals
</I>&gt;<i> for it to grow like it needs to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To the extent that the quality of the proposals is high enough, people
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be attracted to participate (as proposers and/or simply as voters). The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals themselves are your advertisements. At the point that enough
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people are participating, you will be able to start putting the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; official ballots. (Airesis can handle proposing independently, and can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stockpile the proposals until enough people are involved to meet the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;signatures required&quot; to start putting them on official ballots.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I think the odds that Joe Sixpack and his crew are going to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to create and refine proposals that will be both legally sound
</I>&gt;<i> *and* compelling to the average voter are close to zero. IMHO the
</I>&gt;<i> problem with our current system is that people don't even get to
</I>&gt;<i> *vote* on the proposals, not that each and everyone's pet concern
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't end up being covered by some proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really think that this experiment is definitely worth running, and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Airesis is the best software available that I have seen to use in running
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does Airesis run as an app? And does it support text messaging (both
</I>&gt;<i> in and out)? I'm thinking these two things will be necessary
</I>&gt;<i> components of a true &quot;people's voting system&quot;. The app will be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for people that actually want to rate and comment on
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, the SMS support necessary for the casual user to vote
</I>&gt;<i> without having to go to a web page to do it (I'm no wiz at smartphones
</I>&gt;<i> but even I know to avoid anything that runs in a browser because that
</I>&gt;<i> means it's slow, memory intensive (i.e., swaps all my other apps out
</I>&gt;<i> such they have to restart), and likely to be hard to use because it
</I>&gt;<i> was designed to work on a PC rather than on a phone).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
