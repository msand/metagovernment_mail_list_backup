On the contrary: We have abundant proof that representative democracy
functions adequately (albeit suboptimally) with this number. The onus
is actually on you to prove that merely making *more* decisions will
make any difference in the quality of any of them.

Yesterday a discussion was started on italian parlament about cannabis
legalization, after a burst the discussion was postponed to september!!
This is far on the suboptimal range
representative democracy is a total failure given the state of the world
today as a model.
This is my personal opinion

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ned&gt; There appears to be a flaw in your reasoning. You cannot count the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determine how many decisions will be made in a social system that does
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's an assumption, to be sure. But assuming the opposite, that what
</I>&gt;<i> matters is the quantity of decisions rather than the quality, seems to
</I>&gt;<i> me and even bigger assumption. The Matchism proposal, unlike Blinap,
</I>&gt;<i> is actually completely flexible: The 2 or 3 proposals a week number is
</I>&gt;<i> not a hard and fast rule, but merely a design goal. Some weeks there
</I>&gt;<i> may be no votes, others may require a dozen or more. It mostly depends
</I>&gt;<i> on the quality of the Managers: If they are doing their jobs properly
</I>&gt;<i> there will be very little need to correct (or replace) them with
</I>&gt;<i> direct votes. But if we have to fire one there will probably have to
</I>&gt;<i> be several weeks of micromanaging until a suitable replacement can be
</I>&gt;<i> installed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead, first you must put your social system test design into
</I>&gt;<i> full-scale
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operation, and demonstrate that it works well. Then you count the number
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions being made. And then you will have a basis for claiming that,
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least one instance, a social system that was working well was making
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of decisions as it did so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Work expands to fill the time allotted to it. Don't know if you've
</I>&gt;<i> ever served on a committee but a common problem is the &quot;where to put
</I>&gt;<i> the bike racks&quot; debate. I was on an HOA board once where the majority
</I>&gt;<i> of the one meeting was spent on this exact issue when the complex had
</I>&gt;<i> a million dollar maintenance backlog (mostly failing roofs and central
</I>&gt;<i> boilers) that trivial issues like these prevent decisionmaking on. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact Matchism itself grew out of my analysis of this particular
</I>&gt;<i> dysfunctional organization. You simply can't let the people get bogged
</I>&gt;<i> down in small decisions or they'll have no bandwidth remaining to
</I>&gt;<i> tackle the big ones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You have not demonstrated that the Iteration#1 Matchism social system
</I>&gt;<i> design
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will work well in full-scale operation. That is a fundamental fact. In
</I>&gt;<i> order
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to falsify my claim that &quot;2 or 3 direct democracy decisions per week is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough to manage or even significantly influence the operation of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; population-scale social system&quot;, you must demonstrate (1) that the
</I>&gt;<i> Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; design works well in full-scale operation, and (2) that it does so while
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making no more than 2 or 3 direct democracy decisions per week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the contrary: We have abundant proof that representative democracy
</I>&gt;<i> functions adequately (albeit suboptimally) with this number. The onus
</I>&gt;<i> is actually on you to prove that merely making *more* decisions will
</I>&gt;<i> make any difference in the quality of any of them.
