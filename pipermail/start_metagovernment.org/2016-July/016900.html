</I>
I think a good approach would be to make sure that in the limit of low participation the system falls back onto a tested design. For example, I am envisioning a system that has the current representative democracy in this limit. That is by default everybody's delegate is their elected representative. My thinking is, that if a person ever decides to change it, he is much more likely to pay attention to the situation in the future. Also, if people fall asleep, it probably means that nothing horrible is happening right now.

&gt;<i> The same could happen as an emergent phenomenon if delegation allows
</I>&gt;<i> recursion (mine doesn't, instead it computes a weighted average of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple delegate's votes to handle the situation where some of them
</I>&gt;<i> may not vote on a given proposal).
</I>
Yeah, I consider recursive delegation as an option. But then again, the default setting would be no recursion. Yet, I would like to give a voter that freedom. One can also think about educating voters (at the moment when they change settings), like warning them about potential dangers of recursive delegation, or delegating everything to a single popular person.

&gt;<i> 2) If people are asleep, a small faction could then vote to change
</I>&gt;<i> the operation of the system. This is keeping in mind that 88% of the votes
</I>&gt;<i> in 1934 Germany were to elect Hitler as dictator, a vote that
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately they couldn't undo because Hitler, being dictator,
</I>&gt;<i> promptly changed the rules.
</I>
This I would exclude by design: the rule that a voter retains full control of his vote cannot be changed.
&gt;<i> My prediction is that people are going to be even less trusting that a new server-based
</I> &gt; system isn't going to jerk the around.
Let's make the system transparent, it is OK with me either way.

</I>I was equating detaching real names from voting records to privacy. Only random checks would require revealing a small fraction of real names behind the IDs.
&gt;<i> But for those who are really paranoid, I still say our best bet

 &gt; can't be held directly responsible for their vote.
They would still be responsible for excepting those suggestions, so I would say they are still responsible for their votes. To the same extent that voters are responsible for how their representative is voting in Congress.
I agree with you, that at the end of the day all these ideas must be tested in practice. So why not to start with the simpler ones?

 &gt;&gt; &gt; Delegation can be

 &gt;
 &gt;&gt; Seems almost too generous to me. For
 example, it's already larger than
 &gt;&gt; the size of the government in some
 Localities, which could lead to
 &gt;&gt;
 government governing itself if it could convince people to
 transfer
 &gt;&gt; their votes to government
 employees
 &gt;
 &gt; But what
 about my statement that I am always in control of my vote?
 My system would not allow possibility of loosing such
 control. I can always change delegation if I do not like
 what my delegate is doing. Does not this alone resolve the
 issue?
 
 Perhaps. But I'm
 a bit of a collector of techniques for gaming the
 system, and I've got such a large
 collection by now that perhaps I
 over plan
 to prevent it from happening with my proposed system. In
 this example, there are multiple fears, even if
 to start with the
 system does allow any vote
 to be done directly (overriding
 proxies/delegates):
 
 1) Once people get comfortable with the
 operation of the system,
 they'll tend to
 go back to sleep and not even necessarily pay
 attention to individual votes. Distributing the
 responsibility for the
 outcome across as
 many individuals as possible makes it that much
 harder for a small group to take over. The
 degenerate case of
 unlimited proxies is that
 half the people grant their proxy to Rush
 Limbaugh and the other half to Bernie Sanders
 (or half each to
 Republican and Democrat
 parties, if virtual delegates were allowed).
 The same could happen as an emergent phenomenon
 if delegation allows
 recursion (mine
 doesn't, instead it computes a weighted average of
 multiple delegate's votes to handle the
 situation where some of them
 may not vote on
 a given proposal).
 
 2) If
 people are asleep, a small faction could then vote to change
 the
 operation of the system. This is keeping
 in mind that 88% of the votes
 in 1934
 Germany were to elect Hitler as dictator, a vote that
 unfortunately they couldn't undo because
 Hitler, being dictator,
 promptly changed the
 rules.
 
 &gt; I am assuming
 that a typical person is reasonable in thinking that most
 people around are not his enemy. An average person will
 entrust his body to a doctor even though he has very little
 knowledge of medicine. Same with statistics: probably most
 people know someone who is more or less OK with math and can
 confirm that the system of checks is sound.
 &gt;
 
 A point
 for Ned's system, then. And I agree that people
 *should*
 probably act this way, but realize
 that often they don't. Rejection of
 science is all too common (on climate change,
 fracking, GMOs, etc. are
 just the current
 examples). My prediction is that people are going to
 be even less trusting that a new server-based
 system isn't going to
 jerk them
 around.
 
 &gt;&gt; The bigger
 problem, though, is hacking: We can't have a system that
 collapses if all the
 &gt;&gt; data in it
 gets stolen and published.
 &gt;
 &gt; I think this should be just stated
 honestly upfront that there is a chance that the system will
 be hacked. Please be aware of it! Bad things happen from
 time to time. Still better than 100% publicity. And I am
 personally do not care, I am not embarrassed of my choices
 and can explain every one of them. I just think many people
 do care.
 &gt;
 
 I don't have a problem with a certain
 amount of security through
 obscurity: The
 data shouldn't just be handed to anyone asks fully
 digested. Just give them the raw data (id
 numbers instead of names,
 etc.)&#160; And I
 think we should make dropping dox a taboo (e.g., matching
 a persons screen name to their real name and
 then publishing that
 info). But for those
 who are really paranoid, I still say our best bet
 is to allow them to rely on personality-matched
 proxies so that they
 can't be held
 directly responsible for their vote. That way only the
 early voters (who become eligible to be
 proxies) have to actually
 commit to having
 their votes completely unobscured.

 &#160; &#160; Scott
