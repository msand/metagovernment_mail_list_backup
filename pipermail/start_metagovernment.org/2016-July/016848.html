</I>
Understood, and by taking advantage of sampling theory, I even agree
that it *could* even do this sufficiently efficiently to actually
work. The problem is that Blinap relies on something that, as we've
discussed previously, simply doesn't exist: People have to know enough
statistics to trust a sampling-based decisionmaking system. My
position is that they don't, and it would take decades to train enough
of them in statistics (and psychology) to allow them to accept such a
new system. As it stands, people are *terrible* at making decisions
based on statistics now, and what's worse is that they don't even
recognize how terrible they are. There's a whole literature on this in
behavioral economics. Kahneman's work is foundational on the topic,
but for something a little more approachable I recommend Dan Ariely's
&quot;Predictably Irrational&quot;.

&gt;<i> And also, the answer to your implicit question (&quot;Is that possible?&quot;) needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be an actual demonstration, not just words. (I will be really glad when
</I>&gt;<i> we get to the testing phase for Blinap and the Matchsys and Matteo's
</I>&gt;<i> decision system, and past the competitive chest-beating phase that precedes
</I>&gt;<i> the testing phase.)
</I>
I think I disagree: We (including I) don't even know enough yet to
create a viable system, and it'd be a great waste of resources to
build something complete only to find that we'd overlooked some key
fact out there in the world and so ended up off in the weeds. I'm all
for building prototypes, but everything I've seen in this area so far
is so far off the mark that even building a prototype is probably not
the best use of our limited time and energy.

&gt;<i> In that testing, the Blinap design will indeed be found to be capable of
</I>&gt;<i> making millions of decisions per week: democratically, reliably,
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently, affordably, transparently, and quickly. You'll see. (This is me
</I>&gt;<i> competitively beating my chest.)
</I>
I have no doubt that what you propose can be done. But I understand
both human nature and statistics and so I'm not the one you have to
convince. When you tell the average voter that their tax rates will be
set by a group of randomly chosen people and they will just have to
trust that the decision will be optimal because of this design (you
can't even vote the decisionmakers in or out of office!) they're going
to look at like you like you're crazy and refuse to allow it to be
done. As I've said before, Blinap might be appropriate for
civilization 3.0, but we've got to get to 2.0 first to enable us to
lay the groundwork necessary to take that next step.
  Regards,
    Scott

Has it been republished on the web anywhere again? Last time I checked
the site it was originally published on was gone...
