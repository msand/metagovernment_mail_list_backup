<PRE>
Ciao Carlo!
Nice to see that there is another Italian other than me and Jacopo here

I will repost here the five phases of direct democracy projects as they 
do not show up well on my phon

1. The *creative phase*: the single or group proponents of the project 
gather and start to discuss about the project. A document is written, 
and a site is opened.
2. *euphoric phase*: the group starts to involve other people, the 
project is developed, people work hard. The atmosphere around the 
project is euphoric .New functionalities are added every day.
3. The *stagnation phase*: the project fails to get much traction. 
People are starting to get frustrated and there is a deep gulf about the 
big expectations and the poor results.
4. The *decline phase*: the group accuses the public at large of being 
lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the governments 
of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is little or no 
self-criticism about why the project is not going as planned. People 
start to leave the project.
5. The *death phase*: the once big group is now very much slimmed down 
and only a few people survive. There are no major addition and changes 
to the project in months. The project is not being discussed upon in the 
media anymore. In a few months or years, the project is definitely 
shelved for good.

I have also been involved with the Partito Liquido and the Italian 
Pirate Party.
They both failed to get significant traction

In reply to your points

But I think the softwares are ok. &#8203;
-&gt; The software doesnt matter much if it is not used

The experiences I described above have been used, I'm a direct witness 
even if with some functional issues... &#8203;
-&gt;  No point to have few hundreds of people to use the software
Should be few millions

Airesis, Votorola, Liquid Feedback not to mention Vilfredo have faileed
Not even ten thousand people registered there
Loomio and Democracy OS also failed unfortunately

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been involved in direct democracy for almost ten years now and

</I>&gt;<i> &#8203; &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about your projects? Let's share some experiences!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Carlo
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (My thoughts about your statements will follow...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As all direct democracy projects developed so far have failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;I must agree with you in terms of organization, policies and communication
</I>&gt;<i> strategies behind and at the top of the projects.
</I>&gt;<i> But I think the softwares are ok. &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global populations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully, no one is interested in a global anarco-fascist cyber
</I>&gt;<i> dictature.&#8203;.. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hundreds of projects have been developed and on one has been used until
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;The experiences I described above have been used, I'm a direct witness,
</I>&gt;<i> even if with some functional issues... &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, people do not listen to this fact and they keep develop new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects and they keep failing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo has failed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;I'm not optimistic about Pietro's project, even if I know he's improuving
</I>&gt;<i> year after year his software.
</I>&gt;<i> Imho if he will work on design/UX we could really try the potential of
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo.&#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis has failed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;It depends on the groups.
</I>&gt;<i> I know that some 5 Star Movement groups on Airesis are doing very good
</I>&gt;<i> numbers in terms of participation.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that the problem for Airesis is certification and the absence of
</I>&gt;<i> proxy voting (delegation).&#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Votorola has failed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;Did Votorola really started? Please share some links with an online demo
</I>&gt;<i> if possible, I'd really appreciate... I'm really curious about their
</I>&gt;<i> concrete implementation. &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> LQFB has failed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;I totally disagree. I personally implemented the Partito Liquido instance
</I>&gt;<i> and we had thousand of people voting on the platform.
</I>&gt;<i> As I sad, my opinion is that the problem is not about the software, it's
</I>&gt;<i> about the objectives, rules, statutes, constitution of the assembly,
</I>&gt;<i> communication, etc.&#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so many others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Others are in development now, I predict they will fail as well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matchism will fail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blinap will fail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;Do you have some links of these projects? Never heard about it.
</I>&gt;<i> In exchange I suggest you to have a look at:
</I>&gt;<i> - Loomio: <A HREF="https://www.loomio.org">https://www.loomio.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - OpenVote: <A HREF="https://openvote.com">https://openvote.com</A>
</I>&gt;<i> - NationBuilder (US only): &#8203;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/voterfile">http://nationbuilder.com/voterfile</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;- Democracy OS: &#8203;<A HREF="http://democracyos.org">http://democracyos.org</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;- Placeavote (US only): <A HREF="https://placeavote.com">https://placeavote.com</A> &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the saddest thing of all, is that like it happened with the developers of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other direct democracy system, the developers of Matchism and Blinap will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> become so tired, so depressed that I suspect they will quit with direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are the five steps of the typical direct democracy project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The *creative phase*: the single or group proponents of the project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     gather and start to discuss about the project. A document is written, and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     site is opened.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *euphoric phase*: the group starts to involve other people, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     project is developed, people work hard. The atmosphere around the project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is euphoric .New functionalities are added every day.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     3.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The *stagnation phase*: the project fails to get much traction. People
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     are starting to get frustrated and there is a deep gulf about the big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     expectations and the poor results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     4.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The *decline phase*: the group accuses the public at large of being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the governments of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is little or no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     self-criticism about why the project is not going as planned. People start
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to leave the project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     5.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The *death phase*: the once big group is now very much slimmed down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and only a few people survive. There are no major addition and changes to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the project in months. The project is not being discussed upon in the media
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     anymore. In a few months or years, the project is definitely shelved for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     good.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern, no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one excluded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is yet to be seen if there will ever been one direct democracy project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be used on permanent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> basis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Votorola is now at step 5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Airesis at step 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Matchism, Blinap at step 1-2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why new developers do not listen to old developers who failed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why they do not study why other system failed and instead build a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system also doomed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;I really hope to have more time soon to better analyse your opinions and
</I>&gt;<i> give you a ore accurated feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
