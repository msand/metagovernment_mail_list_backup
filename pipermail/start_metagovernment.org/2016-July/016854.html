It's not us making it complicated, the world is complicated. This
includes human culture. Trying to change it requires either vast
resources or very skilled intervention.

</I>
Agreed! The software has to be simple to understand and simple to use.
It also has to be accessible from whatever devices and communication
methods people are using. Indeed one might make the argument that at
least the initial prototypes of a new decisionmaking system should
actually be *built* on FB or Twitter, though of course it couldn't be
wholly dependent on them (i.e., we can't have our government run by a
private company).

</I>
There are lots of reasons for this, ego isn't one of them. Without a
(perhaps delusional) belief that you actually can change things,
nothing will ever get done. This is therefore not a valid criticism.

&gt;<i> We need to get back to Earth and look at things how they are

</I>&gt;<i> MORE than happy if we could just affect it in a positive way on a selected
</I>&gt;<i> range of issues, not millions
</I>
We already have these things. Move-On and Avaaz and other
petition-oriented sites do exactly what you propose. But they're
non-binding and don't even make any claims to being a *replacement*
for government rather than just a minor add-on to it. And that's why
they're commonly derided as being examples of &quot;slacktivism&quot;. IMHO
they're actually making things worse by siphoning off energy that
should be used to encourage development of new systems: People are
being deceived into thinking they're making in a difference when in
fact what they're really doing is strengthening the oligarchies that
are running things now. Is that really what you're advocating?

    Scott
