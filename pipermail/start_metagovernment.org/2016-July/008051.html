<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; National governments and multi-national corporations and top 
capitalists make tens of millions of public-matter decisions per year 
(decisions that affect the public). The decisions that produce the 
atrocities are among those tens of millions. (Not all of the decisions 
produce atrocities, but reliably filtering out those that do requires 
passing all of the decisions through the direct democracy filter.)

 &gt;Scott&gt; Seems like a big project: Review every decision that anyone 
makes that could affect another person?

Ned&gt; Yep. They are Really Big Projects. (Both the project of developing 
the software, and the project of using the software). (Which is why I 
continue the grueling work of trying to entice top talent to switch from 
playing around with the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern to playing 
around with the &quot;propose recursively&quot; design pattern.)

(Actually, the Blinap process in particular is intended to *make* every 
&quot;sufficiently consequential&quot; public-matter decision -- it does not just 
review decisions already made by other means. Blinap is intended to 
entirely displace (render obsolete) decision-making by national 
government-bodies and multi-national corporations and top capitalists.)

And also, the answer to your implicit question (&quot;Is that possible?&quot;) 
needs to be an actual demonstration, not just words. (I will be really 
glad when we get to the testing phase for Blinap and the Matchsys and 
Matteo's decision system, and past the competitive chest-beating phase 
that precedes the testing phase.)

In that testing, the Blinap design will indeed be found to be capable of 
making millions of decisions per week: democratically, reliably, 
efficiently, affordably, transparently, and quickly. You'll see. (This 
is me competitively beating my chest.)

(Anyone interested in discussing details of the Blinap design can post 
to this thread.)
