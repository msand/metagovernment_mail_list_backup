<PRE>Hi Scott,
I stopped posting after I realized that people here had little interest in delegation. The main guy here, Ed Pastore if I recall correctly, explicitly spoke against it. When I tried to explain my rationale he just ignored my posts. Another person I exchanged emails with -- Jacopo Tolja -- was also against it. I actually did a small amount of work (like one day) for Airesis translating it to Russian. That allowed me to learn a little more about it. I quickly realized that it had no delegation option, so it would be doomed like many other projects. Naturally, I stopped contributing.

Is your site already functioning? Can I register and pick delegates?
Helping people to find matching delegates may be useful. I was more thinking those would be people I already know, if we are talking about a large scale system. Like current and former politicians, pundits, bloggers, writers etc. Broadly speaking, all those people whose political views on some topics I am already familiar with.
As for virtual delegates, I have a principle that people should be free in deciding what to do with there votes. So having an entity that is a party, for example, is a possibility. I would not choose it myself, as this is too coarse for me. But some people do just that, they consider themselves a republican or a democrat. But many of these people still disagree on many questions with their parties. So they may still choose to vote differently on those questions, if they care. Or they could choose a party entity for some topics and real people for other topics.
I think that transparency of voting records should be optional, but to be eligible for becoming a delegate that person must reveal its voting records. So, we can have both: privacy for ordinary people, openness for the delegates. Same with the personality type information, I guess.
Sergey

Check your spam filter: I think there's something peculiar about his
posts that triggers spam filters. Another one ended up in mine just
this morning.

Hadn't seen your posts previously (guess I'm still relatively new
here), but agree 100% with your reasoning. The only thing I'd add is
that it also essential to help people *choose* appropriate delegates.
The Matchsys proposal (buried in the manifesto on matchism.org) is
that delegates by matched by personality profile, much the way
computer dating works. The data collection for this is relatively
straightforward as there are very well researched personality tests
that psychologists use that are not overly burdensome to complete
(e.g., there's a 10-question version of the Big-5 inventory that only
takes a couple of minutes to fill out).

What's *not* helpful IMHO is to allow &quot;virtual&quot; delegates that
represent the positions of political parties, corporations, PACs,
nonprofits, etc. because that just introduces a strong bias toward
corruption into the process and actually gets away from the essential
humanness exhibited by individuals that disappears when mob effects
take over (my theory is that our mob-forming instincts evolved in the
EEA to facilitate resource-acquisition attacks on neighboring bands:
Since these effects are no longer required in modern society and
because they facilitate aggression and tribalism they need to be
suppressed or at least not encouraged by the voting system).

One thing you (and I guess I) gloss over is that delegation requires
open voting, which some people object to (fortunately for us the
research shows that it's mostly the least informed voters who don't
want their votes published, references for this provided on
matchism.org). My matching proposal also means that personality type
information will be accessible, at least at the server level. My guess
is that this won't be a problem for most people either (e.g., they'll
offer up their party affiliation at the drop of a hat), but it is
something we need to handle carefully.
&#160; Regards,
&#160; &#160; Scott
