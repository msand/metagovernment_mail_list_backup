<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Delegation can be changed easily at any time.

&gt;<i> Seems almost too generous to me. For example, it's already larger than

But what about my statement that I am always in control of my vote? My system would not allow possibility of loosing such control. I can always change delegation if I do not like what my delegate is doing. Does not this alone resolve the issue?

Well, this is life. People will always need to put some effort to defend their interests. I am just hoping to minimize the amount of that required effort.

&gt;<i> As I was saying with Ned's system, this requires faith in statistics
</I>&gt;<i> that I think most people living now don't have.
</I>
I am assuming that a typical person is reasonable in thinking that most people around are not his enemy. An average person will entrust his body to a doctor even though he has very little knowledge of medicine. Same with statistics: probably most people know someone who is more or less OK with math and can confirm that the system of checks is sound.

&gt;<i> The bigger problem, though, is hacking: We can't have a system that collapses if all the
</I>&gt;<i> data in it gets stolen and published.
</I>
I think this should be just stated honestly upfront that there is a chance that the system will be hacked. Please be aware of it! Bad things happen from time to time. Still better than 100% publicity. And I am personally do not care, I am not embarrassed of my choices and can explain every one of them. I just think many people do care.

Regards,
Sergey

 Contributing to Airesis? Not if they seriously consider
 implementing vote
 &gt; delegation. I guess
 it does not matter by now.
 
 I meant contributing here. As for Airesis I
 agree that it's
 unfortunate that it is
 having trouble getting funded, but it's also
 true that it wasn't really my cup of tea
 either which is why I never
 could get too
 motivated to even use it, let alone contribute to it. I
 liked Loomio better, at least at first, but
 believe that it too has
 too many fundamental
 flaws to be salvageable now.
 
 &gt;&gt; A proxy based system can easily be
 gamed if Rush Limbaugh (or Donald
 &gt;&gt;
 Trump)
 &gt;&gt; does something like
 manipulate his audience into turning *all* of
 &gt;&gt; their votes over to him and then uses
 that &quot;authority&quot; to get that
 &gt;&gt; Zyclon B purchase order through. Which
 as I said before is something
 &gt;&gt;
 normal voters, even authoritarian voters, won't do if
 they have to get
 &gt;&gt; their hands
 dirty.
 &gt;
 &gt; Delegation
 can be changed easily at any time. From what you said, that
 even
 &gt; authoritarian voters won't
 want to get their hands dirty, doesn't it mean
 &gt; there is no problem. I do not consider
 irreversible scenarios here.
 &gt;
 Introducing caps may also be an option worth considering,
 though 1% seems to
 &gt; harsh for me.
 
 Seems almost too generous to
 me. For example, it's already larger than
 the size of the government in some Localities,
 which could lead to
 government governing
 itself if it could convince people to transfer
 their votes to government employees (openly or
 perhaps by some
 subterfuge). But one reason
 I hedge is because I don't really have a
 sense of how many early voters (who by voting
 early become potential
 proxies) there will
 be. If there aren't enough, we may have to allow
 each to carry more of the votes.
 
 &gt;&gt; There is
 unfortunately no progressive counter-weight to this
 phenomenon
 &gt;&gt; (e.g., Elizabeth Warren
 won't even *ask* for your vote).
 &gt;
 &gt; Why not, if this will be very easy to
 do?
 
 Demagoguery is just not
 in the liberal/progressive playbook (Bernie
 Sanders notwithstanding ;-)&#160; That is, even if
 they do make themselves
 available to
 represent you, it'll be done so nicely and
 non-confrontationally that it won't
 generate anywhere near the same
 results as
 when the authoritarians do it.
 
 &gt;&gt; The second reason is verifyability
 (nothing to
 &gt;&gt; do with delegation):
 Votes need to be open so that everyone can go in
 &gt;&gt; and verify that their vote was
 properly recorded and so that anyone
 &gt;&gt; can redo the count using all of the
 voting information because it will
 &gt;&gt;
 be a public record.
 &gt;
 &gt; Two things need to be verifiable:
 &gt;
 &gt; 1) That votes of any
 real voter are counted, it has to be verifiable but
 &gt; that voter. This is easy.
 
 Agreed.
 
 &gt; 2) That votes only come from real voters.
 That requires some removal of
 &gt; privacy,
 but it can be done reliably by random checks, so that a
 probability
 &gt; of the record exposure is
 small, say 0.1% in a life time.
 
 As I was saying with Ned's system, this
 requires faith in statistics
 that I think
 most people living now don't have. The bigger
 problem,
 though, is hacking: We can't
 have a system that collapses if all the
 data
 in it gets stolen and published. I think we need to publish
 the
 data directly to avoid the possibility
 of being held hostage by it.
 This also means
 that dropping dox will also be removed as a threat,
 albeit at the cost that some voters will simply
 refuse to participate
 because they fear
 revealing their positions (although being able to
 vote by proxy I think is a good counter to
 that). How big a problem
 this is I don't
 know yet, but am concerned that many (most?)
 newspapers have already dropped their on-line
 opinion forums because
 the anonymous trolls
 have taken over them. Why they don't just insist
 on real names, I'm not sure, but suspect
 it's because they have
 misjudged the
 situation by assuming that the trolls insistence on
 anonymity is a position shared by the
 neurotypicals (and I'm quite
 sure that
 it isn't).
 &#160; Regards,
 &#160; &#160;
 Scott
 
 &gt; Let me know if
 need to explain this better.
