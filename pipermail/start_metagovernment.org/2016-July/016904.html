&gt;<i> You have just been telling Matteo that you consider Avaaz and MoveOn to be
</I>&gt;<i> actually impediments to changing our global social system for the better.
</I>&gt;<i> From my perspective, Matchism/Matchsys as presented in the current Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> Manifesto would be just as much an impediment to the extent that it gained
</I>&gt;<i> popular traction.
</I>
Why? Again, I provide specific examples and conclusions, you provide
only vague smears...

&gt;<i> So, actually (Mission:Impossible), you *are* one of the
</I>&gt;<i> ones that I have to convince.
</I>
Certainly I hope to be your most important critic, something I'd hope
everyone would aspire to be: Although you (and most of the other
system-developers) seem to resent criticism and then fail to refute
it, I see it as an essential part of the process of creating a
workable system. Being blind to the weaknesses of our own designs is
unavoidable, which is why publishing these designs and responding to
criticism I believe to be an essential part of the process.

&gt;<i> But: I don't think that you should be convinced by *just* my superior
</I>&gt;<i> chest-beating. I think that it is important that you go ahead and *test*
</I>&gt;<i> your designs, and then be convinced by the test results. However superior my
</I>&gt;<i> chest-beating may be, it is still just chest-beating.
</I>
I do plan to do this, but IMHO far better to vet design decisions
verbally before committing to code (I'm a wiz at prototyping (it was
what the product I developed, MetaCard, was best at), but that's still
no substitute for getting the theoretical underpinnings right first).

&gt;<i>  &gt;Scott&gt; I submit that no revolution has ever occurred that *didn't* go
</I>&gt;<i> through this [competitive chest-beating] phase, and usually for many years.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I have no interest in starting a political revolution. (I consider
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;render obsolete&quot; to be a much more responsible strategy-for-change than
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;overthrow and replace&quot;.)
</I>
Dream on: Any idea that challenges the status quo is going to trigger
a reaction from both the powers-that-be and their authoritarian
followers. Not doing something because people might be stressed or
even die as a result is to decide to do nothing (the way I see people
are dying in droves as it is and as long as you can *reduce* that at
all, it's a win).

&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Just discussing social system design ideas reaches the point of
</I>&gt;<i> diminishing returns pretty quickly. Social system design ideas need to be
</I>&gt;<i> realistically *tested*.
</I>
IMHO only after they've been theoretically vetted: Otherwise you risk
meltdown when the system doesn't scale or some critical design flaw
doesn't become apparent until *after* critical mass has been achieved.

&gt;<i> *Testing* is by far the best way to discover where the holes are.
</I>
I think I disagree, at least as to &quot;best&quot;. It's just one component in
the process. It also can result in false positives (discarding a good
idea because there was some flaw in implementation or marketing of
it).

&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Honestly, if the Iteration#1 Matchism design were a lot better than it
</I>&gt;<i> is, and the Matchism implementation plan were a lot better than it is, then
</I>&gt;<i> I would recognize that you had a basis for claiming that all of the
</I>&gt;<i> literature that you have read has done you some good with respect to
</I>&gt;<i> designing and planning. But as it is, the quality of the design and plan do
</I>&gt;<i> not support that claim. In testing, my guess is that the design and the plan
</I>&gt;<i> will not do well.
</I>
Again, more vague smears rather than specific criticism of the
proposals or of the scientific literature they're based on. It almost
looks like a religious position (&quot;those eggheads can't teach me
anything, I've already got the holy grail of TESTING!&quot;).

&gt;<i> In the larger literature, there are very few indeed that have been able to
</I>&gt;<i> find a way to approach the study of population-scale social systems
</I>&gt;<i> experimentally. As a practical matter, that can only be done *responsibly*
</I>&gt;<i> in the lab (which we don't have yet). Putting lives at risk to run social
</I>&gt;<i> system experiments at population scale is something that only people such as
</I>&gt;<i> Stalin and Mao do. (With respect to Matchism, please don't be those guys. We
</I>&gt;<i> need testing and understanding before we seek popularity.)
</I>
Or, we could just understand Stalin and Mao to be psychopaths and
instead of thrashing around in fear of creating (or becoming) another
example, study psychopaths and then design our systems to prevent
people like that from taking control (or otherwise gaming) of them.

    Scott
