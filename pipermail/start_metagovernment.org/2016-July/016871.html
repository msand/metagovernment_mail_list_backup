Agreed, but I also wouldn't consider it a total failure: At least it's
in the queue. Don't know how productive the Italian parliament is, but
if it's like the US they're lucky to get *anything* done in any given
week. Tabling measures like this pending further refinement or
research seems to me completely reasonable, though I agree that it's
also often done merely to avoid criticism and possible repercussions.
US policy on gun control usually falls into this category: Politicians
are simply afraid to introduce gun control measures because the risks
to themselves personally are so high compared to the potential
rewards. A direct democracy won't suffer from this problem.

It's the worst system except when compared to all the others (tyranny,
feudalism, oligarchy, etc.) I agree that it's severely broken, but
we're still alive and we have the ability to discuss replacement
systems here in the open, so I say it can't be all bad...
