Hi Scott

thank you for the reply.
Yes. I did post here hoping to receive a feedback

1)  If people will stop to read after half a section it would be just a 
good thing!
Frankly speaking, the vast majority of the people are simply not 
interested to work even one hour per week to do something for DD, they 
are just lazy and expect to receiveonly
Good thing if they go away as soon as possible
In any project, at the beginning only the 1% of the real activists must 
be involved, not the lazy ones.
So, if they are not even interested to even read a short document of 20 
pages, fine, let them go.
I do not believe know their governments are bad, otherwise their would 
move their buttocks and do something
Please tell me in good faith, how many US citizens would say that their 
government is a major sponsor of war crimes?
Or any Italian?
Or any English?
Or Iranian?
I think in any country in the world, most of the people do not know/care 
about the fact that their govts are responsible of atrocities abroad
I completely disagree about the fact that &quot;solving small problems that 
affect billions is a vastly more important goal than preventing 
atrocities that might affect tens/hundreds/thousands of people&quot; but if 
you really think so, then you should tell this to, for example, the 
families of the victims of 9/11.
After all there have been less than 3 thousand victims in that day.
I would suspect that if you tell to any American/English/Italian that 
9/11 attacks were not so important as only 3000 people died their 
reaction against you may not be that of a kiss in the cheek
Be careful ;)
It would be difficult for anyone to &quot;prove&quot; that direct democracy can 
prevent wars, what we can see is that with the spread of the internet, 
people are more informed and it is easier to take action than 50 years ago
One thing I agree upon is that it may be good to put a remark at the 
beginning of chapter one saying, if you are not interested skip to part 2

2)  I disagree, and it is actually easy to show that the vast majority 
of the people has little interest to have their informed position on any 
issue
Just check how many people around you know the essential parts and 
details of the Iranian nuclear deal.
You would be lucky if you find a 5% of any group of people in the US, 
Italy, Japan, the UK that knows &quot;a little bit&quot; of what the Iranian deal 
is about
People are lazy and they have little interest to be informed
I disagree that vocal minorities are necessarily less informed.
The people at PETA know much more than the average guy on animal 
mistreatment
The people who go out and protest the Israeli occupation in the West 
Bank usually know far more about this issue
The usual Joe/Jane/Mario/Felipe usually parrots what they have heard on 
TV or in the news.
Assuming they even read the news, which in most cases is not even the case

3)  I agree that the delegate thing is under developed, but trying to 
create a match-system for finding delegating people within the 
application would be a huge mistake, IMHO
People want a n application that is easy to use and not complicated
They are too lazy to try to use something which is more complicated than 
Facebook
And any such system would be a hell to program, which means it would not 
even come out well
So everything which is not necessary must be left out.

4)  Votorola, Airesis, Liquid Feedback and the Pirate Party and other 
platforms have all tried to involve the casual user into the writing, 
editing, discussion, amendiment and voting of proposals of law
They have all failed
Simply by not understanding the simple truth
That people are lazy and will  not take the time needed to vote every 
single issue
BY the way, there is nowhere written in the document that people should 
vote according to a party line
People will be free and encouraged to vote per issues, so where did you 
find that?

5)  Allowing people to removing their leader when they do not want it 
anymore without restrictions would result in chaos
I think you cant change a leader every two weeks

Looks like we have many points of disagreement, but this is fine

</I>&gt;<i> 1) The first half of the paper is merely distraction and should be
</I>&gt;<i> published separately. My prediction is that most people will stop
</I>&gt;<i> reading before they even finish that section. Worse, I don't even see
</I>&gt;<i> any claim (let alone support for a claim) that a direct democracy will
</I>&gt;<i> actually reduce the incidence of most of those sorts of atrocities. I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect it will, but certainly wouldn't be willing to stake the worth
</I>&gt;<i> of my project on this. People already know our governments are
</I>&gt;<i> dysfunctional so IMHO there's no need to even document this. There are
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of problems other than preventing atrocities (particularly by
</I>&gt;<i> the military) that a properly functioning government can solve. I
</I>&gt;<i> would argue that solving small problems that affect billions is a
</I>&gt;<i> vastly more important goal than preventing atrocities that might
</I>&gt;<i> affect tens/hundreds/thousands of people. Most of your items are
</I>&gt;<i> actually better evidence that we need to eliminate militaries or
</I>&gt;<i> institute mass anti-tribalism education campaigns than anything to do
</I>&gt;<i> with government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) You sort of gloss over the issue of open voting. You'll find a
</I>&gt;<i> handful of references on the subject on matchism.org: Studies show
</I>&gt;<i> that *most* people are willing to have their positions on the issues
</I>&gt;<i> and their votes published, but that there is a vocal minority who
</I>&gt;<i> oppose it. As it turns out, that minority also happens to be the least
</I>&gt;<i> informed about the issues (i.e., they may be more concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> protection against looking like fools than with any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> privacy/coercion/vote buying/etc. issues).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Your proposed delegation system I think is under-developed (the
</I>&gt;<i> same goes for every other proposal I've seen, notably including
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;liquid democracy&quot;). This is a key component of the current proposal
</I>&gt;<i> on matchism.org, where they key issue of *finding* appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> delegates is dealt with (i.e., they're found by psychologically
</I>&gt;<i> matching people, much the way that dating services like eHarmony
</I>&gt;<i> work).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Although I'd agree that it's an empirical question (and there is
</I>&gt;<i> far too little empiricism in this field today), I'm skeptical that
</I>&gt;<i> virtual delegates (e.g, encouraging the formation of special-issue
</I>&gt;<i> parties) won't just result in the system devolving back into the one
</I>&gt;<i> we have now (e.g., people who vote the party line, single-issue
</I>&gt;<i> voters, etc.). IMHO the trick to building a robust direct democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> to work hard to decouple every vote rather than providing *any* sort
</I>&gt;<i> of aggregation system. My example is that while it's perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> predictable that people will vote for Hitler (or Trump) when they feel
</I>&gt;<i> their resources are being threatened (it's a well-documented
</I>&gt;<i> psychological phenomenon), they probably *won't* vote to approve a
</I>&gt;<i> purchase order for Zyclon-B to be used on some minority group. The
</I>&gt;<i> trick, therefore, is to design the system to suppress aggregation of
</I>&gt;<i> power to the greatest degree possible. Political parties and your
</I>&gt;<i> virtual delegates work against that goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) In my proposed system I share your concerns about the vote
</I>&gt;<i> counters/policy implementers gaining too much power and then becoming
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to remove. I propose a simpler solution: Make them actual
</I>&gt;<i> government employees and create a system such that *any* government
</I>&gt;<i> employee can be removed from their position by popular vote in the
</I>&gt;<i> relevant jurisdiction. I suspect that this will become a very popular
</I>&gt;<i> component of my system when I get around to implementing it (there are
</I>&gt;<i> certain judges and police chiefs that I'm sure nearly everyone will
</I>&gt;<i> actually *enjoy* firing!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally I'd recommend publishing this as a web page rather than as a
</I>&gt;<i> PDF. My experience has been that few people will actually read a
</I>&gt;<i> multi-page PDF, but they will jump around on a web site and absorb at
</I>&gt;<i> least *some* of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to seeing the next revision, and feel free to use any
</I>&gt;<i> of the ideas here or on matchism.org. I don't even expect credit: my
</I>&gt;<i> major fear being that people will implement my ideas badly and set the
</I>&gt;<i> field back than that attributions somehow get lost...
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
