<PRE>Hi Matteo,
What do you think about the following consideration? 

Helping people to find matching delegates may be useful. I was more thinking those would be people I already know, if we are talking about a large scale system. Like current and former politicians, pundits, bloggers, writers etc. Broadly speaking, all those people whose political views on some topics I am already familiar with.
Thanks,Sergey

If I may..

I think you are deluding your self if you think people will use your software to find similarly minded people
They do not care

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Great post. (I do not see you original post somehow, but I see what you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrote in it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Check your spam filter: I think there's something peculiar about his
</I>&gt;<i> posts that triggers spam filters. Another one ended up in mine just
</I>&gt;<i> this morning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (big snip)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not have high expectations, but maybe someone will pay attention to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hadn't seen your posts previously (guess I'm still relatively new
</I>&gt;<i> here), but agree 100% with your reasoning. The only thing I'd add is
</I>&gt;<i> that it also essential to help people *choose* appropriate delegates.
</I>&gt;<i> The Matchsys proposal (buried in the manifesto on matchism.org) is
</I>&gt;<i> that delegates by matched by personality profile, much the way
</I>&gt;<i> computer dating works. The data collection for this is relatively
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward as there are very well researched personality tests
</I>&gt;<i> that psychologists use that are not overly burdensome to complete
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., there's a 10-question version of the Big-5 inventory that only
</I>&gt;<i> takes a couple of minutes to fill out).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What's *not* helpful IMHO is to allow &quot;virtual&quot; delegates that
</I>&gt;<i> represent the positions of political parties, corporations, PACs,
</I>&gt;<i> nonprofits, etc. because that just introduces a strong bias toward
</I>&gt;<i> corruption into the process and actually gets away from the essential
</I>&gt;<i> humanness exhibited by individuals that disappears when mob effects
</I>&gt;<i> take over (my theory is that our mob-forming instincts evolved in the
</I>&gt;<i> EEA to facilitate resource-acquisition attacks on neighboring bands:
</I>&gt;<i> Since these effects are no longer required in modern society and
</I>&gt;<i> because they facilitate aggression and tribalism they need to be
</I>&gt;<i> suppressed or at least not encouraged by the voting system).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One thing you (and I guess I) gloss over is that delegation requires
</I>&gt;<i> open voting, which some people object to (fortunately for us the
</I>&gt;<i> research shows that it's mostly the least informed voters who don't
</I>&gt;<i> want their votes published, references for this provided on
</I>&gt;<i> matchism.org). My matching proposal also means that personality type
</I>&gt;<i> information will be accessible, at least at the server level. My guess
</I>&gt;<i> is that this won't be a problem for most people either (e.g., they'll
</I>&gt;<i> offer up their party affiliation at the drop of a hat), but it is
</I>&gt;<i> something we need to handle carefully.
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; Scott
