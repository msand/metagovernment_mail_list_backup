Sorry I missed it. Please resume ;-)

&gt;<i> Is your site already functioning? Can I register and pick delegates?
</I>
Sorry, I got to the prototyping phase and then the company whose tool
I had chosen fell into financial difficulty and I had to waste a lot
of time trying to straighten that out (I'm also an investor in that
company). It also kind of took the wind out of my sails because I'm
still not sure they'll survive and if they don't I'd have to start
over with another tool. It doesn't help that I was a software engineer
for about 20 years (retired now for about 12) and find that the
current state of app development is probably the worst it's ever been:
The web, in particular, could only have been designed by morons: We
had better designs for distributed processing and information
presentation back in the mid 80s even though for the most part we
lacked the hardware and the bandwidth to actually implement them.
Don't get me started on this...

&gt;<i> Helping people to find matching delegates may be useful. I was more thinking
</I>&gt;<i> those would be people I already know, if we are talking about a large scale
</I>&gt;<i> system. Like current and former politicians, pundits, bloggers, writers etc.
</I>&gt;<i> Broadly speaking, all those people whose political views on some topics I am
</I>&gt;<i> already familiar with.
</I>
I actually think we need to actively work to *prevent* this sort of
thing from happening. The problem I'm sure is not *you*, who probably
read each published work and then carefully consider its merits, the
problem is the authoritarians who tend to respond more to
fearmongering and demagoguery rather than rational argument. A proxy
based system can easily be gamed if Rush Limbaugh (or Donald Trump)
does something like manipulate his audience into turning *all* of
their votes over to him and then uses that &quot;authority&quot; to get that
Zyclon B purchase order through. Which as I said before is something
normal voters, even authoritarian voters, won't do if they have to get
their hands dirty.  Although I'm reluctant to do this and will
probably wait until actual use proves it necessary, I'm thinking we'll
probably have to install a cap on how many votes any individual can
carry (probably something less than 1% of the population in any
Locality).

There is unfortunately no progressive counter-weight to this
phenomenon (e.g., Elizabeth Warren won't even *ask* for your vote). I
have an evolutionary psychological theory as to why this asymmetry
exists and it again goes back to inter-band competition: A million
years ago the fearmongering/warmongering individuals actually had to
*fight* in the battles that they instigated. Now they just send cannon
fodder. This removes the individual risk and has unleashed their
tendency toward behavior that can only be considered antisocial in
modern society (i.e., you want to prevent atrocities, make anyone who
votes for war to actually fight in it. That's the environment our
Clinations evolved to function in).

(snip, same response)

&gt;<i> I think that transparency of voting records should be optional, but to be
</I>&gt;<i> eligible for becoming a delegate that person must reveal its voting records.
</I>&gt;<i> So, we can have both: privacy for ordinary people, openness for the
</I>&gt;<i> delegates. Same with the personality type information, I guess.
</I>
Two problems with this: The first being, as above, elevating proxies
above normal users facilitates them gaming the system (via corruption
or simple demagoguery). The second reason is verifyability (nothing to
do with delegation): Votes need to be open so that everyone can go in
and verify that their vote was properly recorded and so that anyone
can redo the count using all of the voting information because it will
be a public record.

    Scott
