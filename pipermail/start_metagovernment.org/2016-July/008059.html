<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Speaking abstractly, there are two competing decision system 
design patterns through which to effect direct democracy:

propose -&gt; vote
propose recursively (nobody votes)

 &gt;Scott&gt; I think the last Vilfredo round we did was a pretty convincing 
demonstration of why that, or any other recursive or consensus based 
system, is not viable for population-scale decisionmaking. It's simply 
too inefficient.

Ned&gt; It is hard to know where to start with this one. (So many points, 
so little time ...)

     1. First, to me that last Vilfredo round certainly was NOT a 
demonstration that recursive proposing is not viable for 
population-scale decision-making. When we reach the testing phase, 
Blinap will beat the socks off of Matchsys, specifically with respect to 
any and all measures of efficiency of population-scale decision-making. 
(You beat your chest, I beat my chest. I sure will be glad when we 
finally get to the testing phase.)
     2. Vilfredo is a team tool, not a tool for population-scale 
decision-making. In my view, Vilfredo (as a team tool) performed 
admirably (I was impressed), and was not in any way responsible for the 
fact that the team of participants happened to be a herd of cats. I 
would not hesitate to employ Vilfredo again in future Mission:Impossible 
situations such as that one. What you see as inefficiency I see as us 
learning thoroughly that we (the members of the team) were not even 
close to being &quot;on the same page&quot;.
     3. You appear to have a peculiar idea of what constitutes efficient 
population-scale decision-making. Making a single global-scale decision 
through Matchsys puts 6 billion people to work to make that single 
decision. If we say that the living wage cost of that participation is 
$1 for each individual, that puts the living-wage cost at $6 billion for 
that single decision. And, the quality of the decision will be that 
which $1 buys -- poor quality. Matchsys pays $6 billion for each $1 
decision. That does not seem to me to be very efficient decision-making. 
(In testing, Blinap will beat the socks off of Matchsys, with respect to 
both measures of efficiency and measures of decision quality.)
