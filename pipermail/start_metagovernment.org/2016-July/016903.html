</I>
Note that liquid democracy is actually a particular form of delegate
or proxy-based direct democracy. It allows redelegation (recursion)
which other proposed systems (e.g., the Matchsys) specifically
prohibit (In my case because I believe it doesn't solve the core
problem which is that representatives/delegates/proxies don't vote
like the individual would if all have the same information. Once you
get two or three levels removed, all bets are off as to the
psychological profile of the person who ends up determining your
vote).

&gt;<i> Participation (at least at the vote stage is strictly enforced)
</I>
This sounds like a religious argument (i.e., one not based on the
facts, but instead on principle). I would have thought this
inconsistent with the charter of Metagovernment which I believed to be
based on scientific principles (i.e., based on what works, rather than
some essentially arbitrary rule). The core problem with representative
democracy isn't that people don't participate in every decision, it's
that the representatives are psychologically unlike the people they
represent and so their votes don't match the &quot;will of the people&quot;. If
we can find a way to actually tap the latter that is efficient enough
to get full (or nearly full) participation, *that* is the system we
must choose, religious preferences be damned. Requiring individual
participation, particularly in any sort of grueling &quot;consensus&quot; based
system (including both Airesis and Vilfredo), is a non starter because
participation rates are just too low (IMHO it's actually worse than
that, because besides low participation there is something different
about the *kinds* of people who continue to participate, which is
exactly the same core problem representative democracy has).

&gt;<i> If you want to vote what your leader is telling you to do without a critical
</I>&gt;<i> mind that mean that you did not understand direct democracy.
</I>
Again a religious argument: People are not interested in arbitrary
philosophical rules, they just want a government that works.

&gt;<i> If you want to vote on the subject matter what the expert of your reference
</I>&gt;<i> is telling you to do this still direct democracy well enforced.
</I>&gt;<i> Delegation is the sickness of democracy!
</I>
You've misdiagnosed the problem IMHO. Now one *could* make the
argument that there is something *else* wrong with a proxy-based
system (e.g., that delegating causes people to not follow the laws
because &quot;they were made by someone else&quot;). But you didn't make that
argument. I also think that's a pretty weak argument because as long
as the individual retains the right to override their delegate's vote
they *are* taking responsibility for the results.
