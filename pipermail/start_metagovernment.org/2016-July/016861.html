</I>&gt;<i> Got two different versions of this message. I picked this one to respond to...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; As long as you will want to solve all world problems, and include small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions in your project you will always fail!
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Did Tesla start out making a two wheeled car, or Apple a phone
</I>&gt;<i> that only did talk and text? When designing a product you have to
</I>&gt;<i> analyse what the market needs and will accept, then scale your product
</I>&gt;<i> (and your organizations capabilities) to match.
</I>-&gt;  Wrong example.
Musk invested some billion dollars in Tesla, do you have some billions 
of dollars to invest?
Apple invested some billion dollars in the Iphone, do you have some 
billions of dollars to invest?
&gt;&gt;<i> Look at the other projects, see how they failed and try to understand why
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO most fail not because they were too ambitious but because they're
</I>&gt;<i> too timid. Loomio in particular I think has put themselves in a
</I>&gt;<i> straightjacket by failing to claim their product is a viable form of
</I>&gt;<i> government that was designed to *replace* existing organizations not
</I>&gt;<i> just augment them (e.g., it ought to already be possible to replace an
</I>&gt;<i> HOA board with Loomio group, yet they don't even seem to have an
</I>&gt;<i> example of anyone having done that yet).
</I>-&gt; ?? I dont understand

&gt;<i> I think it's even more important to study systems that succeeded but
</I>&gt;<i> then went off the rails. For example, Marx created a very elegant and
</I>&gt;<i> egalitarian system, only to have his design languish for decades,
</I>&gt;<i> mostly because people thought it too difficult to implement (sounds
</I>&gt;<i> like you: &quot;It will fail!&quot;). Unfortunately decades later a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians seeking to create a dictatorship seized on Marx's
</I>&gt;<i> ideas, but rather than implement them the way they were designed, used
</I>&gt;<i> them more like a marketing tool to convince people to get behind the
</I>&gt;<i> new system (which of course didn't work, partly because it was a bad
</I>&gt;<i> design (didn't match human nature) but mostly because it was
</I>&gt;<i> implemented wrong). Which tells me two things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Be careful: People will die as the result of a transition to a new
</I>&gt;<i> system and we can only hope to minimize the cost of the transition,
</I>&gt;<i> not eliminate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Be complete: If you leave a lot of stuff underdefined (as Marx did)
</I>&gt;<i> some jerk like Lenin will come along and fill in the holes with his
</I>&gt;<i> own mostly SDAP preferences. We *do* have to consider what our
</I>&gt;<i> existing political establishment will think of our systems and how
</I>&gt;<i> they will fight against them. That includes having a strategy that not
</I>&gt;<i> only pisses off the lawyers, but also pits most of the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> population against them.
</I>-&gt; Again
Wrong example
It took some 70 years from the publication of the Communist manifesto to 
the October revolution
If you have some 70 years of work to give please go ahead
&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt; Again, complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You do not need to create a responsive site that works with Ipad Iphone etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is a difficult thing to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if you have money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should be working only with a common laptop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This should be more than enough at the beginning
</I>&gt;<i> Again, that's the Tesla motorcycle. You have to design for what the
</I>&gt;<i> market wants, and they don't want a laptop-only app anymore. In fact
</I>&gt;<i> in this market, I'd drop the laptop and *only* support phones if a
</I>&gt;<i> choice had to be made (at least in the US, apps are already twice the
</I>&gt;<i> market share of web for advertising, meaning that's where people are
</I>&gt;<i> spending at least 2/3 of their time)
</I>-&gt;  You have to give the market the product they want
Exactly
No one in the market today needs or wants matchism nor Bitglub
This is why they fail
&gt;&gt;<i> -&gt;  Move-on is one of the few platform that achieved SOMETHING
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is somehow having a small impact on the system
</I>&gt;<i> Small to insignificant. Half the things Avaaz and MoveOn promote don't
</I>&gt;<i> pass, and most of the rest would have passed without their
</I>&gt;<i> participation at all. As a social engineer I can't make the claim
</I>&gt;<i> these organizations have no value: They reduce stress by giving people
</I>&gt;<i> the *feeling* they're making a difference in the world, even though
</I>&gt;<i> objectively there is no significant positive effect and there are
</I>&gt;<i> likely significant negative effects. Although this stress-reduction is
</I>&gt;<i> a positive benefit, it's more like the effect of drugs (including
</I>&gt;<i> alcohol), giving to charity, going to church, etc. and so shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> considered as a way to make a positive contribution to the operation
</I>&gt;<i> of the government or society in general.
</I>-&gt; Small to insignificant????
Funneling thousands of people into supporting a joint action is 
insignificant?
Please let us know what YOU have done better than them
Thanks
&gt;&gt;<i> I do not understand where they would be siphoning energy away from since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone can build a better platform if we want
</I>&gt;<i> And will all those millions of Avaaz and MoveOn contributors use it,
</I>&gt;<i> or will they decide that they already have an outlet that allows them
</I>&gt;<i> to make a contribution and so ignore anything controversial or hard to
</I>&gt;<i> learn or use? My guess is that the vast majority will do the latter,
</I>&gt;<i> which means that Avaaz and MoveOn are actually an impediment to
</I>&gt;<i> changing our political systems.
</I>As said, the sea is big
If you can do something better than them, instead of criticize go ahead
&gt;&gt;<i> And no one has been as successful as MoveOn if I may..
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Move On strenghtening the oligarchies? Are you serious?
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely: By deferring to them (&quot;Oh, please please please do just
</I>&gt;<i> this one little thing for us!&quot;) they actually reinforce the perception
</I>&gt;<i> that we The People are weak and that we do not have the power to
</I>&gt;<i> override the oligarchs. That's just wrong and definitely part of the
</I>&gt;<i> problem rather than part of the solution.
</I>What?
Deferring to the oligarchs by using MoveOn?
&gt;<i> We of course must put disclaimers on our designs and our prototype
</I>&gt;<i> systems that clearly indicate that they're not ready to run the world
</I>&gt;<i> yet, but we must also make it clear that that's what they're
</I>&gt;<i> *designed* to do and that it is inevitable that eventually they will.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>When someone speaks about running the world I always remember

Hehe
