&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo, you are entirely set up at this point to run an experiment that
</I>&gt;<i> can potentially falsify my empirical claim that 2 or 3 direct democratic
</I>&gt;<i> decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly influence a
</I>&gt;<i> population-scale social system. Unlike myself and Scott and Matteo, you have
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary software already up and running (Airesis). To run the
</I>&gt;<i> experiment (which is not &quot;just&quot; an experiment -- if the procedure goes well,
</I>&gt;<i> your efforts will do great good for Italy, and for the world as proof of
</I>&gt;<i> concept) you would start putting up &quot;Make Italy Better&quot; proposals, one after
</I>&gt;<i> another, on Airesis. (Since you will want the proposals to remain available
</I>&gt;<i> for both modification and for voting for an extended period, you may have to
</I>&gt;<i> tweak some of the proposal parameters.)
</I>
While I agree that such an experiment is worth doing, I must express a
high level of skepticism that it will amount to much unless Jacopo has
a large stash of resources hidden away that I haven't heard about. As
I study how these kinds of viral expansions work it occurs to me that
the quality of the proposals is actually *more* important than the
quality of the UI used to evaluate and vote on them. Exhibit A for
this situation is FaceBook, which IMHO still has a terrible UI for
what it does, and yet people find the content compelling enough to
overlook that. The problem for us is that public policy proposals tend
not to be as interesting, and that they have to be written in such a
way that they're actually implementable and legally enforceable.
Unless you happen to come across a lawyer who also possesses the
talents of a technical writer *and* the ability to popularize politics
(e.g., like Carl Sagan or Bill Nye or Neil deGrasse Tyson have done
for science education) *and* really wants to work on this, it's going
to be really tough to get enough people interested in the proposals
for it to grow like it needs to.

&gt;<i> To the extent that the quality of the proposals is high enough, people will
</I>&gt;<i> be attracted to participate (as proposers and/or simply as voters). The
</I>&gt;<i> proposals themselves are your advertisements. At the point that enough
</I>&gt;<i> people are participating, you will be able to start putting the proposals on
</I>&gt;<i> official ballots. (Airesis can handle proposing independently, and can
</I>&gt;<i> stockpile the proposals until enough people are involved to meet the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;signatures required&quot; to start putting them on official ballots.)
</I>
Again, I think the odds that Joe Sixpack and his crew are going to be
able to create and refine proposals that will be both legally sound
*and* compelling to the average voter are close to zero. IMHO the
problem with our current system is that people don't even get to
*vote* on the proposals, not that each and everyone's pet concern
doesn't end up being covered by some proposal.

&gt;<i> I really think that this experiment is definitely worth running, and that
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis is the best software available that I have seen to use in running
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Does Airesis run as an app? And does it support text messaging (both
in and out)? I'm thinking these two things will be necessary
components of a true &quot;people's voting system&quot;. The app will be
necessary for people that actually want to rate and comment on
proposals, the SMS support necessary for the casual user to vote
without having to go to a web page to do it (I'm no wiz at smartphones
but even I know to avoid anything that runs in a browser because that
means it's slow, memory intensive (i.e., swaps all my other apps out
such they have to restart), and likely to be hard to use because it
was designed to work on a PC rather than on a phone).

   Scott
