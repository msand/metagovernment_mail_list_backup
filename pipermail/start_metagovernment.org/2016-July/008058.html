<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; Your design is a variation of the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design 
pattern. I see no reason to think that it will work any better than any 
of the other variations of that design pattern. At population scale, all 
of the variations bump into the &quot;Too Few Decisions&quot; problem: 2 or 3 
direct democracy decisions per week is not enough to manage or even 
significantly influence the operation of a population-scale social system.

 &gt;Scott&gt; Again, it's plenty if all you need to do is make regulatory 
decisions and a few personnel decisions (e.g., hiring the top-level 
manager, and firing someone at any level). I'll admit that it does rely 
pretty heavily on powerful and highly productive managers (the executive 
branch), but we already have those. For example I think both Bush and 
Obama have convincingly shown that the US President can get stuff done 
even when congress can't actually agree on *anything*. The fact that 
both made a great number of really bad decisions I think is because we 
chose the wrong people (i.e., we were limited to choosing among 
politicians rather than being able to select among qualified managers 
and social engineers), not because there's anything inherently wrong 
with having a powerful executive branch of government.

Ned&gt; There appears to be a flaw in your reasoning. You cannot count the 
decisions being made in a social system that is not working well to 
determine how many decisions will be made in a social system that does 
work well.

Instead, first you must put your social system test design into 
full-scale operation, and demonstrate that it works well. Then you count 
the number of decisions being made. And then you will have a basis for 
claiming that, in at least one instance, a social system that was 
working well was making that number of decisions as it did so.

You have not demonstrated that the Iteration#1 Matchism social system 
design will work well in full-scale operation. That is a fundamental 
fact. In order to falsify my claim that &quot;2 or 3 direct democracy 
decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly 
influence the operation of a population-scale social system&quot;, you must 
demonstrate (1) that the Matchism design works well in full-scale 
operation, and (2) that it does so while making no more than 2 or 3 
direct democracy decisions per week.
