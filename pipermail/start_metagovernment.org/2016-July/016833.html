Hi Ned

thank you for your answer

Here are my replies to your replies
1) in detail, &quot;t would be possible to write another list of grievances, 
just as long and substantive, focused on atrocities committed by 
multi-national corporations, and a third list focused on atrocities 
instigated by top capitalists (that effectively own both the 
corporations and the national governments). &quot;
-&gt; I do not think that corporations, alone and without any involvement 
with governments, have caused wars or disasters that top the ones caused 
by the Nazis, the Stalinists and the US+UK govts, for example
Still, when they caused many many victims, it was mainly as governments 
failed to supervise (esample: <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster</A>)
2)   I dont think public govts, corporations and top capitalists make 
tens of millions of public-matter decisions per year!!
I think you are off by several orders of magnitude
In 2015, the US government passed some 100 major laws in 2015
A state like Oregon a handful of bills
<A HREF="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/what_new_laws_passed_in_the_le.html">http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/what_new_laws_passed_in_the_le.html</A>
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acts_of_the_114th_United_States_Congress">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_acts_of_the_114th_United_States_Congress</A>
Most decisions take by corporations are only internal
I do not understand where you got the notion that tens of millions of 
public-matter decisions per year are taken, unless you consider very 
minor decisions as important..
3)  I think you are overtly optimistic if you think that the public at 
large can focus on 2-3 decisions per week!
I bet most people will not focus on 2-3 decisions per year.
This is why we need delegation, to help people who co not have time get 
involved with delegation
As there is still a minority of the people who DO care and they can work 
on the laws and the process, as known
4)  I would be ecstatically happy if people were to pass 2-3 new laws on 
important issues per week!
In fact, I would be still happy if people were to pass 2-3 new laws on 
important issues per month!
And I think 2-3 new laws per month would have an enormous impact on 
public life assumingly
Imagine:
January 2016: decisions on same-sex marriage, gay in the military and 
Iranian nuclear deal done
This alone would wipe out 50% of the public discussion and on politician 
excuses not to focus on real matters
February 2016: decision on war in Afghanistan, support for Isis or not
This alone would clear up much of the discussion on US foreign policy
And we are still at the 28th of February!!
Could you imagine what could be achieved after one year?
5)  I totally disagree that &quot;sensible people&quot; would not get involved on 
important issues as there are too many people vote.
Quite the opposite.
There are still 50% - 60% of people and more that go to vote at the 
elections
Many of them are among the most sensible
Statistics show that people with higher education are more likely to get 
involved in activism

Most of activism today comes from college students

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> National governments and multi-national corporations and top

</I>&gt;<i> (decisions that affect the public). The decisions that produce the 
</I>&gt;<i> atrocities are among those tens of millions. (Not all of the decisions 
</I>&gt;<i> produce atrocities, but reliably filtering out those that do requires 
</I>&gt;<i> passing *all* of the decisions through the direct democracy filter.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The attention of the entire population of the earth can be focused on 
</I>&gt;<i> (at most) only 2 or 3 proposals per week (according to Scott's guess 
</I>&gt;<i> -- in practice, no population in history has ever come anywhere near 
</I>&gt;<i> that many full-quorum direct democracy decisions-per-week). Focusing 
</I>&gt;<i> the attention of the entire population of the earth on those 2 or 3 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals then leaves all of the other millions of public-matter 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions per week entirely free to be made by government-body 
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top capitalists, without 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals of the general public having any formal role in the actual 
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main purpose of population-scale voting (from the perspective of 
</I>&gt;<i> the elites) is to give individual citizens the illegitimate feeling 
</I>&gt;<i> that they are making a difference, when in fact their contribution (as 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals and as a body) is so minuscule as to be negligible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking abstractly, there are two competing decision system design 
</I>&gt;<i> patterns through which to effect direct democracy:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * propose -&gt; vote
</I>&gt;<i>  * propose recursively (nobody votes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your design is a variation of the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern. I 
</I>&gt;<i> see no reason to think that it will work any better than any of the 
</I>&gt;<i> other variations of that design pattern. At population scale, all of 
</I>&gt;<i> the variations bump into the &quot;Too Few Decisions&quot; problem: 2 or 3 
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy decisions per week is not enough to manage or even 
</I>&gt;<i> significantly influence the operation of a population-scale social 
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*Note on nested jurisdictions*: When an individual chooses to focus 
</I>&gt;<i> on 2 or 3 local matters in a particular week rather than on global 
</I>&gt;<i> matters, that reduces the &quot;sheer numbers&quot; that are available to make 
</I>&gt;<i> those 2 or 3 decisions at the global level that week. Since sensible 
</I>&gt;<i> people will understand that casting 1 vote of thousands on an issue 
</I>&gt;<i> has greater effect than casting 1 vote of billions on an issue, 
</I>&gt;<i> sensible individuals will be inclined to focus on local matters more 
</I>&gt;<i> than global matters. This will reduce the number of decisions per week 
</I>&gt;<i> that can be made at the global level, thereby exacerbating the already 
</I>&gt;<i> fatal problem that 2 or 3 global decisions per week is not enough to 
</I>&gt;<i> manage or even significantly influence the operation of a global 
</I>&gt;<i> social system.)
