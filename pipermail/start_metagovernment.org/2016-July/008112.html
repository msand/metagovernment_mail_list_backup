<PRE>  &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; In that testing [phase], the Blinap design will indeed be found 
to be capable of making millions of decisions per week: democratically, 
reliably, efficiently, affordably, transparently, and quickly. You'll 
see. (This is me competitively beating my chest.)

  &gt;Scott&gt; I have no doubt that what you propose can be done. But I 
understand both human nature and statistics and so I'm not the one you 
have to convince.

Ned&gt; (&quot;But I understand both human nature and statistics ...&quot; -- now 
*that* is some serious chest-beating!)

You have just been telling Matteo that you consider Avaaz and MoveOn to 
be actually impediments to changing our global social system for the 
better. From my perspective, Matchism/Matchsys as presented in the 
current Matchism Manifesto would be just as much an impediment to the 
extent that it gained popular traction. So, actually 
(Mission:Impossible), you *are* one of the ones that I have to convince.

But: I don't think that you should be convinced by *just* my superior 
chest-beating. I think that it is important that you go ahead and *test* 
your designs, and then be convinced by the test results. However 
superior my chest-beating may be, it is still just chest-beating.

As for who else I need to convince, I am at this point *not* interested 
in convincing the general public that the Isonomea/Blinap design should 
be installed for production use at population scale &quot;right now!&quot;

Rather, I am interested in convincing funders and software developers 
and potential test subjects that &quot;we&quot; should focus all of our limited 
resources on building a globally available social systems laboratory, in 
which prototype social systems and sub-systems of all sorts can be 
assembled and realistically tested. We need to start studying social 
systems *experimentally*, which can only be done harmlessly in the lab.

  &gt;Scott&gt; I submit that no revolution has ever occurred that *didn't* go 
through this [competitive chest-beating] phase, and usually for many years.

Ned&gt; I have no interest in starting a political revolution. (I consider 
&quot;render obsolete&quot; to be a much more responsible strategy-for-change than 
&quot;overthrow and replace&quot;.)

Rather, I am advocating that we build the social systems laboratory as 
the means through which to turn the study of population-scale social 
systems into a hard science, and a competent field of engineering.

  &gt;Scott&gt; Discussing your ideas proposals in public is by far the best 
way to discover where the holes are, and which features resonate with 
others.

Ned&gt; Just discussing social system design ideas reaches the point of 
diminishing returns pretty quickly. Social system design ideas need to 
be realistically *tested*.

*Testing* is by far the best way to discover where the holes are.

As for &quot;which features resonate with others&quot;, first we need to find out 
which features actually work. That is a science/engineering question, 
not a touchy-feely &quot;which features resonate with others&quot; question.

  &gt;Scott&gt; As for citing literature, although I generally agree that most 
great products have a single visionary at their core, none of us are 
working in a vacuum here and there are &quot;shoulders of giants&quot; available 
to stand on. If you're not going to take advantage of them, I think 
you're putting yourself at a severe disadvantage to those of us who do.

Ned&gt; Honestly, if the Iteration#1 Matchism design were a lot better than 
it is, and the Matchism implementation plan were a lot better than it 
is, then I would recognize that you had a basis for claiming that all of 
the literature that you have read has done you some good with respect to 
designing and planning. But as it is, the quality of the design and plan 
do not support that claim. In testing, my guess is that the design and 
the plan will not do well.

In the larger literature, there are very few indeed that have been able 
to find a way to approach the study of population-scale social systems 
experimentally. As a practical matter, that can only be done 
*responsibly* in the lab (which we don't have yet). Putting lives at 
risk to run social system experiments at population scale is something 
that only people such as Stalin and Mao do. (With respect to Matchism, 
please don't be those guys. We need testing and understanding before we 
seek popularity.)
