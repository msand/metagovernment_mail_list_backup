&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have made a small tour through sciences. While reading some thick systems
</I>&gt;<i> methodology book (P&#345;emysl Jan&#237;&#269;ek, 2014) I realized that we actually try to
</I>&gt;<i> engineer a humanistic system or systems. Humanism as a value system. System
</I>&gt;<i> methodology as methodology. Right?
</I>
I consider this putting the cart before the horse: You can't design a
value system without first having not only really good idea of human
instincts and preferences but also the *distribution* of these
features in a population. Otherwise you end up with what he have now:
Values systems &quot;designed&quot; by amateur social engineers whose biases
certainly do not reflect those of the population as a whole. Indeed
even our current &quot;weighted democracies&quot; are a poor tool for doing this
sort of design, though I do agree with democratic principles in
general: IMHO the new value system will be an emergent phenomenon and
not something that someone designs up front (i.e., it's not really
engineering but more like setting up an environment where evolution
can occur and then providing a mechanism for preferential selection of
the characteristics that demonstrably best match humans).

&gt;<i> Btw. is social engineering the same as soft system engineering ?
</I>
There is some overlap, but soft system engineering and other types
organizational engineering focuses on mechanisms rather than on the
personality characteristics of the humans, whereas the latter is (or
at least should be) the primary focus of social engineering.
Organizational engineering, like organizational psychology, is also
extremely limited in scope, whereas social engineering applies at all
levels and all environments.

&gt;<i> Also started reading some sociobiology - Biosocial interactions in
</I>&gt;<i> modernisation (Cliquet), but I am not sure about the approach, it seems to
</I>&gt;<i> be a lot about maladaptations, while I was more interested in
</I>&gt;<i> sociobiological human needs.
</I>
I'd encourage you to examine your biases: Every personality
characteristic everyone has is a &quot;maladaptation&quot;, depending on the
environment they're operating in. The trick is not to try to ignore
those characteristics and environments, but to design the system such
that it functions properly *in spite of* this messiness. In particular
I'd highly recommend the literature on psychopath/sociopaths, who have
a highly significant impact on society despite being a very small
percentage of the population. Dutton 2012 &quot;The Wisdom of Psychopaths&quot;
is good, for example. If your proposed systems (values, government,
economic, etc.) doesn't account for the way psychopaths attempt (and
often succeed) at gaming the system, it's doomed to failure. Even
better, psychopathy, like autism and most other personality
characteristics is not an all-or-none thing, it's a continuum: We all
display these characteristics to varying degrees depending on the
context we're operating in.

&gt;<i> Do you know some book that is more about
</I>&gt;<i> sociobilogical human needs?
</I>
Unfortunately no. I recommend Walsh's works on Biosociology because he
takes an unconventional approach to the subject, but even that is,
like you say, more about maladaptation than what would be most useful
for someone looking for a survey of human characteristics that need to
be accounted for when designing social/governmental/economic systems.
I've had a stab at this with my list of Clinations
(www.matchism.org/clinations/) but that's pretty much just an outline
whereas an entire book could be (and I would argue *should be*)
written on the subject.
  Regards,
    Scott
