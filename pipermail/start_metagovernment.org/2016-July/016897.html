Perhaps. But I'm a bit of a collector of techniques for gaming the
system, and I've got such a large collection by now that perhaps I
over plan to prevent it from happening with my proposed system. In
this example, there are multiple fears, even if to start with the
system does allow any vote to be done directly (overriding
proxies/delegates):

1) Once people get comfortable with the operation of the system,
they'll tend to go back to sleep and not even necessarily pay
attention to individual votes. Distributing the responsibility for the
outcome across as many individuals as possible makes it that much
harder for a small group to take over. The degenerate case of
unlimited proxies is that half the people grant their proxy to Rush
Limbaugh and the other half to Bernie Sanders (or half each to
Republican and Democrat parties, if virtual delegates were allowed).
The same could happen as an emergent phenomenon if delegation allows
recursion (mine doesn't, instead it computes a weighted average of
multiple delegate's votes to handle the situation where some of them
may not vote on a given proposal).

2) If people are asleep, a small faction could then vote to change the
operation of the system. This is keeping in mind that 88% of the votes
in 1934 Germany were to elect Hitler as dictator, a vote that
unfortunately they couldn't undo because Hitler, being dictator,
promptly changed the rules.

&gt;<i> I am assuming that a typical person is reasonable in thinking that most people around are not his enemy. An average person will entrust his body to a doctor even though he has very little knowledge of medicine. Same with statistics: probably most people know someone who is more or less OK with math and can confirm that the system of checks is sound.
</I>&gt;<i>

A point for Ned's system, then. And I agree that people *should*
probably act this way, but realize that often they don't. Rejection of
science is all too common (on climate change, fracking, GMOs, etc. are
just the current examples). My prediction is that people are going to
be even less trusting that a new server-based system isn't going to
jerk them around.

&gt;&gt;<i> The bigger problem, though, is hacking: We can't have a system that collapses if all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> data in it gets stolen and published.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this should be just stated honestly upfront that there is a chance that the system will be hacked. Please be aware of it! Bad things happen from time to time. Still better than 100% publicity. And I am personally do not care, I am not embarrassed of my choices and can explain every one of them. I just think many people do care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't have a problem with a certain amount of security through
obscurity: The data shouldn't just be handed to anyone asks fully
digested. Just give them the raw data (id numbers instead of names,
etc.)  And I think we should make dropping dox a taboo (e.g., matching
a persons screen name to their real name and then publishing that
info). But for those who are really paranoid, I still say our best bet
is to allow them to rely on personality-matched proxies so that they
can't be held directly responsible for their vote. That way only the
early voters (who become eligible to be proxies) have to actually
commit to having their votes completely unobscured.

    Scott
