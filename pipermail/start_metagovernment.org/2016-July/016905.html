<PRE>This scientific paper explains why a mixture (hybrid) of the so called pure direct democracy and representative democracy is strictly better than either of them: <A HREF="http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/proxy.pdf">http://inside.bard.edu/~armytage/proxy.pdf</A>
&gt;<i> If you want to vote what your leader is telling you to do without a critical mind that mean that you did not understand direct democracy.&gt; Delegation is the sickness of democracy!
</I>Those, who make such claims, probably do not understand what (an optional) delegation is.

to whom it may concernAiresis and the analist behind it do NOT consider proxy voting,&#160;known as liquid democracy a viable solution.Participation (at least at the vote stage is strictly enforced)If you want to vote what your leader is telling you to do without a critical mind that mean that you did not understand direct democracy.If you want to vote on the subject matter what the expert of your reference is telling you to do this still direct democracy well enforced.Delegation is the sickness of democracy!

I meant contributing here. As for Airesis I agree that it's
unfortunate that it is having trouble getting funded, but it's also
true that it wasn't really my cup of tea either which is why I never
could get too motivated to even use it, let alone contribute to it. I
liked Loomio better, at least at first, but believe that it too has
too many fundamental flaws to be salvageable now.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their votes over to him and then uses that &quot;authority&quot; to get that

</I>&gt;<i> Delegation can be changed easily at any time. From what you said, that even
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian voters won't want to get their hands dirty, doesn't it mean
</I>&gt;<i> there is no problem. I do not consider irreversible scenarios here.
</I>&gt;<i> Introducing caps may also be an option worth considering, though 1% seems to
</I>&gt;<i> harsh for me.
</I>
Seems almost too generous to me. For example, it's already larger than
the size of the government in some Localities, which could lead to
government governing itself if it could convince people to transfer
their votes to government employees (openly or perhaps by some
subterfuge). But one reason I hedge is because I don't really have a
sense of how many early voters (who by voting early become potential
proxies) there will be. If there aren't enough, we may have to allow
each to carry more of the votes.

&gt;&gt;<i> There is unfortunately no progressive counter-weight to this phenomenon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g., Elizabeth Warren won't even *ask* for your vote).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not, if this will be very easy to do?
</I>
Demagoguery is just not in the liberal/progressive playbook (Bernie
Sanders notwithstanding ;-)&#160; That is, even if they do make themselves
available to represent you, it'll be done so nicely and
non-confrontationally that it won't generate anywhere near the same
results as when the authoritarians do it.

&gt;&gt;<i> The second reason is verifyability (nothing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do with delegation): Votes need to be open so that everyone can go in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and verify that their vote was properly recorded and so that anyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can redo the count using all of the voting information because it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a public record.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two things need to be verifiable:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) That votes of any real voter are counted, it has to be verifiable but
</I>&gt;<i> that voter. This is easy.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> 2) That votes only come from real voters. That requires some removal of
</I>&gt;<i> privacy, but it can be done reliably by random checks, so that a probability
</I>&gt;<i> of the record exposure is small, say 0.1% in a life time.
</I>
As I was saying with Ned's system, this requires faith in statistics
that I think most people living now don't have. The bigger problem,
though, is hacking: We can't have a system that collapses if all the
data in it gets stolen and published. I think we need to publish the
data directly to avoid the possibility of being held hostage by it.
This also means that dropping dox will also be removed as a threat,
albeit at the cost that some voters will simply refuse to participate
because they fear revealing their positions (although being able to
vote by proxy I think is a good counter to that). How big a problem
this is I don't know yet, but am concerned that many (most?)
newspapers have already dropped their on-line opinion forums because
the anonymous trolls have taken over them. Why they don't just insist
on real names, I'm not sure, but suspect it's because they have
misjudged the situation by assuming that the trolls insistence on
anonymity is a position shared by the neurotypicals (and I'm quite
sure that it isn't).
