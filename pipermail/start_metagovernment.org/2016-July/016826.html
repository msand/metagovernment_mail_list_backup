Seems like we have no choice. But this is all the more reason why the

new system must be designed to allow regular updates as new

information becomes available and the population's values shift as a

result. There's also a section on this &quot;moral progressivism&quot; on

matchism.com. The trick is not to get attached to any particular value

because *everything* must be subject to examination and change.





There is a reason why to start with humanism as a desingn for the process. It is because only humans have politics.

Let us imagine that dolphins will become for some reasons capable of politics, then it will be quite appropriate to have a salt water pool, etc.  in every decision facility.

Humanism is dead, long live the human-dolphinism.





Along these lines, another book I recommend to help extricate oneself

from the zeitgeist and one's gut feelings is Dawkins' &quot;The Selfish

Gene&quot;. Not that it has much to say about public policy, but that it

provides a strong justification that the sources we have been using

for designing public policy, particularly our &quot;gut feelings&quot;, are

inappropriate for this purpose. Most of those things came into being

merely because they facilitated the propagation of genes, not because

they are somehow a good fit for designing a society that matches our

current needs. I'm (slowly) working on a new section for the Matchism

manifesto on this &quot;new covenant&quot; for decisionmaking.





I have read that :) Thank you anyway, maybe I will reread that.



&gt;<i> Sure, there is a risk that I apply my values too extensively, I will try to
</I>
&gt;<i> eliminate it. I am free to talk about those values.
</I>


I've toyed with the idea of actually labeling the sources used when

making a social engineering design decision, whether they be

best-guess placeholders as you describe, based on experimental data,

based on observational data, based on popular wisdom (&quot;everybody knows

that ...&quot;), or based on prescriptions from amateur social engineers

(religious texts, etc.). Doing this would give us some sort of

confidence interval for each policy decision which might make some of

them easier to revisit.





That will be systematic. I will consider doing the same.



About psychopaths, I am in the middle of the book . Just a few quick ideas, that seem as a solution to me: Provide effective decision-making. Make sure the legitimate decisions are respected. Make the game repetitive.

For the game to be repetitive other players do have to remember them. That means a small stable group IMHO. As much as I remember system science recommends the same - short feedback loops. True?

Scott
