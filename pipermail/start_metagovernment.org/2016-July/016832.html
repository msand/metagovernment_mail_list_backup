<PRE>Dear Ned I see the decision at the national level made by the italian
parliament in 2016, an average of 3-4 per month of wich at the end inwill
be interested to give my say at only 2 for this year.
For example few of the vote where on the ratification of treaties with
neighbourhood countries. I will not be interested. But in the next few days
there will be the vote on legalization of cannabis. I will be definitely
interested to vote it.
Regionally and locally there will be few that will interest me, I believe
that if a participation system will be in place, i will be easily notified
by a &quot;smart&quot; fuzzy logic  program.
Regarding top capitalist decisions... at the end the decisions are made at
gov level therefore if my interest are at stake for sure I will easily take
a stance if necessary. Please tell me why I should be involved to take a
stance in a decision where I do not care the outcome.
I will be interested to hear Scott's critics on this.
Peace jacopo

(This is in response to Matteo's Direct Democracy Document. It also applies
to Iteration#1 of the Matchism design.)

You have focused in your list of 75 grievances mostly on atrocities
committed by national governments. It would be possible to write another
list of grievances, just as long and substantive, focused on atrocities
committed by multi-national corporations, and a third list focused on
atrocities instigated by top capitalists (that effectively own both the
corporations and the national governments).

National governments and multi-national corporations and top capitalists
make tens of millions of public-matter decisions per year (decisions that
affect the public). The decisions that produce the atrocities are among
those tens of millions. (Not all of the decisions produce atrocities, but
reliably filtering out those that do requires passing *all* of the
decisions through the direct democracy filter.)

The attention of the entire population of the earth can be focused on (at
most) only 2 or 3 proposals per week (according to Scott's guess -- in
practice, no population in history has ever come anywhere near that many
full-quorum direct democracy decisions-per-week). Focusing the attention of
the entire population of the earth on those 2 or 3 proposals then leaves
all of the other millions of public-matter decisions per week entirely free
to be made by government-body hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top
capitalists, without individuals of the general public having any formal
role in the actual decision-making at all.

The main purpose of population-scale voting (from the perspective of the
elites) is to give individual citizens the illegitimate feeling that they
are making a difference, when in fact their contribution (as individuals
and as a body) is so minuscule as to be negligible.

Speaking abstractly, there are two competing decision system design
patterns through which to effect direct democracy:

   - propose -&gt; vote
   - propose recursively (nobody votes)


Your design is a variation of the &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern. I see
no reason to think that it will work any better than any of the other
variations of that design pattern. At population scale, all of the
variations bump into the &quot;Too Few Decisions&quot; problem: 2 or 3 direct
democracy decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly
influence the operation of a population-scale social system.

(*Note on nested jurisdictions*: When an individual chooses to focus on 2
or 3 local matters in a particular week rather than on global matters, that
reduces the &quot;sheer numbers&quot; that are available to make those 2 or 3
decisions at the global level that week. Since sensible people will
understand that casting 1 vote of thousands on an issue has greater effect
than casting 1 vote of billions on an issue, sensible individuals will be
inclined to focus on local matters more than global matters. This will
reduce the number of decisions per week that can be made at the global
level, thereby exacerbating the already fatal problem that 2 or 3 global
decisions per week is not enough to manage or even significantly influence
the operation of a global social system.)
