LOL! Talk about the pot calling the kettle black! Did you even get 30
pages into the Matchism manifesto? Sounded to me like maybe only 1 or
2...
-&gt; &#160;I did read only 3-4 pages, then I gave up when I understood Matchism is bound to failBut when there is even a tiny possibility of success, I always try to helpLike I did with other software platformsLike I would do for Matchism and other

Wrong: They rationally spend time enjoying themselves because they
*can't* do anything about Afghanistan. You'd probably have them be
depressed or furiously creating and voting on petitions on Avaaz or
MoveOn, but that's just incompetent social engineering. Give them
actual power, though, and you'll see a different outcome...
-&gt; &#160;??????????????On which planet are you living?People can not do anything to avoid wars waged by their own governments?Is this what you are saying?
&gt;<i> -&gt; The only irrational thing here is your failure to understand that you can

</I>&gt;<i> not exclude the other
</I>
The English cliche for this is &quot;having your cake and eating it too&quot;.
People have very limited bandwidth available for these things: If you
try to solve everything at once, the system breaks down, the SDAPs
(who like doing these kind of things) take over, and the situation
either doesn't improve or gets worse. If you prioritize, though, you
end up having to solve gun and car deaths (and starvation and disease
and a whole host of other things) *long* before you have to even think
about a few thousand people getting killed by terrorists (or as
terrorists).
-&gt; Let alone that guns and car deaths have high priority on my listI beg to notice that it was me who said we can solve guns and car deaths, not you
&gt;<i> -&gt;&#160; I never said that people are stupid
</I>&gt;<i> I have just said that you cant vote out a government anytime

</I>
You say they're not stupid, then you say they'll do something stupid
if you give them power. Which is it?
-&gt; &#160;Never said such a thing
Anybody who has been a manager or run a small business knows that you
can't fire people just because they disappoint you from time to time.
I'm sure the rest of the population is smart enough to figure this out
too.
-&gt; This is why I was saying you cant vote a government out every two minutes
