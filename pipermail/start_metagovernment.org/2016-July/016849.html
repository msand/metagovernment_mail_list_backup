</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I will begin by noting that you did not respond to what I actually
</I>&gt;<i> said. Rather, you leaped to philosophy and to guesses about what I advocate.
</I>
Perhaps, and forgive me if I misrepresent your position, but I'm
working from memory since I don't have a copy of your current plan.
But I stand by my claim that Blinap is a collectivist system, albeit
sampling-based. Which I'm not going to argue is inherently bad, but
would argue is fundamentally incompatible with human nature: We're
competitive by nature, even within mostly collaborative groups (e.g.,
the bands of 30 or so individuals in our EEA past). Trying to suppress
all competition increases stress and so is poor social engineering
practice. People also insist on accountability which to my thinking
requires that *they* be involved in the decisions to the extent that
they can't just point fingers when things don't work out. Blinap
doesn't provide that, whereas a system that relies on a strong
executive branch with a regulatory control system above it does.

&gt;<i> (We really do need better software tools through which to work. Tangential
</I>&gt;<i> flights of fancy can be useful/valuable, if they are explicitly recognized
</I>&gt;<i> as such and usefully separated out and organized. Software can help with
</I>&gt;<i> that.)
</I>
Meh, it gets to be a problem for me when these kinds of conversations
go on for weeks, but that seldom happens. I've used all sorts of
collaboration software and frankly prefer email to all of them. I also
like the inherently permanent record and searchability of email,
something I find seriously lacking in other systems (particularly FB,
where you can say something incredibly stupid whenever you want with
full confidence that no one will ever be able to find it again a week
later).

&gt;<i> Do you agree/disagree that &quot;Focusing the attention of the entire population
</I>&gt;<i> of the earth on those 2 or 3 proposals then leaves all of the other millions
</I>&gt;<i> of public-matter decisions per week entirely free to be made by
</I>&gt;<i> government-body hierarchs, by corporate officers, and by top capitalists,
</I>&gt;<i> without *individuals* of the general public having any formal role in the
</I>&gt;<i> actual decision-making at all.&quot;? (And why, if you have a why.)
</I>
Sounds good to me, *provided* that I (we) can recall and override any
of these other decisions. I, like most students of political
philosophy, believe that &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; is the most efficient
form of government. I would go further in claiming that it is also the
most appropriate for human beings given human nature. The problem is
that up to this point it's been very difficult to enforce the
&quot;benevolent&quot; part, not that there's anything inherently wrong with the
&quot;dictator&quot; part.

&gt;<i> I agree that there are fundamental philosophical disagreements between us,
</I>&gt;<i> but those differences are not at all what you have posited. Applying old and
</I>&gt;<i> vague social system terms (such as &quot;collectivist economy&quot;) to new social
</I>&gt;<i> system designs that are nothing like the old designs really doesn't work --
</I>&gt;<i> it totally confuses people, and actually prevents them from seeing and
</I>&gt;<i> understanding the new design. That appears to have happened to you in this
</I>&gt;<i> instance.
</I>
While classification (e.g., stereotyping), can lead to bad
decisionmaking, I think I would find it useful to have a good way of
classifying Blinap in operation. While it has some aspects of
benevolent dictatorship (e.g., the system does the randomizing and the
valuation computation for proposals) I still think of it as primarily
a collectivist system, where even the infrastructure for production
belongs to everyone rather to specific individuals.

&gt;<i> The &quot;propose -&gt; vote&quot; design pattern sets up &quot;collectivist democracy&quot;: The
</I>&gt;<i> demos makes decisions as a single huge entity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In contrast, the &quot;propose recursively&quot; design pattern sets up &quot;individualist
</I>&gt;<i> democracy&quot;: Individuals and small teams participate in decision-making on
</I>&gt;<i> equal footing as autonomous, independent entities, interacting with one
</I>&gt;<i> another. The demos as a single huge entity plays no role in decision making.
</I>
Understood: A miracle of statistics.

&gt;<i> You have never seen &quot;individualist democracy&quot; successfully operating at
</I>&gt;<i> population scale. For whatever reasons, I suspect that you will never accept
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;individualist democracy&quot; can successfully operate at that scale until
</I>&gt;<i> you have seen at least one actual demonstration of it doing so. (Have I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned that I will be really glad when we get to the testing phase, and
</I>&gt;<i> past the competitive chest-beating phase?)
</I>
I'm still working on design, though. After that comes prototyping and
only *then* testing of an actual system that is capable of scaling to
global proportions. So it'll be, um, awhile before we get past this
arguing-about-principles phase.

&gt;<i> (You have also never seen &quot;collectivist democracy&quot; successfully operating at
</I>&gt;<i> population scale, but for some reason that does not seem to have convinced
</I>&gt;<i> you that it therefore cannot. You think that little tweaks such as switching
</I>&gt;<i> from representatives to proxies, and presenting concise, objective, unbiased
</I>&gt;<i> little blurbs at Point-Of-Vote can Save The Day.) (When we get to the
</I>&gt;<i> testing phase, we shall see whether that is indeed the case.)
</I>
Agreed: It's an empirical question. But one doesn't have to have a
full system implemented to have some insight about what people will
like (or even tolerate). If my work as a software engineer focusing on
UI development taught me anything, it's that *I* have to really like
something before there's even a chance that anyone else will. If I'm
forced to do something out of simple expediency or to meet marketing
or key customer expectations, it ends up getting changed in the next
release because everyone else will hate it too. So if *I* like a
system that allows me to override decisions made by my respective
Global and Local benevolent dictators, and provides me with JIT
information to help me make a good decision, I'm going to really like
that.

    Scott
