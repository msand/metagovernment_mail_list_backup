<PRE> &gt;&gt;Ned&gt; (Actually, the Blinap process in particular is intended to 
*make* every &quot;sufficiently consequential&quot; public-matter decision -- it 
does not just review decisions already made by other means. Blinap is 
intended to entirely displace (render obsolete) decision-making by 
national government-bodies and multi-national corporations and top 
capitalists.)

 &gt;Scott&gt; Understood, and by taking advantage of sampling theory, I even 
agree that it *could* even do this sufficiently efficiently to actually 
work.

Ned&gt; Blinap does not take advantage of sampling theory. The Blinap 
decision process does not attempt to sample any signals, nor is it 
intended to sample any signals. Blinap does not make use of sampling 
theory at all, in any way.

My question is, what has caused you to think that Blinap makes use of 
sampling theory? (I confess to being mystified. You will be doing me a 
great service if you can clear up the mystery.)

And also, what sort of signal do you think Blinap is 
attempting/intending to sample? (Perhaps I can take off my tinfoil hat 
for a bit and attempt to tune into that signal.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


 &gt;Scott&gt; The problem is that Blinap relies on something that, as we've 
discussed previously, simply doesn't exist: People have to know enough 
statistics to trust a sampling-based decisionmaking system. My position 
is that they don't, and it would take decades to train enough of them in 
statistics (and psychology) to allow them to accept such a new system.

Ned&gt; People can participate in the Blinap process (as proposers, 
appraisers, and/or investigators) without knowing any statistics.

People can appreciate the decision outcomes of the Blinap process 
without knowing any statistics.

People can appreciate the decision implementation outcomes (that follow 
after the decision outcomes) without knowing any statistics.

People can develop a preference for Blinap over other decision systems 
without knowing any statistics.

Developing trust in Blinap does not depend on having any knowledge of 
statistics.
