<PRE>The book is very good at presenting the paradigm, but doesn't go into  
much detail... that will have to be up to us. :)

As for the value of points, I think they would have to be community- 
defined. That is, each community sets its own point-value system (and  
perhaps also determines a base score or an accumulation value for new  
members). That way, communities can define exchange rates between each  
other. The book only describes Whuffie as a seemingly universal  
standard; but I think it would have to have a community-specific  
element.

After all, you wouldn't necessarily want someone with a fantastically- 
high score derived from the Britney Spears fan club community to  
therefore have a great deal of power in the nuclear proliferation  
control community.
