<PRE>Thanks for the pointer, Ed.  

While money complicates matters, at the very least the voluntary
organizations we form should be based upon aggregations of the goals and
objectives of the members of those organizations. Hopefully, the emerging
StratML standard will contribute toward that end --
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A> -- and MetaScore can
play a role in helping to identify goals and objectives deemed worthy of
joint pursuit.

As you know from my previous postings, I also believe it is the
contributions of (records created by) each individual that should be
&quot;scored&quot; (rated), not the &quot;personalities&quot; of the individuals themselves.  If
virtual .orgs can show the way to build and use *records-based*
meritocracies, .coms may have no choice but to follow ... lest they lose
their ability to induce anyone to give them money.  (Reference Bernie Madoff
as an example of a personality-based rather than a records-based
organization.)

BTW, here is an ironic indication of the degree to which companies have felt
entitled to &quot;own&quot; rather than serve their customers:
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/PushShove.html#cook">http://ambur.net/PushShove.html#cook</A>  Someday it will be ludicrous to think
that companies can &quot;create&quot; people entities.  Instead, companies will come
to be more properly recognized as aggregations of the goals and objectives
of the stakeholders (people) who populate them.

Unfortunately, whom one knows is often still more valuable than what one
knows, and style often is still more influential than substance.  However,
it is within our power to change those dynamics in the organizations in
which we choose to participate ... if we choose to do so (which will require
us to give up some of our illusions and face reality).

I just saw an article on SlashDot about the concept of an open  
company, and thought it was quite relevant to Metascore. I started a  
small article in our wiki about it as well:
