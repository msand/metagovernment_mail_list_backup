<PRE>I just found another interesting detail about IAAS: their adminstrators can be international as shown in this document:

<A HREF="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2009/01/20/09010416.pdf">http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/tsv_pdf/2009/01/20/09010416.pdf</A>

The document is in dutch but if you look at the addresses and locations of the people mentioned you'll get the idea.

But I do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the institutional trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community avoid or prevent or defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex through meta government?

Hello, and welcome, Steven!

I believe that the nature of open, community governance is inherently non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals be empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead a community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people who are interested in participating in it, then communities last only as long as there is interest.

Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller factions, and sometimes they will merge into larger communities. As long as we maintain communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then I think the problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.


That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating somewhat more formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from foundations. But the threat of institutionalization has been one of the serious objections to such a formation. See also:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>

If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if we could form as one international institution and formally declare Metascore to be our entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of directors). Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for this just might be Belgium. From what I understand, your country is the only place which officially supports the formation of international organizations...
