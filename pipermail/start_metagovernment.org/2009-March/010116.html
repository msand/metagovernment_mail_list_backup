<PRE>(Probably this mail won't add new ideas, just make them explicit.)

It is not clearly how Metagovernment is going to *replace* the entire  
government mechanism of a community (but that is what makes this  
project different and special). I think that the opinion between  
project's members is divided in those who believe this could be done  
and those that are pretty sure this is impossible.

Metascore is intended to act as a collaborative legislative power.  
Nobody has said a word about judicial power, anyway I'm sure this  
will be resolved in the future. And finally... the executive power.  
In an organization we often see two kinds of actions: operative and  
administrative. For example &#8212;in a school&#8212;, a teacher does the first  
and a director the second. The teacher has no powers and the director  
is an executive.

The question is: who will do the administrative work?
a) The members through &quot;Meta administration&quot;. They are remunerated as  
in an open company.
b) The organization hires an administrative staff. They are somewhat  
powerless, they follow resolutions given from Metascore, but they  
organize and give orders to the operative staff.
