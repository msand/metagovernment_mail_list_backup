(I should have made it clearer, I was only speaking in general terms.
 I have no opinion on day-to-day politics.  I get in enough trouble as

There may be a misunderstanding, because I wasn't speaking of the bulk
of government, which is mostly service provision.  I was speaking of
top-level *governance*.  I say there will be no substansive
transparency of executive or legislative decision making.  Ministers
and legislators will keep their reasons and motives largely to
themselves.  They won't open up their councils to public scrutiny, in
the way that jurists do, for instance.  They will continue to meet
behind closed doors.  (I believe this is justified for executives, but
not for legislators.)
 
&gt;<i> Where does the authority of government come from?  In a democratic
</I>&gt;<i> society, it comes from us.  Transparency can serve to strengthen,
</I>&gt;<i> not undermine, that authority...
</I>
Legitimacy comes from the people, and it interrelates with authority,
I agree.  But authority depends on other things, too.  It would suffer
if the government were unable to maintain a minimal level of dignity.
In practice, this requires putting on a show.  Transparency would
interfere with the staging.  If people could see how the laws were
made, for example, they might lose respect for authority.  Worse, they
might begin to question the legitimacy of the government.  That could
lead to a crisis, as we have no better system at hand.  So the show
must go on.

&gt;<i> ... I will be an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Kundra's efforts.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think our chances of achieving our goals for better governance are
</I>&gt;<i> much more likely to be achieved through evolution than revolution.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe Mr.  Kundra represents the most encouraging evolutionary
</I>&gt;<i> development we've seen to bring about meaningful transparency in
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>
Metagovernment is the only project that is revolutionary - in the
political sense.  They intend to replace the government (eventually).
The other projects have no close relation with government (they are
e-dem, not e-gov).

Individuals may have their own opinions, but project leaders must be
careful what they say in public.  Much depends on how the project is
organized, and how it is funded:


       Non-Organized        Organized

        lifeworld           system


Most of the projects are sitting at top right.  They are organized as
business firms or non-profits, and the purpose of organizing is to
obtain funding.  The government and the poltical parties are potential
sources of funding.  So there's a collaborative relation among the
various organizations that exist on the right side of the diagram (top
to bottom).

By contrast, two of the projects are sitting at bottom left.  They are
part of the public sphere.  They are open, formally unorganized, and
non-funded.  They are staffed by volunteers who, when they need money,
rely on the private sphere of individuals (mostly themselves) and
family.  So there's a collaborative relation between the two spheres
on the left.

The left side of society (lifeworld) is structured by communication,
while the right side (system) is structured by money and power.  Which
of these needs our help?  Theory tells us that the public sphere is
penetrated by the system, and weakened by manipulations and
interference, so it cannot perform its proper functions.

If we intend to help the public, should we help it by setting up
organizations within the system?  Or should we camp out closer to
where the problems are?

(I think the public can help itself, from within.  I don't think it
 needs the aid of government or other organizations.  I believe the
 various parts of society are largely self-serving.  This view is
 cynical, I agree.  But it offers both realism and grounds for hope.)
