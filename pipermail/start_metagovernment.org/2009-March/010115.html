<PRE>That dichotomy between people who want more government and people who  
want less is one which this project hopes to transcend, since it is  
only a reflection of citizens' alienation from the process. If  
government were an embodiment of the consensus of the governed, then  
the concept of more or less government would be meaningless. For  
example, people usually don't suggest that a chess club should have  
less government.

I have no doubt that other serious disputes will remain, but getting  
over this basic hurdle is a critical precursor to and result of  
consensus government. Once things are no longer divided into 51-49  
splits between two decisions, it should become much easier to build  
toward something that can garner a much larger majority of support.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ed, Owen and Jonathan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree totally with your comments about the evolutionary morphing  
</I>&gt;<i> of communities and the need to avoid institutionalization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of our arguments for having a standard strategy language - in  
</I>&gt;<i> our case OpenStrategy - and for storing the evolving strategy on- 
</I>&gt;<i> line - is that such a strategy can live on and evolve together with  
</I>&gt;<i> the community, rather than being locked into a single rigid  
</I>&gt;<i> organisation/institution populated by individuals who typically move  
</I>&gt;<i> on to new jobs just when they've started to make useful  
</I>&gt;<i> contributions (thereby losing corporate/community memory).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy captures/archives/evolves the collective wisdom/memory  
</I>&gt;<i> of a community independent of any institutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We sometimes describe OpenStrategy as a 3rd generation strategy  
</I>&gt;<i> paradigm:
</I>&gt;<i> 1st generation - top-down: strategy driven top-down by the hierarchy  
</I>&gt;<i> (management focused - simplistic)
</I>&gt;<i> 2nd generation - people networks:  strategy created by networking  
</I>&gt;<i> people/organisations (network focused - 10s of thousands of  
</I>&gt;<i> conversations - hugely complex)
</I>&gt;<i> 3rd generation (StratML/OpenStrategy) - idea networks:  strategy  
</I>&gt;<i> created as an evolving network of interlinked ideas (ideas focused -  
</I>&gt;<i> typically 100s of ideas - hence just moderately complex)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to the concept of &quot;common interest&quot;:  we often say that  
</I>&gt;<i> if a real-world community starts their strategy development by  
</I>&gt;<i> agreeing on &quot;common goals&quot;.... they will fail....  almost always....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because in our experience there are almost no common goals in real- 
</I>&gt;<i> world communities.  There may be common value statements (eg a  
</I>&gt;<i> commitment to &quot;fairness and equity&quot;, or &quot;good health for everyone&quot;,  
</I>&gt;<i> or a &quot;love of Brittany Spears&quot;) but as soon as these high level  
</I>&gt;<i> statements are disaggregated into details, commonality vanishes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We believe that the real world is made up of collections of  
</I>&gt;<i> SubGroups and each SubGroup has reasonably common goals.  Therefore  
</I>&gt;<i> a full community strategy needs to consist of integrated sets of  
</I>&gt;<i> SubStrategies each supported by SubGroups, rather than a monolithic  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;strategy&quot;.  In this way an OpenStrategy parallels a software  
</I>&gt;<i> product which is assembled from complementary open source modules,  
</I>&gt;<i> rather than a software product created by a single vendor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where the SubStrategies don't conflict, life is easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where SubStrategies conflict, then the community needs to find ways  
</I>&gt;<i> to address these conflicts.  We have proven methodologies/processes  
</I>&gt;<i> for doing this, generally starting with identifying each SubGroup's  
</I>&gt;<i> desired Benefits and working back through Uses, Results and Projects  
</I>&gt;<i> to come up with sets of PRU's that will lead to Benefits for both  
</I>&gt;<i> SubGroups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another important characteristic: individual SubStrategies can grow,  
</I>&gt;<i> evolve, be implemented and die a peaceful and celebrated death,  
</I>&gt;<i> while the community strategy can continue it's evolutionary  
</I>&gt;<i> trajectory as SubStrategies come and go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to raise another concept we observe in relation to multi- 
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder strategies (or indeed to any multi-stakeholder activity):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Earning the right to lead&quot; rather than &quot;taking control&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We find that individual stakeholders will fight for the right to  
</I>&gt;<i> engage with a multi-stakeholder activity but that often their  
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasm soon wanes.   They insist on the right to engage, but are  
</I>&gt;<i> much more relaxed about actually engaging long term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've analysed this carefully and have concluded that in many  
</I>&gt;<i> instances, stakeholders get involved initially in order to check  
</I>&gt;<i> that their interests are being catered for - and they insist on the  
</I>&gt;<i> right to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the key/lead stakeholders in the multi-stakeholder group are  
</I>&gt;<i> transparently and effectively looking after the individual's  
</I>&gt;<i> interest, then the individual often steps back and leaves the key  
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders to get on with, knowing that as individuals they can  
</I>&gt;<i> see what's going on and can step back into the process at any time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key/lead stakeholders, by initially performing transparently and  
</I>&gt;<i> effectively, have &quot;earned the right to lead&quot; through their  
</I>&gt;<i> professional behaviour - and, in effect, they have ended up &quot;in  
</I>&gt;<i> control&quot; but they haven't &quot;taken control&quot;.    The open source  
</I>&gt;<i> community thrives on this concept of earned leadership/control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for providing us with the opportunity to share our  
</I>&gt;<i> experiences with multi-stakeholder strategy development.  There is  
</I>&gt;<i> much more we can share about strategy-related concepts and how they  
</I>&gt;<i> are encapsulated in the OpenStrategy system (and could potentially  
</I>&gt;<i> be encapsulated in the excellent StratML initiative).  However, I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to overstay your warm invitation to engage with you so  
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know when you've had enough from us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards

</I>&gt;<i> changes. This thus solves for the inertia of institutionalism  
</I>&gt;<i> because communities will necessarily be changing/merging/splitting  
</I>&gt;<i> as these conditions change. There is nothing stopping a community  
</I>&gt;<i> from formally stating goals, but they may have to adapt over time as  
</I>&gt;<i> conditions change. Or they may not... if they have defined goals  
</I>&gt;<i> well enough to maintain a strong community.
