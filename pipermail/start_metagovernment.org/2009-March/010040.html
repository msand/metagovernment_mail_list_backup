<PRE>I'm pretty tired, but want to share some initial reflections from  
Transparency Camp 09.

People loved <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse2.org">http://www.whitehouse2.org</A>  Why? Because they could see  
it! Yes, it is nicely done, and Jim Gilliam is a good advocate for it;  
but the thing that really swayed people was its accessibility... and  
its existence.

There were numerous times when I saw the ideas of Metagovernment  
blooming in people's heads. But they couldn't really grasp it because  
they couldn't see it (and because still too many people are deeply  
conditioned to think an authority figure is necessary). I am now fully  
on board with Manuel that we need software before we can promote. My  
promotions sounded like fringe-babbling without something to point to.  
No amount of publicity will be able to compare to our successful  
governance of ourselves via Metascore. &gt;95% of people are instantly  
dismissive of governance without singular authority, so the burden is  
entirely on us to prove it before we have a chance of reaching them.

People (including me) were also impressed with yourowndemocracy.org. I  
think the server is down right now, but you can also see <A HREF="http://www.gongszeto.com/">http://www.gongszeto.com/</A> 
  for Gong Szeto, the author. He also was quite eloquent and clearly a  
capable programmer.

I invited both Jim and Gong to join the list server, and I think you  
may see them around soon. I also finally got to meet Mark Frischmuth,  
who is every bit as nice as his online persona would lead you to  
believe. And I corresponded with Craig Newmark (founder of  
Craigslist), who said he would forward info on us onward to the folks  
at PersonalDemocracyForum.

That's most of what I have to report. Mostly, people were very buried  
in the status quo, and very focused on the American federal  
government, so my influence there was somewhat limited. I'm looking  
forward to the eDemocracy camp in April which will be more up our  
line. If we can have something to actually show people there, it would  
be tremendous... but even if not, I think I will have a slightly more  
receptive audience.

I met with folks from several other somewhat related projects, and I  
am again convinced that our approach is on the right track. Our growth  
model from small communities, our international community, our  
flexible-organic structure, and our emphasis on synthesis all make for  
a strong offering... if only we can get it rolling. I would again urge  
everyone here to either consider contributing to the code/interface or  
to pick one way to reach out to other programmers and try to find  
someone else who will help with the code or interface of Metascore.
