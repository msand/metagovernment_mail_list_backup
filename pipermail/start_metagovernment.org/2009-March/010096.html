<PRE>Good reference, Jim.

 

With respect to reputation, Suroweicki says expertise is ... &quot;spectacularly
narrow.&quot;  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A>

 

And Gladwell notes the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when
&quot;human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance
of fundamental character traits and underestimate the importance of the
situation and context.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/tippoint.pdf">http://ambur.net/tippoint.pdf</A>

 

To the degree they may be right, reputation systems should take into account
not only context but also domains of expertise.

 

BTW, here is one of the wild, half-baked thoughts I documented in June 2001:

fyi, there are some folks who have been working on reputation systems for
some time, and wikipedia has some good research linked up.

Manuel, I tend to agree with you that incompetence and the law of unintended
consequences are probably a bigger parts of the problem than outright
corruption, at least in the cultures with which I am most familiar.
However, Charles Ford has asserted that everyone lies; the only difference
is a matter of degree. <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Lies.htm">http://ambur.net/Lies.htm</A>  Robyn Dawes has made a
similar point about irrationality:  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm">http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm</A>

A variation on the theme of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting
absolutely is the notion that leaders have risen to their level of
incompetence, and by deferring responsibility to leaders, we are virtually
guaranteeing as much.  Jean Lipman-Blumen argues there are all sorts of
reasons we may actually prefer to do so:  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf">http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf</A>

So while I share your feeling that it would be nice in a perfect world if it
were unnecessary to require our leaders (if not also ourselves) to be held
personally accountable, I also agree with President Reagan's famous
admonition: &quot;Trust, but verify.&quot;

Those who are indeed trustworthy have nothing to fear from verification.
Indeed, they may take it as a badge of courage.  To the degree that Ford is
right, it will distinguish them as being worthy of leadership.  Those who
refuse to be held personally accountable deserve neither our trust nor our
deference to them as leaders.

Finally, I disagree with your suggestion that technology hardly ever solves
social problems.  While it is true that technology in and of itself is
amoral, the power to change human nature is above our pay grade.  On the
other hand, it is well within our power to innovate and change our
*organizations* by taking advantage of new technical capabilities to help us
overcome our frailties as human beings. <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult">http://ambur.net/Cult</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm">http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm</A>&gt; &amp;Tech.htm

Thus, I would argue that technological advancement is not only the
historically universal way but also the *only* way to make real, sustainable
progress (at least in this world).

I would like to add that there is the underlying topic of trust and
responsibility here. Tracking everybody with a smartcard sends the
message that nobody can be trusted and that in turn you should trust
nobody. I think this kind of system would be tearing at the fabric of
society.

The starting point should be that people can be trusted and encourage
them to take on responsibility. You can't expect everybody to comply
but I don't think we're looking for a perfect solution. People who
abuse trust should be punished on a case to case basis and so long as
we have a system where we can find out about most abuses once they
happen, I don't think we need to set up a big brother state.

Also I would point out that technological solutions alone hardly ever
solve social problems.

Personally I think the main problem in our governments are incompetent
do gooders rather than corruption, so I don't even think that the
right question is being asked.

Manuel
