<PRE>While the concepts of &#161;&#176;transparency&#161;&#177; and &#161;&#176;accountability&#161;&#177; are great,
much lip service has been paid to them as &#161;&#176;business&#161;&#177; (including waste,
fraud, and abuse) has continued as usual.  To be truly meaningful and
effective, those concepts must be made more specific so that *performance
metrics* can be applied to them and reported to stakeholders.  <A HREF="http://ambur.">http://ambur.</A>
net/RMmetrics.htm 

 

Transparency means *records* having the four attributes outlined in ISO
15489 &#168;C integrity, reliability, usability, and authenticity -- and
accountability means that such records must clearly document who knew what
and when they knew it, including exactly what they saw when they view the
information upon which they acted.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_management">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Records_management</A> 

 

ISO 15489 itself must be further specified as requirements against which
performance can be measured, e.g., DoD STD 5015.2.
<A HREF="http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/">http://jitc.fhu.disa.mil/recmgt/</A> 

 

Transparency also means that the records themselves must be created and
maintained throughout their life-cycles in open (nonproprietary),
machine-processable format (e.g., XML) so that the information they contain
is readily subject to indexing, aggregation, reporting, and analysis.

 

It would be good to stop paying lip service to these concepts and get on
with implementing and improving the relevant technical standards, including
standards for measuring and reporting the performance of each of us in
creating, managing, and sharing records.  The fact that it seems to be so
hard to do so implies deep-seated psychological reasons that we may actually
prefer to allow our leaders to continue to avoid accountability in order to
afford ourselves the same opportunity.  Those reasons are the subject of my
ongoing series of papers at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping">http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping</A>  The
next in the series will address the psychology of rumors.

A post I had made sometime back (below) may be relevant to what is stated by
Mat&#168;&#170;as Battocchia &quot;For a patch, *corruption must be reduced first*, because
it is the cause that prevents the appliance of more equitable policies&quot;.

Transparency and Accountability

Openness of thought and action in every individual is
... more &lt;javascript:toggle_req('more_com2','more_com1');&gt; &gt;&gt; Openness of
thought and action in every individual is
transparency in life. It would result in self accountability.
This alone can lead to all round peace and prosperity and give a
new meaning to life. 

Secrecy in life, can lead to corruption of the mind, thereby creating
unhappiness for the self and community. With secrecy we tend to indulge in
wrong thoughts and actions as we think we can get away with it. Invariably
we do get away also and this encourages us to further indulge in wrong
thoughts and actions. With openness and transparency, every action of ours
can be questioned and challenged by the community.

This would bring about a transformation in our thought process.
We would not tend to put self before others, at any cost! Instead
we would say, self before others only if it is acceptable to all.
Saying it in another way, we would say, self along with
others. This would create equality of opportunity for all and
a level playing field where every one contributes.

&#167;&#165;&#167;&#222;&#167;&#218;&#167;&#228;&#167;&#226;&#167;&#218;&#167;&#219;: I see capitalism as an economic system to be improved &#161;&#170;with
effective tax and wealth distribution policies&#161;&#170; rather than replaced. I
have two very good reasons:

*	Today's economy is way to complex to be controlled, better leave
that work to the free market laws.  
*	It is relatively straightforward for a capitalistic nation to patch
its current system, in the other hand total reform requires much more work
and you have to be sure that the new system is going to be more successful.

For a patch, *corruption must be reduced first*, because it is the cause
that prevents the appliance of more equitable policies.

 

Bye,
