<PRE>Hi Allan,

before I give you an answer in detail I shall define the area that I am talking 
about. 

As I said before did I get the idea because of the discussions about the 
European constitution but it applies also to the US constitution or any other 
big law. These are so big that not a single person can handle the whole 
document. They consist of a few chapters and many articles and even more small 
paragraphs. The process I am describing here refers to articles and 
paragraphs. 

The concept is that they are moderated by one person who can be seen as a 
benevolent dictator (as leaders from open source call them self). These 
moderators have the power of integrating suggestions or not. And here comes 
the necessity of a separation. The moderators can do a good moderation by 
being good leaders and using their &quot;power&quot; correctly. But having the 
possibility of a separation &quot;bad leaders&quot; can easily be exchanged. This 
results in the situation that the moderator has only got the right staying in 
this position as long as people are accepting him/her as the person doing the 
job in the best way.

Addidtion or exchange of the issues to the chapters or the whole constitution 
can only be achieved by a poll. So there is no moderator or someone in power.

&gt;<i> Hi Gerold,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the best is to separate the task into small and big dissents. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small dissents I would prefer if the group stays together in which case
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe a tool like the one they are using for developing the GPL could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help: <A HREF="http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html">http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This has got the advantage that people can see which part of the article
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; got edited and discussed most. They can also vote for a suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe that in this case a separation because of little dissent will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not happen so fast since bringing in ideas is very easy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Big issues need to split apart in my point of view and a poll can show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which way is better later on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You afford a dissensus (splitting apart) but not a consensus (coming
</I>&gt;<i> together).  So dissent may multiply into a false dissensus - one that
</I>&gt;<i> has no substance in reality - being held apart merely by inertia, and
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of affordances to come together.
</I>
The &quot;coming together&quot; is because of group building. I think it is a social 
behavior that people want be part of a group where they feel being accepted. 
So only a moderator that can give this kind of feeling will be accepted.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, dissent may express itself in a petition to an authority - the
</I>&gt;<i> moderator of the dominant position - with the power to accept or
</I>&gt;<i> reject.  If rejected, dissent is suppressed.  So the result is a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus maintained, not so much because it's the best of the
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives, but because it's the only alternative.  So it is a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus *de facto*, rather than *de jure*.
</I>
... *de jure* consensus depends on the size of the discussed issue, eg a 
chapter
... *social* consensus applied for small issues, eg paragraphs

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; In other words, how can a newly introduced idea - a better variant -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; climb to the top of the heap?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Getting an issue from the bottom to the top is indeed very difficult,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; therefore I think it has to go from &quot;top to bottom&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally speaking, this could be a problem.  A top-to-bottom process
</I>&gt;<i> is necessarily mediated by power - force and threat of force - that
</I>&gt;<i> ensconses itself in an organization (power structure).
</I>
With the top-to-bottom process I mean that there was first only one aggregation 
around a person with power and that power can very easily be split, separated 
or exchanged. So I do not see any power with force here.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Power has a price.  So the process will be mediated by money, too.
</I>
How can money be relevant if everything is transparent and the person in 
*power* has actually no right since she/he can easily be *exchanged*? Maybe I 
just don't see it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can could imagine the following process to be implemented:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) someone starts an issue (tags need to be set for filtering so that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is easy to find similar topics and avoid redundancy)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) this person is moderating the issue by accepting suggestions or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignoring them
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some dissent will be lost here - suppressed by the moderator's power
</I>&gt;<i> structure (she will have many willing helpers).
</I>
The moderator will only have power if she/he is doing a good job otherwise 
a group of people can copy the issue and start new. Again, the moderator has 
to prove herself and has no real power.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (3a) if a group of people is not happy with the moderation, they start a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separated issue by copying it with the whole history (this is what I mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with top to bottom)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of them will leave the process, at that point - they will walk
</I>&gt;<i> away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whatever dissent remains (insuppressable, and strongly held) will go
</I>&gt;<i> to fragmenting the process into a dissensus.  OK.
</I>
I believe people prefer to stay in a group as long as they are respected in 
the group and happy with the process even if there is dissent.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (3b) if the problem gets to big the issue should be split in two or more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parts to make it easier for the participants to follow the discussions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (again top to bottom)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (4) finally the issues have to take a vote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There will be too many minor fragments to consider.  So the voter will
</I>&gt;<i> either vote for one of the dominant positions (usually two or three),
</I>&gt;<i> or she'll walk away from the process.
</I>
Two or three is a good number which people can handle. I count on the chance 
that at least one of the moderators is doing a good job and integrating good 
ideas from the group. Most people will follow that person.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Effectively, you have centralized and serialized a process that is
</I>&gt;<i> better when decentered and parallel.  (I shouldn't say *you*, as your
</I>&gt;<i> method - thus far - is basically a model of the status quo.)
</I>
Yes, I do not see centralization generally as bad and that is why I want 
centralization for small issues. Big issues should be a collection of small 
issues where the small issues can only be integrated by a positive poll. There 
is no moderation.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some additional ideas:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - issues can build a crowd (similar to having friends)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - people can get a &quot;reputation&quot; when other people vote for them or if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they manage to pass an issue through the whole process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This is potentially dangerous, as yet another centralizing tendency.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - issues can merge to one issue
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think this is closer to the mark.  The crucial thing is to
</I>&gt;<i> afford a consensus that neither suppresses dissent, nor is
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessarily fragmented by it.  It's hard to imagine how, exactly,
</I>&gt;<i> except by facilitating the flow of innovations from the periphery (in
</I>&gt;<i> dissensus) to the center (in consensus).
</I>
It is a socializing thing. People do not like to be alone :)
