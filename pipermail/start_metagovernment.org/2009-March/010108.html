<PRE>With respect to the thought that &quot;communities last only as long as there is
interest,&quot; the communities in which I am most interested in participating
are those which: 

 

a)      have clearly documented in open, readily sharable format (e.g.
StratML) what they aim to accomplish (longer-term goals and near-term
objectives), and

b)      measure and report progress against their common goals and
objectives.

 

To the degrees that goals may be achieved, there may be no need for the
community to continue to exist.  However, in many, if not most instances
there will be needs/opportunities for ongoing maintenance, if not also
enhancement of the results achieved.  For example, according to the opening
clause of our Constitution, the purpose of the USA is to &quot;form a more
perfect Union&quot; in the pursuit of other goals.

Regarding the potential for using a widely distributed model --
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore#Distribution_model">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore#Distribution_model</A> - it will be
interesting to explore the degree to which it may be possible to enable
folks to post StratML documents anywhere they choose on the Web and let the
results speak for themselves - in StratML-enabled performance reports.  It
is not the subjective &quot;scores&quot; that matter but, rather, the objective
(measurable) results achieved.  The OpenStrategies.com folks call such
results &quot;benefit&quot; or &quot;use&quot; - as in usage by the intended beneficiaries.

But I do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the
institutional trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community
avoid or prevent or defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex
through meta government?

 

Hello, and welcome, Steven!

 

I believe that the nature of open, community governance is inherently
non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals be
empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead a
community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people who are
interested in participating in it, then communities last only as long as
there is interest.

 

Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller factions, and sometimes
they will merge into larger communities. As long as we maintain
communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then I think the
problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.

 

That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating somewhat more
formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from foundations.
But the threat of institutionalization has been one of the serious
objections to such a formation. See also:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>

 

If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if we could form
as one international institution and formally declare Metascore to be our
entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of directors).
Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for this just might be
Belgium. From what I understand, your country is the only place which
officially supports the formation of international organizations...
