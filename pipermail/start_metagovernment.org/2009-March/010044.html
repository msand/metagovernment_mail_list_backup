</I>
I see it like giving an issue a &quot;human touch&quot;.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - issues can build a crowd (similar to having friends)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - people can get a &quot;reputation&quot; when other people vote for them or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manage to pass an issue through the whole process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two very notable ideas I got from Whitehouse2.org (the author, Jim
</I>&gt;<i> Gilliam is now a member of this list) were:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Participants can earn &quot;political capital&quot; and then they can spend
</I>&gt;<i> it. This is more flexible than a simple user score, since your capital
</I>&gt;<i> goes down as you spend it, meaning you have to choose wisely where you
</I>&gt;<i> want to apply it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Political capital has to be externally earned. That is, nobody can
</I>&gt;<i> earn capital just by acting... it has to be given to them by other
</I>&gt;<i> users
</I>
You mean something like &quot;material capital&quot; but with the restriction that 
people can only spend as much as they have accumulated before. A lesson we 
haved learned from the financial crisis. Yes, is indeed an interesting idea.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; ... My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; hope is that governments accept the proposals because of the good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; quality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; this kind of system will produce. Reason comes from the good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; quality of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Votes are maybe the best measure of quality.  If a proposal has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; stable consensus - stable, mind - then politicians are going to pay
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; attention.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, votes may be the only way to have a broad consensus and proof for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality. It is easy to vote, but less people are commenting or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussing an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue and even less people are doing the &quot;work&quot; by writing something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just to be clear here (and I understand this thread is about Gerold's
</I>&gt;<i> published idea, not Metascore), the end goal of Metascore is to be a
</I>&gt;<i> governance mechanism in itself. Instead of asking governments to
</I>&gt;<i> accept citizens' ideas; we want to remove the distinction and make
</I>&gt;<i> government the collection of the ideas of its participants.
</I>
What I was explaining above is a practical goal for the start. How all that 
will evolve I can't say. But if there should be a time without governments, it 
will still take a long time (more than 20 years). There are still many 
governments around in the world (eg China) that won't change their system for 
some time and they probably will prefer to talk to a representative government 
of the country instead to a bunch of loosely gathered people in the internet.
