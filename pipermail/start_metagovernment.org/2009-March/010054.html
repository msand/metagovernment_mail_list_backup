<PRE>Some of the discussions I've had on my end included these examples:

1. Marriage Vows that the two parties agree upon when they first enter into
their personal agreement, which is further refined as the relationship
matures.
2. Care Plans between the Primary Care Giver, the recipient, and all others
involved in the process, that evolve with the complications being managed.
3. Product Requirements that are agreed upon by each individual involved in
the project, with new features being added and scored throughout each new
iteration of the product.

This did bring to mind the idea to create a website that allows individuals
to sign up and create documents/vows/plans/requirements, in order to both
promote metaScore, and alleviate the need for someone to download the source
and maintain a database when all they need is metaScore.

Is this approach too generic?
