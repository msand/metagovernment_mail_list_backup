I guess it's about helping government to do a better job.  But we're
aimed at replacing government (Metagovernment), or at removing
decision-making from its hands (DemocracyLab, Votorola, et al).  Our
focus is therefore on helping the public sphere to do a better job.

With regard to government, consider three types of transparency, of:

  a) governance (substansive)  -  impossible

  b) governance (non-substansive)

  c) services

(a) Substansive transparency of governance is impossible.  It would be
unacceptable to government, as it would undermine the authority of its
decisions.  Government is all about authority.

(b) Non-substansive transparency might be useful as an instrument of
propaganda.  Public opinion might be manipulated, for instance, by
selective transparency.  (But this sounds like a difficult knife
trick.  Other, safer channels of propaganda are available.)

(c) Transparency of services is perhaps all we can expect.  The
government may choose to expose parts of its bureaucracy to public
scrutiny.  This makes sense, because politicians are always at odds
with the bureaucracy.  Selective exposure might give them an added
lever of control over it.  (Not to mention, the level of service might
improve.)

So transparency might have no bearing on the public (as such), but
private individuals could benefit from improved services.  That's my
guess,
