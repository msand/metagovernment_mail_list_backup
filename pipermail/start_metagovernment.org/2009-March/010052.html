<PRE>Hi Gerold,

&gt;<i> I think the best is to separate the task into small and big dissents. For 
</I>&gt;<i> small dissents I would prefer if the group stays together in which case maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> a tool like the one they are using for developing the GPL could help: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html">http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has got the advantage that people can see which part of the article got 
</I>&gt;<i> edited and discussed most. They can also vote for a suggestion. 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe that in this case a separation because of little dissent will not 
</I>&gt;<i> happen so fast since bringing in ideas is very easy. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Big issues need to split apart in my point of view and a poll can show which 
</I>&gt;<i> way is better later on.
</I>
You afford a dissensus (splitting apart) but not a consensus (coming
together).  So dissent may multiply into a false dissensus - one that
has no substance in reality - being held apart merely by inertia, and
the lack of affordances to come together.

Or, dissent may express itself in a petition to an authority - the
moderator of the dominant position - with the power to accept or
reject.  If rejected, dissent is suppressed.  So the result is a
consensus maintained, not so much because it's the best of the
alternatives, but because it's the only alternative.  So it is a
consensus *de facto*, rather than *de jure*.

&gt;<i> &gt; In other words, how can a newly introduced idea - a better variant -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; climb to the top of the heap?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Getting an issue from the bottom to the top is indeed very difficult, therefore 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it has to go from &quot;top to bottom&quot;. 
</I>
Generally speaking, this could be a problem.  A top-to-bottom process
is necessarily mediated by power - force and threat of force - that
ensconses itself in an organization (power structure).

Power has a price.  So the process will be mediated by money, too.

&gt;<i> I can could imagine the following process to be implemented:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) someone starts an issue (tags need to be set for filtering so that it is 
</I>&gt;<i> easy to find similar topics and avoid redundancy)
</I>&gt;<i> (2) this person is moderating the issue by accepting suggestions or ignoring 
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>
Some dissent will be lost here - suppressed by the moderator's power
structure (she will have many willing helpers).

&gt;<i> (3a) if a group of people is not happy with the moderation, they start a 
</I>&gt;<i> separated issue by copying it with the whole history (this is what I mean with 
</I>&gt;<i> top to bottom)
</I>
Most of them will leave the process, at that point - they will walk
away.

Whatever dissent remains (insuppressable, and strongly held) will go
to fragmenting the process into a dissensus.  OK.

&gt;<i> (3b) if the problem gets to big the issue should be split in two or more parts 
</I>&gt;<i> to make it easier for the participants to follow the discussions (again top to 
</I>&gt;<i> bottom)
</I>&gt;<i> (4) finally the issues have to take a vote
</I>
There will be too many minor fragments to consider.  So the voter will
either vote for one of the dominant positions (usually two or three),
or she'll walk away from the process.

Effectively, you have centralized and serialized a process that is
better when decentered and parallel.  (I shouldn't say *you*, as your
method - thus far - is basically a model of the status quo.)

&gt;<i> Some additional ideas:
</I>&gt;<i> - issues can build a crowd (similar to having friends)
</I>&gt;<i> - people can get a &quot;reputation&quot; when other people vote for them or if they 
</I>&gt;<i> manage to pass an issue through the whole process
</I>
(This is potentially dangerous, as yet another centralizing tendency.)

&gt;<i> - issues can merge to one issue
</I>
Yes, I think this is closer to the mark.  The crucial thing is to
afford a consensus that neither suppresses dissent, nor is
unnecessarily fragmented by it.  It's hard to imagine how, exactly,
except by facilitating the flow of innovations from the periphery (in
dissensus) to the center (in consensus).
