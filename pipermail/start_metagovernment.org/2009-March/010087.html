<PRE>I have been away on a trip, which afforded me a chance to read the  
book Robert Peters mentioned: &quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom.&quot;  It  
can be downloaded for free <A HREF="http://craphound.com/down/download.php">http://craphound.com/down/download.php</A> and  
I would encourage members of this list to read it.

This book seems entirely predictive of what I have been describing as  
Metagovernment's &quot;mesh of communities&quot; concept: that self-defining  
communities form around issues, and that issues migrate up and down  
communities until they find their natural home. The book takes it  
farther and has developed the concept very well.

The essential point: they use a &quot;reputation economy.&quot; The book posits  
that a pre-requisite for such an economy may be a completely saturated  
material economy... that is, that all basic material needs can be  
provided for every single member of society as a standard base-level.  
We certainly are not there yet, but there is nothing preventing us  
from getting the reputation economy started.

The book's reveals a somewhat chaotic community structure: where &quot;ad  
hocs&quot; have authority over a system for as long as they are able to  
maintain it, based on their support from the community. I think this  
is entirely realistic, and that it may indicate that Metagovernment  
should focus on an even less structured approach than what we have  
developed so far. In other words, I think it may be useful for us to  
do nothing but develop a broadly-open-standard reputation system which  
can be deployed by other communities in whatever software they choose.

In this book, the reputation-&quot;money&quot; is called &quot;Whuffie.&quot; It can be  
accumulated and spent. It can be given to other people both negatively  
and positively. Regardless of what you take from the above, I would  
like to posit that in whatever systems we develop, people have to  
spend some of their own score in order to give a score to others  
(negative or positive). In other words, for example, for every point  
you give to someone, you lose a quarter-point. And for every negative  
point you give someone, you also lose a quarter-point. This would then  
make people score other people carefully and thoughtfully.

So again, I'd encourage you to read at least the first couple chapters  
of this book and think on it. I'm still absorbing the ideas, but these  
are my initial thoughts.
