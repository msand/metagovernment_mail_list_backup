<PRE>It's funny how so much of the world is interconnected.

After reading this tweet: <A HREF="http://twitter.com/epastore/status/1265812610">http://twitter.com/epastore/status/1265812610</A>

&gt;<i> Still not seeing the value in keeping representatives (read: &quot;lords&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> involved in the democratic process. #tcamp09
</I>
some cogs started turning in the back of my head. I knew somewhere I
had heard somebody on the internet with a good argument in response
to the tweet.

Today I read this: <A HREF="http://twitter.com/pietrosperoni/status/1273438879">http://twitter.com/pietrosperoni/status/1273438879</A>

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bit.ly/hxNKC">http://bit.ly/hxNKC</A> liked Schwartz #ted talk. Agreed on importance of
</I>&gt;<i> virtue, disagreed with solution proposed: acknowledging heroes
</I>
which reminds me of this:
<A HREF="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice.html</A>

Finally making the cogs lock in.

Applied to the tweet, I would interpret the latter talk as making the
argument that the ability to directly make decisions presents an
opportunity cost.

The former contains the argument that rules (and I would extend
authorities) provide a means to liberate oneself from responsibility.

I've given an argument related to this before:

&gt;<i> There is also great potential in the personal growth of citizens. Todays
</I>&gt;<i> electorate is in its political adolescence. We whine about decisions made
</I>&gt;<i> from &quot;above&quot; without knowing or considering their reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being responsible for actively shaping decisions will encourage and to
</I>&gt;<i> some extent force people to grow up. It will foster a new sense of
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility and community, as every person on the street becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> peer with whom you can collaborate to build a better society.
</I>
All this will form part of my argument for a proposal at SIGINT 2009
<A HREF="http://sigint.ccc.de/sigint/2009/wiki/Hauptseite">http://sigint.ccc.de/sigint/2009/wiki/Hauptseite</A>

This is a bit cheaper^Wcloser for me than Berlin and I'll have more time
then. Also it's a Venue where some programmers should be hanging out
rather than people who are purely motivated by the social/political aspect.
(Not that there's anything wrong with that)

I'm kinda dizzy now =)
