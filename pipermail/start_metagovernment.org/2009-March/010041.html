<PRE>There was a tweed at the beginning of the Camp saying: 

&quot;1 gov can't solve probs for 300million ppl, but 300mln people can solve 
problems for 1 gov't&quot;

I think this brings the current situation pretty much to the point.

&gt;<i> I'm pretty tired, but want to share some initial reflections from
</I>&gt;<i> Transparency Camp 09.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People loved <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse2.org">http://www.whitehouse2.org</A>  Why? Because they could see
</I>&gt;<i> it! Yes, it is nicely done, and Jim Gilliam is a good advocate for it;
</I>&gt;<i> but the thing that really swayed people was its accessibility... and
</I>&gt;<i> its existence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There were numerous times when I saw the ideas of Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> blooming in people's heads. But they couldn't really grasp it because
</I>&gt;<i> they couldn't see it (and because still too many people are deeply
</I>&gt;<i> conditioned to think an authority figure is necessary). I am now fully
</I>&gt;<i> on board with Manuel that we need software before we can promote. My
</I>&gt;<i> promotions sounded like fringe-babbling without something to point to.
</I>&gt;<i> No amount of publicity will be able to compare to our successful
</I>&gt;<i> governance of ourselves via Metascore. &gt;95% of people are instantly
</I>&gt;<i> dismissive of governance without singular authority, so the burden is
</I>&gt;<i> entirely on us to prove it before we have a chance of reaching them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People (including me) were also impressed with yourowndemocracy.org. I
</I>&gt;<i> think the server is down right now, but you can also see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gongszeto.com/">http://www.gongszeto.com/</A> for Gong Szeto, the author. He also was quite
</I>&gt;<i> eloquent and clearly a capable programmer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I invited both Jim and Gong to join the list server, and I think you
</I>&gt;<i> may see them around soon. I also finally got to meet Mark Frischmuth,
</I>&gt;<i> who is every bit as nice as his online persona would lead you to
</I>&gt;<i> believe. And I corresponded with Craig Newmark (founder of
</I>&gt;<i> Craigslist), who said he would forward info on us onward to the folks
</I>&gt;<i> at PersonalDemocracyForum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's most of what I have to report. Mostly, people were very buried
</I>&gt;<i> in the status quo, and very focused on the American federal
</I>&gt;<i> government, so my influence there was somewhat limited. I'm looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to the eDemocracy camp in April which will be more up our
</I>&gt;<i> line. If we can have something to actually show people there, it would
</I>&gt;<i> be tremendous... but even if not, I think I will have a slightly more
</I>&gt;<i> receptive audience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I met with folks from several other somewhat related projects, and I
</I>&gt;<i> am again convinced that our approach is on the right track. Our growth
</I>&gt;<i> model from small communities, our international community, our
</I>&gt;<i> flexible-organic structure, and our emphasis on synthesis all make for
</I>&gt;<i> a strong offering... if only we can get it rolling. I would again urge
</I>&gt;<i> everyone here to either consider contributing to the code/interface or
</I>&gt;<i> to pick one way to reach out to other programmers and try to find
</I>&gt;<i> someone else who will help with the code or interface of Metascore.
