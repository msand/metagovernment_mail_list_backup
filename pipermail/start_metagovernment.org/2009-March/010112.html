<PRE>I converted IAAS&#146;s mission and goal statements into StratML format for
inclusion in our collection at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Nonprofits">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Nonprofits</A>
or, more specifically, <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/IAAS.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/IAAS.xml</A>

 

It is the 469th plan indexed in Mark Logic&#146;s StratML search service
prototype -- <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices</A> &#150; in which it
currently ranks:  2nd of 75 referencing the term &#147;students&#148; and 8th among 30
referencing &#147;agriculture&#148;.

 

BTW, with reference to understanding cultural differences, Hall&#146;s
conceptualization of high- versus low-context cultures may be of interest.
In high-context cultures most of the message is embedded in the physical
context or internalized in the people, while relatively little is in the
explicit, coded portion of the message. Communicators use restricted codes
and rely on contextual cues, demonstrating inexact, implicit, and indirect
communication patterns. Conversely, low-context cultures rely on elaborated
verbal messages and precise, explicit, and straightforward communication
patterns.  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult">http://ambur.net/Cult</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm">http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm</A>&gt; &amp;Tech.htm

Hey Ed,

 

It appears you are correct about the legal entity form in belgium. It's
called an international organization without profit intentions (rough
translation). I've actually found a legal document regarding such an
organization:

 

<A HREF="http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/files/BelgianOfficialJournal2">http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/files/BelgianOfficialJournal2</A>
0070806.pdf

 

It's regarding the IAAS or International Association of Students in
Agriculture and Related Sciences:

 

<A HREF="http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/">http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/</A>

 

They're actually located not too far from where I live (but then again
Belgium is not big) so I guess I could get in touch with them to learn more
details.

 

It's good to hear that you guys have exactly the same concerns as I have.
Btw, I've looked at the current workload and there isn't too much on there
that sound like a match for me. The only thing I could do on the short term
is contact the IAAS people and see if we can get them involved somehow. How
does that sound?

 

Btw, my personal wiki page is

But I do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the
institutional trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community
avoid or prevent or defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex
through meta government?

 

Hello, and welcome, Steven!

 

I believe that the nature of open, community governance is inherently
non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals be
empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead a
community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people who are
interested in participating in it, then communities last only as long as
there is interest.

 

Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller factions, and sometimes
they will merge into larger communities. As long as we maintain
communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then I think the
problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.

 

That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating somewhat more
formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from foundations.
But the threat of institutionalization has been one of the serious
objections to such a formation. See also:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>

 

If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if we could form
as one international institution and formally declare Metascore to be our
entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of directors).
Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for this just might be
Belgium. From what I understand, your country is the only place which
officially supports the formation of international organizations...
