<PRE>Manuel, thanks you for encouraging your Metagovernment colleagues to consider the potential benefits of the emerging StratML standard.

StratML is not just for &quot;government transparency&quot;; we aim to establish it as an international voluntary consensus standard for potential use by *all organizations* worldwide.

Consider these relationships to the description of Metagovernment:

&quot;This form of democracy, called open source governance, does not entail traditional voting or majority rule. Instead, people may help govern any community as much or as little as they wish by creating, discussing, and supporting proposals.&quot;

StratML will enable anyone to propose goals and objectives in which they may wish to engage others, and they can post StratML documents anywhere on the Web.  Hopefully, StratML will also facilitate the establishment of metrics by which progress can be measured in the pursuit of such goals and objectives. 

&quot;User input is weighed by other users through a scoring system and brought to the attention of other participants interested in that input.&quot;

This is the very kind of feedback we hope to enable through StratML, so that folks aren't forced to wade through voluminous PDF files to find goals and objectives of interest to them.  However, particularly with respect to voluntary and charitable organizations, the most important feedback is the amount of resources that supporters are willing and able to contribute toward realization of the objectives of interest to them.

Thanks again.

&gt;&gt;<i> If you think that makes sense, please check out <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htmand">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htmand</A> let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me know if you think AIIM&#8217;s emerging Strategy Markup Language (StratML) standard might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fit into your plans for Metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone else from the project (Manuel?) may wish to write him back...
</I>
&gt;<i>From a cursory glance, the focus of StratML seems to be more on the
</I>side of government
transparency. I can't immediately say how well this will transfer to
our project, but in the long
run it would be beneficial to make all information in metascore
available through open standards.

Metascore would require some adaptation so that useful output can be
generated in StratML.
This may take the form of requiring specific formats for articles, so
that the software can
recognize it as expressing laws policies and as Owen Ambur mentions
&quot;strategic goals&quot; and
&quot;measurable objectives&quot; and from this representation be able to
produce StratML. This is my
initial idea of how this could fit into metascore, but I'm not
entirely familiar with the format,
so I may be missing something and maybe there are better ways to integrate it.

While this isn't something I personally want to focus on (certainly
not in the short term), I can see that it may become important and
would appreciate if somebody is interested specifically in this topic,
would dedicate themselves to it. Of course this is also an interesting
research topic for the
FP7 proposal.
