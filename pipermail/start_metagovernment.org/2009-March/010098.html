<PRE>With reference to the risk of Sybil attacks cited in the source that Jim
provided below, reputation should be based not on &quot;personality&quot; (of which an
individual may create many) but upon the quality of the records (e.g.
uniqueness, originality, reliability, authenticity, usability, and
integrity) created and *shared* by individuals.

 

To the degree that individuals are unwilling or unable to affix digital
signatures to such records, that is a risk factor by which their reputation
should be discounted.

 

To the degree that individuals may prefer to have multiple personalities,
that too is a risk factor by which their reputations would be diluted since
none of them could create sufficient numbers of unique, sufficiently
high-quality records to acquire much social power.  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/French">http://ambur.net/French</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm">http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm</A>&gt; &amp;Raven.htm  Indeed, using text analysis
and other means, it may be possible to identify multiple pseudo
personalities as likely to be one and the same individual.

 

In other words, &quot;personality&quot; should be inferred from performance - as
documented in records having the attributes outlined in ISO 15489.

 

If we settle for anything less, we are bound to get what we deserve.

 

BTW, lest we might be tempted to accept the excuse that public (and
corporate) officials cannot be expected to use digital signatures, at least
a couple of them already have, including Energy Secretary Abraham --

to corporate officials, recall that it was only relatively recently that SEC
required them to sign their annual corporate reports (as if they were not
even responsible for what they were reporting).  This site tends to confirm
my recollection that SEC now accepts, if not necessarily requires, digital
signatures: <A HREF="http://www.acii.com/cseca_tc.htm">http://www.acii.com/cseca_tc.htm</A>

Good reference, Jim.

 

With respect to reputation, Suroweicki says expertise is ... &quot;spectacularly
narrow.&quot;  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A>

 

And Gladwell notes the Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE) occurs when
&quot;human beings invariably make the mistake of overestimating the importance
of fundamental character traits and underestimate the importance of the
situation and context.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/tippoint.pdf">http://ambur.net/tippoint.pdf</A>

 

To the degree they may be right, reputation systems should take into account
not only context but also domains of expertise.

 

BTW, here is one of the wild, half-baked thoughts I documented in June 2001:

fyi, there are some folks who have been working on reputation systems for
some time, and wikipedia has some good research linked up.
