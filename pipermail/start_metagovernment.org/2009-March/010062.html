Excellent, that's so true.  (I see from your Wiki page that you were a
PLC programmer.  You have a logical mind. :)

&gt;<i> In <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore/PrototypeB">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore/PrototypeB</A> you can write
</I>&gt;<i> your answer to that question. We don't have to code this prototype, just
</I>&gt;<i> design it. It's like a useful exercise.
</I>
My own answer is to &quot;make assent visible&quot;.  Whenever an issue is being
discussed, and one person nods her head, in agreement with another,
then:

  a) Draw a line of assent from her to the other person, extending
     through the air;

  b) Make the line visible (glowing) to everyone else; and

  c) Allow her to change the line (redirect it), at any time.
 
There will soon be many such lines, lighting up paths of agreement.
Follow them to their points of convergence, and you will discover what
people think of the issue.  (Repeat for all issues of public
importance.)

&gt;<i> PS: I haven't seen you using the wiki's Community Portal, (please) give it a
</I>&gt;<i> chance!
</I>
Anyone who uses the Wiki may copy my answer to there.  Please call it
prototype V, for visibility.
