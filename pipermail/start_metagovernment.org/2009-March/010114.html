<PRE>This is brilliant.  Thank you Phil for sharing.  This is exactly what I'm
seeing happen at White House 2.  There are no goals, that's a  more
revolutionary concept for a traditional organization, but is totally obvious
when dealing in the political realm where at the most basic level, half the
people want more government and half the people want less.   And people very
much want to have their voice heard, but don't stay engaged over a long
period.  On wh2, folks who haven't signed in recently get less oomph in the
rankings for their priorities to prevent things from getting stale... the
core group of people keeps things humming along, developing the ideas and
hashing out the details, while the steady stream of new folks keeps the
rankings fresh.

&gt;<i>  Hi Ed, Owen and Jonathan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree totally with your comments about the evolutionary morphing of
</I>&gt;<i> communities and the need to avoid institutionalization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of our arguments for having a standard strategy language - in our case
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy - and for storing the evolving strategy on-line - is that such
</I>&gt;<i> a strategy can live on and evolve together with the community, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> being locked into a single rigid organisation/institution populated by
</I>&gt;<i> individuals who typically move on to new jobs just when they've started to
</I>&gt;<i> make useful contributions (thereby losing corporate/community memory).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy captures/archives/evolves the collective wisdom/memory of a
</I>&gt;<i> community *independent of* any institutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We sometimes describe OpenStrategy as a 3rd generation strategy paradigm:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. *1st generation - top-down*: strategy driven top-down by the
</I>&gt;<i>    hierarchy (management focused - simplistic)
</I>&gt;<i>    2. *2nd generation - people networks*:  strategy created by networking
</I>&gt;<i>    people/organisations (network focused - 10s of thousands of conversations -
</I>&gt;<i>    hugely complex)
</I>&gt;<i>    3. *3rd generation (StratML/OpenStrategy) - idea networks*:  strategy
</I>&gt;<i>    created as an evolving network of interlinked ideas (ideas focused -
</I>&gt;<i>    typically 100s of ideas - hence just moderately complex)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With respect to the concept of &quot;common interest&quot;:  we often say that if a
</I>&gt;<i> real-world community starts their strategy development by agreeing on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;common goals&quot;.... they will fail....  almost always....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because in our experience there are almost no common goals in real-world
</I>&gt;<i> communities.  There may be common value statements (eg a commitment to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fairness and equity&quot;, or &quot;good health for everyone&quot;, or a &quot;love of Brittany
</I>&gt;<i> Spears&quot;) but as soon as these high level statements are disaggregated into
</I>&gt;<i> details, commonality vanishes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We believe that the real world is made up of collections of SubGroups and
</I>&gt;<i> each SubGroup has reasonably common goals.  Therefore a full community
</I>&gt;<i> strategy needs to consist of integrated sets of SubStrategies each supported
</I>&gt;<i> by SubGroups, rather than a monolithic &quot;strategy&quot;.  In this way an
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy parallels a software product which is assembled from
</I>&gt;<i> complementary open source modules, rather than a software product created by
</I>&gt;<i> a single vendor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where the SubStrategies don't conflict, life is easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where SubStrategies conflict, then the community needs to find ways to
</I>&gt;<i> address these conflicts.  We have proven methodologies/processes for doing
</I>&gt;<i> this, generally starting with identifying each SubGroup's desired Benefits
</I>&gt;<i> and working back through *U*ses, *R*esults and *P*rojects to come up with
</I>&gt;<i> sets of PRU's that will lead to Benefits for both SubGroups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another important characteristic: individual SubStrategies can grow,
</I>&gt;<i> evolve, be implemented and die a peaceful and celebrated death, while the
</I>&gt;<i> community strategy can continue it's evolutionary trajectory as
</I>&gt;<i> SubStrategies come and go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to raise another concept we observe in relation to
</I>&gt;<i> multi-stakeholder strategies (or indeed to any multi-stakeholder activity):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Earning the right to lead&quot; rather than &quot;taking control&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We find that individual stakeholders will fight for the *right *to engage
</I>&gt;<i> with a multi-stakeholder activity but that often their enthusiasm soon
</I>&gt;<i> wanes.   They *insist* on the *right* to engage, but are much more relaxed
</I>&gt;<i> about *actually engaging long term.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've analysed this carefully and have concluded that in many instances,
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders get involved initially in order to check that their interests
</I>&gt;<i> are being catered for - and they insist on the right to do this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the key/lead stakeholders in the multi-stakeholder group are *
</I>&gt;<i> transparently* and *effectively* looking after the individual's interest,
</I>&gt;<i> then the individual often steps back and leaves the key stakeholders to get
</I>&gt;<i> on with, knowing that as individuals they can see what's going on and can
</I>&gt;<i> step back into the process at any time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The key/lead stakeholders, by initially performing transparently and
</I>&gt;<i> effectively, have *&quot;earned the right to lead&quot;* through their professional
</I>&gt;<i> behaviour - and, in effect, they have ended up &quot;in control&quot; but they haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;*taken* control&quot;.    The open source community thrives on this concept of
</I>&gt;<i> *earned* leadership/control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for providing us with the opportunity to share our experiences
</I>&gt;<i> with multi-stakeholder strategy development.  There is much more we can
</I>&gt;<i> share about strategy-related concepts and how they are encapsulated in the
</I>&gt;<i> OpenStrategy system (and could potentially be encapsulated in the excellent
</I>&gt;<i> StratML initiative).  However, I don't want to overstay your warm invitation
</I>&gt;<i> to engage with you so please let me know when you've had enough from us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> the inertia of institutionalism because communities will necessarily be
</I>&gt;<i> changing/merging/splitting as these conditions change. There is nothing
</I>&gt;<i> stopping a community from formally stating goals, but they may have to adapt
</I>&gt;<i> over time as conditions change. Or they may not... if they have defined
</I>&gt;<i> goals well enough to maintain a strong community.
