</I>
Yes but where does it come from? There has to be a source from which
it can be accumulated. If you allow each user to generate the currency
through scoring, you have the onset of inflation only bounded by the
largest number you can represent with a computer(unbounded for all
practical purposes). If you hand out a fixed amount per person you
have a situation where you must verify their identity, to prevent a
group from creating multiple accounts and thereby gaining
proportionally more of the currency.

A possible solution is paying for services to the community with the
currency. The community needs somebody to do some research on a topic,
make a proposal summarize a debate (whatever may be of value to them).
Collectively they agree to pay a certain amount. Once the system is
running you can adjust inflation with intrest/deprication rates based
on the total amount in circulation.

Since fiat currencies have a bad history though, it would be good to
be able to guarantee something for peoples money, so that it's a bit
more tangible. Otherwise you have to ask what is the currency worth? I
guess I should read on before I continue.
