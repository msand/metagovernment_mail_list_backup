<PRE>Thanks for stating what I was thinking, Mark.

Even to the degree that Michael's point of view may accurately reflect the
current state of affairs, we have it within our power to change the culture
and dynamics of the organizations of which we are a part.

Toward that end, I am pursuing the establishment of StratML as an
international voluntary consensus standard for potential use by all
organizations worldwide: <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm</A>  The reason I
subscribed to this list was to explore prospects for using Metascore to
provide stakeholder feedback on the goals and objectives set forth in
strategic and performance plans.

To borrow a phrase used by President Obama during the campaign, &quot;yes, we
can.&quot;

Michael,

I think your take on this is way too cynical.  I've had the opportunity to
meet Vivek Kundra and hear him speak, and I'm convinced he views substantive
transparency as the driving force behind his involvement in government.  I'm
confident that will remain his driving purpose as America's CIO, and that it
was for this reason that Obama chose him.

Your statement that substantive transparency in government is impossible is
an understandable reaction to the secrecy and manipulation we've become
accustomed to in government.  However, just because something hasn't
happened yet does not by any stretch make it impossible (I'm guessing you'd
agree and choose a different word here).  

Where does the authority of government come from?  In a democratic society,
it comes from us.  Transparency can serve to strengthen, not undermine, that
authority.  I will be an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Kundra's efforts.  I
think our chances of achieving our goals for better governance are much more
likely to be achieved through evolution than revolution.  I believe Mr.
Kundra represents the most encouraging evolutionary development we've seen
to bring about meaningful transparency in government.

Mark

&gt;<i>(a) Substantive transparency of governance is impossible.  It would be
</I>&gt;<i>unacceptable to government, as it would undermine the authority of its
</I>&gt;<i>decisions.  Government is all about authority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(b) Non-substansive transparency might be useful as an instrument of
</I>&gt;<i>propaganda.  Public opinion might be manipulated, for instance, by
</I>&gt;<i>selective transparency.  (But this sounds like a difficult knife
</I>&gt;<i>trick.  Other, safer channels of propaganda are available.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>(c) Transparency of services is perhaps all we can expect.  The
</I>&gt;<i>government may choose to expose parts of its bureaucracy to public
</I>&gt;<i>scrutiny.  This makes sense, because politicians are always at odds
</I>&gt;<i>with the bureaucracy.  Selective exposure might give them an added
</I>&gt;<i>lever of control over it.  (Not to mention, the level of service might
</I>&gt;<i>improve.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>So transparency might have no bearing on the public (as such), but
</I>&gt;<i>private individuals could benefit from improved services.  That's my
</I>&gt;<i>guess,
</I>&gt;<i>--
</I>&gt;<i>Michael Allan
