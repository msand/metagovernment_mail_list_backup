<PRE>Ed, Chris,

Could we have a full report on the trasparency camp?

I am really interested of what is going on there, and I am sorry I
could not come, but flying from one continent to the other was just a
bit too much.
As I am preparing the project to present to the first draft of the FP7;
I have a serious fear that whatever we come out with will be really
old, by the time we finish the work (provided we win), that is 4 years
from now.

It is for this reason that it is really important that we shoot high enough.
On the other side the people judging the project might not be aware of
how fast the progress is going in this area.
So as we present the proposal we will have to have enough references
of work that is already going on.

It seem to me that we are having 3 threads that are going on:
a trasparency thread
an open democracy thread
an open government thread

The transparency thread aims (only) at the government being fully
trasparent and fully accountable.
In a micro format, xml way so that we know in every moment what is going on.

The open democracy includes the transparency but would bring it
further as people are now voting on issues, and the suggestion might
be ratified by the represntatives, also some power might be given to
people like the power to ask for referendums, or to abrogate laws. But
essentially the power is still all in the hand of the representatives
of the people (as opposed to the people). This is what I suspect most
people highest ambition in terms of intersection between governance
and new technologies.

And finally the open government is what we are really here all about.
The idea, that for now is still a vague dream, that somehow it should
be possible to build a system where people interact directly through
the system, and have their ideas go through a darwinian system, and
gather momentum, and finally be enforced... with no small group of
people being in charge.

Now what I really would like to know is:
a) do other people at transparency camp percive the division in a similar way?
b) what is in place of those elements?
c)what is being developed of those elements

and finally I am really interested to know how are people imagining
and dreaming of point 3: the open government. As it is taking form
from the vague ideas.

By the way, I saw you paid 50$ for the metagovernment position. Can I
please chip in? I have paypal.

Looking forward for the responses, so that we can use them to write
the FP7 proposal. I shall write the metagovernment mindmap about it by
tomorrow.

Cheers,
Pietro
