<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> If you think that makes sense, please check out <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htmand">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htmand</A> let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me know if you think AIIM&#8217;s emerging Strategy Markup Language (StratML) standard might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fit into your plans for Metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone else from the project (Manuel?) may wish to write him back...
</I>
&gt;<i>From a cursory glance, the focus of StratML seems to be more on the
</I>side of government
transparency. I can't immediately say how well this will transfer to
our project, but in the long
run it would be beneficial to make all information in metascore
available through open standards.

Metascore would require some adaptation so that useful output can be
generated in StratML.
This may take the form of requiring specific formats for articles, so
that the software can
recognize it as expressing laws policies and as Owen Ambur mentions
&quot;strategic goals&quot; and
&quot;measurable objectives&quot; and from this representation be able to
produce StratML. This is my
initial idea of how this could fit into metascore, but I'm not
entirely familiar with the format,
so I may be missing something and maybe there are better ways to integrate it.

While this isn't something I personally want to focus on (certainly
not in the short term), I can see that it may become important and
would appreciate if somebody is interested specifically in this topic,
would dedicate themselves to it. Of course this is also an interesting
research topic for the
FP7 proposal.
