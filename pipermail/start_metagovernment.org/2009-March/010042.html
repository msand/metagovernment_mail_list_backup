I'm very intrigued by the idea of giving &quot;ownership&quot; of an issue to  
the author... especially since that ownership is non-exclusive. I  
think this blends well with Metascore's idea of a Synthesis Score.

&gt;<i> - issues can build a crowd (similar to having friends)
</I>&gt;<i> - people can get a &quot;reputation&quot; when other people vote for them or  
</I>&gt;<i> if they
</I>&gt;<i> manage to pass an issue through the whole process
</I>
Two very notable ideas I got from Whitehouse2.org (the author, Jim  
Gilliam is now a member of this list) were:

1. Participants can earn &quot;political capital&quot; and then they can spend  
it. This is more flexible than a simple user score, since your capital  
goes down as you spend it, meaning you have to choose wisely where you  
want to apply it.

2. Political capital has to be externally earned. That is, nobody can  
earn capital just by acting... it has to be given to them by other  
users.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ... My
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hope is that governments accept the proposals because of the good  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quality
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this kind of system will produce. Reason comes from the good  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> quality of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Votes are maybe the best measure of quality.  If a proposal has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stable consensus - stable, mind - then politicians are going to pay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, votes may be the only way to have a broad consensus and proof for
</I>&gt;<i> quality. It is easy to vote, but less people are commenting or  
</I>&gt;<i> discussing an
</I>&gt;<i> issue and even less people are doing the &quot;work&quot; by writing something.
</I>
Just to be clear here (and I understand this thread is about Gerold's  
published idea, not Metascore), the end goal of Metascore is to be a  
governance mechanism in itself. Instead of asking governments to  
accept citizens' ideas; we want to remove the distinction and make  
government the collection of the ideas of its participants.
