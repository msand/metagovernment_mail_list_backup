<PRE>Hi Ed, Owen and Jonathan
 
I agree totally with your comments about the evolutionary morphing of
communities and the need to avoid institutionalization.   
 
One of our arguments for having a standard strategy language - in our case
OpenStrategy - and for storing the evolving strategy on-line - is that such
a strategy can live on and evolve together with the community, rather than
being locked into a single rigid organisation/institution populated by
individuals who typically move on to new jobs just when they've started to
make useful contributions (thereby losing corporate/community memory).  
 
OpenStrategy captures/archives/evolves the collective wisdom/memory of a
community independent of any institutions.
 
We sometimes describe OpenStrategy as a 3rd generation strategy paradigm:

1.	

	1st generation - top-down: strategy driven top-down by the hierarchy
(management focused - simplistic)
2.	

	2nd generation - people networks:  strategy created by networking
people/organisations (network focused - 10s of thousands of conversations -
hugely complex)
3.	

	3rd generation (StratML/OpenStrategy) - idea networks:  strategy
created as an evolving network of interlinked ideas (ideas focused -
typically 100s of ideas - hence just moderately complex)

 
With respect to the concept of &quot;common interest&quot;:  we often say that if a
real-world community starts their strategy development by agreeing on
&quot;common goals&quot;.... they will fail....  almost always....    
 
Why?  
 
Because in our experience there are almost no common goals in real-world
communities.  There may be common value statements (eg a commitment to
&quot;fairness and equity&quot;, or &quot;good health for everyone&quot;, or a &quot;love of Brittany
Spears&quot;) but as soon as these high level statements are disaggregated into
details, commonality vanishes.  
 
We believe that the real world is made up of collections of SubGroups and
each SubGroup has reasonably common goals.  Therefore a full community
strategy needs to consist of integrated sets of SubStrategies each supported
by SubGroups, rather than a monolithic &quot;strategy&quot;.  In this way an
OpenStrategy parallels a software product which is assembled from
complementary open source modules, rather than a software product created by
a single vendor.
 
Where the SubStrategies don't conflict, life is easy.  
 
Where SubStrategies conflict, then the community needs to find ways to
address these conflicts.  We have proven methodologies/processes for doing
this, generally starting with identifying each SubGroup's desired Benefits
and working back through Uses, Results and Projects to come up with sets of
PRU's that will lead to Benefits for both SubGroups.
 
Another important characteristic: individual SubStrategies can grow, evolve,
be implemented and die a peaceful and celebrated death, while the community
strategy can continue it's evolutionary trajectory as SubStrategies come and
go.
 
I'd like to raise another concept we observe in relation to
multi-stakeholder strategies (or indeed to any multi-stakeholder activity):

 
&quot;Earning the right to lead&quot; rather than &quot;taking control&quot;.
 
We find that individual stakeholders will fight for the right to engage with
a multi-stakeholder activity but that often their enthusiasm soon wanes.
They insist on the right to engage, but are much more relaxed about actually
engaging long term. 
 
We've analysed this carefully and have concluded that in many instances,
stakeholders get involved initially in order to check that their interests
are being catered for - and they insist on the right to do this.  
 
If the key/lead stakeholders in the multi-stakeholder group are
transparently and effectively looking after the individual's interest, then
the individual often steps back and leaves the key stakeholders to get on
with, knowing that as individuals they can see what's going on and can step
back into the process at any time.  
 
The key/lead stakeholders, by initially performing transparently and
effectively, have &quot;earned the right to lead&quot; through their professional
behaviour - and, in effect, they have ended up &quot;in control&quot; but they haven't
&quot;taken control&quot;.    The open source community thrives on this concept of
earned leadership/control.
 
Thanks again for providing us with the opportunity to share our experiences
with multi-stakeholder strategy development.  There is much more we can
share about strategy-related concepts and how they are encapsulated in the
OpenStrategy system (and could potentially be encapsulated in the excellent
StratML initiative).  However, I don't want to overstay your warm invitation
to engage with you so please let me know when you've had enough from us.
 
Kind regards
 
Phil

With respect to the thought that &quot;communities last only as long as there is
interest,&quot; the communities in which I am most interested in participating
are those which:

a)      have clearly documented in open, readily sharable format (e.g.
StratML) what they aim to accomplish (longer-term goals and near-term
objectives), and
b)      measure and report progress against their common goals and
objectives.

To the degrees that goals may be achieved, there may be no need for the
community to continue to exist.  However, in many, if not most instances
there will be needs/opportunities for ongoing maintenance, if not also
enhancement of the results achieved


For the purposes of this project, communities are any collection of people
who share a common interest. So it could refer to the group of people
working for global nuclear disarmament, or the group of people who worship
Britney Spears.

This broad definition inherently includes the possibility of communities
morphing over time, as people's interests and attitudes change, and as the
environment in which the community operates changes. This thus solves for
the inertia of institutionalism because communities will necessarily be
changing/merging/splitting as these conditions change. There is nothing
stopping a community from formally stating goals, but they may have to adapt
over time as conditions change. Or they may not... if they have defined
goals well enough to maintain a strong community.
