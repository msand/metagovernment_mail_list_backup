<PRE>Hello,
as part of the FP7 proposal, we are trying to get an idea of the size
that an eGov website can have.

DOes anyone know what is the Obama website. I mean, I think he has a
website where people can suggest questions, and vote on each other
suggestions. Is this still so? And do we have info of the traffic that
that website had? Maybe just the adress might be enough, coupled with
Alexa.

Also, supposing we have x people going to such a website, how many of
them will actively participate in the discussion adding their own
proposals?

Any idea about the size of this would be of great help, as it would
help us to understand the proposal space we need to
order/search/manage.

And eventually a lot of problems are just: can you handle matrixes big enough?

Cheers,
Pietro
