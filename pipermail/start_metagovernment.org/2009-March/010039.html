<PRE>Hi Allen,

I was trying to catch up some of the issues you were discussing lately and the 
case studies on your pages which are very intersting. I like the P2P approach 
which reflects the function of the internet so far.

So finally here are my answers:

</I>&gt;<i> You allow competing drafts - variants of a single proposal.  So there

</I>&gt;<i> (enable and promote) a consensus, on a single draft?
</I>
I think the best is to separate the task into small and big dissents. For 
small dissents I would prefer if the group stays together in which case maybe 
a tool like the one they are using for developing the GPL could help: 
<A HREF="http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html">http://gplv3.fsf.org/comments/gplv3-draft-4.html</A> 

This has got the advantage that people can see which part of the article got 
edited and discussed most. They can also vote for a suggestion. 
I believe that in this case a separation because of little dissent will not 
happen so fast since bringing in ideas is very easy. 

Big issues need to split apart in my point of view and a poll can show which 
way is better later on.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you guard against the &quot;bias&quot;, as Tim here decribes it, &quot;towards
</I>&gt;<i> those relatively few entries [variants] that manage to gain an early
</I>&gt;<i> lead in net votes&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://groups.dowire.org/groups/consult/messages/topic/2IbPilDgy4CLnyMHbSjP">http://groups.dowire.org/groups/consult/messages/topic/2IbPilDgy4CLnyMHbSjP</A>
</I>&gt;<i>LB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, how can a newly introduced idea - a better variant -
</I>&gt;<i> climb to the top of the heap?
</I>
Getting an issue from the bottom to the top is indeed very difficult, therefore 
I think it has to go from &quot;top to bottom&quot;. 

I can could imagine the following process to be implemented:
(1) someone starts an issue (tags need to be set for filtering so that it is 
easy to find similar topics and avoid redundancy)
(2) this person is moderating the issue by accepting suggestions or ignoring 
them
(3a) if a group of people is not happy with the moderation, they start a 
separated issue by copying it with the whole history (this is what I mean with 
top to bottom)
(3b) if the problem gets to big the issue should be split in two or more parts 
to make it easier for the participants to follow the discussions (again top to 
bottom)
(4) finally the issues have to take a vote

Some additional ideas:
- issues can build a crowd (similar to having friends)
- people can get a &quot;reputation&quot; when other people vote for them or if they 
manage to pass an issue through the whole process
- issues can merge to one issue

&gt;<i> &gt;... My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hope is that governments accept the proposals because of the good quality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this kind of system will produce. Reason comes from the good quality of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Votes are maybe the best measure of quality.  If a proposal has a
</I>&gt;<i> stable consensus - stable, mind - then politicians are going to pay
</I>&gt;<i> attention.
</I>
Yes, votes may be the only way to have a broad consensus and proof for 
quality. It is easy to vote, but less people are commenting or discussing an 
issue and even less people are doing the &quot;work&quot; by writing something.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you point to design/theory docs, if any are posted?
</I>
I have written down some basic rules long time ago. There I was defining 
different levels of quality to provide issues for people that like to 
experiment and people that will only join if the issue has already got a kind 
of good quality. Though I think that this would be too complicated for a 
normal user to understand. This rules can be found here:
