For the purposes of this project, communities are any collection of  
people who share a common interest. So it could refer to the group of  
people working for global nuclear disarmament, or the group of people  
who worship Britney Spears.

This broad definition inherently includes the possibility of  
communities morphing over time, as people's interests and attitudes  
change, and as the environment in which the community operates  
changes. This thus solves for the inertia of institutionalism because  
communities will necessarily be changing/merging/splitting as these  
conditions change. There is nothing stopping a community from formally  
stating goals, but they may have to adapt over time as conditions  
change. Or they may not... if they have defined goals well enough to  
maintain a strong community.
