In most nonprofits, there is a fear among the founders (or later on,  
by a &quot;cabal&quot; of insiders) that if they open up too much, they will  
lose the project vision. With Metagovernment, I have found that my  
original vision has indeed been changed repeatedly by the open  
group... each time for the better. The key, as I see it, was in  
developing a good set of Basic Principles and letting the open group  
expound from there.
