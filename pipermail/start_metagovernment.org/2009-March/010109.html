<PRE>Hey Owen,

Hi and thanks for your thoughts on institutions and self-preservation.

I think I come from a completely different direction which is actually closer to Clay Shirky's thinking (in my opinion). For me self-preservation is first and foremost an emotional problem. As Clay Shirky says when an institution is formed the first goal changes from whatever the nominal goal was to self-preservation.

I was just walking to the neighborhood shop and thought that it would make sense for me to write a philosophical anthropological piece on the governance of geographic communities and self-preservation of the governing body. Even if there is no official body as soon as people come together to govern a territory the step towards institutionalization in my opinion is very small.

Consider the case of Jeltsin who in 1991 unilaterally decided to end the USSR (he even told Bush Senior before telling Gorbatsjov). This example was a very emotional affair. The exact opposite could happen in a local community where some people decide to charter the governance of the community in some institutional form despite the fact that there is something like meta government going on. I would like to explore this issue further if it hasn't already.

Steven

With respect to the thought that &#8220;communities last only as
long as there is interest,&#8221; the communities in which I am most interested
in participating are those which: 
 
a)      have
clearly documented in open, readily sharable format (e.g. StratML) what they
aim to accomplish (longer-term goals and near-term objectives), and
b)      measure
and report progress against their common goals and objectives.
 
To the degrees that goals may be achieved, there may be no need
for the community to continue to exist.  However, in many, if not most instances
there will be needs/opportunities for ongoing maintenance, if not also enhancement
of the results achieved.  For example, according to the opening clause of
our Constitution, the purpose of the USA is to &#8220;form a more perfect Union&#8221;
in the pursuit of other goals.  <A HREF="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Preamble">http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Preamble</A> 
 
Regarding the potential for using a widely distributed model -- <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore#Distribution_model">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore#Distribution_model</A> &#8211; it will be interesting to explore the degree to which it may be
possible to enable folks to post StratML documents anywhere they choose on the
Web and let the results speak for themselves &#8211; in StratML-enabled
performance reports.  It is not the subjective &#8220;scores&#8221; that
matter but, rather, the objective (measurable) results achieved.  The
OpenStrategies.com folks call such results &#8220;benefit&#8221; or &#8220;use&#8221;
&#8211; as in usage by the intended beneficiaries.  <A HREF="http://openstrategies.com/">http://openstrategies.com/</A>

But I
do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the institutional
trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community avoid or prevent or
defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex through meta government?
 
Hello, and welcome, Steven!
 
I believe that the nature of open, community governance is
inherently non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals
be empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead a
community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people who are
interested in participating in it, then communities last only as long as there
is interest.
 
Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller
factions, and sometimes they will merge into larger communities. As long as we
maintain communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then I think
the problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.
 
That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating
somewhat more formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from
foundations. But the threat of institutionalization has been one of
the serious objections to such a formation. See also:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>
 
If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if
we could form as one international institution and formally declare Metascore
to be our entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of directors).
Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for this just might be
Belgium. From what I understand, your country is the only place which
officially supports the formation of international organizations...
