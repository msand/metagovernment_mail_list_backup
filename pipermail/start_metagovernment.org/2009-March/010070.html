Dear all,

After reading the comments of all, I am tempted to forward an article I had
written some what recently on  'A prescription to end corruption' for
poverty alleviation, keeping the developing world particularly India in mind
where we see a lot of day to secrecy and corruption in the government and
bureaucracy.

A prescription to end corruption
Unique identification of every citizen will help kill the corruption malaise
in developing economies

Kris Dev, 
ICT &amp; e-Gov Consultant, Manthan Awardee for e-Inclusion &amp; Livelihood
Creation



What ails the under developed and developing nations? Reply: corruption
leading to self perpetuating poverty. Reason: lack of honesty &amp;
transparency. Result: lack of accountability for sustained growth. Economy
is divided between rich &amp; poor; the rich are growing richer and the poor are
growing poorer. The poor cannot afford essentials such as food, clothing,
shelter, health, education and social security. The division is so sharp
between communities, while a rich family can afford to spend Euro500 per
week on food items, a poor family of the same size can hardly spend Euro5
per week. 

Does this mean all citizens living in a poor nation are poor? Well the
answer is a 'NO'. The wealth in a under developed/developing nation is
skewed. Almost 80-90% of the wealth of the nation is in the control of say
5-10% of the population. The majority of the population hardly has access to
any wealth and live in abject poverty.

One of the biggest factors is 'Corruption.' It is the cancer eating into the
vitals of the society. It has permeated into all facets of life, affecting
the poor and voiceless. Today, the common man with no money or muscle power,
cannot think of getting any thing done in the developing world, without
having to pay bribe. 

Global institutions such as World Bank, IMF, and UN must enjoy legitimacy
from their member countries and the international community. They must be
responsive, with the interests of all members, especially the smaller and
poorer, being taken into account. The governance of these institutions must
be flexible, must respond to new challenges, national priorities and
specific circumstances.

A scathing report from the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of IMF
highlights the lack of transparency and accountability in IMF. The IEO
measured governance along four dimensions - effectiveness, efficiency,
accountability and voice - and against three standards - the Fund's own
governing documents, other international organisations, and private &amp;
public-sector corporations. The report finds accountability and voice are
the weakest features of the Fund's governance and these weaknesses entail
risks to the Fund's legitimacy, which in turn has a bearing on its
effectiveness. 

If this is the situation with global institutions, we can well imagine what
would be the situation with national and regional institutions. No wonder
they abound in corruption of all sorts and get away with it. Then, how do we
get over this corruption mania? One sure way would be to plug all the
leakages in the system. This cannot be done without active support of the
governments and its citizens. A unique identification of every citizen is
the primary requirement. With the advent of ICT tools, every citizen can be
uniquely identified from birth to death using unique identification methods
such as fingerprint, iris, hand vein geometry and DNA linked to their ID,
name, photo, etc. 

A Multi Purpose Biometric Smart Card for every individual and organisation
linked to a money account and a e-Tool to link every citizen and service
provider/public authority including the vertical and horizontal hierarchy of
governance can be used as a single window of transactions for G2C, G2G, B2B,
B2C, etc. If the transactions are thrown open, then total transparency and
accountability can prevail, as envisaged in the Right to Information Act.

Healthy citizenry can be created by covering all aspects of citizens from
birth to death such as health, hygiene, housing, education, employment,
expenses, consumption, savings, social security, et al, based on genuine
physical transactions and not ghost transactions. Thus corruption, money
laundering, arms trade and terrorism can be eliminated and all round peace
and prosperity can prevail as every one would feel good that no one can
cheat any one and all have equitable opportunities to contribute and grow.

I guess it's about helping government to do a better job.  But we're
aimed at replacing government (Metagovernment), or at removing
decision-making from its hands (DemocracyLab, Votorola, et al).  Our
focus is therefore on helping the public sphere to do a better job.

With regard to government, consider three types of transparency, of:

 a) governance (substansive)  -  impossible

 b) governance (non-substansive)

 c) services

(a) Substansive transparency of governance is impossible.  It would be
unacceptable to government, as it would undermine the authority of its
decisions.  Government is all about authority.

(b) Non-substansive transparency might be useful as an instrument of
propaganda.  Public opinion might be manipulated, for instance, by
selective transparency.  (But this sounds like a difficult knife
trick.  Other, safer channels of propaganda are available.)

(c) Transparency of services is perhaps all we can expect.  The
government may choose to expose parts of its bureaucracy to public
scrutiny.  This makes sense, because politicians are always at odds
with the bureaucracy.  Selective exposure might give them an added
lever of control over it.  (Not to mention, the level of service might
improve.)

So transparency might have no bearing on the public (as such), but
private individuals could benefit from improved services.  That's my
guess,
