<PRE>Hi Robert,

Thanks for your thoughts. My comments are interleaved....

2009/3/17 Robert Peters &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">thewinterlion at googlemail.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i>  Hi Kris,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if someone steals my pen drive?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> They can't use it as biometric control (finger print / palm reader / iris)
</I>&gt;<i> would prevent anyone else opening it! Biometric pen drive helps in
</I>&gt;<i> one-to-one authentication and validating transaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if I buy pornography today, and then 5 years from now
</I>&gt;<i> pornography is outlawed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If it is legal to buy pornography now and if it pleases you to buy, please
do so ... When it becomes illegal, you cannot be questioned for buying it
earlier, but you have moral obligation to return / destroy / account for
it!  The biometric smart card would help to curb such illegal action as
every transaction would get accounted genuinely. Arms trade, drugs trade,
money laundering etc. would vanish.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What happens if I bought some cancer drugs for my mother, and then apply
</I>&gt;<i> for life insurance and am declined because they think I may have cancer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If your mother had cancer, it would show up in her biometric medical
records. If you bought medicines for her, it has to be so declared. On a
medical check-up, the insurance company can ascertain that you do not have
cancer and that your mother has cancer. Hence there would be no problem with
your insurance cover!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are just the first three things that come to my mind.  There are an
</I>&gt;<i> infinite number of ways that this system could be abused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Biometric smart card would leave an irrefutable / indelible proof of actions
and hence an audit trail for any one to follow any time ....

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, privacy has a long and proven history of protecting people from
</I>&gt;<i> oppression.  You must find another way to eliminate corruption that protects
</I>&gt;<i> people's privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Random ID would protect privacy of those who function within the law. Law
breakers can be identified by community / society and hence would fear wrong
action. Right action need not be feared. When challenged by any one the
action has to be defended as right. If it cannot be defended, then it is
wrong and such action has to be reversed or punishment faced.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To convince you to take a different path, have you looked for any
</I>&gt;<i> correlation between a country's privacy index and their corruption index?
</I>&gt;<i> For example, Canada is 9th of 180 on Transparency International's Corruption
</I>&gt;<i> Perceptions Index.  They are 2nd on Privacy International's yearly privacy
</I>&gt;<i> ranking of countries.  So clearly it is possible to have low corruption and
</I>&gt;<i> high privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That possibly speaks of the high level of ethics of the individuals, family,
community, organizations, states and nation. I am not following Canadian
ethics to comment on it. But my hunch is, the ethics followed in canada may
not be uniform throughout the country. There must be pockets of relatively
unethical action, followed in public / private life. Probably their wants
may be limited within their means and probably greed has not over taken
them!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All this to say that, yes, eliminating all personal privacy may reduce
</I>&gt;<i> corruption, but it would also eliminate many other rights and freedoms that
</I>&gt;<i> humans enjoy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What one does with oneself or family is privacy. But when it spills into the
public domain, then it should be transparent.

If we were being bothered by some rabbits eating our garden, we could spray
&gt;<i> poison from an airplane on all the country surrounding our garden, killing
</I>&gt;<i> the rabbits, and many other animals and people as well, destroying the
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem entirely.  Or, we could set some small traps that only rabbits
</I>&gt;<i> could trip in our own garden.  Which seems a better solution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I can only go by my pet whom we lost a few months ago. I felt, he had no
worries in life. Every thing was transparent for him and he lived by the
moment and not apparently worried about the past / present / future but to
enjoy the present to the maximum.

To give another analogy, one man's food is another man's poisin. A
businessman may be saying he is doing ethical business with the customer;
but he may be using the law to his advantage when he uses his contact in the
government to reduce the import duty on his raw materials and he is able to
make a huge profit.

A multi purpose biometric smart card linked public transaction would show up
the cost of import and cost of manfacture vis-a-vis sale price and profit.
If the profit margins are high, he could well be questioned, if made public
and others can come in and reduce the price, etc.

He may even treat his contact in government to a fully paid vacation in
Hawaii!!  In the first step, both of them would not be indulging in the
wrong action, as they can get exposed that the trip was ill gotten and paid
by some one else as the biometric smart card of both would reveal the actual
situation!!

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I like this ongoing debate on this subject and it is best we come to a
logical conclusion. If you have a better and fool proof method of
eliminating corruption in public and private life to create a ethical
citizenry, than the &quot;Annonymous Yet Transparent Transaction&quot; using Biometric
Smart Card, I advocate, please feel free to suggest. You are most welcome
and I shall be the first to stand corrected. But the false notion of privacy
leading to secrecy and corruption bugs me...

Best,

Kris Dev

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> the public at large and if the public money is ill spent, the same should be
</I>&gt;<i> recovered from them. Public voting and score card should be the system of
</I>&gt;<i> identifying whether the money is well spent or ill spent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are your thoughts on the above?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While the elimination of corruption is a worthy goal, your solution sounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worse than the disease.  It seems to erase every last vestige of privacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from your citizens.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you uniquely identify every citizen, where will you store this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information?  Who will have access to it?  Who will audit it?  Who will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> determine what I am allowed to buy?  What will happen if a hacker gains
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> access to the database (which they most assuredly will at some point)?  How
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can I be assured that my legal purchase now won't become illegal later, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how can I be assured that I won't be punished for it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Privacy has proven a time-tested deterrent to oppression.  Would you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really throw it out to potentially eliminate corruption?  I think you need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to come up with a different solution, one that doesn't drive a stake into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the heart of personal privacy.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What ails the under developed and developing nations? Reply: corruption
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leading to self perpetuating poverty. Reason: lack of honesty &amp;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transparency. Result: lack of accountability for sustained growth. Economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is divided between rich &amp; poor; the rich are growing richer and the poor are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> growing poorer. The poor cannot afford essentials such as food, clothing,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shelter, health, education and social security. The division is so sharp
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between communities, while a rich family can afford to spend Euro500 per
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> week on food items, a poor family of the same size can hardly spend Euro5
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> per week.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Does this mean all citizens living in a poor nation are poor? Well the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer is a 'NO'. The wealth in a under developed/developing nation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skewed. Almost 80-90% of the wealth of the nation is in the control of say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5-10% of the population. The majority of the population hardly has access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any wealth and live in abject poverty.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the biggest factors is 'Corruption.' It is the cancer eating into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the vitals of the society. It has permeated into all facets of life,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affecting the poor and voiceless. Today, the common man with no money or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> muscle power, cannot think of getting any thing done in the developing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> world, without having to pay bribe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Global institutions such as World Bank, IMF, and UN must enjoy legitimacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from their member countries and the international community. They must be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> responsive, with the interests of all members, especially the smaller and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poorer, being taken into account. The governance of these institutions must
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be flexible, must respond to new challenges, national priorities and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific circumstances.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A scathing report from the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of IMF
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highlights the lack of transparency and accountability in IMF. The IEO
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> measured governance along four dimensions &#8211; effectiveness, efficiency,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accountability and voice &#8211; and against three standards &#8211; the Fund's own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governing documents, other international organisations, and private &amp;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public-sector corporations. The report finds accountability and voice are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the weakest features of the Fund's governance and these weaknesses entail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risks to the Fund's legitimacy, which in turn has a bearing on its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectiveness.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If this is the situation with global institutions, we can well imagine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what would be the situation with national and regional institutions. No
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wonder they abound in corruption of all sorts and get away with it. Then,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how do we get over this corruption mania? One sure way would be to plug all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the leakages in the system. This cannot be done without active support of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the governments and its citizens. A unique identification of every citizen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is the primary requirement. With the advent of ICT tools, every citizen can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be uniquely identified from birth to death using unique identification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methods such as fingerprint, iris, hand vein geometry and DNA linked to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their ID, name, photo, etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A Multi Purpose Biometric Smart Card for every individual and organisation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> linked to a money account and a e-Tool to link every citizen and service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provider/public authority including the vertical and horizontal hierarchy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance can be used as a single window of transactions for G2C, G2G, B2B,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B2C, etc. If the transactions are thrown open, then total transparency and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> accountability can prevail, as envisaged in the Right to Information Act.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Healthy citizenry can be created by covering all aspects of citizens from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> birth to death such as health, hygiene, housing, education, employment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expenses, consumption, savings, social security, et al, based on genuine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> physical transactions and not ghost transactions. Thus corruption, money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laundering, arms trade and terrorism can be eliminated and all round peace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and prosperity can prevail as every one would feel good that no one can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cheat any one and all have equitable opportunities to contribute and grow.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  I guess it's about helping government to do a better job.  But we're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> aimed at replacing government (Metagovernment), or at removing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decision-making from its hands (DemocracyLab, Votorola, et al).  Our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> focus is therefore on helping the public sphere to do a better job.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> With regard to government, consider three types of transparency, of:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  a) governance (substansive)  -  impossible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  b) governance (non-substansive)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  c) services
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (a) Substansive transparency of governance is impossible.  It would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unacceptable to government, as it would undermine the authority of its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions.  Government is all about authority.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (b) Non-substansive transparency might be useful as an instrument of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> propaganda.  Public opinion might be manipulated, for instance, by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> selective transparency.  (But this sounds like a difficult knife
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trick.  Other, safer channels of propaganda are available.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (c) Transparency of services is perhaps all we can expect.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> government may choose to expose parts of its bureaucracy to public
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scrutiny.  This makes sense, because politicians are always at odds
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with the bureaucracy.  Selective exposure might give them an added
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lever of control over it.  (Not to mention, the level of service might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> improve.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So transparency might have no bearing on the public (as such), but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> private individuals could benefit from improved services.  That's my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> guess,
