<PRE>fyi, there are some folks who have been working on reputation systems for
some time, and wikipedia has some good research linked up.

&gt;<i> Manuel, I tend to agree with you that incompetence and the law of
</I>&gt;<i> unintended
</I>&gt;<i> consequences are probably a bigger parts of the problem than outright
</I>&gt;<i> corruption, at least in the cultures with which I am most familiar.
</I>&gt;<i> However, Charles Ford has asserted that everyone lies; the only difference
</I>&gt;<i> is a matter of degree. <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Lies.htm">http://ambur.net/Lies.htm</A>  Robyn Dawes has made a
</I>&gt;<i> similar point about irrationality:  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm">http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A variation on the theme of power corrupting and absolute power corrupting
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely is the notion that leaders have risen to their level of
</I>&gt;<i> incompetence, and by deferring responsibility to leaders, we are virtually
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteeing as much.  Jean Lipman-Blumen argues there are all sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> reasons we may actually prefer to do so:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf">http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So while I share your feeling that it would be nice in a perfect world if
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> were unnecessary to require our leaders (if not also ourselves) to be held
</I>&gt;<i> personally accountable, I also agree with President Reagan's famous
</I>&gt;<i> admonition: &quot;Trust, but verify.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those who are indeed trustworthy have nothing to fear from verification.
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, they may take it as a badge of courage.  To the degree that Ford is
</I>&gt;<i> right, it will distinguish them as being worthy of leadership.  Those who
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to be held personally accountable deserve neither our trust nor our
</I>&gt;<i> deference to them as leaders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I disagree with your suggestion that technology hardly ever solves
</I>&gt;<i> social problems.  While it is true that technology in and of itself is
</I>&gt;<i> amoral, the power to change human nature is above our pay grade.  On the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, it is well within our power to innovate and change our
</I>&gt;<i> *organizations* by taking advantage of new technical capabilities to help
</I>&gt;<i> us
</I>&gt;<i> overcome our frailties as human beings. <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm">http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, I would argue that technological advancement is not only the
</I>&gt;<i> historically universal way but also the *only* way to make real,
</I>&gt;<i> sustainable
</I>&gt;<i> progress (at least in this world).

</I>&gt;<i> Sent: Tuesday, March 17, 2009 12:25 PM

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [Start] Wired How-to: Open Up Government Data
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to add that there is the underlying topic of trust and
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility here. Tracking everybody with a smartcard sends the
</I>&gt;<i> message that nobody can be trusted and that in turn you should trust
</I>&gt;<i> nobody. I think this kind of system would be tearing at the fabric of
</I>&gt;<i> society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The starting point should be that people can be trusted and encourage
</I>&gt;<i> them to take on responsibility. You can't expect everybody to comply
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think we're looking for a perfect solution. People who
</I>&gt;<i> abuse trust should be punished on a case to case basis and so long as
</I>&gt;<i> we have a system where we can find out about most abuses once they
</I>&gt;<i> happen, I don't think we need to set up a big brother state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also I would point out that technological solutions alone hardly ever
</I>&gt;<i> solve social problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally I think the main problem in our governments are incompetent
</I>&gt;<i> do gooders rather than corruption, so I don't even think that the
</I>&gt;<i> right question is being asked.
