<PRE>I would like to add that there is the underlying topic of trust and
responsibility here. Tracking everybody with a smartcard sends the
message that nobody can be trusted and that in turn you should trust
nobody. I think this kind of system would be tearing at the fabric of
society.

The starting point should be that people can be trusted and encourage
them to take on responsibility. You can't expect everybody to comply
but I don't think we're looking for a perfect solution. People who
abuse trust should be punished on a case to case basis and so long as
we have a system where we can find out about most abuses once they
happen, I don't think we need to set up a big brother state.

Also I would point out that technological solutions alone hardly ever
solve social problems.

Personally I think the main problem in our governments are incompetent
do gooders rather than corruption, so I don't even think that the
right question is being asked.

Manuel
