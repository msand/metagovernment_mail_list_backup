Hello, and welcome, Steven!

I believe that the nature of open, community governance is inherently  
non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals  
be empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead  
a community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people  
who are interested in participating in it, then communities last only  
as long as there is interest.

Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller factions, and  
sometimes they will merge into larger communities. As long as we  
maintain communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then  
I think the problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.

That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating somewhat more  
formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from  
foundations. But the threat of institutionalization has been one of  
the serious objections to such a formation. See also:

If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if we could  
form as one international institution and formally declare Metascore  
to be our entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of  
directors). Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for  
this just might be Belgium. From what I understand, your country is  
the only place which officially supports the formation of  
international organizations...
