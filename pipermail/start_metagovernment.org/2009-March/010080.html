<PRE>Robert and Owen,

Biometric pen/zip drives can hold all personal information about the
individual and his / her transactions. A central database can also hold
information. When the ID is a random generated number no one can have access
to your identity but know all the transactions done and can question non
genuine transactions. Transparency would make people not to resort to
corruption. You can choose what to do or buy. But every thing you do would
be in the public domain and at any time now or in future any one is
accountable for their actions and any wrong action reversed. This in my
opinion would eliminate privacy to the extent of keeping secret all
transactions which has been the bane of our society. But at the same time,
there has to be freedom for any one to do genuine transactions as they wish.


As far as Governments are concerned, it is an assembly of persons holding
certain positions of authority and spending public money. Business
organizations and middlemen can collude in wrong spending. So we need to be
vigilant as to how well the money is spent. The transparency attached to
transactions can make public servants accountable for their transactions to
the public at large and if the public money is ill spent, the same should be
recovered from them. Public voting and score card should be the system of
identifying whether the money is well spent or ill spent.

What are your thoughts on the above?


Best,

Kris Dev

&gt;<i>  While the elimination of corruption is a worthy goal, your solution sounds
</I>&gt;<i> worse than the disease.  It seems to erase every last vestige of privacy
</I>&gt;<i> from your citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When you uniquely identify every citizen, where will you store this
</I>&gt;<i> information?  Who will have access to it?  Who will audit it?  Who will
</I>&gt;<i> determine what I am allowed to buy?  What will happen if a hacker gains
</I>&gt;<i> access to the database (which they most assuredly will at some point)?  How
</I>&gt;<i> can I be assured that my legal purchase now won't become illegal later, and
</I>&gt;<i> how can I be assured that I won't be punished for it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Privacy has proven a time-tested deterrent to oppression.  Would you really
</I>&gt;<i> throw it out to potentially eliminate corruption?  I think you need to come
</I>&gt;<i> up with a different solution, one that doesn't drive a stake into the heart
</I>&gt;<i> of personal privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert

</I>&gt;<i> Unique identification of every citizen will help kill the corruption

</I>&gt;<i> What ails the under developed and developing nations? Reply: corruption
</I>&gt;<i> leading to self perpetuating poverty. Reason: lack of honesty &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> transparency. Result: lack of accountability for sustained growth. Economy
</I>&gt;<i> is divided between rich &amp; poor; the rich are growing richer and the poor are
</I>&gt;<i> growing poorer. The poor cannot afford essentials such as food, clothing,
</I>&gt;<i> shelter, health, education and social security. The division is so sharp
</I>&gt;<i> between communities, while a rich family can afford to spend Euro500 per
</I>&gt;<i> week on food items, a poor family of the same size can hardly spend Euro5
</I>&gt;<i> per week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Does this mean all citizens living in a poor nation are poor? Well the
</I>&gt;<i> answer is a 'NO'. The wealth in a under developed/developing nation is
</I>&gt;<i> skewed. Almost 80-90% of the wealth of the nation is in the control of say
</I>&gt;<i> 5-10% of the population. The majority of the population hardly has access to
</I>&gt;<i> any wealth and live in abject poverty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the biggest factors is 'Corruption.' It is the cancer eating into
</I>&gt;<i> the vitals of the society. It has permeated into all facets of life,
</I>&gt;<i> affecting the poor and voiceless. Today, the common man with no money or
</I>&gt;<i> muscle power, cannot think of getting any thing done in the developing
</I>&gt;<i> world, without having to pay bribe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Global institutions such as World Bank, IMF, and UN must enjoy legitimacy
</I>&gt;<i> from their member countries and the international community. They must be
</I>&gt;<i> responsive, with the interests of all members, especially the smaller and
</I>&gt;<i> poorer, being taken into account. The governance of these institutions must
</I>&gt;<i> be flexible, must respond to new challenges, national priorities and
</I>&gt;<i> specific circumstances.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A scathing report from the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO) of IMF
</I>&gt;<i> highlights the lack of transparency and accountability in IMF. The IEO
</I>&gt;<i> measured governance along four dimensions &#8211; effectiveness, efficiency,
</I>&gt;<i> accountability and voice &#8211; and against three standards &#8211; the Fund's own
</I>&gt;<i> governing documents, other international organisations, and private &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> public-sector corporations. The report finds accountability and voice are
</I>&gt;<i> the weakest features of the Fund's governance and these weaknesses entail
</I>&gt;<i> risks to the Fund's legitimacy, which in turn has a bearing on its
</I>&gt;<i> effectiveness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the situation with global institutions, we can well imagine what
</I>&gt;<i> would be the situation with national and regional institutions. No wonder
</I>&gt;<i> they abound in corruption of all sorts and get away with it. Then, how do we
</I>&gt;<i> get over this corruption mania? One sure way would be to plug all the
</I>&gt;<i> leakages in the system. This cannot be done without active support of the
</I>&gt;<i> governments and its citizens. A unique identification of every citizen is
</I>&gt;<i> the primary requirement. With the advent of ICT tools, every citizen can be
</I>&gt;<i> uniquely identified from birth to death using unique identification methods
</I>&gt;<i> such as fingerprint, iris, hand vein geometry and DNA linked to their ID,
</I>&gt;<i> name, photo, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Multi Purpose Biometric Smart Card for every individual and organisation
</I>&gt;<i> linked to a money account and a e-Tool to link every citizen and service
</I>&gt;<i> provider/public authority including the vertical and horizontal hierarchy of
</I>&gt;<i> governance can be used as a single window of transactions for G2C, G2G, B2B,
</I>&gt;<i> B2C, etc. If the transactions are thrown open, then total transparency and
</I>&gt;<i> accountability can prevail, as envisaged in the Right to Information Act.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Healthy citizenry can be created by covering all aspects of citizens from
</I>&gt;<i> birth to death such as health, hygiene, housing, education, employment,
</I>&gt;<i> expenses, consumption, savings, social security, et al, based on genuine
</I>&gt;<i> physical transactions and not ghost transactions. Thus corruption, money
</I>&gt;<i> laundering, arms trade and terrorism can be eliminated and all round peace
</I>&gt;<i> and prosperity can prevail as every one would feel good that no one can
</I>&gt;<i> cheat any one and all have equitable opportunities to contribute and grow.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I guess it's about helping government to do a better job.  But we're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aimed at replacing government (Metagovernment), or at removing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-making from its hands (DemocracyLab, Votorola, et al).  Our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> focus is therefore on helping the public sphere to do a better job.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With regard to government, consider three types of transparency, of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  a) governance (substansive)  -  impossible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  b) governance (non-substansive)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  c) services
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a) Substansive transparency of governance is impossible.  It would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unacceptable to government, as it would undermine the authority of its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions.  Government is all about authority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (b) Non-substansive transparency might be useful as an instrument of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> propaganda.  Public opinion might be manipulated, for instance, by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> selective transparency.  (But this sounds like a difficult knife
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trick.  Other, safer channels of propaganda are available.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (c) Transparency of services is perhaps all we can expect.  The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government may choose to expose parts of its bureaucracy to public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> scrutiny.  This makes sense, because politicians are always at odds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the bureaucracy.  Selective exposure might give them an added
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lever of control over it.  (Not to mention, the level of service might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improve.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So transparency might have no bearing on the public (as such), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> private individuals could benefit from improved services.  That's my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> guess,
