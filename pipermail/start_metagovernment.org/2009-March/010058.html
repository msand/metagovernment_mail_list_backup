May we look at an example?  Consider a national legislative bill.  A
single participant (P) has an idea.  She wishes to modify the bill in
a certain way.  Her modification is such that - given a few hours of
preparatory discussion - people are generally:

  20% against

  40% neutral

  40% for

It's an important bill, so we can expect a turnout of 150 million at
the polls.  How is P's idea eventually promulgated as law?  Please
walk me through the steps: 1, 2... N.

&gt;<i> &gt; Power has a price.  So the process will be mediated by money, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How can money be relevant if everything is transparent and the person in 
</I>&gt;<i> *power* has actually no right since she/he can easily be *exchanged*? Maybe I 
</I>&gt;<i> just don't see it.
</I>
It's a problem for all methods.  It's not particular to yours.  But
yours may be especially susceptible.  As you imply, it all depends on
the difficulty of exchanging one mediator for another - the difficulty
of forking.

Can you take me through a successful fork?  I was assuming a messy
process, a process that the average participant would be reluctant to
repeat.
