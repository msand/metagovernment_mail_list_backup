<PRE>Dear friends,

My name is Steven Devijver, I live in Belgium and I've joined this mailing list yesterday. I guess that makes me an aspiring Meta Government member.

I have a keen interest in local government in the context of the collapse of nation-states which if you ask me is unavoidable and upon us. I can talk for hours on this subject which I won't do here but you can poke me if you want to or check my blog at <A HREF="http://endesha.com/blog">http://endesha.com/blog</A>

I'm interested in the meta government project since it tries to establish an alternative governance system to the current power mongering which leads to inequality. I think it's important to provide some kind of transition once the current collapse is complete and it's important for me to be part of this in some way. 

But I do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the institutional trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community avoid or prevent or defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex through meta government?

I saw the mail on greenpeace pass through my mailbox this morning which to me is a typical example of the self-preservation reflex. I use self-preservation in the context of Clay Shirky's wonderful &quot;Institutions vs collaboration&quot; talk:

I'm looking forward to getting to know you and finding my spot in the meta government project. Right now I'm not sure where that spot is but I'm excited to find out.

Kind regards

Steven Devijver
