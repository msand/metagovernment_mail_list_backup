Agreed in principle; which is why for the short term this project  
basically ignores large (or even small) governments and instead  
intends to target small communities with representative democracies,  
such as clubs, non-profit startups, etc. Not only is it much easier to  
get a foothold there; it also will be a great learning experience to  
start there and gradually scale upward.

20 years may be optimistic... or it may be far too long. It is  
difficult to tell, since internet phenomena can boom into major public  
institutions in an extremely short time. If we can build a good  
community governance mechanism, it is not impossible to imagine it  
could start replacing city governments (or pieces of them, such as  
school boards) in just a few years. And it is also possible it could  
take 50 or more years... we will just have to see what happens.
