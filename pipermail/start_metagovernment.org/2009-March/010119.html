<PRE>Chris, I don't see a section entitled &quot;Scoring System&quot; on the &quot;Talk&quot; page:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page</A> 

 

I do see a link to <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system</A> 

 

I'm unsure on which suggestions you are seeking comments.  However, based
upon Surowiecki's views on the wisdom of crowds, it may be better: 

 

a) *not* to engage in debate, and 

 

b) to require simultaneous rather than sequential &quot;scoring&quot; (voting) ... or
at least to make sure that no one knows how anyone else has voted before
they do so.  

 

Otherwise the risks include social proof, information cascades, and
confirmation bias.

 

Surowiecki asserts: &quot;Organizations ... clearly can and should have people
offer their judgments simultaneously, rather than one after the other [since
one] key to successful group decisions is getting people to pay much less
attention to what everyone else is saying.&quot;
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A>

 

He also notes the importance of diversity in the decision-making group.
Lacking at least a devil's advocate, he says group polarization is likely to
occur, whereby

discussion leads groups to adopt more extreme, rather than more rational
positions.

 

BTW, although I have great respect for Surowiecki's arguments, he may wish
to rethink this point in light of the Madhoff and other scandals in the
marketplace:

 

. capitalism has evolved over the centuries toward greater trust and
transparency - not because capitalists are naturally good people but because
the &quot;benefits of trust ... are potentially immense, and because a successful
market system teaches people to recognize those benefits...&quot;

 

Evidence suggests that none of us is very good at recognizing who is and is
not trustworthy.  In short, trust is no substitute for verification, and
verification should be based upon records having the attributes outlined in
ISO 15489.  Otherwise, statistically speaking, crime often does pay, and it
is easy to fool most of the people most of the time.  Indeed, who knows on
how many issues all of us are still being fooled all of the time?

Hello everyone

I've put some suggestions on the talk page under 'Scoring System'. I'd like
to know what you think.
