<PRE>I agree with you completely, Manuel.

In our attempts to solve social problems, it is often easier to attempt 
a technological solution than it is to take a long and serious look at 
what the root cause of the social problem is.  Looking at the root 
social cause may expose our weakness and short-comings, and we find this 
uncomfortable.  It's much easier to simply issue everyone with a 
biometric chip in their skull.

Kind regards,
Korey
