<PRE>Hey Ed,

It appears you are correct about the legal entity form in belgium. It's called an international organization without profit intentions (rough translation). I've actually found a legal document regarding such an organization:

<A HREF="http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/files/BelgianOfficialJournal20070806.pdf">http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/files/BelgianOfficialJournal20070806.pdf</A>

It's regarding the IAAS or International Association of Students in Agriculture and Related Sciences:

<A HREF="http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/">http://iaasinternational.studentenweb.org/site/</A>

They're actually located not too far from where I live (but then again Belgium is not big) so I guess I could get in touch with them to learn more details.

It's good to hear that you guys have exactly the same concerns as I have. Btw, I've looked at the current workload and there isn't too much on there that sound like a match for me. The only thing I could do on the short term is contact the IAAS people and see if we can get them involved somehow. How does that sound?

Btw, my personal wiki page is <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Devijvers">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Devijvers</A>

But I do have a question: how do you see meta government avoid the institutional trap? Or to put it differently: how does or can a community avoid or prevent or defuse the institutional self-preservation reflex through meta government?

Hello, and welcome, Steven!

I believe that the nature of open, community governance is inherently non-institutional. As long as we avoid having designated individuals be empowered, there is nobody to preserve the institution. If instead a community is defined by the mere fact of the collection of people who are interested in participating in it, then communities last only as long as there is interest.

Sometimes communities will dissolve into smaller factions, and sometimes they will merge into larger communities. As long as we maintain communities-of-interest as the basic unit of governance, then I think the problem of over-preserved institutions cannot be a problem.


That said... we have been tentatively exploring creating somewhat more formal institutions in order to be able to attract funding from foundations. But the threat of institutionalization has been one of the serious objections to such a formation. See also:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>

If we do form an institution, it would be of great benefit if we could form as one international institution and formally declare Metascore to be our entire governance structure (ie, as opposed to a board of directors). Interestingly, the best candidate for a host nation for this just might be Belgium. From what I understand, your country is the only place which officially supports the formation of international organizations...
