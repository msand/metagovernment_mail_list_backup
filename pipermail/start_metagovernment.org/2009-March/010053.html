I couldn't agree more, Manuel. What we (and I mean collectively this  
and all the related projects) are working toward is not just a shared  
right to participate, but a shared *responsibility* of governance. A  
system which allows everyone to input into any decision as they please  
places the burden on all citizens to act when they feel action is  
necessary. (And as you note, it removes the opportunity for people to  
whine about the status quo.)

The popular English diction Merriam-Webster gives two definitions for  
politician:
<A HREF="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politician">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/politician</A>
1: a person experienced in the art or science of government ;  
especially : one actively engaged in conducting the business of a  
government
2 a: a person engaged in party politics as a profession b: a person  
primarily interested in political office for selfish or other narrow  
usually short-sighted reasons

What we are doing is very consistent with the first definition: in  
that we enable everyone to be a politician. And it is very  
inconsistent with the second definition. I very much look forward to  
the day when everyone is a politician as a mere fact of citizenship  
(much like the ancient Greeks saw it), and where no one does it  
professionally.
