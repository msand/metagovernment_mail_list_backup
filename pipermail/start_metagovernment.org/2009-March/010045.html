<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thanks Ed for your review.
I fully agree with you that we need a software.

I especially liked:

&gt;<i> There were numerous times when I saw the ideas of Metagovernment blooming in
</I>&gt;<i> people's heads. But they couldn't really grasp it because they couldn't see
</I>&gt;<i> it (and because still too many people are deeply conditioned to think an
</I>&gt;<i> authority figure is necessary).
</I>...
&gt;<i> My promotions sounded like
</I>&gt;<i> fringe-babbling without something to point to. No amount of publicity will
</I>&gt;<i> be able to compare to our successful governance of ourselves via Metascore.
</I>&gt;<i>95% of people are instantly dismissive of governance without singular
</I>&gt;<i> authority, so the burden is entirely on us to prove it before we have a
</I>&gt;<i> chance of reaching them.
</I>...
&gt;<i> That's most of what I have to report. Mostly, people were very buried in the
</I>&gt;<i> status quo, and very focused on the American federal government, so my
</I>&gt;<i> influence there was somewhat limited.
</I>
I will now finalize the preparation for tomorrow's meeting.

Cheers,
Pietro
