<PRE>A post I had made sometime back (below) may be relevant to what is stated by
Mat&#237;as Battocchia &quot;For a patch, *corruption must be reduced first*, because
it is the cause that prevents the appliance of more equitable policies&quot;.

Transparency and Accountability

 Openness of thought and action in every individual is
... more&gt;&gt; &lt;javascript:toggle_req('more_com2','more_com1');&gt;  Openness of
thought and action in every individual is
transparency in life. It would result in self accountability.
This alone can lead to all round peace and prosperity and give a
new meaning to life.

Secrecy in life, can lead to corruption of the mind, thereby creating
unhappiness for the self and community. With secrecy we tend to indulge in
wrong thoughts and actions as we think we can get away with it. Invariably
we do get away also and this encourages us to further indulge in wrong
thoughts and actions. With openness and transparency, every action of ours
can be questioned and challenged by the community.

This would bring about a transformation in our thought process.
We would not tend to put self before others, at any cost! Instead
we would say, self before others only if it is acceptable to all.
Saying it in another way, we would say, self along with
others. This would create equality of opportunity for all and
a level playing field where every one contributes.
