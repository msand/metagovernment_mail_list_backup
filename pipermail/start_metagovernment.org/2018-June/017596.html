<PRE>As for the measurement and goal distinction. I am not sure what to expect...
In the first phase, the goal of the Positive Affect Search Engine is
simple. Maximize affect balance of individual users.
Next, we will see if it will hurt the common sense of justice, equality.
Whether there will be some detrimental stable social formations, that will
resist the power of the basic algorithm, etc.

Well, to return your job... Do you think that designing systems for
societies with different psychological health is different?

Regards,
Michal

</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Also I am not entirely in the &quot;idea of progress&quot;, progress is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meaningless if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you do not enjoy life while progress is done.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BS: Look into this thing called &quot;delayed gratification&quot;. It's the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing that separates successful humans from the rest. &quot;No pain, no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gain&quot; is the modern athlete's cliche for this, and I believe it's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful rule of thumb in almost every domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main goal is not succes. I just wanted to say that the if the average
</I>&gt;<i> affect balance is not higer with delayed gratification than it is not worh
</I>&gt;<i> it. But it guess it will be quite often that the delayed gratification will
</I>&gt;<i> make your average higher.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  If we push too strong for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; progress, I think that we believe that we will enjoy life later. So the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of enjoyment and emotions is there in &quot;progress&quot;, just in an odd way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; And Eudaimonia feels like progress. Is it like progress?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why I like &quot;eudaimonia&quot;, at least as Plato and other early
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> philosophers conceived of it, is that it least has an element of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objective assessment to it. The problem with using SWB as a metric,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and especially with using it as a goal, is that it doesn't provide any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> check on exploitative behavior (or lack of virtue, as Plato would call
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it). For example, in a society that allows slavery, you can have very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high SWB because those who are not slaves benefit from the production
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of those who are. And of course the SWB of slaves doesn't enter into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the equation because, well, they're not people. Even that OECD report
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentions at least twice how the Israeli's SWB scores reflect how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they've gamed the system by not counting the unimaginable suffering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they continuously inflict on the Palestinians. But the same goes for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SDAPs in all domains (organized crime, misrepresentative democracy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the US advertising and financial services industries, any country with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a large immigrant labor force, etc.): The people within the exploiting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group have high SWB scores whereas those they are exploiting are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minority and usually a substantially undercounted minority. The old
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usage of eudaimonia has a correction for this because what is a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life also includes social feedback on whether the individual's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> behavior is/was good for the group, not just for themselves. I believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people (at least neurotypicals) internally do this calculation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically and this will be reflected in their decisionmaking even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if it's hard to quantify in a survey. Which, again, is why I recommend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that we concentrate on fixing the decisionmaking system and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasing &quot;happiness&quot; will just be an emergent phenomenon of using a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system that actually reflects the preferences of the majority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well cannot automate eudaimonia measurement and correct it by affect
</I>&gt;<i> balance, but I can automate affect balance measurement and correct the
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm by eudaimonia.
</I>&gt;<i> I know there is mo where the basic algorithm needs to be modified, but I
</I>&gt;<i> got not summary yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
