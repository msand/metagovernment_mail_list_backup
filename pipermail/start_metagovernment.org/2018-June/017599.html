<PRE>dealing with anti-socials is a real thing, however they to need to be
seen and heard, the whole world must have a bully somewhere. I believe
search co's do have the problem in tow.

&gt;<i> I've got proxyfor.me updated to the latest versions of the frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> and the bugs fixed and am setting it up to do a shadow of a local
</I>&gt;<i> government for the next round of beta testing. Any of you have any
</I>&gt;<i> experience or suggestions for how/where to do this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of the issues/constraints:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's of course got to be an English-speaking area (I've got a
</I>&gt;<i> design for wiring in automatic translation, but that will have to wait
</I>&gt;<i> for some future version).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) One of the things I plan to test is the proposal of allowing people
</I>&gt;<i> to collect their name off of the public voter rolls to do
</I>&gt;<i> authentication (I'm planning to allow people outside the area to
</I>&gt;<i> participate, but to keep the votes separated (registered in the
</I>&gt;<i> locality vs. other)). In Colorado that database is available for $50
</I>&gt;<i> (it's *much* more expensive in most other states, and many of them
</I>&gt;<i> require you to contact *each county* to build a statewide list).
</I>&gt;<i> Colorado also has an easy-to-use web site that will allow people to
</I>&gt;<i> look up their registration. I'm thinking to key off of the voterID
</I>&gt;<i> field, which is something no one would know or be able to spoof unless
</I>&gt;<i> it's their own registration (they use their name, zip, and birthday on
</I>&gt;<i> the State's site to look up their voterID, and the birthday isn't in
</I>&gt;<i> the public database). Unless of course they bought the database
</I>&gt;<i> themselves: I'm thinking to check for fraud via that by recording some
</I>&gt;<i> sort of device fingerprint to make sure that no more than a few
</I>&gt;<i> account creations come from any one machine. There are several
</I>&gt;<i> libraries out there that do this, and if a machine is flagged we then
</I>&gt;<i> use that to block entire IP address ranges. Given the massive number
</I>&gt;<i> of attacks against matchism.org from Russia and Ukraine  I've had to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with (they've even cracked all of the CAPTCHA routines!) I'm
</I>&gt;<i> tempted to just ban those entire countries from accessing proxyfor.me
</I>&gt;<i> until we're ready to replace their governments with new ones that
</I>&gt;<i> aren't so tolerant toward, or even directly engaging in, this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> antisocial behavior.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The locality has got to have good public information sites,
</I>&gt;<i> including all the handouts that the local council members use to make
</I>&gt;<i> their decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Choosing a combined city+county is appealing because ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> we'll get to dealing with the revenue side (budgeting), and the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of that comes from property taxes which are set by counties.
</I>&gt;<i> Surprisingly there are only a couple dozen examples of this in the US,
</I>&gt;<i> so I may have to work around this somehow eventually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Even so, I'm going to have to extensively prune the list of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals: As is the case for the US congress the majority of things
</I>&gt;<i> voted on at the City/County level are non-substantive (like
</I>&gt;<i> recognizing national hot-dog day!) and there's no need to waste The
</I>&gt;<i> People's time on that crap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm mostly looking at Denver (around 700K population), which meets all
</I>&gt;<i> the requirements above, but would like to consider others even if they
</I>&gt;<i> don't. The tradeoffs seem to be that big cities have a lot more varied
</I>&gt;<i> topics, but most of that relates to managing concessions (Denver city
</I>&gt;<i> council spends almost half of its time dealing with the airport and
</I>&gt;<i> the various sports and entertainment venues they own). That's boring
</I>&gt;<i> and IMHO not something the government should be micromanaging anyway
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., the management itself should be contracted out). Boulder
</I>&gt;<i> (population 100K) would actually be almost ideal because of the
</I>&gt;<i> manageable size combined with a high participation rate (more people
</I>&gt;<i> typically show up for Boulder city council meetings than in Denver
</I>&gt;<i> despite the huge population difference, and Boulder has the most
</I>&gt;<i> awesome access to documents of any city I've seen), but I frequently
</I>&gt;<i> have to deal with the City of Boulder for various reasons (mostly
</I>&gt;<i> related to our rental properties) and so am somewhat reluctant to
</I>&gt;<i> paint a target on my back...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any other factors or places I should consider?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
