<PRE>On Mon, Jun 4, 2018 at 3:23 PM, Michal &#352;t&#283;p&#225;nek &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">micstepanek at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> And it seem that it is philosophy that divides us. It is difficult to talk

Bring it on!

&gt;<i> I see persons more as emotional beings. In my opinion the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;rationality&quot; thing is here just to serve emotions.
</I>
This is Haidt's proposal, and I think it is well supported by the
neuroscience:  I just finished Sapolsky's &quot;Behave: The Biology of
Humans at Our Best and Worst&quot; (book club) and it cites Haidt and
provides a lot of background as to why this is a good model for human
behavior. I wouldn't go so far as to use the term &quot;serve&quot;, but would
agree that we waste a *lot* of our intellectual capabilities, perhaps
even a majority, on justification/rationalization and in figuring out
ways to game our social systems.

&gt;<i> Also I am not entirely in the &quot;idea of progress&quot;, progress is meaningless if
</I>&gt;<i> you do not enjoy life while progress is done.
</I>
BS: Look into this thing called &quot;delayed gratification&quot;. It's the main
thing that separates successful humans from the rest. &quot;No pain, no
gain&quot; is the modern athlete's cliche for this, and I believe it's a
useful rule of thumb in almost every domain.

&gt;<i>  If we push too strong for
</I>&gt;<i> progress, I think that we believe that we will enjoy life later. So the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of enjoyment and emotions is there in &quot;progress&quot;, just in an odd way.
</I>&gt;<i> And Eudaimonia feels like progress. Is it like progress?
</I>
Why I like &quot;eudaimonia&quot;, at least as Plato and other early
philosophers conceived of it, is that it least has an element of
objective assessment to it. The problem with using SWB as a metric,
and especially with using it as a goal, is that it doesn't provide any
check on exploitative behavior (or lack of virtue, as Plato would call
it). For example, in a society that allows slavery, you can have very
high SWB because those who are not slaves benefit from the production
of those who are. And of course the SWB of slaves doesn't enter into
the equation because, well, they're not people. Even that OECD report
mentions at least twice how the Israeli's SWB scores reflect how
they've gamed the system by not counting the unimaginable suffering
they continuously inflict on the Palestinians. But the same goes for
SDAPs in all domains (organized crime, misrepresentative democracy,
the US advertising and financial services industries, any country with
a large immigrant labor force, etc.): The people within the exploiting
group have high SWB scores whereas those they are exploiting are a
minority and usually a substantially undercounted minority. The old
usage of eudaimonia has a correction for this because what is a good
life also includes social feedback on whether the individual's
behavior is/was good for the group, not just for themselves. I believe
people (at least neurotypicals) internally do this calculation
automatically and this will be reflected in their decisionmaking even
if it's hard to quantify in a survey. Which, again, is why I recommend
that we concentrate on fixing the decisionmaking system and that
increasing &quot;happiness&quot; will just be an emergent phenomenon of using a
system that actually reflects the preferences of the majority.
  Regards,
    Scott
