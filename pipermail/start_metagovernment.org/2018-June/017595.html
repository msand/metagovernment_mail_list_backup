<PRE>This ended up in my spam folder, not sure why. Good on you for sending the
letter. And agree with the disappointing results.

</I>&gt;<i> I've read the winning proposals, and skimmed several others, and

</I>&gt;<i> *how* AI would be used to refine proposals (a tantalizing promise in
</I>&gt;<i> the abstract). Unfortunately the full submission contains exactly zero
</I>&gt;<i> additional information as to how any of it would work. The other two
</I>&gt;<i> winners are just UN tweaks (Argh!). None of the entries address the
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental flaws in misrepresentative-based decisionmaking, and yet
</I>&gt;<i> the 3 winners were awarded $600K each to spend on their Tahitian
</I>&gt;<i> vacations. But at least that means most of the prize money was
</I>&gt;<i> withheld and so they'll be able to run the contest again at some
</I>&gt;<i> point. With that in mind I sent them the following critique about a
</I>&gt;<i> month ago, a submission they acknowledged but I haven't heard anything
</I>&gt;<i> back from them since.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I have to say overall I'm very encouraged: If that's the best of
</I>&gt;<i> the competition, the members of this group have a much better chance
</I>&gt;<i> of achieving disruption than anyone else working in this area because
</I>&gt;<i> at least we have *some* idea of what works and what doesn't. We also
</I>&gt;<i> have a definite preference for engineering over handwaving, which
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be relatively rare if the entrants in all of these
</I>&gt;<i> competitions is any guide. I recommend we redouble our efforts because
</I>&gt;<i> if we don't come up with a better system and get it implemented, it's
</I>&gt;<i> abundantly clear that no one else will either...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To whom it may concern:
</I>&gt;<i> While I was not terribly surprised that my GCF entry (Matched Proxy
</I>&gt;<i> Augmented Direct Democracy, or MPADD) was not selected as a finalist
</I>&gt;<i> (I didn't follow the rules!), I was surprised and very disappointed in
</I>&gt;<i> the quality of the entries that were selected. My analysis of them
</I>&gt;<i> just confirms my assessment going into this process that there are
</I>&gt;<i> serious flaws in both the rules as stated and the process the GCF used
</I>&gt;<i> to judge the entries, flaws that virtually guarantee that none of the
</I>&gt;<i> finalists will be capable of eliminating, or even partially
</I>&gt;<i> correcting, the serious flaws in our existing decisionmaking systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully you can use this criticism to improve the process for the
</I>&gt;<i> next time the contest is held.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There is a fundamental flaw in the rules that ensures that you
</I>&gt;<i> never received (or at least could not accept) the only proposals that
</I>&gt;<i> actually could effect any change in public policy decisionmaking. The
</I>&gt;<i> problematic paragraph is flawed in so many ways that I must quote the
</I>&gt;<i> whole thing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented
</I>&gt;<i> within the foreseeable future. This requires that it be acceptable to
</I>&gt;<i> major states and the wider international community. A significant
</I>&gt;<i> measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement
</I>&gt;<i> eliminates models that rely on time-consuming and controversial
</I>&gt;<i> changes in the political system of individual states, e.g. models that
</I>&gt;<i> postulate that all states should be democracies.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This insistence on deferring to those with an inherent strong
</I>&gt;<i> preference for the status quo is fundamentally incompatible with the
</I>&gt;<i> expectation that the decisionmaking process can be changed. My entry
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly rejected this requirement (likely leading to its
</I>&gt;<i> disqualification), but I note that many of the finalists implicitly
</I>&gt;<i> plan to replace/bypass the existing decisionmakers without specifying
</I>&gt;<i> how they'd achieve this. While I acknowledge that this is a
</I>&gt;<i> politically sensitive area it my considered opinion is that attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> hide the fact that it is our goal to replace existing governments or
</I>&gt;<i> at least substantially reduce their power is not only dishonest but
</I>&gt;<i> leads to handwaving and poor design because it eliminates the need to
</I>&gt;<i> define how and when the transition in power will occur. Should any of
</I>&gt;<i> these proposals actually accrue any power leaving this transition
</I>&gt;<i> unspecified is also risking repeating the mistakes of Nazism and
</I>&gt;<i> Marxism/Leninism that led to the deaths of millions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This rule is also based on a naive interpretation of political power
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;a significant measure of civic acceptance&quot;? Seriously?): A system
</I>&gt;<i> capable of replacing our existing public policy decisionmaking systems
</I>&gt;<i> globally and at all levels could easily be built by a small group of
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers (it would be a small fraction of scale of the Linux
</I>&gt;<i> project, for example), would require cloud computing resources that
</I>&gt;<i> would cost significantly less than the GCF prize amount to operate
</I>&gt;<i> each year, and could take over these duties within months of its
</I>&gt;<i> release. What remains is merely a marketing problem: Once a majority
</I>&gt;<i> of The People *believe* that the new system is the legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> government, it simply becomes that. No need for the drama of a violent
</I>&gt;<i> overthrow of any existing governments or even having to ask for their
</I>&gt;<i> approval (though it would of course be wise to have a plan for how to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with the minority that will resist the transition).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The rules specify that the contest is about decisionmaking, but
</I>&gt;<i> many accepted entries are actually economic models.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be sufficient to just specify this distinction more clearly
</I>&gt;<i> in the rules, but the judges too should brush up on this difference:
</I>&gt;<i> It seems reasonable to me to just completely reject any proposal that
</I>&gt;<i> emphasizes economic models, particularly those designed merely to
</I>&gt;<i> *fund* projects, to effect change when they leave the decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> model underspecified or in some cases even completely unspecified. It
</I>&gt;<i> should be obvious as to why: A functioning decisionmaking system can
</I>&gt;<i> bring unimaginable economic resources to bear on a problem whereas
</I>&gt;<i> even the most powerful economic system can be shut down with a simple
</I>&gt;<i> vote by a decisionmaking system that considers the new system to be a
</I>&gt;<i> threat to its power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Many entries include proposals that have already been shown to be
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable or irrelevant (e.g. anything relying on blockchain
</I>&gt;<i> technology or Liquid Democracy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These issues have been debated many places (slashdot, reddit, etc.),
</I>&gt;<i> but the most recent debates I've participated in are on the
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment mailing list (see the February and March 2018
</I>&gt;<i> archives):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And on the DemocracyEarth whitepaper GitHub project:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are also discussed in some of my own projects, including the Help
</I>&gt;<i> system for proxyfor.me (<A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A>) and in the Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> manifesto (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/system">http://www.matchism.org/system</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The judges are academics and organizational experts rather than
</I>&gt;<i> social engineers or visionaries and so are biased toward things that
</I>&gt;<i> seem familiar to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While one might think that having experience in government or in an
</I>&gt;<i> NGO would qualify one as a judge, in my considered opinion the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite is actually the case: These individuals have devoted their
</I>&gt;<i> careers to figuring out ways of gaming the system rather than having
</I>&gt;<i> the freedom to design a new one from scratch and so can only see new
</I>&gt;<i> proposals from the very narrow perspective of their own hardened
</I>&gt;<i> appraisal of how difficult it is to change the system from within.
</I>&gt;<i> Disruption *always* comes from outside, and that's also where you'll
</I>&gt;<i> find the best judges of technology that is designed to disrupt (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> next time ask those who have successfully instigated disruptions in
</I>&gt;<i> other industries to be your judges).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Biased toward handwaving and against functioning systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that the anonymity requirement was an attempt to acquire
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy by imitating blind peer reviews in academia, but this is a
</I>&gt;<i> bad idea for two reasons. First, academia doesn't *actually* work that
</I>&gt;<i> way (authors and reviewers can usually figure out who everyone is
</I>&gt;<i> because, being experts in the field, they know who's working on what).
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, these are not experiments or theories, they're supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> be *social engineering* proposals. And as anyone who's worked in
</I>&gt;<i> engineering, or technology in general, can tell you, a working
</I>&gt;<i> prototype is worth a mountain of handwaving proposals. By excluding
</I>&gt;<i> this information from the judging, particularly when you only have
</I>&gt;<i> managers and academics as judges, you've virtually guaranteed that the
</I>&gt;<i> winning proposals will be those that superficially appear to be
</I>&gt;<i> solutions but have fundamental flaws that make them completely
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable (which is my assessment of *all* of the finalists in this
</I>&gt;<i> round). Next time, you should *encourage* the entrants to submit
</I>&gt;<i> working prototypes or at least published work that fleshes out the
</I>&gt;<i> models and then bias the judging toward those ideas that have proven
</I>&gt;<i> to be workable or at least implementable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) No public debate forum available during entry preparation, leading
</I>&gt;<i> to obviously unworkable entries because they never received feedback
</I>&gt;<i> that would correct obvious errors and oversights (e.g., as specified
</I>&gt;<i> in #3 above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even the GCF web site seems to operate as a closed system with no
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for discussion or even feedback (the email this message
</I>&gt;<i> was sent to is the only personal email address I found on the entire
</I>&gt;<i> site!) Though public debate does provide the opportunity for
</I>&gt;<i> time-wasting trolling, it is also by far the most efficient way to
</I>&gt;<i> identify deeply flawed and other crackpot ideas. If a proposal can
</I>&gt;<i> survive a debate in a public forum it has a vastly better chance of
</I>&gt;<i> being viable and implementable. And the time to do this is during
</I>&gt;<i> proposal preparation, not after judging as you seem to propose now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) It kind of bothered me that the rules seem to indicate that winner
</I>&gt;<i> could just take the 5 mil and retire to Tahiti. I would have liked to
</I>&gt;<i> see the &quot;prize&quot; be more like funding for a grant proposal, with a
</I>&gt;<i> specific work product promised. It would seem reasonable to me to do
</I>&gt;<i> that for this year's &quot;winners&quot; too: Have them prepare a proposal for
</I>&gt;<i> how much they need and what they'll produce if they get that, then
</I>&gt;<i> fund based on this additional information. I would recommend against
</I>&gt;<i> what seems to be the current plan which looks to me like attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> create ad-hoc groups to make mash-ups of the proposals and then try to
</I>&gt;<i> implement those Frankenproposals...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone would like to discuss any of these items I remain at your
</I>&gt;<i> service.
