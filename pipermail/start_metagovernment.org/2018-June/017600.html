<PRE>As you consider translating in other languages, i can share the experience
of Airesis.
Language files remain separated from software in a paraghraph numbered file
that when posted on crowdin translation specifically designed web site,
this permit us to receive a lot of volunteer translators and we where able
to translate in 13 languages at no cost. If proxyfor.me is opensource, the
crowdin service is free.
I will suggest also to consider registering domain for the specific
language where will be used, in italian proxyfor.me does not mean nothing
and will not be considered with that name

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've got proxyfor.me updated to the latest versions of the frameworks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and the bugs fixed and am setting it up to do a shadow of a local
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; government for the next round of beta testing. Any of you have any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; experience or suggestions for how/where to do this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some of the issues/constraints:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) It's of course got to be an English-speaking area (I've got a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; design for wiring in automatic translation, but that will have to wait
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for some future version).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) One of the things I plan to test is the proposal of allowing people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to collect their name off of the public voter rolls to do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authentication (I'm planning to allow people outside the area to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participate, but to keep the votes separated (registered in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; locality vs. other)). In Colorado that database is available for $50
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (it's *much* more expensive in most other states, and many of them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; require you to contact *each county* to build a statewide list).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Colorado also has an easy-to-use web site that will allow people to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; look up their registration. I'm thinking to key off of the voterID
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field, which is something no one would know or be able to spoof unless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's their own registration (they use their name, zip, and birthday on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the State's site to look up their voterID, and the birthday isn't in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the public database). Unless of course they bought the database
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; themselves: I'm thinking to check for fraud via that by recording some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sort of device fingerprint to make sure that no more than a few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; account creations come from any one machine. There are several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; libraries out there that do this, and if a machine is flagged we then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use that to block entire IP address ranges. Given the massive number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of attacks against matchism.org from Russia and Ukraine  I've had to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal with (they've even cracked all of the CAPTCHA routines!) I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tempted to just ban those entire countries from accessing proxyfor.me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until we're ready to replace their governments with new ones that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aren't so tolerant toward, or even directly engaging in, this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; antisocial behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) The locality has got to have good public information sites,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; including all the handouts that the local council members use to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) Choosing a combined city+county is appealing because ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we'll get to dealing with the revenue side (budgeting), and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; majority of that comes from property taxes which are set by counties.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Surprisingly there are only a couple dozen examples of this in the US,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I may have to work around this somehow eventually.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) Even so, I'm going to have to extensively prune the list of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals: As is the case for the US congress the majority of things
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voted on at the City/County level are non-substantive (like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recognizing national hot-dog day!) and there's no need to waste The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People's time on that crap.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm mostly looking at Denver (around 700K population), which meets all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the requirements above, but would like to consider others even if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't. The tradeoffs seem to be that big cities have a lot more varied
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topics, but most of that relates to managing concessions (Denver city
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; council spends almost half of its time dealing with the airport and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the various sports and entertainment venues they own). That's boring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and IMHO not something the government should be micromanaging anyway
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i.e., the management itself should be contracted out). Boulder
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (population 100K) would actually be almost ideal because of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manageable size combined with a high participation rate (more people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; typically show up for Boulder city council meetings than in Denver
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; despite the huge population difference, and Boulder has the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; awesome access to documents of any city I've seen), but I frequently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to deal with the City of Boulder for various reasons (mostly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to our rental properties) and so am somewhat reluctant to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paint a target on my back...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any other factors or places I should consider?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Scott
