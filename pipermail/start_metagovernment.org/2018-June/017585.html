<PRE>The results of the GCF have been posted:
<A HREF="https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/awardees">https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/awardees</A>

I've read the winning proposals, and skimmed several others, and
unfortunately they all make the &quot;Next System&quot; competition winners look
like models of precision by comparison: Such frantic handwaving I've
never seen, at least outside postmodernist screed. I was particularly
disappointed by the &quot;AI&quot; entry, expecting it to flesh out exactly
*how* AI would be used to refine proposals (a tantalizing promise in
the abstract). Unfortunately the full submission contains exactly zero
additional information as to how any of it would work. The other two
winners are just UN tweaks (Argh!). None of the entries address the
fundamental flaws in misrepresentative-based decisionmaking, and yet
the 3 winners were awarded $600K each to spend on their Tahitian
vacations. But at least that means most of the prize money was
withheld and so they'll be able to run the contest again at some
point. With that in mind I sent them the following critique about a
month ago, a submission they acknowledged but I haven't heard anything
back from them since.

But I have to say overall I'm very encouraged: If that's the best of
the competition, the members of this group have a much better chance
of achieving disruption than anyone else working in this area because
at least we have *some* idea of what works and what doesn't. We also
have a definite preference for engineering over handwaving, which
seems to be relatively rare if the entrants in all of these
competitions is any guide. I recommend we redouble our efforts because
if we don't come up with a better system and get it implemented, it's
abundantly clear that no one else will either...

To whom it may concern:
While I was not terribly surprised that my GCF entry (Matched Proxy
Augmented Direct Democracy, or MPADD) was not selected as a finalist
(I didn't follow the rules!), I was surprised and very disappointed in
the quality of the entries that were selected. My analysis of them
just confirms my assessment going into this process that there are
serious flaws in both the rules as stated and the process the GCF used
to judge the entries, flaws that virtually guarantee that none of the
finalists will be capable of eliminating, or even partially
correcting, the serious flaws in our existing decisionmaking systems.
Hopefully you can use this criticism to improve the process for the
next time the contest is held.

1) There is a fundamental flaw in the rules that ensures that you
never received (or at least could not accept) the only proposals that
actually could effect any change in public policy decisionmaking. The
problematic paragraph is flawed in so many ways that I must quote the
whole thing:

&quot;The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented
within the foreseeable future. This requires that it be acceptable to
major states and the wider international community. A significant
measure of civic acceptance is also required. This requirement
eliminates models that rely on time-consuming and controversial
changes in the political system of individual states, e.g. models that
postulate that all states should be democracies.&quot;

This insistence on deferring to those with an inherent strong
preference for the status quo is fundamentally incompatible with the
expectation that the decisionmaking process can be changed. My entry
explicitly rejected this requirement (likely leading to its
disqualification), but I note that many of the finalists implicitly
plan to replace/bypass the existing decisionmakers without specifying
how they'd achieve this. While I acknowledge that this is a
politically sensitive area it my considered opinion is that attempt to
hide the fact that it is our goal to replace existing governments or
at least substantially reduce their power is not only dishonest but
leads to handwaving and poor design because it eliminates the need to
define how and when the transition in power will occur. Should any of
these proposals actually accrue any power leaving this transition
unspecified is also risking repeating the mistakes of Nazism and
Marxism/Leninism that led to the deaths of millions.

This rule is also based on a naive interpretation of political power
(&quot;a significant measure of civic acceptance&quot;? Seriously?): A system
capable of replacing our existing public policy decisionmaking systems
globally and at all levels could easily be built by a small group of
volunteers (it would be a small fraction of scale of the Linux
project, for example), would require cloud computing resources that
would cost significantly less than the GCF prize amount to operate
each year, and could take over these duties within months of its
release. What remains is merely a marketing problem: Once a majority
of The People *believe* that the new system is the legitimate
government, it simply becomes that. No need for the drama of a violent
overthrow of any existing governments or even having to ask for their
approval (though it would of course be wise to have a plan for how to
deal with the minority that will resist the transition).

2) The rules specify that the contest is about decisionmaking, but
many accepted entries are actually economic models.

It might be sufficient to just specify this distinction more clearly
in the rules, but the judges too should brush up on this difference:
It seems reasonable to me to just completely reject any proposal that
emphasizes economic models, particularly those designed merely to
*fund* projects, to effect change when they leave the decisionmaking
model underspecified or in some cases even completely unspecified. It
should be obvious as to why: A functioning decisionmaking system can
bring unimaginable economic resources to bear on a problem whereas
even the most powerful economic system can be shut down with a simple
vote by a decisionmaking system that considers the new system to be a
threat to its power.

3) Many entries include proposals that have already been shown to be
unworkable or irrelevant (e.g. anything relying on blockchain
technology or Liquid Democracy).

These issues have been debated many places (slashdot, reddit, etc.),
but the most recent debates I've participated in are on the
Metagovernment mailing list (see the February and March 2018
archives):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/</A>

And on the DemocracyEarth whitepaper GitHub project:
<A HREF="https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues">https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper/issues</A>

They are also discussed in some of my own projects, including the Help
system for proxyfor.me (<A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A>) and in the Matchism
manifesto (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/system">http://www.matchism.org/system</A>)

4) The judges are academics and organizational experts rather than
social engineers or visionaries and so are biased toward things that
seem familiar to them.

While one might think that having experience in government or in an
NGO would qualify one as a judge, in my considered opinion the
opposite is actually the case: These individuals have devoted their
careers to figuring out ways of gaming the system rather than having
the freedom to design a new one from scratch and so can only see new
proposals from the very narrow perspective of their own hardened
appraisal of how difficult it is to change the system from within.
Disruption *always* comes from outside, and that's also where you'll
find the best judges of technology that is designed to disrupt (e.g.,
next time ask those who have successfully instigated disruptions in
other industries to be your judges).

5) Biased toward handwaving and against functioning systems.

My guess is that the anonymity requirement was an attempt to acquire
legitimacy by imitating blind peer reviews in academia, but this is a
bad idea for two reasons. First, academia doesn't *actually* work that
way (authors and reviewers can usually figure out who everyone is
because, being experts in the field, they know who's working on what).
Secondly, these are not experiments or theories, they're supposed to
be *social engineering* proposals. And as anyone who's worked in
engineering, or technology in general, can tell you, a working
prototype is worth a mountain of handwaving proposals. By excluding
this information from the judging, particularly when you only have
managers and academics as judges, you've virtually guaranteed that the
winning proposals will be those that superficially appear to be
solutions but have fundamental flaws that make them completely
unworkable (which is my assessment of *all* of the finalists in this
round). Next time, you should *encourage* the entrants to submit
working prototypes or at least published work that fleshes out the
models and then bias the judging toward those ideas that have proven
to be workable or at least implementable.

6) No public debate forum available during entry preparation, leading
to obviously unworkable entries because they never received feedback
that would correct obvious errors and oversights (e.g., as specified
in #3 above).

Even the GCF web site seems to operate as a closed system with no
opportunity for discussion or even feedback (the email this message
was sent to is the only personal email address I found on the entire
site!) Though public debate does provide the opportunity for
time-wasting trolling, it is also by far the most efficient way to
identify deeply flawed and other crackpot ideas. If a proposal can
survive a debate in a public forum it has a vastly better chance of
being viable and implementable. And the time to do this is during
proposal preparation, not after judging as you seem to propose now.

7) It kind of bothered me that the rules seem to indicate that winner
could just take the 5 mil and retire to Tahiti. I would have liked to
see the &quot;prize&quot; be more like funding for a grant proposal, with a
specific work product promised. It would seem reasonable to me to do
that for this year's &quot;winners&quot; too: Have them prepare a proposal for
how much they need and what they'll produce if they get that, then
fund based on this additional information. I would recommend against
what seems to be the current plan which looks to me like attempting to
create ad-hoc groups to make mash-ups of the proposals and then try to
implement those Frankenproposals...

If anyone would like to discuss any of these items I remain at your service.
