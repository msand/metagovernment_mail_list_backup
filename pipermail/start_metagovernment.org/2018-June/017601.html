I considered this, but ruled it out as too unwieldy: Not only do you
have to translate the proposal but *all* of the supporting material
*and* all of the posts anyone makes about it. Worse, unlike automated
translation we inherently can't trust human translation because of the
inevitable bias introduced (perception influenced by personality type
at best, deliberate attempts to mislead at worst). I've even ruled out
coding the language in the URL as you sometimes see
(<A HREF="https://www.whatever.org/en/someurl">https://www.whatever.org/en/someurl</A>) because bookmarks and marketing
become a nightmare if you do that. Instead the translation will be
automatic for *each* URL with target language set as a user preference
selected from a toplevel menu in the menu bar. Chrome already
automatically does a serviceable job at this now when navigating
around in a site in a different language and we can make this even
more seamless in a site designed to support it. We even have multiple
choices of translators now: AWS just introduced their own alternative
to Google Translate. Automatic translation isn't perfect and I'm sure
it's better for us English speakers than for everyone else (I've used
it a fair amount lately, mostly reading about the Rousseau and LQFB
systems), but it'll continue to get better and, after all, we've got
to consider this a long-term project ;-)

&gt;<i> I will suggest also to consider registering domain for the specific language
</I>&gt;<i> where will be used, in italian proxyfor.me does not mean nothing and will
</I>&gt;<i> not be considered with that name
</I>
Unlike, say, &quot;Airesis&quot; which makes sense in every language ;-) We may
need to do this eventually, but they'll all have to be simple
redirects to be used for marketing, not actual mirror sites...

    Scott

PS: I'm kind of surprised that no one has posted any horror stories
about dealing with the core problem in my post: How to shadow an
existing government. Is it really the case that no one has done this
yet?

PPS: To save a little space I'll reply to harold here:

</I>
Dealing with anti-social *individuals* I think is a relatively easy
problem compare with dealing with coordinated attacks by
organizations, especially state-sponsored groups. If any of these DD
systems gains enough traction to start to be seen as a reasonable form
of government the attacks it will have to withstand from autocratic
regimes will make what the Russians did in the 2016 US election look
like &quot;pong&quot; by comparison.
