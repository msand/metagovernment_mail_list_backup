Agreed, but I think this is outside the scope of the metagovernment
project.  At least in the US you're going to bring out a lot of trolls
with talk like that and we don't really have the bandwidth to debate
economic systems in addition to political ones ;-)

Very nice!  The voiceover is perfectly intelligible although I agree
that using a native English speaker would make it more compelling for
the mass audience (although of course you'd also have to pick an
accent, which is a whole other minefield ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
