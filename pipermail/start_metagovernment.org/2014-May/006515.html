<PRE>I think we need a system that allows a reevaluation if new information is
made known about an issue.

My proposed system could go like this.

If a decision is made and any party comes forward with new information a
question would be sent out to *those* who made the decision for a
reevaluation. Notice I stress *new* information. If the group(the ones who
participated and took part in the decision, not the new party) decides it
is new information or relevant information then a revote can be cast with
the new information. If the group can show that that topic has already been
discussed and that information has been accounted for then the group can
move forward with the decision.

So only if something new or important is brought up would it be
reevaluated. That way we can minimize disruption while still allowing us to
take important info in if we had not thought of it before as a group.

As much as we want to think we are very smart and have thought of
everything a lot of the time we haven't. That is why a group like this is
important to the decision making process. If new information is brought
forth we shouldn't discard it because we have already made a decision. That
would be foolish.

Things to be decided is:
How much of the group needs to agree that it is not new information in
order to be ignored and visa versa.

Cheers,
James
