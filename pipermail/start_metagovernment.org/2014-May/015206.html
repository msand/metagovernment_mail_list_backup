<PRE>Hi Michael,
personally I think consensus is overrated.

*We need to distinguish between situations that need (or are helped by)
consensus.* Like when we are deciding what to do with a common resource. *And
when consensus is not needed, maybe not even helpful.* *This is especially
true when we are deciding what projects to bring on. *If there is enough
support over a project to move it on, the project will go on. Regardless
what other people do.

You don't need consensus for a kickstarter project to take off. You
definitely want to have as much consensus as possible when deciding how to
share your nation annual budget. Those are opposite situations.

In most of my research I am realising how the context of the question
really changes the terms of the question.

In VgtA we tried strongly to have consensus. And in fact VgtA works well
for &quot;how&quot; questions and not for &quot;what shall we&quot; questions. But really the
how questions comes after the what question and is usually done only to the
people participating in a project. So now there is a common limited
resource. But even there if you don't find consensus you fork. So consensus
is not a real necessity often.

</I>&gt;<i> 2 or more people who can act on it, i.e. actually move Metagov in the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when Metagov started the idea was to build a software. We started
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussing one that eventually became Candiwi. At about the same time
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of us (ma and Giovani) participated in a EU grant application. We did not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; win the grant, but in this process the idea for Vilfredo goes to Athens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where born. So for some time there were two software. Then other software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started joining, and Metagov became a metagroup for various software.
</I>&gt;<i> Most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of them were either discontinued, or found that the discussion inside
</I>&gt;<i> here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was not that relevant to them. SO the participation went down.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also there were some concepts inside metagov that I think pushed some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people away. If you find yourself disagreeing with someone at a
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level, but do not have the time, or the patience, to discuss it, you will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just walk away and do your thing. I think this is what happened in many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instances.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So what remained was mostly people talking (still better than many other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; places), and a wiki that no one reads. And the most important: a long
</I>&gt;<i> list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of relevant softwares.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am now considering to make a series of pages in the wiki about my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; positions in the various topics. Anonimity, consensus. And invite other
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do theirs as well. Something like: Pietro on consensus, and Michael on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus, and so on. This mirrors better what happens in science where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people write rarely, and each person tend to present his point of view. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't want to have to defent my point every time someone says something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Instead I think it should be the other way around. If someone says
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that strikes me as really really good, and makes me change my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mind, then (and only then) will I change my position. Less discussion,
</I>&gt;<i> more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; personal research.
