<PRE>Regardless, but with much respect of everyone, I'd like to point out that
we should look at this process as ongoing. I express my nay to blank the
page but I can live with it, as long as a new one is up soon and with as
much consensus that we can get, BUT be ready to have that page going to be
questioned again and again. I have not understand how is going to be
written and I am very interested to see your chosen process in action as
the one I offer is not being considered.
Regards

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One week to make a big decision like this seems like a unusually small

</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ball hiding behind the &quot;system&quot; saying it has already decided. If you
</I>&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on the other side of the line how would you want to be treated? It
</I>&gt;<i> smells a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little authoritarian to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Umm, I think you have this backwards: It's authoritarian to assume
</I>&gt;<i> that there *is* a leader.  I've always been told that this is an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ad-hocracy&quot; in which case whoever shows up is the right group to make
</I>&gt;<i> decisions like this.  And a week seems short to me too, which is why I
</I>&gt;<i> proposed two weeks as a deadline.  But we're not going to make that
</I>&gt;<i> either unless more of you step up to voice your opinion on what
</I>&gt;<i> statements the home page should contain...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ed has worked on this list for years where you have only been a month or
</I>&gt;<i> so?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I consider it a professional courtesy not a statement of ownership.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've no problem with professional courtesy and definitely empathize
</I>&gt;<i> with his situation (I've got an ailing mother myself and am currently
</I>&gt;<i> embroiled in the nursing home vs home-care debate and decision and so
</I>&gt;<i> know that it is a very difficult, timeconsuming, and emotionally
</I>&gt;<i> draining process).  But I'll repeat my statement from my first post:
</I>&gt;<i> This group and this project is occupying very valuable mind-share and
</I>&gt;<i> so we have an *obligation* to make good use of it and if sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> that means forging ahead without our full complement that is
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately what we must do.  Now that this process has started and
</I>&gt;<i> the home page is already down, let's go ahead and finish it with the
</I>&gt;<i> implied consensus that when Ed (or whoever) wants to revisit it we
</I>&gt;<i> will do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, back to the big question, what is *your* current vision of what
</I>&gt;<i> this project is about?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
