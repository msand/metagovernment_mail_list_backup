<PRE>Dear Reid you are perfectly right, I apologize, I concentrate on the merit
while I should concentrate on the method. Actually, I did in the
development group by proposing long time ago a system, I called &quot;discussion
to synthesis&quot; where for each contribution is created a  mini forum, on the
side of a forum there is a synthesis area where everyone, participating on
a miniforum, can edit the text based on the development of the discussion.
Somehow similar to what loomio is coming about but in more collaborative
way. (multiple editors, all participant can edit the synthesis)

I will share this post with the ML of the Airesis development group maybe
they will put attention to this suggestion you are mentioning.
The overall point for me is to close a discussion with a productive
synthesis that can be considered the concentrated agreed output.
In case there is completely opposing views and no ground for changing idea,
the minority group (within the discussion) should start a new discussion
and produce the best synthesis according to their position on the issue.
Then the democratic process should put an end to the dispute. The voting
system should be by majority on 2 point of view or range on &lt;2 point of
view.
Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not find airesis addressing the main points I was trying to make in
</I>&gt;<i> this post, which is the reason I brought it up, since none of the projects
</I>&gt;<i> I've looked at do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, airesis does not go that deep into their comments section, you
</I>&gt;<i> can only comment on a comment to one level. Which might be fine for the
</I>&gt;<i> traffic it's receiving now but it's not the multiple branching that can go
</I>&gt;<i> much deeper that I was referencing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the sorting method of comments to the proposals is not at all
</I>&gt;<i> similar. In airesis you can choose what order to display the comments,
</I>&gt;<i> whether newest or highest rated first, which divides users to different
</I>&gt;<i> areas instead of combining them to get the best of both worlds like I was
</I>&gt;<i> proposing. Also this 'smart sorting' seems backwards as any comment you've
</I>&gt;<i> previously expressed interest in gets hidden at the bottom of the page for
</I>&gt;<i> you to forget about and not follow up on. Further separating users
</I>&gt;<i> attention in different directions when we should be trying focus
</I>&gt;<i> conversation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another thing that's different is you're only able to rate the first layer
</I>&gt;<i> of comments and not a comment to a comment, which can be equally important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I appreciate the response regardless but airesis is not similar to what I
</I>&gt;<i> was proposing in this post. Please try to read and understand my posts
</I>&gt;<i> point before assuming it's old news that has already been addressed,
</I>&gt;<i> because it hasn't.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Reid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Something very similar is already implemented in airesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First the concept, a proposal is a live forum where we consolidate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contribution based on consensus and approval.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  If you consider the single proposal and you are the relater or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participant we try to help your work to relate and edit the proposition or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to participate and look into the contributions to eventualli vote or answer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them in the most effective way as follows.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When you look into a proposal contributions you can choose 3 views:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Smart Sorting, Most recent and Most voted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead of rewrite how each work i suggest you to visit one of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current proposal there is in the Metagov testing group and mouse over the 3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option and you can see how each will show you the contribution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Personally I see room for improvement into the current contribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system where each contribution cannot be edited by the owner because is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subject to rank vote.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have proposed a different process to more collaborative contribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process where more persons can work and edit single paragraph to achieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the best consensus on a shared concept. If someone does not agree with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wording or the concept elaborated can open a new cntribution and find other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that support his vision.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You will not see the views in proposal where there is no contribution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example if you go here
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page">http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the bottom of the page you will not see the Smart Sorting, Most recent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Most voted  because there is no contribution yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Neither here because there is only one contribution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4947-what-method-should-metagovernment-use-to-measure-group-decisions">http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4947-what-method-should-metagovernment-use-to-measure-group-decisions</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can show you the 3 views in one of our (italian) proposal with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface in english so you get to understand how it works, just follow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this link and look down in the page below the proposal text where the space
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for generic contribution is starting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/proposals/212-sanit-pubblica-e-privata">http://www.airesis.eu/proposals/212-sanit-pubblica-e-privata</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just need to remind you all that Airesis have been offered in 9
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> language due to my direct involvement in the internationalization but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in English there is very little proposals and groups because is only few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> months that we have it made available and very little communication effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so the platform still not known.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The discussion process of drafting a proposal needs to be regimented to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an extend in order to keep the  focus directed on the project and not have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it go off track. I think two types of posts should be highlighted for this
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> process to be efficient. Posts that are highly accepted and posts that are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> highly criticised. These two types of comments usually create a good degree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of debate and input from all sides, which is want we want. I think my
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system should work well for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To start off I want to introduce a concept for the structure of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> forum that helps me understand the overall layout a little better. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of each proposal starting out as a stem, a sprout that emerges from the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ground. This stem then forms a few leaves (responses), the more leaves the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more energy it absorbs and the stronger the stem becomes. The leaves might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> turn into branches themselves and host their own leaves (responses)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eventually. Over time it becomes a full fledge tree with many different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> branches and leaves going off in many different directions shaping the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tree's look. Every leaf is still connected in some way back to the stem,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through a chain of branches. Every sprout has the potential to become a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tree, every tree sits in a in a forest of other trees (proposals). The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> largest and strongest trees might eventually be chosen to be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> production purposes (voting stage).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Whenever a new leaf (response) is created the entire chain of branches
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all the way down to the stem (original proposal) is temporarily
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> strengthened (raised to the top of their lists, it becomes post number
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one). However if the newly formed leaf does not acquire sufficient sunlight
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (up votes) it can quickly wither and the tree will divert more energy to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the more successful leafs to grow that area instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Okay hopefully enough with the tree analogy. Now to get a little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> technical.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Each new response to a post or a new proposal starts with a score of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> zero (0). Zero is actually the best score a post can get. Upon each posts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> creation a timer starts. Every time the timer goes off, say 60 seconds, it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> loses a point. So a post that's 3 minutes old (180 seconds) will have a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> score of negative three (-3). This score ranks the order in which responses
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to a post or proposals are displayed. Closest to zero and down the list you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> go.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The other aspect of this formula is that every time a post receives an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up vote the timer is increased. So instead of a post losing a point every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 60 seconds, a post with one up vote could instead lose a point ever 70
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seconds, a post with two up votes could lose a point every 80 seconds. So
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you can see the more agreed upon posts will drop at a slower rate ensuring
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that they eventually overtake a post that generates fewer up votes.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Another layer is that a fresh response to a post bumps up the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thread (chain of branches back to the original stem) up to the top of their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> individual lists, original proposal included. Each post associated with the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fresh post starts back at zero and starts losing points again at the rate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the fresh post. So each associated response piggy backs on the fresh
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posts score and mimics it's attributes, 60 seconds timer or what have you.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This happens until the fresh posts score becomes lower than the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> score of its associated posts. These posts then revert back to their score
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and timer. The timer doesn't actually stop on the associated posts it just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pretends like it has a higher score until it doesn't anymore. The chain of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posts cherry picks whichever response attached to it has the highest score
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and uses that number until their own score becomes the highest, which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happens quickly if the new response receives no up votes.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> This means any fresh insight to a proposal gives it it's chance in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> spotlight but if it does not generate support that it falls out of sight
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and gives way to more popular conversations.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do not include any down votes in this system, as it not only brings on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unnecessary negativity but has no actual useful purpose in this model. If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you do not agree with a post can ignore it or respond to it, however a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> response bumps it up to the top again.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The correct math formula is obviously not sorted out yet but think it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> something easily established when we get some measure of consistent
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> activity.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry if I repeated myself a couple times in this explanation, just
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wanted to make sure it was clear because it took some time for myself to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fully wrap my head around. Again please with the questions, happy to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> answer. This model keeps the proposals circulating but continuously
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reverting back to the projects that have drummed up the most support
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overall. This process of giving priority to the emerging proposals and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comments hopefully can progress proposals in the right direction.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Much love
