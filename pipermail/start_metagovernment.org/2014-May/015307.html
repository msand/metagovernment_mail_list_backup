<PRE>I like the points being made, just to add a couple on the actual system, if
we can be that specific. I feel these should be emphasized on the home
page, though probably re-worded.


- We aim to distribute power evenly amongst every individual. We aim to
reach decisions that improve the overall quality of life for the largest
group possible. We aim to grow together as one entity.


- We aim to do away with political parties, political platforms, and party
lines. We are individuals who all have equally valid opinions that can vary
from issue to issue, we should never be defined or categorized.


- We aim to uncover all the information and analysis all the facts,
discussing them at face value, hiding nothing. Transparency is important
for discovering the truth. Numbers should always be recorded and accounted
for.


- We aim to own up to mistakes when they are made, to make the changes
necessary in a timely fashion. We do not to trivialize the issue in order
to save any face, we succeed together, we fail together, no excuses.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Fine analysis Scott. you should transfer your points into the proposal

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment Testing group. There, any one can suggest modifications
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together decide to bring the proposal to a maturity, so far  sound like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; death proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I'd like to place another concept and is about current mass media, that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will go through a deep transformation in the Internet era
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6) The mass media should not be in control of any group and the internet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be free and the access to it should be a fundamental right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but I think this is outside the scope of the metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> project.  At least in the US you're going to bring out a lot of trolls
</I>&gt;<i> with talk like that and we don't really have the bandwidth to debate
</I>&gt;<i> economic systems in addition to political ones ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding the video, this is a finalized version we recently completed
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Airesis, I apologize for the voice (mine, with a heavy italian accent)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very nice!  The voiceover is perfectly intelligible although I agree
</I>&gt;<i> that using a native English speaker would make it more compelling for
</I>&gt;<i> the mass audience (although of course you'd also have to pick an
</I>&gt;<i> accent, which is a whole other minefield ;-)
