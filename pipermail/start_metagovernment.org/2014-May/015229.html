<PRE>Michael,

To clarify: As you said there is no active project. There is an active
group of people with a common mission of discussing tools and idea around
tools for government. I believe we are generally doing what the first two
sentences of the Metagovernment website says:

&quot;The Metagovernment project supports internet tools to enable collaborative
governance. We are a global community of people working on numerous
projects which further this goal.&quot;

Although the &quot;support&quot; at this time is just a place to discuss and debate
what the tools need to do.

Maybe a better summary would be &quot; Metagovernment is a discussion group
about tools that enable collaborative governance.&quot;

&gt;<i> Hi Paul,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it is important to find some basic consensus of at least some

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think Metagov is developing a tool.  Tools are being developed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even an individual (a group of one) can develop a tool.  If Ed were to

</I>&gt;<i> But Ed isn't doing that.  Ed is running a mailing list (and a wiki).
