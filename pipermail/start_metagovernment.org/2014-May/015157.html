<PRE>Dear Scott I made some research on RWA just to understand better. I start
to see you as a very pessimistic person while I am definitely an optimistic
person.
I cannot believe that a 30% of the population can control the world... I
believe in software like Airesis where I am actively working and in
software like open annotation... <A HREF="http://vimeo.com/29633009">http://vimeo.com/29633009</A> or
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc&amp;noredirect=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCkm0lL-6lc&amp;noredirect=1</A> where if 30% try
to f.... with me I will spot them because i will have tools to spot them.
Nevertheless here is some aspect that goes beyond being authoritarian or
liberal or what ever we may be labeled.
I read some article about this new research into human psychology
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw</A>  Probably we need to enforce
some kind of genetic DNA test to find the extreme-ist character and enforce
a karma handicap in online voting!
Kind Regards
J

</I>&gt;<i> whoever, etc.) which is worse than having representatives, currently
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat less than half of whom are SDAs, at least in the US by my
</I>&gt;<i> estimate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Freedom is for me correlated to participation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue isn't freedom, it's good government.  We *need* high
</I>&gt;<i> participation rates to keep the SDAs in check.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my current thinking on the decision rule is 51% of the actual
</I>&gt;<i> voters or 1/3 of the registered voters, WHICHEVER IS LARGER, have to
</I>&gt;<i> vote yes.  This gets you concensus/near unanimity in low turnout
</I>&gt;<i> elections which will keep the SDAs (maybe 30% of the population) in
</I>&gt;<i> check, and yet also allows progress on controversial issues where you
</I>&gt;<i> have high turnout.  This seems a reasonable rule to me mostly given
</I>&gt;<i> the existence of proxies that those who aren't able to invest the time
</I>&gt;<i> to research every issue in detail will be able to use.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: we found an implementation of Altemeyer's authoritarian test on
</I>&gt;<i> OK-Cupid (a dating site, of all places), and the news at least there
</I>&gt;<i> is good: In that sample of around 1800 people the authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> percentage is somewhat less than 20%.  Add in a few percent for the
</I>&gt;<i> non-correlated social dominators and we're still under a quarter of
</I>&gt;<i> that population.  There unfortunately are some serious issues with
</I>&gt;<i> that survey:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) self-selected sample
</I>&gt;<i> 2) dating oriented and so probably more socially aware
</I>&gt;<i> 3) It's labelled an &quot;authoritarian test&quot; (should have been labeled as
</I>&gt;<i> a general personality test to avoid bias).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to put one of these up on my site when I get to that point
</I>&gt;<i> (labelled something clickbait like &quot;what kind of dragon are you&quot;) to
</I>&gt;<i> try collect data from FB/reddit/slashdot users.
