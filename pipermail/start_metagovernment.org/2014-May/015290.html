It still has the links, though, so I think it'll do for now.  I'd
propose that if we diddle around for more than two weeks that you just
put the old one back until we get our act together.

Sorry, it still has that pesky word &quot;consensus&quot; in it (watered down
though the context may be).  Again, my purpose here is not to hijack
this group, but instead to wake it up to the reality that there has
been a lot of research in this area and we need to at least take that
into consideration.  For my purposes the key fact is that we're going
to have a quarter to a third of the population that is going to oppose
any reasonable course of action in favor of preserving the status quo
(or worse).  Therefore, consensus is out as a decision rule.
Conveniently enough, of course, my 1/3 + majority decision rule
proposal *also* passed, and by more votes than this home page issue
did...

Maybe as an exercise we each should list the top 5 concepts we'd like
to see covered on the new home page.  Here are mine:

1) Representative government is inherently corrupt because of the
money required/allowed to campaign for those offices.

2) Representative government is inherently dangerous to the general
population because authoritarians, who are instinctively prejudiced
against and aggressive toward those they consider outsiders, gravitate
towards filling the role of representative.

3) The general population (who I call the &quot;Neurotypicals&quot;) is better
suited to making the decisions about how they want to live directly
than relying on representatives to do it for them.

4) The technology to run a direct democracy of more than a few dozen
people simply did not exist even 20 years ago.  But it does now, and
the day when a sufficient percentage of the population is comfortable
enough with it to run a government is rapidly approaching or in some
places has already arrived.

5) If we want our government to function better, it's up to *us* to
design and implement a better system because for damn sure our
existing governments are not going to do it for us, nor can we trust
corporations to do it because we cannot provide any monetary incentive
without introducing inherent conflicts of interest and corruption.

Then, a Call to Action (e.g., &quot;So come help us design/implement/test a
new system of government that we can use to govern organizations of
any size simply, safely, and effectively.&quot;)

&gt;<i> (Feel free to add yours using a similar URL.) I&#8217;d love to have a video that
</I>&gt;<i> matches the text, but obviously don&#8217;t have time now.
</I>
That sort of stuff can come later too.  I'd love to have a flashy
multimedia presentation too, but let's take care of the foundation
work first.
  Regards,
   Scott
