<PRE>Hi Pietro,

That's a good description of the history.  I was there in the early
days too, though more as critic than a participant (and now here I am
back in that role).  About that description, it'd be an achievement
just to agree on that and publish it clearly for all to see (where
Metagov comes from). It would help in navigating the forward direction
(where Metagov is going) by making it more difficult to go in circles.

About the opinion pages in the wiki: I might be interested in reading
those if they're on the topic of Metagov's purpose (where Metagov is
going).  What I'd be more interested in, however, is a consensus on
that topic; not just any consensus, mind you, but a consensus between
2 or more people who can act on it, i.e. actually move Metagov in the
agreed direction.

I participated for years without such a consensus.  It didn't work.
Maybe I was thinking that consensus would eventually materialize just
because I put solid work into it.  It didn't.  Now I'm an outside
critic again and my recommendation to everyone (not just to you) is,
&quot;Don't do that.  It's a waste of time.  It doesn't work.&quot;

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> when Metagov started the idea was to build a software. We started
</I>&gt;<i> discussing one that eventually became Candiwi. At about the same time some
</I>&gt;<i> of us (ma and Giovani) participated in a EU grant application. We did not
</I>&gt;<i> win the grant, but in this process the idea for Vilfredo goes to Athens
</I>&gt;<i> where born. So for some time there were two software. Then other software
</I>&gt;<i> started joining, and Metagov became a metagroup for various software. Most
</I>&gt;<i> of them were either discontinued, or found that the discussion inside here
</I>&gt;<i> was not that relevant to them. SO the participation went down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also there were some concepts inside metagov that I think pushed some
</I>&gt;<i> people away. If you find yourself disagreeing with someone at a fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> level, but do not have the time, or the patience, to discuss it, you will
</I>&gt;<i> just walk away and do your thing. I think this is what happened in many
</I>&gt;<i> instances.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So what remained was mostly people talking (still better than many other
</I>&gt;<i> places), and a wiki that no one reads. And the most important: a long list
</I>&gt;<i> of relevant softwares.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am now considering to make a series of pages in the wiki about my
</I>&gt;<i> positions in the various topics. Anonimity, consensus. And invite other to
</I>&gt;<i> do theirs as well. Something like: Pietro on consensus, and Michael on
</I>&gt;<i> consensus, and so on. This mirrors better what happens in science where
</I>&gt;<i> people write rarely, and each person tend to present his point of view. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to have to defent my point every time someone says something.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead I think it should be the other way around. If someone says
</I>&gt;<i> something that strikes me as really really good, and makes me change my
</I>&gt;<i> mind, then (and only then) will I change my position. Less discussion, more
</I>&gt;<i> personal research.
