<PRE>The up vote and the down vote are just taken into consideration by the
relater to decide to include or not a contribution into the proposal.
Only after you chose the upvote ( I agree green face) or the downvote (I
disagree red face) you can see the level of agreement for that specific
contribution. Unfortunately our group does not participate to the two
proposal so without real testing is hard to understand how it work. We are
discussing ideas and we consider the process to be made piece by piece and
as an ongoing process.
I doubt the the group have grasped the functioning of Airesis so far but to
answer directly to your question is more of the &quot;I think that this is
noteworthy and I would like to see this concept integrated into the
proposal&quot;


Kind Regards
Jacopo

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The discussion process of drafting a proposal needs to be regimented to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an extend in order to keep the  focus directed on the project and not have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it go off track. I think two types of posts should be highlighted for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process to be efficient. Posts that are highly accepted and posts that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> highly criticised. These two types of comments usually create a good degree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of debate and input from all sides, which is want we want. I think my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system should work well for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To start off I want to introduce a concept for the structure of the forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that helps me understand the overall layout a little better. I think of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each proposal starting out as a stem, a sprout that emerges from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ground. This stem then forms a few leaves (responses), the more leaves the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more energy it absorbs and the stronger the stem becomes. The leaves might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turn into branches themselves and host their own leaves (responses)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eventually. Over time it becomes a full fledge tree with many different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> branches and leaves going off in many different directions shaping the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tree's look. Every leaf is still connected in some way back to the stem,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through a chain of branches. Every sprout has the potential to become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tree, every tree sits in a in a forest of other trees (proposals). The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> largest and strongest trees might eventually be chosen to be used for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> production purposes (voting stage).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whenever a new leaf (response) is created the entire chain of branches
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the way down to the stem (original proposal) is temporarily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strengthened (raised to the top of their lists, it becomes post number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one). However if the newly formed leaf does not acquire sufficient sunlight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (up votes) it can quickly wither and the tree will divert more energy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the more successful leafs to grow that area instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Okay hopefully enough with the tree analogy. Now to get a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Each new response to a post or a new proposal starts with a score of zero
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (0). Zero is actually the best score a post can get. Upon each posts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creation a timer starts. Every time the timer goes off, say 60 seconds, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> loses a point. So a post that's 3 minutes old (180 seconds) will have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> score of negative three (-3). This score ranks the order in which responses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a post or proposals are displayed. Closest to zero and down the list you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The other aspect of this formula is that every time a post receives an up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote the timer is increased. So instead of a post losing a point every 60
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds, a post with one up vote could instead lose a point ever 70
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seconds, a post with two up votes could lose a point every 80 seconds. So
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can see the more agreed upon posts will drop at a slower rate ensuring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they eventually overtake a post that generates fewer up votes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another layer is that a fresh response to a post bumps up the entire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread (chain of branches back to the original stem) up to the top of their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual lists, original proposal included. Each post associated with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fresh post starts back at zero and starts losing points again at the rate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the fresh post. So each associated response piggy backs on the fresh
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posts score and mimics it's attributes, 60 seconds timer or what have you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This happens until the fresh posts score becomes lower than the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> score of its associated posts. These posts then revert back to their score
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and timer. The timer doesn't actually stop on the associated posts it just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pretends like it has a higher score until it doesn't anymore. The chain of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> posts cherry picks whichever response attached to it has the highest score
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and uses that number until their own score becomes the highest, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens quickly if the new response receives no up votes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means any fresh insight to a proposal gives it it's chance in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> spotlight but if it does not generate support that it falls out of sight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and gives way to more popular conversations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I do not include any down votes in this system, as it not only brings on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unnecessary negativity but has no actual useful purpose in this model. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you do not agree with a post can ignore it or respond to it, however a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> response bumps it up to the top again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The correct math formula is obviously not sorted out yet but think it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something easily established when we get some measure of consistent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> activity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry if I repeated myself a couple times in this explanation, just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wanted to make sure it was clear because it took some time for myself to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fully wrap my head around. Again please with the questions, happy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer. This model keeps the proposals circulating but continuously
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reverting back to the projects that have drummed up the most support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overall. This process of giving priority to the emerging proposals and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comments hopefully can progress proposals in the right direction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Much love
