Actually, I happen to really like your plan. I've only read it once, and would likely need to read it another time or two to fully grok it, but it seems like a great foundation for a very productive discussion. I&#8217;d like to see it condensed into a line item format (similar to the structure Reid is suggesting in the other thread), and then posted on Loomio (or wherever) so we can keep track of the discussion and vote on each of the bits and pieces.  You may not want to subject to that level of scrutiny or inquiry&#8230;but it could be productive&#8230;.and maybe even fun&#8230;.well for me anyway.  :-)

&gt;<i> we just have to have a plan ready so that when that last straw comes it will be our system that gets implemented instead of one by another Lenin/Hitler/Mao/etc. 
</I>
I like it that you said *our* system&#8230;but I'm not really clear what you mean by that.   It sounds like an implication of collaboration.  ;-)
