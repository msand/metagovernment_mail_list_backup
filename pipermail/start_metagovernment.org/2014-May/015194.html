&gt;<i> Just a raw example. You want to register on such a platform. There will, of course, be some procedure to check whether you are a real person. After that, you receive a one-time key to sign up. When doing this, the script creates your account and saves to the database that you already have an account. But there needs not to be a connection or mapping in the database between these two files! This is only necessary for registration and won't be available later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This adds a layer of protection for sure, but I maintain that the
original data does need to be maintained to verify it when an
individual moves or claims their account has been hacked (let alone
for auditing).  The very existence of the mapping file *anywhere*
renders the system vulnerable to attack and no amount of fancy
footwork is going to eliminate this threat.  The best security is just
collectively deciding that we don't need that security and indeed are
better off without it.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; That's really a very important point. Looking on a bigger time span, in fact almost every pseudonym will be assignable to the underlaying real identity. This already happens by the fact that someone may want to promote one's contribution in offline life to other people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Right, and as I've been saying all along, there is no real need for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this sort of privacy/anonymity, and most people (especially young
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people) are simply not as concerned about it as some people raised in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an environment where totalitarianism was common (like us old farts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, but that should be no reason for us (me?). Privacy/anonymity (P/A) can be important even if nobody cares about it.
</I>
I'm not getting your point.  There are two very important reasons for
not allowing this (adding vulnerability to hacks, and lack of control
over authoritarian behavior).  Unless you have a good reason why we
*do* need it other than your own preference (prejudice?) it seems to
me better to just dispense with the whole idea.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, this registry would be a favorite tool of the likes of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stalin/Hitler/Mao, but the point is that our primary goal has to be to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensure that no one like that ever comes to power again. If we achieve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that, being able to tell who voted how is no more a threat to people's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom than asking them to sign petitions, speak at a city council
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> meeting, or meet with their neighbors to organize a block party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Talking to somebody is no piece of data remaining available for a nearly unlimited time. (Well, as long as there's no CCTV.)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It is also no piece of data available for many people.
</I>
These ships have already sailed.  Given cell phones and security
cameras *everywhere* there is no longer any expectation of this kind
of privacy *anywhere*.  Again, our only hope now is to prevent another
rise of the authoritarians who would exploit this data.  A battle,
BTW, that I believe we're losing (to Putin, the Chinese government,
the NSA, etc.).  To get on my soap box again, this is *not* just an
academic exercise: The very survival of our species may depend on the
work we're doing here.

&gt;<i> The contrary is true for a public online discussion! Some militant group *could* exist also in the USA or in Europe. I think, it's not the fact now, but if it's the fact in ten or twenty years, data are still available. There is always some risk and nobody knows the world of tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, but see my point above.

&gt;<i> I also still don't know the best approach, but I think we still have to discover it. I don't think, voting should be influenced by any social effects because it's just an atmospheric picture of the people. Social effects could be useful in discussion to avoid Spam or trolling, but not during voting, electing etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I disagree, and in fact why my proposal goes further in requiring live
updating of voting results.  Social control at all stages is the
environment we evolved to function best in and is *necessary* to
ensure the authoritarians get the social cues they need to conform to
societal norms.
  Regards,
    Scott
