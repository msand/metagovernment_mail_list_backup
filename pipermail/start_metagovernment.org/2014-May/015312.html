&gt;<i> Sorry I still can&#8217;t participate fully, but I&#8217;ve kept a partial eye on some
</I>&gt;<i> of the comments flowing since my last post. A few observations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1. We have rules; we should stick with them. *I do not like the outcome
</I>&gt;<i> of this proposal, but it happened in accordance with the rules
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>&gt; currently in effect. If we ignore
</I>&gt;<i> our own rules, then we have no governance, and that is not what we are
</I>&gt;<i> about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. We should change the rules.* Much of what we do here is an
</I>&gt;<i> experiment. Let&#8217;s learn from our mistakes and improve our rules.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately, we have rules
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules#Modification_of_this_ruleset">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules#Modification_of_this_ruleset</A>&gt; for
</I>&gt;<i> how to change the rules! :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *3. The participants are the quorum.* Decisions are made by those who
</I>&gt;<i> choose to participate (Scott, do you now see the sense in this?). I think
</I>&gt;<i> we&#8217;ve learned here that one week is too short of a timeframe, so we should
</I>&gt;<i> lengthen that. But we cannot define a quorum by a percentage of the list
</I>&gt;<i> membership (that is 159 at this moment). When we think of all the decisions
</I>&gt;<i> to be made in all the world, it only makes sense that it is the engaged who
</I>&gt;<i> get to decide&#8230; provided there is enough publicity and wait-time for others
</I>&gt;<i> to engage and change the result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *4. Decisions should stick when they are made*. This is a tough one, and
</I>&gt;<i> I see a lot of people arguing with it. Shortly after the decision was made,
</I>&gt;<i> the nays had enough votes to have broken the consensus. But it was too
</I>&gt;<i> late. That&#8217;s the rule (as currently stated), and it is a good one.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise, we allow what engineers call flapping
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_flapping">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Route_flapping</A>&gt;. What if each time someone
</I>&gt;<i> jumps into the conversation they vote the opposite of the last person? We
</I>&gt;<i> could end up with rules switching on and off, back and forth, over and
</I>&gt;<i> over. Governance is about consistency. If a rule passes, then repealing it
</I>&gt;<i> should require the same threshold. But please note, the rule as currently
</I>&gt;<i> stated is *not* that there is one week to decide, but rather that
</I>&gt;<i> consensus (as defined by a percentage) must be maintained for a week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To avoid flapping, we currently have a time period of one week to be
maintained by a newly build consensus.
A counter proposal could be brought up at any time and continuously be
lobbyed for until it reaches consensus which then has to be maintained for
a week.
Currently i wouldnt know how to change the rules as i feel they are fine
for now, but feel free to make a proposal :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *5. I have no privilege*. The word &#8220;privilege&#8221; means &#8220;private law.&#8221; It
</I>&gt;<i> was first used to describe the senators of ancient Rome who were a law unto
</I>&gt;<i> themselves. It is the antithesis of this project. If I had felt really
</I>&gt;<i> strongly about the process, I could have just jumped in and said &#8220;no&#8221; when
</I>&gt;<i> I saw the emails coming in, even though I wasn&#8217;t informed. But I didn&#8217;t,
</I>&gt;<i> and the rules carry. Tough for me. (I&#8217;ll note that I will evoke privilege
</I>&gt;<i> in one case: if this group suddenly gets overrun by a bunch of &#8220;vandals&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> who start trying to hijack our community and pass nonsense laws. We&#8217;re not
</I>&gt;<i> strong enough yet to overcome that on our own. We should get that strong,
</I>&gt;<i> however.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So please go forth with proposals to change the home page. Heck, someone
</I>&gt;<i> can make a proposal to restore it. I might vote for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also, we should formally propose changes to the rules. Please feel
</I>&gt;<i> free to go ahead with that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;d like to suggest that *only emails that start with the word &#8220;Proposal&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> be considered a valid proposal* in this community (even if your email
</I>&gt;<i> just points people to a proposal in another venue). And further, if you
</I>&gt;<i> think a proposal can be improved, make your own better proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

+1 for that proposal.
Every day, a lot of emails end up in my inbox, so if for some reason i dont
find the time to always immediately go through all of them, then at least i
can glance over the topics and look at the ones which say: &quot;PROPOSAL: foo
bar baz whatever...&quot;




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for what software we use to decide on a proposal, that&#8217;s an organic and
</I>&gt;<i> undefined process. *Let&#8217;s try some new things* and see what results we
</I>&gt;<i> get. We can always use the discussion in this community to overrule any
</I>&gt;<i> decision that a particular system makes that seems unreasonable.
