<PRE>&gt;<i>Ah, got it.  In which case I only disagree with the 140 character

This might be a minor point but I think 140 character is only too long when
viewing on a phone or some small device, 140 can easily fit on most
screens.  I'd argue 45 is way too little. You want to introduce a proposal,
one that could be on a complicated subject, so you don't want to paraphrase
and have it potentially misleading. You want it to be a complete sentence,
one that peaks the interest of all associated users to that idea. Having a
simplified title invites a more random audience. This is my rational
anyway.


&gt;<i>Good, this is the important part.  I want the actual legal part
</I>&gt;<i>available, but even if it's written as clearly and concisely as it
</I>&gt;<i>could possibly be, it's still going to be too hard for most people to
</I>&gt;<i>understand both because of the specificity and the lack of context.
</I>&gt;<i>Which is why there actually has to be 3 different versions of the
</I>&gt;<i>proposal available, a 1-line subject, a human-friendly synopsis
</I>&gt;<i>including links to references (could be several pages), and the actual
</I>&gt;<i>text of the bill which will probably range from a few sentences up to
</I>
&gt;<i>a page or so.
</I>

Are all these versions together, under one page? As in 'the 1-line subject'
is the 'tweet', click on that opens up 'the human-friendly synopsis', like
a point form break down of the proposal, with attached links, then below
that is the actual bill which the people will be reading to vote on? Sorry,
little unclear on how your format will be presented.


The discussion aspect of some more technical proposals might go over most
people's heads, but I don't think a bill for voting should ever be too hard
for the average person to understand. It should be able to be broken down
and presented in a way that the general public will be confident enough
with the material to make an informed vote. By the time the discussion
process is done the truth of the proposal should already have been
established and the best path forward presented. Acquiring the votes is
just to actualize the best path, but there should be no mistake as to what
that path is and where it goes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Making a proposal should be a lot of work for the proposer. Some
</I>&gt;<i> proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will be quite long but this method structures the proposal into a
</I>&gt;<i> familiar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; format for everyone to easily view and digest the material.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again you got me wrong, I'm not suggesting a reputation system. Each post
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be scored independently, unrelated to a users past successes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, I apparently confounded the meta-information about when a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal was ready to be voted with attaching specific information to
</I>&gt;<i> posts.  I think the past success stuff *is* useful to have for
</I>&gt;<i> filtering and maybe when searching for a good proxy, but it shouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> be used for any default (unfiltered) presentation of the posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps a user could have a viewable rank of how well they generally
</I>&gt;<i> score
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but the score should not be a determining factor in their positioning for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each of their comments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless the user wants to do that: I've written up my first draft of
</I>&gt;<i> the database schema and it will support filtering based not only on
</I>&gt;<i> tags on the actual post, but tags on the user who created it.  We'll
</I>&gt;<i> just have to see how it works before deciding whether or not to keep
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How to rank the comments is another aspect I've given thought to but
</I>&gt;<i> didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dive into here because as you said, I didn't want to take on too much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bring it on!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hope this clears things up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, it seems like we're on the same page anyway.
