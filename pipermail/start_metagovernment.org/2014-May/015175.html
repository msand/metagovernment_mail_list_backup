Better late than never!

&gt;<i> I think this discussion came full-circle... and I think the conclusion is: mixing proposal tuning and voting creates consensus (i.e., the subject line of this message).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott, you're proposing small groups of volunteers working on proposals. So am I. But I don't think they are going to get it right, no matter how well-intentioned, well-informed, or well-educated they are. As the proposal gains larger visibility, it will get pushback.
</I>
Agreed, and this *reduces* the likelihood of consensus.

&gt;<i> That is why voting should be iterative and mixed with the proposal development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let the interested volunteers work up proposals, then as those proposals near acceptance their visibility grows, more people jump in, and they meet resistance. So the proposals need to be tweaked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are we even disagreeing? It sounds to me like we're all arguing for proposal tuning as the involved population grows. It's just a matter of terminology at this point, no?
</I>
We are disagreeing because you didn't address the issue of resource
utilization, specifically the time commitment for people who &quot;jump in&quot;
at some point prior to the &quot;final&quot; version of a proposal.  Every one
of those will have to review the proposal repeatedly as it is
modified.  Expecting more than a small percentage of the population to
do this is simply unreasonable IMHO.

I've put out my ballpark estimate of how many proposals a person would
have to vote on to run a government (both local and global) and how
long it should take (2 or 3 a week, less than an hour, based on what
is required now at all levels in the US).  Do you have an estimate as
to how much more time commitment it will require if repeated votes are
held?  Or is your solution simply to reduce the percentage of the
population who will actually vote?
  Regards,
    Scott
