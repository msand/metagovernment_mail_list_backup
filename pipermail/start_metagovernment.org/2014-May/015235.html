<PRE>I am in the middle of two crises and cannot catch up on my reading in this list right now, but I strongly disagree with this proposal. Defining what function something has at this moment limits what it is able to be. Do we want to be nothing but a discussion group? Should we delete the wiki? Should we stop participating in each others' projects?

At the very least, I would change &quot;discussion group&quot; to &quot;community,&quot; as it opens the door for other forms of community. Additionally, this group has performed and continues to perform functions as a testbed for projects to experiment on. Michael, you can say that hasn't worked for you, but we have used Votorola (very successfully!) to come up with the rules for defining the home page, we have also used Vilfredo and Candiwi to come to decisions, as well as some other platforms on occasion.

Also, the wiki does perform functions outside of what you may know. It gets a fair amount of traffic (see the footer of any page), is linked to from ~10 pages in Wikipedia (which is huge), and the lists of active/related projects have potential to evolve into a really great resource (something that I would love to work on, and would encourage others to improve).

Additionally, the purpose of a home page should be to inform people about what the group/project/community/whatever is about: why we exist, what the mission is. If we're going to change the home page, I'd rather it be to something like the elevator pitch:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>
(perhaps with some modification to the second sentence.)


Sorry I cannot participate more at this time. If we're discussing modification of the home page, please note that these rules apply:

The underlying poll that lead to that page is here:

</I>&gt;<i> PROPOSAL
</I>&gt;<i> --------
</I>&gt;<i> Following on Bentley's suggestion, I propose that we replace the home

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Metagovernment is a discussion group about tools that enable
</I>&gt;<i>   collaborative governance.  &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone disagree with this proposal?  Does anyone have an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative proposal for the home page?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To clarify: As you said there is no active project. There is an active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group of people with a common mission of discussing tools and idea around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools for government. I believe we are generally doing what the first two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sentences of the Metagovernment website says:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The Metagovernment project supports internet tools to enable collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance. We are a global community of people working on numerous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects which further this goal.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although the &quot;support&quot; at this time is just a place to discuss and debate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the tools need to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe a better summary would be &quot; Metagovernment is a discussion group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about tools that enable collaborative governance.&quot;
