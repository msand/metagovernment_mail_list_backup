<PRE>I believe the system only allows for one proposal to be considered at a
time. Anyone can propose a new proposal if one is not already there. I
believe everyone can even close the current proposal and then create a new
one. I can see no way to edit a proposal so when better wording was
suggested I close the current proposal and create a new one with the new
wording. Since I was the only person that voted for the proposal and the
updated wording was clearly superior I didn't think anyone would mind the
proposal changes.

Theoretically you can tell what proposal the comments applied to as the
proposals and the comments are listed chronologically in the discussion
text. It's not easy to see though as the textual changes are not fully
shown in the list.

</I>&gt;<i> Seems simple enough to me, my problem is the opposite: Many of the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There seems to be the question and a motivation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of: there's a &quot;discussion&quot; with a title and description.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There then seems to be a specific title and a fuller body and that is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can vote on the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That part is easy, although I'm not keen on that &quot;veto&quot; power that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone has..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I can make a statement about the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually you can just make general statements and there isn't any way
</I>&gt;<i> to determine what specific proposal it refers to.  And Bently keeps
</I>&gt;<i> changing the damn proposals!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Okay.  I would want to make a different proposal.  I Do Not Know how.
</I>&gt;<i>  Also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since i agree with the first title but not the details of the proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should my title be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like only Bentley can do that (he being the one who set up that
</I>&gt;<i> discussion).  You can create a new discussion and create proposals for
</I>&gt;<i> that, but can't edit or replace proposals in other people's
</I>&gt;<i> discussions.  Weird, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only 6 people joined.  I can't promise it to be super-fun, but you
</I>&gt;<i> really do need to at least play with the system for a few minutes to
</I>&gt;<i> have an informed opinion about how these things should work (or not
</I>&gt;<i> work, as the case may be).
