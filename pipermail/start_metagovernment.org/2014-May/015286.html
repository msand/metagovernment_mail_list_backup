<PRE>Hi James, The group has made a decision and we ought to respect it.
Your proposals (re the home page, the decision process) are welcome,
but please take them to a separate thread. - Mike

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my experience as a web developer you never put up the &quot;under
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; construction&quot; sign. As much as we would like to think we know what will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; happen we don't. The last thing we want is an extended blankness for some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reason, or people have no idea what we do and perhaps lose membership.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we want to discuss what we want there and then replace when we actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have something that would make more sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've been doing web consulting for a while so that is IMNotSoHO.
