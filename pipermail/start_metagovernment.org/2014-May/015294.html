<PRE>Yes, let's reflect calmly.  The home page now clearly belongs to the
group as a whole, which is an unaccustomed responsibility.  Naturally
we feel a little nervous in the new situation, but let's not panic.
Nothing bad is about to happen.  There's no ticking clock of doom.
We're not actually drilling into dangerous rock yet, nor sailing into
dangerous seas.  We're just reflecting calmly.

We're free to define ourselves as we please, and to express ourselves
as we please in our home page, and to do all of this in our own time.

&gt;<i> Haha,

</I>&gt;<i> Here is another one that might sit you better.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let pretend you are charting a course through dangerous water. You gathered
</I>&gt;<i> your plans and decided on a course, but before you leave someone comes up
</I>&gt;<i> and says, &quot;hey, I have navigated those waters before. It actually looks to
</I>&gt;<i> me like you ship sits deeper than you thought it would. Here, and here
</I>&gt;<i> (points to the map) you might want to revisit.&quot; The response, &quot;Actually, we
</I>&gt;<i> have already decided, so we will go with that.&quot; As if somehow the act of
</I>&gt;<i> deciding made the path through more safe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The dangers of the path is independent of decision. But, if you would like
</I>&gt;<i> to continue on that course, I'll support you. Just know it has real risks
</I>&gt;<i> that exist outside of wether or not we decide that they are there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear James Thank you!, you put in this metaphoric tale what I say in two
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; word,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I say that was &quot;not vital&quot; to blank the page but we could live with it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; until a new one was developed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The blanking as the metaphor of the drilling sound to me so much &quot;italian&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the way it was  operated!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So I know that a group decision was made and I was asked to move this to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; another thread so I am. Let me give an example of what just happened here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in a different context. If you want to keep the decision as is that's okay,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but don't say I didn't warn you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Lets imagine you are drilling for oil. You work on a plan as a company
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and decide to move forward. Right before you start mining someone visits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and says, &quot;Hey you know, I have actually drilled there before and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; angle you chose will actually cause a bunch of damage to your equipment and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; cause unforeseen losses. You might want to revisit.&quot; The group responds,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;well, since we already decided we have to honor that decision so we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; going to drill anyway&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Really? I would ask anyone who has experience in this field to challenge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; me on this. I just didn't want to sit back and say nothing.  And really,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you want to sit behind a group decision that went on for a week in light of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; new information that should effect your decision? I would hope the group is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; smarter than that. Again, if anyone has experience in this field I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; gladly hear from him.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And again, if you want to stick with it by all means do. If the group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; want's to I will support that decision. I just hope we won't hide behind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the &quot;We have already decided, because we have already decided, and that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the reason why we will do it&quot; when there is new information to consider.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; James
