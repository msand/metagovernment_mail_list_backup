<PRE>I just want to chime in to say that I&#8217;m following the various threads of the current conversation and am really resonating with what&#8217;s emerging. I wish I had more time to join in. 
Also, I find myself wishing I could vote (or thumbs up) some of the various ideas presented here&#8230;..and am wondering who is taking notes. ;-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I may present a potential scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Looks good to me!  A few small comments:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - This creates small groups of advocates that could craft crazy proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and gain some interest for their cause. Whatever interest they generate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works against them though as their proposal becomes more popular, good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> citizens of the world will begin to notice more and start to investigate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their potential weaknesses. This exposes any hidden agenda or truths as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debate carries on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I surmise that a proposal should only go forward to a voting stage with at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least a 51% participation rate of all active members on the site. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be a difficult thing to do and will require sustained interest in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal guaranteeing it remains near the top of the site to ensure it gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seen.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This seems a bit high to me, but again this is an empirical question
</I>&gt;<i> and I think we'll have to wait to see how small these &quot;working groups&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> end up being.  I'm also inclined try to tie in some sort of rating
</I>&gt;<i> threshold (twice as many pros as cons, ratings on pro statements
</I>&gt;<i> averaging a full point higher than cons, etc.) and a greenlight from
</I>&gt;<i> the proposer(s) who may feel like they need time for additional tweaks
</I>&gt;<i> to ensure the proposal will pass the general vote rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> taking it out of their hands when it reaches some threshold.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Participation does not necessary include making a post, as many users can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be bothered to research a strong counter argument. Participation can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply be reading the proposal a bit finding an opinion that reflects their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view on the issue and up voting that post. This up vote increases the weight
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of that post in the discussion and makes their opinion a larger part of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision, exposing it as well to possible weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly: Merely giving a pro or con statement a rating should be
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient to count toward moving the proposal to a vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - This process creates our pros and cons list that can be drafted and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presented in a simplified way to then move on to the voting stage where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still more of the public will be involved. A majority of 2/3 of the votes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take it. Everything is open and transparent the entire time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, the majority necessary to approve may need to be tweaked, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would at least *hope* that 2/3 will be achievable and so it seems
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to start with that goal.  This will put the fire to the
</I>&gt;<i> feet of the proposers to do their best work.  One alternative we might
</I>&gt;<i> consider is to vary the supermajority required as a function of the
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of registered voters who cast a vote.  My big concern is
</I>&gt;<i> that if only 1/3 of the people vote even a 2/3 or 3/4 majority won't
</I>&gt;<i> be enough to ensure that the Neurotypicals will keep the SDAs (who
</I>&gt;<i> tend to vote in larger numbers, especially for those relatively few
</I>&gt;<i> issues they really care about) in check.  If the SDAs make up 30% of
</I>&gt;<i> the population (probably a high estimate, and not all of them would
</I>&gt;<i> vote) we'd need 2/3 of registered voters to actually vote (possibly by
</I>&gt;<i> proxy) with a simple majority rule for the Neurotypicals to play their
</I>&gt;<i> proper role in the process.  The lower the percentage of registered
</I>&gt;<i> voters who vote, the larger the supermajority would have to be such
</I>&gt;<i> that if you get down into the 30% range the vote to approve would have
</I>&gt;<i> to be unanimous or nearly so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Participation is voluntary but there can be penalties for incorrectly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participating in the discussion. You can never be penalized for up voting or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting. This limits input without limiting quality.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm opposed to &quot;penalties&quot; per se, but being flagged and filtered by
</I>&gt;<i> people (which an individual would be notified of) should be sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> incentive for the potentially troublesome individuals to alter their
</I>&gt;<i> behavior to confirm to societal norms.  Again, this is the way we
</I>&gt;<i> humans did it for millions of years and we ignore that fact at our
</I>&gt;<i> peril.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any reason why this wouldn't work?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably a thousand that we haven't thought of ;-)  What we need now
</I>&gt;<i> is a working prototype so that we can start shaping the UI and those
</I>&gt;<i> thresholds.  I'm working on it but am taking my time selecting a
</I>&gt;<i> platform (I'm doing the Django tutorial right now) to avoid having to
</I>&gt;<i> start over if I pick the wrong one to start out with.
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
