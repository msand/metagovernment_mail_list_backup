<PRE>Hi Steve, (I greatly regret not having more time for this at this point ...)

Regarding clearinghouse and notification functionality:

    * I agree with Ed that we desperately need an &quot;overview&quot;
      clearinghouse site and a general proposal notification system at
      this point.
    * I agree with you that using a wiki-page as clearinghouse and the
      list for notification leaves much to be desired.
    * I agree with you that Loomio handles its own proposals and
      notification well.
    * But it does not look to me like Loomio would be able to serve as a
      general clearinghouse site and notification system, for proposals
      being decided on other platforms. (I would be most appreciative to
      be shown that I am wrong about that.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Steve&gt; The proposer decides the respective window. Others can
    challenge it if it seems unsuitable for the matter at hand.

    Ned&gt; (We will of course need to specify how the challenge is to be
    effected &#8230;)

    Steve&gt; What would you suggest?

Ned&gt; Each particular platform will need its own answers to this 
question. The answers will also depend on the characteristics of the 
clearinghouse site and the notification system. It is a very important 
question, but (alas) not one that I have time to speak to now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Enabling blocking without enabling any effective means to
    resolve unreasonable blocks is doomed to produce a system fail, ...

    Steve&gt; Loomio seems to be working quite well for a number of groups
    and organizations.

You are absolutely correct that the question is an empirical one. If you 
propose (on Loomio) that instead of using Scott's decision rule or the 
Metagov RULES page decision rule, we use (on Loomio) a &quot;Proposer picks 
the decision rule&quot; decision rule, I will definitely vote for it. I agree 
that we should run the experiments, rather than just sit in our 
armchairs guessing about the outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
