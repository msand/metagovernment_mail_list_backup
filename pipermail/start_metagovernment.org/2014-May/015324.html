<PRE>Hi Steve, (Great Move!)

Steve wrote: Please respond individually to each line item below.

   1. We allow everyone on this list a certain window of time to state
      whether they are willing and able to participate in this groups
      discussions and decision making (I'm thinking 2 weeks). If a
      lurker changes their mind, or if someone joins the list at a later
      date, they can sign on and participate from that point on.

      Ned&gt; I should think that anyone should be free to sign up to be on
      the list, and that anyone on the list should be free to
      participate or not at any point, as each chooses, in the moment.
      To me, requiring a separate declaration of participation (or
      whatever) is straight-up unacceptable. I am not interested in
      being a member of an &quot;us versus them&quot; private club. We are all
      riding around on planet earth together.

   2. We choose a platform (Airesis, Loomio, Vilfredo, Votorola, or &#8230; )
      to use for a given length of time. All [MG] decisions will be made
      on that platform for that period of time (maybe 6 months). This
      window should allow us time to adjust to the platform, test it,
      use it, and offer constructive feedback to the developer. Then we
      move on to another platform and do the same.

      Ned&gt; Absolutely not. The proposer (each proposer) should be free
      to choose the platform upon which to propose. The last thing that
      we need at this point is arbitrary and unnecessary regimentation.

   3. For each proposal/decision, the quorum is comprised of those
      participating. The time allotted for the discussion is relative to
      the significance or gravity of the proposals effect on the group.
      The proposer decides the respective window. Others can challenge
      it if it seems unsuitable for the matter at hand.

      Ned&gt; I would suggest: &quot;For each proposal/decision, the quorum is
      comprised of those participating. The proposer decides the
      respective window. Others can challenge it if it seems unsuitable
      for the matter at hand.&quot; (We will of course need to specify how
      the challenge is to be effected ...)

   4. In all decisions we strive for consensus. A decision becomes
      binding if, in the window of time allotted for the proposal, there
      are no blocks to its passing. If the proposal is blocked and
      someone in the group feels that, with more time, a consensus could
      be reached, they can then restate the proposal and choose a new
      window for it&#8217;s discussion and possible passage.

      Ned&gt; Enabling blocking without enabling any effective means to
      resolve unreasonable blocks is doomed to produce a system fail,
      and will give &quot;consensus&quot; a bad name when it does.

      The best means that we humans have available to us through which
      to resolve unreasonable blocks is rational discourse.

      SettleIt and Blinap and Vilfredo are examples of decision systems
      that (a) enable blocking, and (b) enable effective means through
      which to resolve unreasonable blocks. Loomio is an example of a
      decision system that enables blocking without enabling any
      effective means through which to resolve unreasonable blocks.

      Since neither SettleIt nor Blinap are available for use at this
      point, it would be a bad idea for us to enable blocking (except on
      Vilfredo), which means that we are stuck (for now) with having to
      cast and count votes to reach decisions, and with majority or
      super-majority rule. Bummer.
