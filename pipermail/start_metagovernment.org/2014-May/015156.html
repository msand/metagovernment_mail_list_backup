This would be OK *except* for the issue of Social Dominators and
Authoritarians.  If they can find a way to reduce overall
participation to increase their own influence, they've no qualms about
doing so (e.g., as they do now do discourage voting by putting
barriers to participation in place using the bogus excuse of
preventing voter fraud).   The result will be a government even worse
than what we have now because even more of the votes would go the way
these SDAs want (starting wars, enshrining prejudice, punishing
whoever, etc.) which is worse than having representatives, currently
somewhat less than half of whom are SDAs, at least in the US by my
estimate.

&gt;<i> Freedom is for me correlated to participation.

The issue isn't freedom, it's good government.  We *need* high
participation rates to keep the SDAs in check.

So, my current thinking on the decision rule is 51% of the actual
voters or 1/3 of the registered voters, WHICHEVER IS LARGER, have to
vote yes.  This gets you concensus/near unanimity in low turnout
elections which will keep the SDAs (maybe 30% of the population) in
check, and yet also allows progress on controversial issues where you
have high turnout.  This seems a reasonable rule to me mostly given
the existence of proxies that those who aren't able to invest the time
to research every issue in detail will be able to use.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: we found an implementation of Altemeyer's authoritarian test on
OK-Cupid (a dating site, of all places), and the news at least there
is good: In that sample of around 1800 people the authoritarian
percentage is somewhat less than 20%.  Add in a few percent for the
non-correlated social dominators and we're still under a quarter of
that population.  There unfortunately are some serious issues with
that survey:
1) self-selected sample
2) dating oriented and so probably more socially aware
3) It's labelled an &quot;authoritarian test&quot; (should have been labeled as
a general personality test to avoid bias).

I'm going to put one of these up on my site when I get to that point
(labelled something clickbait like &quot;what kind of dragon are you&quot;) to
try collect data from FB/reddit/slashdot users.
