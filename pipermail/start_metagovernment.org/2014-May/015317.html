Definitely, and I've always been a fan of &quot;the right people show up&quot;
when trying to decide whether a committee or other working group has a
quorum/mandate to develop a new proposal.  But that is not the same
thing as allowing that group to hold a vote *binding* the entire
population to a decision...

&gt;<i> I think we&#8217;ve
</I>&gt;<i> learned here that one week is too short of a timeframe, so we should
</I>&gt;<i> lengthen that. But we cannot define a quorum by a percentage of the list
</I>&gt;<i> membership (that is 159 at this moment).
</I>
If this were a normal government, that low of a participation rate
would be pretty terrifying.  But most of those people obviously don't
care because we are not actually binding them to anything, and I'd
even suspect that a significant number of those addresses are just
effectively dead.  So I agree that we can't use any conventional
definition of quorum to set a criteria for whether a vote is binding
or not.   But I'm inclined to accept the legitimacy of my decision
rule as it applies to votes we've held on Loomio (currently 9
registered members of the group).

&gt;<i> 4. Decisions should stick when they are made. This is a tough one, and I see
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of people arguing with it.
</I>
I agree: The time to voice your opinion is when you first hear about
the proposal, not later when you see that it didn't go your way.  This
custom must apply not just to governing this group, but also to the
general systems we eventually produce.  I worry about flapping too,
but in a larger population *everything* is going to just take a lot
longer and so reversals will not happen often because of the amount of
work it would require.  But I would be happy if they happen more often
than in our current representative-based governments, where reversing
an earlier (bad) decision is like pulling teeth and so is extremely
rare.

&gt;<i> So please go forth with proposals to change the home page. Heck, someone can
</I>&gt;<i> make a proposal to restore it. I might vote for that.
</I>
I see that you are not a member of the Loomio group, but would again
encourage you to try it out.  Same goes for anyone else who want to
make this sort of proposal.  I'm certainly no big fan of Loomio, but
it works and I believe we should continue to use it until something
better comes along.  That web site again is loomio.org, and the group
name is &quot;Metagovernment&quot;.  Note that you have to apply for membership,
so it's a two step process (i.e., don't wait until the last minute and
expect everything to happen instantly, better join now so that when
something important comes along you won't get held up).
  Regards,
   Scott
