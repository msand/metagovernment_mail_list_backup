Not totally clear on your exact stance here but I think this is an
important distinction to make. For the most part everything should be
public and transparent. However I think people need to feel safe expressing
themselves, if their identity is not anonymous (everyone posting under
their public names) there will be certainly be problems irl. Politics needs
to be kept private to an extent or we'll lose voices to fear.


I think every user getting a number is our best alternative. A number which
only they should know. That way everyone's free to say whatever they want.
Voting is recorded and displayed publicly to see and check. Individuals
listed number and which way they voted are public, all activity is recorded
and reviewable. Just their true identity needs to be kept safe. Users true
identities will have to be recorded eventually but no one should ever need
to access it. It should just be automatic. Difficult to pull off maybe...
but I don't think impossible.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quite effective at) manipulating the rest of us, many of whom have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own &quot;issues&quot; that allow this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; believe in software like Airesis where I am actively working and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; like open annotation... <A HREF="http://vimeo.com/29633009">http://vimeo.com/29633009</A> or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; f.... with me I will spot them because i will have tools to spot them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now who's pessimistic?  My proposal is not about &quot;spotting&quot; them, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about sorting/filtering the input so you seldom run into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problematic or just useless stuff, regardless of its source.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes Social Dominators and Authoritarians *do* have useful things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to contribute.  It's probably relatively uncommon, particularly for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who have decided to take the full-on troll tactic, but it still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happens often enough that our best tool is sorting/filtering based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the content itself rather than on the producer.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Open Annotation looks like a bunch of smart people with good ideas,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but a slick video does not a revolution make.  If they get some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> traction then that system can certainly be integrated with ours.  But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO they have misidentified the real problem and have given up on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public voting in favor of privacy and anonymity (which is what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarians want and in fact *need* to maintain their control), so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're working with one hand tied behind their backs and my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> predictions is that they're therefore unlikely to amount to much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless here is some aspect that goes beyond being authoritarian or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; liberal or what ever we may be labeled.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I read some article about this new research into human psychology
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw</A>  Probably we need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enforce some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; kind of genetic DNA test to find the extreme-ist character and enforce a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; karma handicap in online voting!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, but that would be an authoritarian tactic and so unfortunately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not available to us.  Fortunately there's a whole world of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sort of psychological information available to us to use in designing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a system that works without explicitly discriminating against
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS: Finished with Django and have ruled that out, and am now knee-deep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in revIgniter which is a LiveCode clone of codeIgniter, a PHP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framework.  The more of these things I look at, the more they all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> start to look the same.  They're all basically doing the same things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same way and yet are all much harder to learn and harder to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than they need to be.  Part of this is that they're also a lot more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general purpose than what I need so the path forward is starting to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reveal itself to me: It seems it doesn't really matter which framework
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I use since I'm probably only going to use a fraction of what it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> offers and now that I've got the lay of the land I can pick and port
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whichever bits I need from those other frameworks if they're not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already available in the one I end up using.  Taking this &quot;machete
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode&quot; route is going to make *me* a lot more productive at the cost of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe making it a bit harder for experts on my base framework to pitch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in and help.  But I don't see them lining up anytime soon and given
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the cross-framework competition I'm seeing creating a &quot;catholic&quot; route
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like this might actually make it easier for zealots for other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frameworks to pitch in because they won't have to cross enemy lines...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Kind Regards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; J
