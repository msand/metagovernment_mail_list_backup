</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Not totally clear on your exact stance here but I think this is an important
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> distinction to make. For the most part everything should be public and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> transparent. However I think people need to feel safe expressing themselves,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if their identity is not anonymous (everyone posting under their public
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> names) there will be certainly be problems irl. Politics needs to be kept
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> private to an extent or we'll lose voices to fear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know this is a really tempting position to take, but I'm becoming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> increasingly convinced that not only is it not necessary, but is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually incompatible with human nature and our goal of good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government.  The great irony here is that it is primarily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarians who are constantly harping on this issue, yet it is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characteristics of those very people that are the reason why we can't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provide them what they want:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Being both fearful *and* unusually susceptible to social pressure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are key personality characteristics of authoritarians (although not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social dominators, who in general I believe will be on board with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public voting).  By giving up on public voting, we basically give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these authoritarians a free pass on voting based on their fears and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their tendency to take on antisocial positions (prejudice and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> warmongering being two of their favorites).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Authoritarians are actually *also* the primary concern as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *instigators* of pressure on others to vote a particular way.  When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you talk about a boss or a husband coercing someone's vote, the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nature of the situation calls it out as an authoritarian dynamic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Neurotypicals not only are far less likely to apply this kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pressure (their tolerance for diversity being much higher), but are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also far less likely to be responsive to it.  If a wife (and it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> always a wife) feels pressure from her husband to vote the way he
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> says, that's not a problem with the system, it's a problem with her
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marriage, and not one we as a people need to try to solve by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bolstering the power of her husband (and to add to the irony, note
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that this very question is actually *on* Altemeyer's RWA test!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only exception I can think of is on certain redistribution issues
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where there is an inherent conflict between the preferences of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corporation and that of their employees (e.g., an employee of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defense contractor voting to reduce the defense budget or cancel a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weapon system, or maybe voting against a measure that would encourage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other employers to relocate into the area which would increase
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> competition on their employer).  But I note that this problem already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exists and people's participation in the process is already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> constrained (e.g., no generating petitions or even signing them if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they'd be detrimental to one's employer!).  By opening the system up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we're bringing social engineering tools to bear on the issue, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means we can reduce the bystander effect (look it up!) and so not only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not cause a new problem but help solve another old one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In summary &quot;losing voices to fear&quot; I think is a useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> characterization, I'm just saying this is a feature of the new system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not a bug: As a species we need to evolve our customs beyond the point
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where our behavior is dominated by our fearful animal natures.  We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evolved to work in environments where public voting was the standard
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice and we need to take this fact into consideration when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designing our new system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think every user getting a number is our best alternative. A number which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> only they should know. That way everyone's free to say whatever they want.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Voting is recorded and displayed publicly to see and check. Individuals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> listed number and which way they voted are public, all activity is recorded
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and reviewable. Just their true identity needs to be kept safe. Users true
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> identities will have to be recorded eventually but no one should ever need
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to access it. It should just be automatic. Difficult to pull off maybe...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> but I don't think impossible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think impossible, and this is covered in my book:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) What happens when Snowden or Manning goes to work for The System
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and releases all the name/number data?  Shut the whole government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down?  Destroy all the old vote and proposal records?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Even with a number people will be very hesitant to provide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficient details in their posts that would allow others to identify
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them if they believe this is necessary to preserve their anonymity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes this information is absolutely necessary to assess someone's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argument.  For example, if a proposal is for a road to be widened, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes a hell of a lot of difference whether a poster lives on that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> road or instead is one of the people who commutes using that road.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Use of screen names is an important part of my proposal because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> although it doesn't guaranty anonymity it at least removes the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tendency to make disagreements personal.  But it's human nature to try
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to &quot;out&quot; people who are disagreeing with you.  This tendency needs to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be curbed using social engineering (i.e., a way to flag someone who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does this), but again, we can't make the system vulnerable to collapse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when people break taboo and do it anyway.  Assigning a new number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every time this happens is just not a reasonable option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has this issue been debated on this list before?  Anyone got any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> literature to cite on the matter?  My &quot;bible&quot; (Public Choice III) only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentions the issue of secret ballots a handful of times, and only one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can find where it is the variable: That one says voter participation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *decreased* by 7% in 1890s when secret ballots were introduced, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theory being that this was due to widespread vote buying at that time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and when you can't verify a vote you can't pay someone to vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you.  But in a direct democracy the corruption that goes along with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote buying is not only much easier to spot, but much less likely to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even be a problem in general (i.e., paying *everyone* to vote a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certain way isn't corruption, it's compensation, and so only a problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if the amount is significantly lower than any negative economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effects of the vote).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Regards,
