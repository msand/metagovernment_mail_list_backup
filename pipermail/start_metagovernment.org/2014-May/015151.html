&gt;<i> Very good Scott, thanks for clearing some of that up.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mention moderators. What do you foresee their job being exactly? Since
</I>&gt;<i> most is done by the flagging system. We may need moderators at first to
</I>&gt;<i> work out glitches. Ideally though I think you would agree would be a system
</I>&gt;<i> without moderators, a system that could run on the participation of its
</I>&gt;<i> members alone. I believe it's achievable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I fail to see how missing posts doesn't distort the conversation. If a
</I>&gt;<i> user with no filters attached to their profile gets into an argument with
</I>&gt;<i> an individual who's been flagged as a troll, users with the troll filter on
</I>&gt;<i> would see a neutral user just arguing with himself pointlessly. This is
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary space and time being wasted by actual users trying to read and
</I>&gt;<i> learn about real issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My envisioned model would not be &quot;The System&quot; that punishes them but in
</I>&gt;<i> fact other users. A post is flagged/reported several times. A message is
</I>&gt;<i> then sent out to a random unconnected active user that an infraction has
</I>&gt;<i> occurred. This user can then check the infraction and make a call whether
</I>&gt;<i> to punish the culprit or not based on the established rules of the forum.
</I>&gt;<i> If the user feels the culprit broke a rule they lock the post from
</I>&gt;<i> receiving any further replies and attaches a comment to the original post
</I>&gt;<i> on why the decision was made. The culprit must then take a time out from
</I>&gt;<i> posting. If the culprit does not feel the verdict was justified then I
</I>&gt;<i> think a situation like the &quot;Forum Court&quot; you suggested could be utilized.
</I>&gt;<i> However the punishment would have to be more severe in this stage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the penalty aspect puts these annoying users out of commission for
</I>&gt;<i> an extended period so the rest of the site can get back to business. I
</I>&gt;<i> think we should be attempting to discourage rampant posting, keeping the
</I>&gt;<i> overall structure as clean and simple as possible.  This would make the
</I>&gt;<i> site easier to navigate through and promoting a higher standard of posting
</I>&gt;<i> etiquette would ensure a greater ratio of quality posts, which would
</I>&gt;<i> encourage individuals to read more conversations since they know they're
</I>&gt;<i> not wasting their time with pointless posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your method although nice to give everyone the freedom to post whatever, I
</I>&gt;<i> feel opens the site up to a lot of unnecessary discussion and confusion. I
</I>&gt;<i> feel like it would be an ongoing problem as there's no actual punishment
</I>&gt;<i> for being annoying, annoying people will just keep doing it, complicating
</I>&gt;<i> the site's view ability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> www.theinternetswebsite.com is my project. It's a working prototype of
</I>&gt;<i> sorts, though doesn't yet have the activity to realize its full potential
</I>&gt;<i> as a functioning forum of debate. The basic concepts at least for what
</I>&gt;<i> we're trying to accomplish are presented. I'd be interested to hear what
</I>&gt;<i> you thought of it as our views appear to be similar. I currently lack the
</I>&gt;<i> funds and the knowledge to continue to improve upon it. I'd be willing to
</I>&gt;<i> let you have access to build upon it if you thought it could make a solid
</I>&gt;<i> platform. Would save you some time and would make my efforts worth
</I>&gt;<i> something. If we were to partner up I would step up my efforts on
</I>&gt;<i> promotion of the idea. Media creation is more my strong suit and I believe
</I>&gt;<i> it's going to take a massive public awareness campaign to empower
</I>&gt;<i> individuals to believe in this new system, something that can come through
</I>&gt;<i> viral videos. We live in a very exciting time where all of this is possible
</I>&gt;<i> even with limited resources, collaboration is what we need.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; To get back to the filtering issue, I'd appreciate some clarity on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Do you intend to have filters on particular language like any post that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; included the word &quot;homosexual&quot; an individual could omit those results
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; their feed? I think you can see that this would both confuse the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; conversations to have randomly missing posts as well as deprive the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; individual of a different opinion and a chance to expand their mind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; way they could just vote against any gay rights without even hearing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the other side had to hear. This is problematic would you not agree?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wasn't proposing filtering on words, but instead on flags.  There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be obviously be some interaction between the two, so for example
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if some individual repeatedly use racial or sexual orientation *slurs*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of whatever the PC term-du-jour is that their posts would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> likely get flagged and as a result filtered by some/many people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Missing posts in a feed are not that big of a deal and you see this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the time on newspaper sites (someone will respond to a post prior
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a moderator getting around to deleting it).  Whether or not some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clue that there was a filtered post is shown in the feed I think is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> UI issue we'll have to decide once we see how it works.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The other option which you seem to be hinting at is that users would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to flag other users into categories like, flammer, troll etc. and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; filters to hide those individuals. My concern with this is people being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; flagged as a troll will be stuck in that. What happens if someone comes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; their senses and decides to try and change, their already stuck as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> troll
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and mostly everyone has filtered them out already, they'll be invisible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; life. Seems like it would be very hard to correct their state once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in a box.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good point, and one I've been struggling with myself.  I've come up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with three solutions to this problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Flag expiration.  Maybe they only stick around for a month or two,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so the affected user's posts will gradually start appearing in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people's feeds again, in proportion to how tight that individual's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filters are set.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) On-line training: An individual could take a course on on-line
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forum etiquette and have their flags cleared.  Kind of like traffic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> court, where taking a class reduces the points on against your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> license.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) &quot;Forum Court&quot;, where an individual could appeal the flags to a jury
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of their peers (self selected, or maybe chosen at random like regular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> juries are) where the offending posts would be discussed and a vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> taken to reverse the user flags if warranted.  I think we need this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> option anyway because it would also be used to appeal moderator
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions: Although user flagging should make up the bulk of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moderation process (specifically there must not be any post removal by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> moderators based on profanity or personal attacks) we're still going
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to need moderators and we need a way for The People to review and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> override those moderators both to help weed out the bad ones and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent the moderators themselves from becoming a too-powerful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> influence in the process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My recommendation is to instead have guidelines established, rules of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; kind of behavior is acceptable on the system. Break a rule and enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; report/flag you, your post is locked and you are served a time penalty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; you are not allowed to post. Once the time period is up you're free to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; again but the next time you're caught breaking a rule the time penalty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; increases. This enables and encourages individuals to clean up their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> act but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; punishes continual offenders and rids the site of problem people without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; having to sensor or omit any information, we should all be on the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and see what the community is talking about.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As I expressed in my other posts I'm opposed to these types of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;punishments&quot; because they're a relatively poor way to achieve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> desired outcome (as punishment for antisocial behavior is in general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> according to just about all the psychological research (e.g., see the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section in the book on crime and punishment)).  It *is* censorship and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also turns the whole process upside down: It should never be perceived
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that The System that is punishing a user, it should always be known
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it is only the other users who are individually making the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision to banish or ostracize a problem individual.  This is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technique that we *evolved* to use and be responsive to, and resorting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to authoritarian techniques is not only less effective, but has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bunch of negative side effects that come along with it (i.e., this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> huge problem we have of people hating on the government when in fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *we are* the government).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I do think we should allow filtering but they should be inclusive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Keywords - so you can search &quot;homosexual&quot; if that's your area of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expertise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and have a list populated with all topics including that word.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We definitely need global search features and saved searches to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> facilitate this.  In the book I also propose ways to specify these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kinds of things in an individual's &quot;Goals&quot; settings area such that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like-minded individuals could find each other to work on a proposal if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no one of them has the time or skill to take on creating a proposal by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with a lot of what you're saying but this area is still unclear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As it is to me.  This back-and-forth is how this thing *should* be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed and I appreciate all the questions/comments as it really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helps me clarify my own understanding of the issues.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
