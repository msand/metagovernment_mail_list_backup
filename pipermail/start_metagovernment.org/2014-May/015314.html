<PRE>-1 by me @ Minimize Disruption Proposal

Because: Although i believe that the process should protect against
&quot;flapping&quot;, i currently think, a period of one week during which a
consensus must be held is enough to prevent flapping, while the above given
proposal would need some kind of &quot;authority&quot; which would decide whether new
information is given or not, which is in fact a very personal matter. What
is new information to someone might be ancient information to someone else.

</I>&gt;<i> If a decision is made and any party comes forward with new information a

</I>&gt;<i> discussed and that information has been accounted for then the group can
</I>&gt;<i> move forward with the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So only if something new or important is brought up would it be

</I>&gt;<i> take important info in if we had not thought of it before as a group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as we want to think we are very smart and have thought of
</I>&gt;<i> everything a lot of the time we haven't. That is why a group like this is
</I>&gt;<i> important to the decision making process. If new information is brought
</I>&gt;<i> forth we shouldn't discard it because we have already made a decision. That
</I>&gt;<i> would be foolish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things to be decided is:
</I>&gt;<i> How much of the group needs to agree that it is not new information in
</I>&gt;<i> order to be ignored and visa versa.
