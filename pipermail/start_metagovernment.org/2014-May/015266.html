<PRE>Thanks Marc.  Here's where we currently stand:

   PROPOSAL 1
   ----------
   Blank the home page and insert the following:

      The content of the home page is currently under discussion.
      &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;

   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike, Reid, Scott, Steve
   Against: Marc


Marc asked:
&gt;<i> MIke, two questions on this:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) what's your definition of &quot;not for long&quot;?
</I>
I'd defer to the group on that.  But if the home page is still blank
in a few weeks *and* it's looking like it'll be staying that way, then
it means there's a deep problem here.  That shouldn't happen.  At that
point, we should probably speak with Ed about taking some kind of
corrective action.  Ed can do that, of course, because he owns the
wiki and the list.  He could fix things if necessary.  But I'm sure he
won't do that unless the group itself proves incapable of taking
action.  And I doubt that very much.

&gt;<i> (2) how would you like to &quot;ensure proper content&quot;?
</I>
By talking about it and agreeing to it.  You'll see; if the decision
passes, then people will come together and do the right thing.  They
always do, when it's important.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> Mike said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Marc said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... we should keep the current content, because this is based on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; former decision until we have a newer decision, isn't it??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, I think the former decision wasn't valid.  Our common desire to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change the home page at the time was valid, but we did it improperly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thomas might disagree, but I think he'd change his mind if we spoke to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; him about it.  I can explain more, if you like.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO there are two fundamental characteristics of
</I>&gt;<i> A decision
</I>&gt;<i> (1) is always valid, that means the decision itself holds even if the 
</I>&gt;<i> backing assumptions change
</I>&gt;<i> (2) should be in a flow, that means if the backing assumptions change, a new 
</I>&gt;<i> decision should be made
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Speaking for myself, I vote to blank the page till we agree what to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; put there.  The current content is false and misleading, and a blank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page is always better than a false page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given the characteristics above, even if the content of the home page is not 
</I>&gt;<i> optimal (you said 'false and misleading'), it is better than nothing (blank 
</I>&gt;<i> page).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's just my own opinion.  Please speak your mind, Marc.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; registered your vote, yet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence I'll vote for keeping the content until we decide for a better one and 
</I>&gt;<i> place a remark at the top of the home page stating that the content needs 
</I>&gt;<i> improvment and link to the discussion thread. It's a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Reid said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't mind blanking the home page just so long as we come up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; things to put on it relatively quickly. ... If I was to come across
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a homepage that just read &quot;Owing to a dispute, the content of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; home page is currently under discussion. ... &quot; I doubt I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; inclined to explore further or get involved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You agree with Steve and I that it shouldn't stay blank for long.  Ed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will agree too, I'm sure.  Together we'll ensure it gets some proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content.  So I take your vote as 'Yes', for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> MIke, two questions on this:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) what's your definition of &quot;not for long&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> (2) how would you like to &quot;ensure proper content&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
