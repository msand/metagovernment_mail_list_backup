<PRE>Haha,

Here is another one that might sit you better.

Let pretend you are charting a course through dangerous water. You gathered
your plans and decided on a course, but before you leave someone comes up
and says, &quot;hey, I have navigated those waters before. It actually looks to
me like you ship sits deeper than you thought it would. Here, and here
(points to the map) you might want to revisit.&quot; The response, &quot;Actually, we
have already decided, so we will go with that.&quot; As if somehow the act of
deciding made the path through more safe.

The dangers of the path is independent of decision. But, if you would like
to continue on that course, I'll support you. Just know it has real risks
that exist outside of wether or not we decide that they are there.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but don't say I didn't warn you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lets imagine you are drilling for oil. You work on a plan as a company
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and decide to move forward. Right before you start mining someone visits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and says, &quot;Hey you know, I have actually drilled there before and that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> angle you chose will actually cause a bunch of damage to your equipment and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cause unforeseen losses. You might want to revisit.&quot; The group responds,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;well, since we already decided we have to honor that decision so we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to drill anyway&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Really? I would ask anyone who has experience in this field to challenge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me on this. I just didn't want to sit back and say nothing.  And really,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want to sit behind a group decision that went on for a week in light of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new information that should effect your decision? I would hope the group is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smarter than that. Again, if anyone has experience in this field I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gladly hear from him.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And again, if you want to stick with it by all means do. If the group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want's to I will support that decision. I just hope we won't hide behind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;We have already decided, because we have already decided, and that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the reason why we will do it&quot; when there is new information to consider.
