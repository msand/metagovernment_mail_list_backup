<PRE>Metagovernment exists for many years now and even though it does, a
relatively radical decision like the one to blank the main page of
metagovernment.org was decided acording to the rules we have set in the
past.
This is something i do like a lot, because i have experienced that given
such circumstances, rules are being ignored and instead people use their
power to sabotage something that they strongly oppose.

I have copied the last valid version of the front page to this etherpad:
*<A HREF="https://titanpad.com/Metagovernment-org">https://titanpad.com/Metagovernment-org</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://titanpad.com/Metagovernment-org">https://titanpad.com/Metagovernment-org</A>&gt;*

It enables everyone to co-create new proposals and vote for those.
The problem is, that the content of that &quot;external pad&quot; will not go into
the archive of this mailing list, thus we might technically have a problem.


*PROPOSAL:* (and because the proposal of Ed of making every proposal start
with the word &quot;Proposal&quot; written as a subject is currently not a valid rule
yet)
I propose that metagovernment.org hosts it's own etherpad, like the hosting
provider of titanpad.com or the pirate party and many other organisations
already do.
It's a very flexible and open tool, which could be easily used for a
collaborative brainstorming process, given the discipline within this
community.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; One week to make a big decision like this seems like a unusually small

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; include and get all the facts. Not run as fast as you can while you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ball hiding behind the &quot;system&quot; saying it has already decided. If you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; on the other side of the line how would you want to be treated? It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> smells a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; little authoritarian to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Umm, I think you have this backwards: It's authoritarian to assume
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that there *is* a leader.  I've always been told that this is an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;ad-hocracy&quot; in which case whoever shows up is the right group to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions like this.  And a week seems short to me too, which is why I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposed two weeks as a deadline.  But we're not going to make that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either unless more of you step up to voice your opinion on what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statements the home page should contain...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Ed has worked on this list for years where you have only been a month
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or so?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I consider it a professional courtesy not a statement of ownership.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've no problem with professional courtesy and definitely empathize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with his situation (I've got an ailing mother myself and am currently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> embroiled in the nursing home vs home-care debate and decision and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> know that it is a very difficult, timeconsuming, and emotionally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> draining process).  But I'll repeat my statement from my first post:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This group and this project is occupying very valuable mind-share and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we have an *obligation* to make good use of it and if sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that means forging ahead without our full complement that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfortunately what we must do.  Now that this process has started and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the home page is already down, let's go ahead and finish it with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implied consensus that when Ed (or whoever) wants to revisit it we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will do that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, back to the big question, what is *your* current vision of what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this project is about?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
