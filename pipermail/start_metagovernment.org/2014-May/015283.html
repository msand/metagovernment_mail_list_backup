<PRE>Hi Ed,

Yes, we discussed the proposal and its alternatives for over a week.
We made adjustments to address people's concerns.  A solid consensus
held throughout the week.  The proposal has therefore carried and is
now a group decision.

Everything's in order here.  Please don't let this decision distract
you from caring for your folks.  I'm hoping (we're all hoping) they
make a speedy recovery.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> tactic to force action, instead of trying to build consensus, which
</I>&gt;<i> has worked for this group every time before. The message can be a
</I>&gt;<i> header, but blanking makes it ridiculous for anyone who may visit
</I>&gt;<i> the site. Sorry I can't participate more. If you're going to leave
</I>&gt;<i> it like that, can you at least propose something to replace it now?
