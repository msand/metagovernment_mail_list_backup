Seems simple enough to me, my problem is the opposite: Many of the
things I want to do simply aren't supported.

&gt;<i> There seems to be the question and a motivation.
</I>
Sort of: there's a &quot;discussion&quot; with a title and description.

&gt;<i> There then seems to be a specific title and a fuller body and that is a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can vote on the proposal.
</I>
That part is easy, although I'm not keen on that &quot;veto&quot; power that
everyone has..

&gt;<i> I can make a statement about the proposal.
</I>
Actually you can just make general statements and there isn't any way
to determine what specific proposal it refers to.  And Bently keeps
changing the damn proposals!

&gt;<i> Okay.  I would want to make a different proposal.  I Do Not Know how.  Also
</I>&gt;<i> since i agree with the first title but not the details of the proposal, what
</I>&gt;<i> should my title be?
</I>
Seems like only Bentley can do that (he being the one who set up that
discussion).  You can create a new discussion and create proposals for
that, but can't edit or replace proposals in other people's
discussions.  Weird, I think.

Only 6 people joined.  I can't promise it to be super-fun, but you
really do need to at least play with the system for a few minutes to
have an informed opinion about how these things should work (or not
work, as the case may be).
  Regards,
    Scott
