<PRE>The Loomio people met 2.5 to 3 years ago during #Occupy. Since then they&#8217;ve created and crowdfunded (+$125,735+) an awesome platform that&#8217;s really taking off in various groups and organizations around the world.  Meaning people are actually using it.  However *pedestrian* it may be&#8230;.it&#8217;s actually working. 

Our group is still shuffling words on our home page.  :-)

But, wait a minute, that&#8217;s right&#8230;..there is no *our group* anymore.  We&#8217;ve finally figured out that we&#8217;re all in this together, on the same boat&#8230;......and it&#8217;s sinking.  

Just saying&#8230;.

</I>&gt;<i> Outcome
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your input everyone, this update will be out soon :)
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> The language for the new group settings page makes sense to me
</I>&gt;<i> Latest version here: <A HREF="https://i.imgur.com/14ubHjm.png">https://i.imgur.com/14ubHjm.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Positions
</I>&gt;<i> Robert Guthrie	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Alanna Krause	agreed	much better!
</I>&gt;<i> Richard D. Bartlett	agreed	Also like Alanna's suggested changes
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Taklis	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> A. Renato	agreed	better!
</I>&gt;<i> Matthew Bartlett	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Vivien Maidaborn	agreed	from the pov of teaching this it is great language easy to understand
</I>&gt;<i> Josef Davies-Coates	agreed	well, yes, they do make sense
</I>&gt;<i> Iulian Dumitra&#351;cu	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Knight	agreed	huge improvement!
</I>&gt;<i> Jon Lemmon	abstained	Ambiguity: If the group is &quot;members only&quot; can someone with a link to it see it? If not, you may want to change the wording to &quot;Who can see this group?&quot; instead of &quot;Who can find this group?&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> mix irving	abstained	quite good. The middle two are a little unclear perhaps. What is the diff between joining and adding ? I think 'Adding members' means approving requests to join and sending active invites/ adding people manually? see comments for more
</I>&gt;<i> Philippe Ponge	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Closed 2 hours ago
</I>&gt;<i> Proposed by Richard D. Bartlett 3 days ago
</I>&gt;<i> 10% of members stated their position (13/122)
