<PRE>Discussion is a very good think to do but I will love to see the group
choose the top tool to be developed by a major survey and then support it
with code development and active action.
I will start a proposal in the metagovernment  group i recently formed into
the Airesis platform to be developed into maturity, Some one ask me what is
the maturity value.
Basically during the proposal making there is contribution to it by the
participants and  as the proposal change and grow. participants are giving
their assessment to the readiness of the proposal, when the degree of
readiness reach a quorum defined ahead and or a specific time defined to
discuss the proposal the proposal reach the readiness. At this point there
is a reflection period and then there is the actual vote. During the
discussion every one will be given a temporary anonymity so that non one
knows who is who After the vote, if is choose as  secret the name are not
release if is palese the vote will have a name. I wish the group to reach
at least ten participants to make this decision and I invited Ed to take
part to this test.
Regards
Jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> To clarify: As you said there is no active project. There is an active
</I>&gt;<i> group of people with a common mission of discussing tools and idea around
</I>&gt;<i> tools for government. I believe we are generally doing what the first two
</I>&gt;<i> sentences of the Metagovernment website says:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The Metagovernment project supports internet tools to enable
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance. We are a global community of people working on
</I>&gt;<i> numerous projects which further this goal.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the &quot;support&quot; at this time is just a place to discuss and debate
</I>&gt;<i> what the tools need to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe a better summary would be &quot; Metagovernment is a discussion group
</I>&gt;<i> about tools that enable collaborative governance.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm saying there's no active group here, just a mailing list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it is important to find some basic consensus of at least some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; persons. I'm not sure whether I've got your point, but I don't see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; many groups of people discussing the same topic we do - because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; nearly everybody wants &quot;the tool&quot; to look different.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think Metagov is developing a tool.  Tools are being developed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (hundreds of tools) by hundreds of different groups, but Metagov isn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even an individual (a group of one) can develop a tool.  If Ed were to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> develop a tool, for example, then he might call it the &quot;Metagov tool&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But Ed isn't doing that.  Ed is running a mailing list (and a wiki).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's an odd mailing list where the subscribers (even myself sometimes)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they're on a common mission.  But actually they're not.
