<PRE>Allow me to clarify. I am not suggesting a proposal should ever just be 140
characters. Steve has it correct.


The 'tweet' is just the synopsis of the proposal, like the subject line to
this e-mail. Just so there can be many proposals in one place, making it
easier to find one you might be interesting in.


Clicking on the 'tweet' opens up the proposal which is separated into
different points by the proposer, depending on how many aspect of the idea
there is. This gives a more detailed outline of the actual project,
displayed in point form and again condensed to 140 characters for
simplicity of reading and understanding the overall idea.


Each point of the proposal can also be opened again to reveal more details
on that specific point. Referenced sources, cost analysis... whatever
details are important for that point. I imagined here too we view it in
point form for simplicity.


Making a proposal should be a lot of work for the proposer. Some proposals
will be quite long but this method structures the proposal into a familiar
format for everyone to easily view and digest the material.


Other users should be able to respond to any point individually or address
the entire proposal as a whole depending on which area they reply in.


&gt;&gt;<i> - Once a proposal is ready to go the voting stage it should be cleaned
</I>up to
&gt;&gt;<i> include any alterations that have been agreed upon in the discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. It should be presented in a clear and concise manner with all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information being available should the voter wish to know more.
</I>

&gt;<i>I'd disagree here because the refinement (and writing up the actual
</I>&gt;<i>legal wording) should be *complete* at the proposal stage to avoid the
</I>&gt;<i>possibility that some proposer will slip in objectionable material
</I>&gt;<i>(intentionally or not) during this rewrite.
</I>

Yes true, this point will have to be revisited.


&gt;<i> I'm still on the fence about these &quot;points&quot; (i.e., a reputation
</I>&gt;<i> system).  My current thinking is that the average rating given to a
</I>&gt;<i> poster's comments (and the percentage of them being flagged) needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be easily accessible (perhaps even included in the header of their
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent posts), but I'm uncomfortable with the idea that some
</I>&gt;<i> people's posts will be prioritized merely because they were
</I>&gt;<i> instrumental in getting bills passed in the past.  This sounds to me
</I>&gt;<i> like a recipe for recreating the political machines (parties) that
</I>&gt;<i> plague our current systems.
</I>

Again you got me wrong, I'm not suggesting a reputation system. Each post
should be scored independently, unrelated to a users past successes.


Perhaps a user could have a viewable rank of how well they generally score
but the score should not be a determining factor in their positioning for
each of their comments.


How to rank the comments is another aspect I've given thought to but didn't
dive into here because as you said, I didn't want to take on too much.


Hope this clears things up.

&gt;<i> What I hear you suggesting Reid is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep the title and synopsis of the proposal to 140 characters, or so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, each *line item* of the proposal should be limited as well (for
</I>&gt;<i> discussion and voting purposes)&#8230;.but the overall body of the proposal can
</I>&gt;<i> be any length?

</I>&gt;<i> - Click on a proposal synopsis and you're taken to the expanded proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> where a more detailed account is presented in point form. Again, each point
</I>&gt;<i> is a synopsis of 140 characters or something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I don't see the benefit of limiting the length of the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> or the comments.  Certainly being concise should be rewarded and we
</I>&gt;<i> may even want a &quot;TL;DR&quot; flag, but sometimes (a lot of time, actually)
</I>&gt;<i> really understanding an issue takes a page or more of text (i.e.,
