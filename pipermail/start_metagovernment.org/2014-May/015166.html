<PRE>Hi Max,
Thanks for responding. I&#8217;m not sure what source code license is&#8230;or why that is important in this regard.
Could you elaborate?

</I>&gt;<i> Below is a list of some proposed changes to Loomio&#8230;.(from their website).

</I>&gt;<i> I like what they're doing and am wondering if there is some (sensible) reason why we're not currently using Loomio for some of the discussions taking place on this list right now?
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like it could be helpful to organize our conversations and any proposals that might get off the ground.

</I>&gt;<i>  What are your top requested features and changes to Loomio?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This was initially about a list specifically for a programme we were applying for, but has evolved into a general requests discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Suggestions from the discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Simple server installation for new Loomio instances
</I>&gt;<i> Export facility for Loomio groups
</I>&gt;<i> Import facility for Loomio groups
</I>&gt;<i> list of Admins/ Co-ordinators
</I>&gt;<i> Ability to add people to sub groups before they accept their invite
</I>&gt;<i> Forking proposals
</I>&gt;<i> quick polls, temperature checks
</I>&gt;<i> mobile app
</I>&gt;<i> api &amp; oauth integration
</I>&gt;<i> grouping and sorting passed proposals to build up a documentation of a groups &#8216;policy and governance&#8217; rules. Sort of like living legislation for a group as opposed to proposals which are about decisions that aren&#8217;t relevant once passed.
</I>&gt;<i> Mobile Apps
</I>&gt;<i> Engagement stats and metrics so you can see who is participating at what levels over time,
</I>&gt;<i> visualizations of decisions made, membership numbers, etc, on a timeline
</I>&gt;<i> Search comments, proposals, by date, by author, etc.

</I>&gt;<i> Outcome
</I>&gt;<i> Strong support for this feature, but some are unsure how well it could be integrated.
</I>&gt;<i> Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> Option to follow Public Groups
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;Ask to Join&quot; feature of Public Groups is useful as it increases transparency of an otherwise Private Group or membership control of an otherwise Open Public Group. However, it seems nonsensical that in order to follow discussions you can already view, you need to 'Ask to Join'. Therefore I propose a 'Follow' option for Public Groups.
</I>&gt;<i> Positions
</I>&gt;<i> Steven Palmer	agreed	Appears common sense.
</I>&gt;<i> Alanna Krause	agreed	I think this is a good idea! It should be included in the more general update to how tracking discussions you're following works, that Jon is working on.
</I>&gt;<i> Strypey	agreed	It would be great to have a simple way to 'follow' public groups or discussions without creating work for the coordinators processing 'join' requests from people who only want to follow.
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Richter	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Rachel B. Wickert	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Taklis	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> mix irving	abstained	I think you have highlighted an important pain point. I think this is very similar to a concept of 'following' discussions &amp; groups generally. I would prefer to see that system as a whole designed/ developed rather than a small part of the solution
</I>&gt;<i> Jon Lemmon	abstained	I like the spirit of this, but I do have some concerns about how to keep things simple and not give too many options (as Sam highlighted). I'll give this some more thought.
</I>&gt;<i> rory tb	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Fernando Nunes	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Benjamin Knight	agreed	Makes lots of sense to me
</I>&gt;<i> Zack	agreed	i agree but if it's complicated to implement or you want people to be more participative, a solution would be to become follower when you ask to join a Public group. if your request is approved you will be able to contribute as well
</I>&gt;<i> Hannah Salmon	agreed	I think the concept of following makes sense as a next step. I'm interested to see how it could work with the decision-centric focus.
</I>&gt;<i> Iulian Dumitra&#351;cu	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Umutcan Onal	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Neil Morris	agreed	
</I>&gt;<i> Sam Boyer	abstained	i haven't seen a good explanation of how this will fit coherently into the overall model yet, so i'm gonna sit back.
</I>&gt;<i> Closed 8 minutes ago
</I>&gt;<i> Proposed by Steven Palmer 1 month ago
