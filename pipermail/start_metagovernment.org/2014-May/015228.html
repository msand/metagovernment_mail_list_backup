<PRE>Hi Paul,

I'm saying there's no active group here, just a mailing list.

&gt;<i> Yes, it is important to find some basic consensus of at least some
</I>&gt;<i> persons. I'm not sure whether I've got your point, but I don't see
</I>&gt;<i> many groups of people discussing the same topic we do - because
</I>&gt;<i> nearly everybody wants &quot;the tool&quot; to look different.
</I>
I don't think Metagov is developing a tool.  Tools are being developed
(hundreds of tools) by hundreds of different groups, but Metagov isn't
one of them.

Even an individual (a group of one) can develop a tool.  If Ed were to
develop a tool, for example, then he might call it the &quot;Metagov tool&quot;.
But Ed isn't doing that.  Ed is running a mailing list (and a wiki).
It's an odd mailing list where the subscribers (even myself sometimes)
think they're on a common mission.  But actually they're not.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> But how can we work onto partial consensus? I think, this will only work if we break down our main problem into smaller pieces which can be solved nearly independently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And: Do you think that a strategical consensus would be enough for now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Paul
</I>
And:
&gt;<i> Michael: What is the problem combining this list with the wiki? I think, I still didn't get what you wanted to express.
