<PRE>Dear James Thank you!, you put in this metaphoric tale what I say in two
word,
I say that was &quot;not vital&quot; to blank the page but we could live with it
until a new one was developed.
The blanking as the metaphor of the drilling sound to me so much &quot;italian&quot;
in the way it was  operated!
Cheers
Jacopo
