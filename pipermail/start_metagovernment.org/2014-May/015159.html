<PRE>In passing, there are some Imo good reasons to use python but language
selection depends on your requirements.  Still. There are several CMSs
based on django.  Try mezzanine (sp) and django cms.  Also my old favorite
is Plone which is based on Zope.

I will look at the some of the cites that you rejected.

Are any of you interested in simply an open source standard voting system?
People think it could save a half billion a year in the US.  Just curious.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I cannot believe that a 30% of the population can control the world...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, that would be evidence in favor of the second hypothesis ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it's actually easier than that: Remember that that 30% (or
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully less) are more fearful and more motivated and yet less
</I>&gt;<i> ethical than the rest and as a result are capable of (and actually
</I>&gt;<i> quite effective at) manipulating the rest of us, many of whom have
</I>&gt;<i> their own &quot;issues&quot; that allow this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe in software like Airesis where I am actively working and in
</I>&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like open annotation... <A HREF="http://vimeo.com/29633009">http://vimeo.com/29633009</A> or

</I>&gt;<i> try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; f.... with me I will spot them because i will have tools to spot them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now who's pessimistic?  My proposal is not about &quot;spotting&quot; them, it's
</I>&gt;<i> about sorting/filtering the input so you seldom run into the
</I>&gt;<i> problematic or just useless stuff, regardless of its source.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes Social Dominators and Authoritarians *do* have useful things
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute.  It's probably relatively uncommon, particularly for
</I>&gt;<i> those who have decided to take the full-on troll tactic, but it still
</I>&gt;<i> happens often enough that our best tool is sorting/filtering based on
</I>&gt;<i> the content itself rather than on the producer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Annotation looks like a bunch of smart people with good ideas,
</I>&gt;<i> but a slick video does not a revolution make.  If they get some
</I>&gt;<i> traction then that system can certainly be integrated with ours.  But
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO they have misidentified the real problem and have given up on
</I>&gt;<i> public voting in favor of privacy and anonymity (which is what
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians want and in fact *need* to maintain their control), so
</I>&gt;<i> they're working with one hand tied behind their backs and my
</I>&gt;<i> predictions is that they're therefore unlikely to amount to much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nevertheless here is some aspect that goes beyond being authoritarian or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; liberal or what ever we may be labeled.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I read some article about this new research into human psychology
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw</A>  Probably we need to enforce
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of genetic DNA test to find the extreme-ist character and enforce a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; karma handicap in online voting!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, but that would be an authoritarian tactic and so unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> is not available to us.  Fortunately there's a whole world of this
</I>&gt;<i> sort of psychological information available to us to use in designing
</I>&gt;<i> a system that works without explicitly discriminating against
</I>&gt;<i> anyone...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: Finished with Django and have ruled that out, and am now knee-deep
</I>&gt;<i> in revIgniter which is a LiveCode clone of codeIgniter, a PHP
</I>&gt;<i> framework.  The more of these things I look at, the more they all
</I>&gt;<i> start to look the same.  They're all basically doing the same things
</I>&gt;<i> the same way and yet are all much harder to learn and harder to use
</I>&gt;<i> than they need to be.  Part of this is that they're also a lot more
</I>&gt;<i> general purpose than what I need so the path forward is starting to
</I>&gt;<i> reveal itself to me: It seems it doesn't really matter which framework
</I>&gt;<i> I use since I'm probably only going to use a fraction of what it
</I>&gt;<i> offers and now that I've got the lay of the land I can pick and port
</I>&gt;<i> whichever bits I need from those other frameworks if they're not
</I>&gt;<i> already available in the one I end up using.  Taking this &quot;machete
</I>&gt;<i> mode&quot; route is going to make *me* a lot more productive at the cost of
</I>&gt;<i> maybe making it a bit harder for experts on my base framework to pitch
</I>&gt;<i> in and help.  But I don't see them lining up anytime soon and given
</I>&gt;<i> the cross-framework competition I'm seeing creating a &quot;catholic&quot; route
</I>&gt;<i> like this might actually make it easier for zealots for other
</I>&gt;<i> frameworks to pitch in because they won't have to cross enemy lines...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind Regards
