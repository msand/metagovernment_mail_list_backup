<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; I think every user getting a number is our best alternative. A number which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only they should know. That way everyone's free to say whatever they want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Voting is recorded and displayed publicly to see and check. Individuals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; listed number and which way they voted are public, all activity is recorded
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and reviewable. Just their true identity needs to be kept safe. Users true
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identities will have to be recorded eventually but no one should ever need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to access it. It should just be automatic. Difficult to pull off maybe...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I don't think impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think impossible, and this is covered in my book:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What happens when Snowden or Manning goes to work for The System
</I>&gt;<i> and releases all the name/number data?  Shut the whole government
</I>&gt;<i> down?  Destroy all the old vote and proposal records?
</I>
I don't think so: As far as I can see, there are cryptographic possibilities such as public-key cryptography to ensure an unique pseudonym but on the other hand to hide the relationships for everyone not owning a supercomputer.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Even with a number people will be very hesitant to provide
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient details in their posts that would allow others to identify
</I>&gt;<i> them if they believe this is necessary to preserve their anonymity.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes this information is absolutely necessary to assess someone's
</I>&gt;<i> argument.  For example, if a proposal is for a road to be widened, it
</I>&gt;<i> makes a hell of a lot of difference whether a poster lives on that
</I>&gt;<i> road or instead is one of the people who commutes using that road.
</I>
That's really a very important point. Looking on a bigger time span, in fact almost every pseudonym will be assignable to the underlaying real identity. This already happens by the fact that someone may want to promote one's contribution in offline life to other people.

I propose to use different approaches for different parts of the system here. In pure discussion or proposing something, people reveal information that could easily be connected to identify someone so that we have to use a more anonymous approach here if we don't want the connection to the real identity. Of course, there are social effects and I think, they will only be solvable in practice.
When it's about decision-making, voting, ranking etc., the problem is more simple. There aren't so many social effects (well, chilling effects). There are reasons why current elections are non-public elections but there are also reasons for transparency in politics.
If there is one, I would prefer an innovative third way.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Use of screen names is an important part of my proposal because
</I>&gt;<i> although it doesn't guaranty anonymity it at least removes the
</I>&gt;<i> tendency to make disagreements personal.  But it's human nature to try
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;out&quot; people who are disagreeing with you.  This tendency needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be curbed using social engineering (i.e., a way to flag someone who
</I>&gt;<i> does this), but again, we can't make the system vulnerable to collapse
</I>&gt;<i> when people break taboo and do it anyway.  Assigning a new number
</I>&gt;<i> every time this happens is just not a reasonable option.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Has this issue been debated on this list before?  Anyone got any
</I>&gt;<i> literature to cite on the matter?  My &quot;bible&quot; (Public Choice III) only
</I>&gt;<i> mentions the issue of secret ballots a handful of times, and only one
</I>&gt;<i> I can find where it is the variable: That one says voter participation
</I>&gt;<i> *decreased* by 7% in 1890s when secret ballots were introduced, the
</I>&gt;<i> theory being that this was due to widespread vote buying at that time
</I>&gt;<i> and when you can't verify a vote you can't pay someone to vote for
</I>&gt;<i> you.  But in a direct democracy the corruption that goes along with
</I>&gt;<i> vote buying is not only much easier to spot, but much less likely to
</I>&gt;<i> even be a problem in general (i.e., paying *everyone* to vote a
</I>&gt;<i> certain way isn't corruption, it's compensation, and so only a problem
</I>&gt;<i> if the amount is significantly lower than any negative economic
</I>&gt;<i> effects of the vote).
</I>
You won't be able to spot it if the threated group of voters is a minority and the majority is intolerant, which in fact still happens sometimes today. This &quot;coercion&quot; is not uneconomic, I think it is a possible social phenomenon.

Regards,
Paul Reichert
