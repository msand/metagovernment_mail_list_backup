Nope, this deals with hackers (or the government) snooping on the
communication lines, but not those who hack into the main database or
employees of the organization running the servers.  There *must* be a
screen-name to individual mapping kept someplace to ensure that people
don't just create bogus accounts to commit voter fraud.

&gt;<i> That's really a very important point. Looking on a bigger time span, in fact almost every pseudonym will be assignable to the underlaying real identity. This already happens by the fact that someone may want to promote one's contribution in offline life to other people.

Right, and as I've been saying all along, there is no real need for
this sort of privacy/anonymity, and most people (especially young
people) are simply not as concerned about it as some people raised in
an environment where totalitarianism was common (like us old farts).
Sure, this registry would be a favorite tool of the likes of
Stalin/Hitler/Mao, but the point is that our primary goal has to be to
ensure that no one like that ever comes to power again. If we achieve
that, being able to tell who voted how is no more a threat to people's
freedom than asking them to sign petitions, speak at a city council
meeting, or meet with their neighbors to organize a block party.
