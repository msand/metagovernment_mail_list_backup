I know this is a really tempting position to take, but I'm becoming
increasingly convinced that not only is it not necessary, but is
actually incompatible with human nature and our goal of good
government.  The great irony here is that it is primarily
authoritarians who are constantly harping on this issue, yet it is the
characteristics of those very people that are the reason why we can't
provide them what they want:

1) Being both fearful *and* unusually susceptible to social pressure
are key personality characteristics of authoritarians (although not
social dominators, who in general I believe will be on board with
public voting).  By giving up on public voting, we basically give
these authoritarians a free pass on voting based on their fears and
their tendency to take on antisocial positions (prejudice and
warmongering being two of their favorites).

2) Authoritarians are actually *also* the primary concern as the
*instigators* of pressure on others to vote a particular way.  When
you talk about a boss or a husband coercing someone's vote, the very
nature of the situation calls it out as an authoritarian dynamic.
Neurotypicals not only are far less likely to apply this kind of
pressure (their tolerance for diversity being much higher), but are
also far less likely to be responsive to it.  If a wife (and it's
always a wife) feels pressure from her husband to vote the way he
says, that's not a problem with the system, it's a problem with her
marriage, and not one we as a people need to try to solve by
bolstering the power of her husband (and to add to the irony, note
that this very question is actually *on* Altemeyer's RWA test!)

The only exception I can think of is on certain redistribution issues
where there is an inherent conflict between the preferences of a
corporation and that of their employees (e.g., an employee of a
defense contractor voting to reduce the defense budget or cancel a
weapon system, or maybe voting against a measure that would encourage
other employers to relocate into the area which would increase
competition on their employer).  But I note that this problem already
exists and people's participation in the process is already
constrained (e.g., no generating petitions or even signing them if
they'd be detrimental to one's employer!).  By opening the system up
we're bringing social engineering tools to bear on the issue, which
means we can reduce the bystander effect (look it up!) and so not only
not cause a new problem but help solve another old one.

In summary &quot;losing voices to fear&quot; I think is a useful
characterization, I'm just saying this is a feature of the new system,
not a bug: As a species we need to evolve our customs beyond the point
where our behavior is dominated by our fearful animal natures.  We
evolved to work in environments where public voting was the standard
practice and we need to take this fact into consideration when
designing our new system.

&gt;<i> I think every user getting a number is our best alternative. A number which
</I>&gt;<i> only they should know. That way everyone's free to say whatever they want.
</I>&gt;<i> Voting is recorded and displayed publicly to see and check. Individuals
</I>&gt;<i> listed number and which way they voted are public, all activity is recorded
</I>&gt;<i> and reviewable. Just their true identity needs to be kept safe. Users true
</I>&gt;<i> identities will have to be recorded eventually but no one should ever need
</I>&gt;<i> to access it. It should just be automatic. Difficult to pull off maybe...
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't think impossible.
</I>
I think impossible, and this is covered in my book:

1) What happens when Snowden or Manning goes to work for The System
and releases all the name/number data?  Shut the whole government
down?  Destroy all the old vote and proposal records?

2) Even with a number people will be very hesitant to provide
sufficient details in their posts that would allow others to identify
them if they believe this is necessary to preserve their anonymity.
Sometimes this information is absolutely necessary to assess someone's
argument.  For example, if a proposal is for a road to be widened, it
makes a hell of a lot of difference whether a poster lives on that
road or instead is one of the people who commutes using that road.

3) Use of screen names is an important part of my proposal because
although it doesn't guaranty anonymity it at least removes the
tendency to make disagreements personal.  But it's human nature to try
to &quot;out&quot; people who are disagreeing with you.  This tendency needs to
be curbed using social engineering (i.e., a way to flag someone who
does this), but again, we can't make the system vulnerable to collapse
when people break taboo and do it anyway.  Assigning a new number
every time this happens is just not a reasonable option.

Has this issue been debated on this list before?  Anyone got any
literature to cite on the matter?  My &quot;bible&quot; (Public Choice III) only
mentions the issue of secret ballots a handful of times, and only one
I can find where it is the variable: That one says voter participation
*decreased* by 7% in 1890s when secret ballots were introduced, the
theory being that this was due to widespread vote buying at that time
and when you can't verify a vote you can't pay someone to vote for
you.  But in a direct democracy the corruption that goes along with
vote buying is not only much easier to spot, but much less likely to
even be a problem in general (i.e., paying *everyone* to vote a
certain way isn't corruption, it's compensation, and so only a problem
if the amount is significantly lower than any negative economic
effects of the vote).
  Regards,
    Scott
