<PRE>Hi Michael,
What is the time window on this vote?  Seems like it could go on for some time without a distinct closing date for objections. 
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> No, I think the former decision wasn't valid.  Our common desire to

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking for myself, I vote to blank the page till we agree what to
</I>&gt;<i> put there.  The current content is false and misleading, and a blank
</I>&gt;<i> page is always better than a false page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's just my own opinion.  Please speak your mind, Marc.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> registered your vote, yet.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You agree with Steve and I that it shouldn't stay blank for long.  Ed
</I>&gt;<i> will agree too, I'm sure.  Together we'll ensure it gets some proper
</I>&gt;<i> content.  So I take your vote as 'Yes', for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're right, the message is a little too off-putting, especially the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Owing to a dispute&quot; part.  Maybe we can just drop that?  And maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> should link to the whole archive, not to any particular thread; there
</I>&gt;<i> may be multiple threads.  These changes are relatively minor, so I
</I>&gt;<i> make them below.  Please speak if you disagree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In summary, here's where we currently stand:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   PROPOSAL 1
</I>&gt;<i>   ----------
</I>&gt;<i>   Blank the home page and insert the following:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>      The content of the home page is currently under discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>      &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
</I>&gt;<i>   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;<i>   -------------
</I>&gt;<i>       For: Mike, Reid, Scott, Steve
</I>&gt;<i>   Against: (nobody)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok Michael (and others), I agree to this proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> marc said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why not adopting to common behaviour here? Would you ever find a &quot;BLANK&quot; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> page on wikipedia linking to the discussion thread? Come on - we should keep 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the current content, because this is based on a former decision until we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a newer decision, isn't it??
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reid Millerd said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't mind blanking the home page just so long as we come up with things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to put on it relatively quickly. The homepage is the introduction to our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group, it should at least be an outline of the general ideas, we need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let people know what is going on here. If I was to come across a homepage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that just read &quot;Owing to a dispute, the content of the home page is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> currently under discussion.  &lt;link to discussion thread&gt;&quot; I doubt I would
