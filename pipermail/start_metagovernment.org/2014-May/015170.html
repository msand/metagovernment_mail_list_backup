<PRE>Scott, to answer both of your scenarios below (climate change and defense spending) my answer is that government shouldn't be operating on the scale that it is.

New-style governments (the ones I'm hoping to see us foster) won't be deciding on defense spending, because that is a issue of a national government. What point is there in having national governments? They are just political artifacts that have little to do with natural geography or ethnicity as much as they have to do with kingdoms and their legacies. A government so vast that it decides the fate of hundreds of millions of people is ludicrous. Maybe someday collaborative governance could operate on that scale for the occasional question, but for the most part governance shouldn't be for areas larger than an ecoregion or city... and usually for much smaller, or more importantly less-geographically-specific communities.

Collaborative governance is a disruptive process, not a direct replacement for the current systems. It is a system for use in communities of any kind: geographic, common-interest, or common-mission. Those typically are not the scale of large nations; nor do they need to make decisions rashly.

Issues like climate change are more nuanced. All of the above applies there too (no gigantic governments making massive decisions), and so that opens up a lot more flexibility and nimbleness. Smaller groups can come up with innovative plans that make progress against climate change without having to get everyone's buy-in. Compare that to what we have now. We have very high scientific consensus about climate change, and national governments are doing next to nothing about it.

As for what percentage of the voting population equals consensus; that's answered in my other post. If voting is iterative, then you know you have consensus when most voters agree... and also that that agreement holds for a while. If a proposal is about to go into effect, more people will hear about it and can easily prevent it if they disagree. So there's no hard number. It's a process.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.

</I>&gt;<i> 1/3 is primarily made up of people who have provably irrational
</I>&gt;<i> thought processes on the subject?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, please address the relationship between &quot;consensus&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of the total population who vote.  Is it consensus when 1/3
