<PRE>Hi,
speaking strictly for Vilfredo, but with a general view to the other tools.
Each tool is different and it is different the kind of questions and the
contexts in which it works well (or at all).

Vilfredo works under those conditions:
-5-25 people
-a situation where people are all willing to read each proposal (in a
future version we will try to change this but for now it is a necessity)
-a question where we are looking for a single answer.

The last point requires a bit of explenation: if we are saying what shall
we do for the US economy (or the Italian Economy), well there are plenty of
things that need to be done. And Vilfredo is not the right tool because it
permit a proposal to dominate another one, even if they have nothing to do
with each other.

Instead if you ask: how shall we build this car, where shall we go to eat
this evening, what shall we write to the MG homepage, then Vilfredo works
really well, because you are looking for a single answer. And if there are
multiple answers, you need to try to integrate them, or you will ignore one
instead of the other.

So saying that we shall use Vilfredo for each MG decision for 6 months does
not make sense. Vilfredo should be used only for certain metagovernment
decisions.

For example we could use it now to decide the homepage.

In this way, one week to propose what should be written,
one week to vote.
If we reach consensus we write what is in the consensus.
If we do not reach consensus, we give the alternative versions, of all the
proposals in the Pareto Front.
In the meantime, in the background we keep on running Vilfredo as a slow
buring, while trying to find a consensus.

Similarly Loomia works better for simpler decisions with many more people.
I think Loomia and Vilfredo could integrate very well. In fact you should
start with Loomia and once someone asks to use Vilfredo, provided there are
not more than 25 people, a Vilfredo question starts instead.

And so on.

Cheers,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Please respond individually to each line item below. Following one week of
</I>&gt;<i> discussion, I will edit each item (per your feedback) and post them as
</I>&gt;<i> proposals on Loomio for the group to make (or block the making of)  a
</I>&gt;<i> *binding* decision for each. Unless there's strong opposition (a block),
</I>&gt;<i> these decisions will be made by consensus as it is currently stated in
</I>&gt;<i> proposal number 4.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We allow everyone on this list a certain window of time to state
</I>&gt;<i> whether they are willing and able to participate in this groups discussions
</I>&gt;<i> and decision making (I'm thinking 2 weeks). If a lurker changes their mind,
</I>&gt;<i> or if someone joins the list at a later date, they can sign on and
</I>&gt;<i> participate from that point on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. We choose a platform (Airesis, Loomio, Vilfredo, Votorola, or &#8230; ) to
</I>&gt;<i> use for a given length of time. All [MG] decisions will be made on that
</I>&gt;<i> platform for that period of time (maybe 6 months). This window should allow
</I>&gt;<i> us time to adjust to the platform, test it, use it, and offer constructive
</I>&gt;<i> feedback to the  developer. Then we move on to another platform and do the
</I>&gt;<i> same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. For each proposal/decision, the quorum is comprised of those
</I>&gt;<i> participating. The time allotted for the discussion is relative to the
</I>&gt;<i> significance or gravity of the proposals effect on the group. The proposer
</I>&gt;<i> decides the respective window. Others can challenge it if it seems
</I>&gt;<i> unsuitable for the matter at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. In all decisions we strive for consensus. A decision becomes binding
</I>&gt;<i> if, in the window of time allotted for the proposal, there are no blocks to
</I>&gt;<i> its passing. If the proposal is blocked and someone in the group feels
</I>&gt;<i> that, with more time, a consensus could be reached, they can then restate
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal and choose a new window for it&#8217;s discussion and possible
</I>&gt;<i> passage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I realize there is a certain chicken and egg conundrum with respect to the
</I>&gt;<i> initial decision about how this group will make a decision, as well as what
</I>&gt;<i> constitutes a quorum to decide our necessary quorum, as well as the amount
</I>&gt;<i> of time necessary to make a decision about how long we allow for
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making, as well as the platform we use to decide on which platform
</I>&gt;<i> to use&#8230;...but we must start somewhere. Please indulge the list with your
</I>&gt;<i> constructive feedback.
