<PRE>
&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; The proposer (each proposer) should be free
</I>&gt;<i>     to choose the platform upon which to propose.
</I>
(From my response to Pietro:)  Perhaps we could choose one platform as a *default platform* (for a given period of time), with the caveat that each individual proposer can choose which venue they feel is best to host their respective proposal. Sans any unresolved objections, we switch to that platform, for that particular proposal.

&gt;<i>     Steve&gt; The proposer decides the respective window. Others can challenge
</I>&gt;<i>     it if it seems unsuitable for the matter at hand.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt;  (We will of course need to specify how
</I>&gt;<i>     the challenge is to be effected &#8230;)
</I>
What would you suggest?

&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Enabling blocking without enabling any effective means to
</I>&gt;<i>     resolve unreasonable blocks is doomed to produce a system fail,
</I>
Loomio seems to be working quite well for a number of groups and organizations.

&gt;<i>     The best means that we humans have available to us through which
</I>&gt;<i>     to resolve unreasonable blocks is rational discourse.
</I>
How does a group decide if a discourse is rational or not?

&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Loomio is an example of a
</I>&gt;<i>     decision system that enables blocking without enabling any
</I>&gt;<i>     effective means through which to resolve unreasonable blocks.
</I>
How does a group decide if a block is unreasonable?

&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; ...it would be a bad idea for us to enable blocking (except on
</I>&gt;<i>     Vilfredo), which means that we are stuck (for now) with having to
</I>&gt;<i>     cast and count votes to reach decisions, and with majority or
</I>&gt;<i>     super-majority rule. Bummer.
</I>
The moment a time window is created for any given decision a blocking function, in essence, has been established. Simple disagreement keeps the proposal from passing. Without a time window, the discussion becomes potentially endless.  Then you wind up with situations like the one here on [MG] where after how many years we are still trying to decide, how we are going to decide. Whereas groups like Loomio are beginning to change the world.
