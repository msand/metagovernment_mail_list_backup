<PRE>Hi Scott, (jumping in, though I haven't read the thread)

&gt;<i> ... Do you have an estimate as to how much more time commitment it
</I>&gt;<i> will require if repeated votes are held?  Or is your solution simply
</I>&gt;<i> to reduce the percentage of the population who will actually vote?
</I>
Knowing Ed, I think he'll answer (as time permits) that people who
wish to vote and can afford to vote (as time permits) will vote.
That's the way people usually do things, of course.

I haven't read the thread (sorry) but jumped in just to underline a
point that Ed seems to be making (which probably you agree with, too).

&gt;<i> &gt; Let the interested volunteers work up proposals, then as those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals near acceptance their visibility grows, more people jump
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in, and they [original volunteers] meet resistance. So the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals need to be tweaked.
</I>
Our only assurance that a consensus text is legitimate, or at least
evolving toward legitimacy, is its unconditional openness to critical
outsiders; i.e. their freedom to intervene through voting, drafting,
and other means of expression.  That freedom must apply to everyone
(the biggest possible number) though the number actually taking
advantage is relatively small.

Probably there's no disagreement on this.  Most likely people are just
emphasizing different aspects, so it appears there's disagreement.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this discussion came full-circle... and I think the conclusion is: mixing proposal tuning and voting creates consensus (i.e., the subject line of this message).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott, you're proposing small groups of volunteers working on proposals. So am I. But I don't think they are going to get it right, no matter how well-intentioned, well-informed, or well-educated they are. As the proposal gains larger visibility, it will get pushback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, and this *reduces* the likelihood of consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is why voting should be iterative and mixed with the proposal development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let the interested volunteers work up proposals, then as those proposals near acceptance their visibility grows, more people jump in, and they meet resistance. So the proposals need to be tweaked.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are we even disagreeing? It sounds to me like we're all arguing for proposal tuning as the involved population grows. It's just a matter of terminology at this point, no?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are disagreeing because you didn't address the issue of resource
</I>&gt;<i> utilization, specifically the time commitment for people who &quot;jump in&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> at some point prior to the &quot;final&quot; version of a proposal.  Every one
</I>&gt;<i> of those will have to review the proposal repeatedly as it is
</I>&gt;<i> modified.  Expecting more than a small percentage of the population to
</I>&gt;<i> do this is simply unreasonable IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've put out my ballpark estimate of how many proposals a person would
</I>&gt;<i> have to vote on to run a government (both local and global) and how
</I>&gt;<i> long it should take (2 or 3 a week, less than an hour, based on what
</I>&gt;<i> is required now at all levels in the US).  Do you have an estimate as
</I>&gt;<i> to how much more time commitment it will require if repeated votes are
</I>&gt;<i> held?  Or is your solution simply to reduce the percentage of the
</I>&gt;<i> population who will actually vote?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
