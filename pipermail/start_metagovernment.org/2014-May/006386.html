<PRE>1. Several people on this list have asked what they can do to help if they are not programmers and/or don&#8217;t have a lot of free time.

2. Several people on this list have bemoaned that it is difficult to follow long, complex conversations that produce many diverse ideas.

So if you are one of the people in #1, you can help out the people in #2! All you have to do is help transcribe little bits of conversations on this list into the wiki. I don&#8217;t mean copying verbatim, but rather summing up some noteworthy ideas or conclusions.

You don&#8217;t have to take sides. Following in the footsteps of Wikipedia, when there&#8217;s a disputed topic, you write about both sides of the topic and explain why each side feels that way. Here&#8217;s an example:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment</A>

Also, you do not have to do a god job! You can write anything, and others can help improve it later. Or you can be one of those who jumps in and improves things. You can start by improving the above article. :) Even fixing a typo is appreciated. Please help.

In five minutes you can make some sort of contribution to the wiki. Give it a try. There are no wrong moves in a wiki.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold</A>
And if you have any trouble, just let me or the list know, and you&#8217;ll get assistance.

Can you help?
