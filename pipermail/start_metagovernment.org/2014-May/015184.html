<PRE>I support maximum!! Privacy.  I support this over preventing minor vote
fraud.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think so: As far as I can see, there are cryptographic
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities such as public-key cryptography to ensure an unique pseudonym
</I>&gt;<i> but on the other hand to hide the relationships for everyone not owning a
</I>&gt;<i> supercomputer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, this deals with hackers (or the government) snooping on the
</I>&gt;<i> communication lines, but not those who hack into the main database or
</I>&gt;<i> employees of the organization running the servers.  There *must* be a
</I>&gt;<i> screen-name to individual mapping kept someplace to ensure that people
</I>&gt;<i> don't just create bogus accounts to commit voter fraud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's really a very important point. Looking on a bigger time span, in
</I>&gt;<i> fact almost every pseudonym will be assignable to the underlaying real
</I>&gt;<i> identity. This already happens by the fact that someone may want to promote
</I>&gt;<i> one's contribution in offline life to other people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and as I've been saying all along, there is no real need for
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of privacy/anonymity, and most people (especially young
</I>&gt;<i> people) are simply not as concerned about it as some people raised in
</I>&gt;<i> an environment where totalitarianism was common (like us old farts).
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, this registry would be a favorite tool of the likes of
</I>&gt;<i> Stalin/Hitler/Mao, but the point is that our primary goal has to be to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that no one like that ever comes to power again. If we achieve
</I>&gt;<i> that, being able to tell who voted how is no more a threat to people's
</I>&gt;<i> freedom than asking them to sign petitions, speak at a city council
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, or meet with their neighbors to organize a block party.
