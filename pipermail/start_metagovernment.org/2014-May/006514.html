<PRE>I just wanted to formally propose an edition to how we make decisions as a
list.

First, time limits. One week is not enough time to gather enough
information and make sure the list is moving together on an issue. We
should come up with a time span that must pass before a decision should be
made. But, with the caveat that if we have heard from everyone in the group
than it can move forward before that time comes.

Most of us while passionate and have valuable ideas also have to maintain a
real life outside of this list. It is unfair and I believe unwise to not
hear the opinion of someone who might make a difference. Or at least give
them enough time to respond. Rushing decisions leads to poor decisions with
not all the facts and unforeseen problems as a result.

This would allow us to move at a pace we all agree while giving people the
chance to chime in if they have important information. To have been so sick
you can't read for a week to be told that sorry you missed the boat on a
time limit you didn't even agree to seems unfair. To have agreed upon
a limit that you then miss knowing that your voice won't be heard after
that time seems fair. No &quot;I turned the way for a moment&quot; and boom I have no
say.

If agreed to the concept we can work together on establishing a minimum
time limit.

Also we would need to agree on the definition of the size of the list. As
well as conditions that would put you as part of the group that must be
heard from before the minimum time limit is made.

Input is appreciated.

Cheers,
James
