<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Rather than respond individually to a bunch of emails that seem to me
from people unhappy with some aspect of metagovernment or another, I'd
like to generally counter that IMHO the system is fine, it's people's
use and expectations that may need adjusting:

1) I've been through this forum/discussion system vs. email list many
times on many different lists and my conclusion has always been the
same: I prefer mailing lists, primarily because it shows up in my
inbox where I don't forget about it like I seem to always do with
forums.  Perhaps the best combination is what sites like slashdot and
quora have where they email you a digest every day with the best
threads of that day.  Not so good if you're going to be an active
participant in a news-related story (the conversations are stale by
the time you get to them) but great for a lurker, especially for
long-term design issues (which is what we're all working on here,
right?)

2) The archives for the email list IMHO are always better than trying
to find old stuff on forum sites, although you do have to jump through
some hoops to use the Metagovernment list archives (e.g., using the
site: tag in Google search).

3) If the volume of this list is too high, I'd recommend switching to
digest mode except for one thing: Most people don't properly trim
their posts.  Being a mailing-list junkie for 30 years it *still*
bothers me that people can't take 10 seconds to remove the unneeded
stuff from a message they're responding to.  The proper technique, as
practiced religiously back in the day for bandwidth reasons (and now
necessary for attention span reasons) is to leave one or two sentences
you're responding to, then put your response after that.  If this is
too much of a burden, please reconsider posting at all: If you can't
spend 10 seconds editing someone else's post down, do you really have
the time to compose a message that's truly worth cluttering up
everyone's inbox with?

4) I don't expect metagovernment to come up with the &quot;One True&quot;
on-line government system, or even to function as a &quot;recruiting&quot; tool.
 I'm here because this is where a lot of bright people who've thought
a lot about the issues are.  Seems to me our role here is to ask
questions and point out potential flaws in other people's systems.  If
you're not working on a system, that's fine, just being a critic is a
valuable contribution.  But to be useful as a critic you've got to go
out and try out the systems (now Loomio and Airesis) to see what you
like and don't like about them, and be prepared to say why.

5) The name &quot;Metagovernment&quot; means a replacement government to me.
Which means any systems we come up with should be scalable to millions
or even billions of people.  I've nothing against decision support
systems for smaller groups, it's just that that's not what I'm here
for and not what I believe metagovernment.org was set up to discuss.
This again is why I believe sorting/filtering is *the* key issue in
any system design, and why I believe that none of the existing systems
(or even their prototypes) are even on the right path.

6) The Affero GPL license is the only thing any of us should accept
for any project we &quot;review&quot;.  Fortunately both Loomio and Airesis use
that, as will my project.
  Regards,
    Scott
