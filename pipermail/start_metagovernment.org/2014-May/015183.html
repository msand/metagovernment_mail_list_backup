&gt;&gt;<i> Scott, you're proposing small groups of volunteers working on proposals. So am I. But I don't think they are going to get it right, no matter how well-intentioned, well-informed, or well-educated they are. As the proposal gains larger visibility, it will get pushback.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, and this *reduces* the likelihood of consensus.
</I>
Yes. There shouldn't be consensus until... there is consensus. No point forcing the matter.

&gt;&gt;<i> That is why voting should be iterative and mixed with the proposal development.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let the interested volunteers work up proposals, then as those proposals near acceptance their visibility grows, more people jump in, and they meet resistance. So the proposals need to be tweaked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are we even disagreeing? It sounds to me like we're all arguing for proposal tuning as the involved population grows. It's just a matter of terminology at this point, no?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are disagreeing because you didn't address the issue of resource

</I>&gt;<i> at some point prior to the &quot;final&quot; version of a proposal.  Every one
</I>&gt;<i> of those will have to review the proposal repeatedly as it is
</I>&gt;<i> modified.  Expecting more than a small percentage of the population to
</I>&gt;<i> do this is simply unreasonable IMHO.
</I>
We're working on different assumptions; so let me clarify that I am working in a model where every public decision is open to everyone. Most decisions will get ignored by most people, and they'll join in when something alarms or excites them. 

But even given that, there are several ways people can avoid excessive reading. Here are a few.

1. Delegate to someone else. Delegation should be allowable on a proposal-by-proposal basis (not carte blanche) and should be withdrawable at any time.

2. Vote no on long proposals. Again, in my model, all decisions are opened up. There should be no gigantic proposals like the omnibus budget bills in the United States. Proposals should be refined down to a specific solution for a specific problem.

3. Allow friends, the media, etc. to inform your decision. That's what we do now... except that we don't get to vote at all. There's nothing wrong with having a trusted colleague tell you that they've read over a proposal and they think you should vote for it.


&gt;<i> I've put out my ballpark estimate of how many proposals a person would
</I>&gt;<i> have to vote on to run a government (both local and global) and how
</I>&gt;<i> long it should take (2 or 3 a week, less than an hour, based on what
</I>&gt;<i> is required now at all levels in the US).  Do you have an estimate as
</I>&gt;<i> to how much more time commitment it will require if repeated votes are
</I>&gt;<i> held?  Or is your solution simply to reduce the percentage of the
</I>&gt;<i> population who will actually vote?
</I>
Yes, reduce the population who will vote on any one decision, because decisions should not be grandiose. &quot;We should repair bridge X and we should pay for it with a $1 toll on everyone who uses the bridge this year.&quot; That's a good proposal. Not some 400-page city budget. That's just ludicrous anyway. Even the politicians who vote on those bills don't read them.
