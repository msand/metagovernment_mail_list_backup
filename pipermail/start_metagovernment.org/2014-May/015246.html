I'm kind of liking this because it has the additional benefit of
forcing the issue: Nobody wants a blank page as the intro and clearing
it should inspire participatory activity, which so far is sadly
lacking: Of the 150 people on this list I count an even dozen who have
actually posted in the last 2 months and only 9 have signed up for
Loomio (where I note this proposal has also been made).  Lurking on a
list is perfectly fine 99% of the time, but maybe this is one of those
rare times when we ought to require people to speak up or get removed.

Just to go on record, my objections to that page are to the term
&quot;consensus&quot; and the specific architectural requirements (i.e.,
multiple systems that somehow magically function together, which I am
quite sure is simply unworkable).  To be honest, I've never been too
fond of the word &quot;collaborative&quot; either, and would prefer it be more
specific and descriptive (i.e., go ahead and use the term &quot;direct
democracy&quot; because that's what we're all really talking about).

My &quot;wish list&quot; items include a more complete description of the
inherent flaws of representative democracy (for which I volunteer the
&quot;talking point&quot; on this issue I wrote for my book), descriptions of
whatever other ground rules we can agree on (e.g., hopefully open
voting), and a little more on how the transition from the current
system to the new one would work (i.e., once everyone starts using the
new one, they would naturally use it to take a simple vote to replace
the old one).

As I've expressed before, I have the time and ability to edit that
page (or any other) myself but don't feel comfortable doing so unless
I am specifically directed to by Ed and/or a majority of the group.
  Regards,
    Scott
