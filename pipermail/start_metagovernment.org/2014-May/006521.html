<PRE>Sorry I still can&#8217;t participate fully, but I&#8217;ve kept a partial eye on some of the comments flowing since my last post. A few observations.

1. We have rules; we should stick with them. I do not like the outcome of this proposal, but it happened in accordance with the rules currently in effect. If we ignore our own rules, then we have no governance, and that is not what we are about.

2. We should change the rules. Much of what we do here is an experiment. Let&#8217;s learn from our mistakes and improve our rules. Fortunately, we have rules for how to change the rules! :)

3. The participants are the quorum. Decisions are made by those who choose to participate (Scott, do you now see the sense in this?). I think we&#8217;ve learned here that one week is too short of a timeframe, so we should lengthen that. But we cannot define a quorum by a percentage of the list membership (that is 159 at this moment). When we think of all the decisions to be made in all the world, it only makes sense that it is the engaged who get to decide&#8230; provided there is enough publicity and wait-time for others to engage and change the result.

4. Decisions should stick when they are made. This is a tough one, and I see a lot of people arguing with it. Shortly after the decision was made, the nays had enough votes to have broken the consensus. But it was too late. That&#8217;s the rule (as currently stated), and it is a good one. Otherwise, we allow what engineers call flapping. What if each time someone jumps into the conversation they vote the opposite of the last person? We could end up with rules switching on and off, back and forth, over and over. Governance is about consistency. If a rule passes, then repealing it should require the same threshold. But please note, the rule as currently stated is not that there is one week to decide, but rather that consensus (as defined by a percentage) must be maintained for a week.

5. I have no privilege. The word &#8220;privilege&#8221; means &#8220;private law.&#8221; It was first used to describe the senators of ancient Rome who were a law unto themselves. It is the antithesis of this project. If I had felt really strongly about the process, I could have just jumped in and said &#8220;no&#8221; when I saw the emails coming in, even though I wasn&#8217;t informed. But I didn&#8217;t, and the rules carry. Tough for me. (I&#8217;ll note that I will evoke privilege in one case: if this group suddenly gets overrun by a bunch of &#8220;vandals&#8221; who start trying to hijack our community and pass nonsense laws. We&#8217;re not strong enough yet to overcome that on our own. We should get that strong, however.)

So please go forth with proposals to change the home page. Heck, someone can make a proposal to restore it. I might vote for that.

And also, we should formally propose changes to the rules. Please feel free to go ahead with that.

I&#8217;d like to suggest that only emails that start with the word &#8220;Proposal&#8221; be considered a valid proposal in this community (even if your email just points people to a proposal in another venue). And further, if you think a proposal can be improved, make your own better proposal.

As for what software we use to decide on a proposal, that&#8217;s an organic and undefined process. Let&#8217;s try some new things and see what results we get. We can always use the discussion in this community to overrule any decision that a particular system makes that seems unreasonable.
