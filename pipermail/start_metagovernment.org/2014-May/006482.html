<PRE>The discussion process of drafting a proposal needs to be regimented to an
extend in order to keep the  focus directed on the project and not have it
go off track. I think two types of posts should be highlighted for this
process to be efficient. Posts that are highly accepted and posts that are
highly criticised. These two types of comments usually create a good degree
of debate and input from all sides, which is want we want. I think my
system should work well for that.


To start off I want to introduce a concept for the structure of the forum
that helps me understand the overall layout a little better. I think of
each proposal starting out as a stem, a sprout that emerges from the
ground. This stem then forms a few leaves (responses), the more leaves the
more energy it absorbs and the stronger the stem becomes. The leaves might
turn into branches themselves and host their own leaves (responses)
eventually. Over time it becomes a full fledge tree with many different
branches and leaves going off in many different directions shaping the
tree's look. Every leaf is still connected in some way back to the stem,
through a chain of branches. Every sprout has the potential to become a
tree, every tree sits in a in a forest of other trees (proposals). The
largest and strongest trees might eventually be chosen to be used for
production purposes (voting stage).


Whenever a new leaf (response) is created the entire chain of branches all
the way down to the stem (original proposal) is temporarily strengthened
(raised to the top of their lists, it becomes post number one). However if
the newly formed leaf does not acquire sufficient sunlight (up votes) it
can quickly wither and the tree will divert more energy to the more
successful leafs to grow that area instead.


Okay hopefully enough with the tree analogy. Now to get a little technical.


Each new response to a post or a new proposal starts with a score of zero
(0). Zero is actually the best score a post can get. Upon each posts
creation a timer starts. Every time the timer goes off, say 60 seconds, it
loses a point. So a post that's 3 minutes old (180 seconds) will have a
score of negative three (-3). This score ranks the order in which responses
to a post or proposals are displayed. Closest to zero and down the list you
go.


The other aspect of this formula is that every time a post receives an up
vote the timer is increased. So instead of a post losing a point every 60
seconds, a post with one up vote could instead lose a point ever 70
seconds, a post with two up votes could lose a point every 80 seconds. So
you can see the more agreed upon posts will drop at a slower rate ensuring
that they eventually overtake a post that generates fewer up votes.


Another layer is that a fresh response to a post bumps up the entire thread
(chain of branches back to the original stem) up to the top of their
individual lists, original proposal included. Each post associated with the
fresh post starts back at zero and starts losing points again at the rate
of the fresh post. So each associated response piggy backs on the fresh
posts score and mimics it's attributes, 60 seconds timer or what have you.
This happens until the fresh posts score becomes lower than the actual
score of its associated posts. These posts then revert back to their score
and timer. The timer doesn't actually stop on the associated posts it just
pretends like it has a higher score until it doesn't anymore. The chain of
posts cherry picks whichever response attached to it has the highest score
and uses that number until their own score becomes the highest, which
happens quickly if the new response receives no up votes.


This means any fresh insight to a proposal gives it it's chance in the
spotlight but if it does not generate support that it falls out of sight
and gives way to more popular conversations.


I do not include any down votes in this system, as it not only brings on
unnecessary negativity but has no actual useful purpose in this model. If
you do not agree with a post can ignore it or respond to it, however a
response bumps it up to the top again.


The correct math formula is obviously not sorted out yet but think it's
something easily established when we get some measure of consistent
activity.


Sorry if I repeated myself a couple times in this explanation, just wanted
to make sure it was clear because it took some time for myself to fully
wrap my head around. Again please with the questions, happy to answer. This
model keeps the proposals circulating but continuously reverting back to
the projects that have drummed up the most support overall. This process of
giving priority to the emerging proposals and comments hopefully can
progress proposals in the right direction.


Much love
