<PRE>I think you might be right, it's a little sad but society is undoubtedly
heading towards an era without secrets, where everything's public, which
may in fact be better overall but is a little unsettling. Keeping politics
separate from the public life would be better for the individual but maybe
not for civilization as a whole.

Alternatively we might explore the option that only the original proposal
is submitted anonymously, and comments/voting afterwards be public. The
reason is I fear that with a public proposal it opens up a clear target for
anyone that disagrees with the proposer. Especially if the proposer is
integral to moving the proposal forward to a voting stage, this public
display could lead to murderous results.

My other comment against public comments/voting is that it makes it more
like a game. It's more you winning and the other guy losing as oppose to it
all being anonymous and no one knowing, I feel it's adding weird incentive
to make a name for yourself. Instead of people just contributing to the
overall knowledge of the discussion, we'd get more people doing things just
to be noticed and I don't particularly consider that a good thing.

Just my two cents.
