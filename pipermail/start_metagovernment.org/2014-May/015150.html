<PRE>Dear all, I also would like to say that I am very interested in this
thread, but seem to lack the time to read it properly. Much less to chip
in. My idea of a summary was lost in the noise. Could I ask some of the
participants to write down at least what have been agreed on. And maybe a
list of the alternative ideas, too?

Many thanks to anyone who takes responsibility for this.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If I may present a potential scenario:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looks good to me!  A few small comments:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (snip)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - This creates small groups of advocates that could craft crazy
</I>&gt;<i> proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and gain some interest for their cause. Whatever interest they generate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; works against them though as their proposal becomes more popular, good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; citizens of the world will begin to notice more and start to investigate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their potential weaknesses. This exposes any hidden agenda or truths as
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; debate carries on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - I surmise that a proposal should only go forward to a voting stage
</I>&gt;<i> with at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; least a 51% participation rate of all active members on the site. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; should be a difficult thing to do and will require sustained interest
</I>&gt;<i> in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposal guaranteeing it remains near the top of the site to ensure it
</I>&gt;<i> gets
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; seen.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems a bit high to me, but again this is an empirical question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I think we'll have to wait to see how small these &quot;working groups&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end up being.  I'm also inclined try to tie in some sort of rating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; threshold (twice as many pros as cons, ratings on pro statements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; averaging a full point higher than cons, etc.) and a greenlight from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the proposer(s) who may feel like they need time for additional tweaks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to ensure the proposal will pass the general vote rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; taking it out of their hands when it reaches some threshold.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Participation does not necessary include making a post, as many users
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not be bothered to research a strong counter argument. Participation can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; simply be reading the proposal a bit finding an opinion that reflects
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; view on the issue and up voting that post. This up vote increases the
</I>&gt;<i> weight
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of that post in the discussion and makes their opinion a larger part of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision, exposing it as well to possible weaknesses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Exactly: Merely giving a pro or con statement a rating should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sufficient to count toward moving the proposal to a vote.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - This process creates our pros and cons list that can be drafted and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; presented in a simplified way to then move on to the voting stage where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; still more of the public will be involved. A majority of 2/3 of the
</I>&gt;<i> votes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; take it. Everything is open and transparent the entire time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, the majority necessary to approve may need to be tweaked, but I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would at least *hope* that 2/3 will be achievable and so it seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reasonable to start with that goal.  This will put the fire to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feet of the proposers to do their best work.  One alternative we might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider is to vary the supermajority required as a function of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; percentage of registered voters who cast a vote.  My big concern is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that if only 1/3 of the people vote even a 2/3 or 3/4 majority won't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be enough to ensure that the Neurotypicals will keep the SDAs (who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tend to vote in larger numbers, especially for those relatively few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issues they really care about) in check.  If the SDAs make up 30% of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the population (probably a high estimate, and not all of them would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote) we'd need 2/3 of registered voters to actually vote (possibly by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proxy) with a simple majority rule for the Neurotypicals to play their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proper role in the process.  The lower the percentage of registered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voters who vote, the larger the supermajority would have to be such
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that if you get down into the 30% range the vote to approve would have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be unanimous or nearly so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Participation is voluntary but there can be penalties for incorrectly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; participating in the discussion. You can never be penalized for up
</I>&gt;<i> voting or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; voting. This limits input without limiting quality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm opposed to &quot;penalties&quot; per se, but being flagged and filtered by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people (which an individual would be notified of) should be sufficient
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incentive for the potentially troublesome individuals to alter their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior to confirm to societal norms.  Again, this is the way we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; humans did it for millions of years and we ignore that fact at our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; peril.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Any reason why this wouldn't work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably a thousand that we haven't thought of ;-)  What we need now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a working prototype so that we can start shaping the UI and those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thresholds.  I'm working on it but am taking my time selecting a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform (I'm doing the Django tutorial right now) to avoid having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; start over if I pick the wrong one to start out with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Scott
