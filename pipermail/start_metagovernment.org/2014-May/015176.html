&gt;<i> Scott, to answer both of your scenarios below (climate change and defense spending) my answer is that government shouldn't be operating on the scale that it is.

Ah, I think we've exposed an Anarchist!

&gt;<i> New-style governments (the ones I'm hoping to see us foster) won't be deciding on defense spending, because that is a issue of a national government. What point is there in having national governments? They are just political artifacts that have little to do with natural geography or ethnicity as much as they have to do with kingdoms and their legacies. A government so vast that it decides the fate of hundreds of millions of people is ludicrous. Maybe someday collaborative governance could operate on that scale for the occasional question, but for the most part governance shouldn't be for areas larger than an ecoregion or city... and usually for much smaller, or more importantly less-geographically-specific communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Fortunately this issue is independent of the issue of representative
vs. direct democracy and of the decision rule.

That being said, your position is completely untenable because it
embodies the classic naivete of anarchists: The belief that once that
wonderful system is embraced by everyone that there will be no need to
fear other &quot;ecoregions&quot;.  But you've neglected the lessons of history
(as interpreted by me) which is that unless your system specifically
controls the authoritarians it is doomed to failure by conquest.  This
includes having everyone using the *same* system and so functioning as
*one* people.

&gt;<i> Collaborative governance is a disruptive process, not a direct replacement for the current systems. It is a system for use in communities of any kind: geographic, common-interest, or common-mission. Those typically are not the scale of large nations; nor do they need to make decisions rashly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't see the need to separate those two.  It's almost as if you
believe that a slow decision is a better decision.  I disagree, and
restate my claim that this is a recipe for gridlock and that *any*
decision is better than no decision.

&gt;<i> Issues like climate change are more nuanced. All of the above applies there too (no gigantic governments making massive decisions), and so that opens up a lot more flexibility and nimbleness. Smaller groups can come up with innovative plans that make progress against climate change without having to get everyone's buy-in. Compare that to what we have now. We have very high scientific consensus about climate change, and national governments are doing next to nothing about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hey, if they're going to start seeding the atmosphere with particles
to try to deal with this (a serious proposal in some quarters), I want
everyone on the planet to have voted to approve this first.  Your way,
any enterprising &quot;ecoregion&quot; can take the ball and run with it because
there *is* no global government...

&gt;<i> As for what percentage of the voting population equals consensus; that's answered in my other post. If voting is iterative, then you know you have consensus when most voters agree... and also that that agreement holds for a while. If a proposal is about to go into effect, more people will hear about it and can easily prevent it if they disagree. So there's no hard number. It's a process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, I got the supermajority rule from your previous posts, but I'm
still missing the termination condition.  How do you know when you're
done?  And see my other post asking about the time burden you're
willing to impose on people...
  Regards,
    Scott
