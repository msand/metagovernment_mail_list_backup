<PRE>Steve, Jacopo and others,

Please note, my proposal 2 isn't currently on the table (sorry, my
fault).  Here's the proposal to discuss and vote:


   PROPOSAL 1
   ----------
   Blank the home page and insert the following:

      Owing to a dispute, the content of the home page is currently
      under discussion.  &lt;link to discussion thread&gt;

   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike, Scott
   Against: (nobody)


Steve said:
&gt;<i> Ok, so far only Ned has accepted my invitation to work on Michael's
</I>&gt;<i> proposals via Loomio.  :-(
</I>
Sorry Steve, speaking for myself, I'm unable to participate there at
the moment.  Before making other commitments, I need (at least) to
know whether we're going to fix the home page.

How do you feel about proposal 1, Steve?


Jacopo said:
&gt;<i> Just as a test ... will anyone try to open to discussion the same
</I>&gt;<i> proposal in the Airesis metagovernment page ...
</I>
(Just speaking for myself, I opt out with apologies, as I explain to
Steve above.)

&gt;<i> ... I will ask to add also a third solution that is to leave the
</I>&gt;<i> home page as is ...
</I>
To leave the home page as is, you'd say 'No' to proposal 1.  Is that
what you prefer?

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> So, just in case the resistance to go there is too thick to melt&#8230;.I'm going to play both ends.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's my response or ammendment to Michael&#8217;s proposal # 2:   (posted on Loomio as well)   :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment is a group that discusses the theory and technical practice of, the design, development, and implementation of various scalable systems of human self-governance. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I might want to add more later.

&gt;<i> I wish Ed to overcome the crisis he is going through.
</I>&gt;<i> Just as a test,  not to further any polemic, will anyone try to open to
</I>&gt;<i> discussion the same proposal in the Airesis metagovernment page I will ask
</I>&gt;<i> to add also a third solution that is to leave the home page as is and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually work on other solution, at the end of the proposition period we
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to test the Schulze algorithm method on multiple solution. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe will be a good starter for the testing group and actually we can
</I>&gt;<i> edit the home page in the Airesis Metagovernment group accordingly. I
</I>&gt;<i> remind that every one have been given administrative right so is an
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal group so far
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo

</PRE>
