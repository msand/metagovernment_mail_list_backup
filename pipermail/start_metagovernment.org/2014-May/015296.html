<PRE>Fine analysis Scott. you should transfer your points into the proposal
related to the home page
discussion&lt;<A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page">http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page</A>&gt;I
have started in the Airesis Metagovernment Testing group. There, any
one
can suggest modifications and together decide to bring the proposal to a
maturity, so far  sound like a death proposal.
 I'd like to place another concept and is about current mass media, that
will go through a deep transformation in the Internet era

6) The mass media should not be in control of any group and the internet
should be free and the access to it should be a fundamental right.

Regarding the video, this is a finalized version we recently completed for
Airesis, I apologize for the voice (mine, with a heavy italian accent)
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ-SZhj3MJM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ-SZhj3MJM</A>

If any of you would like to do an English recording, I will be glad to send
the written text.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd still like the home page to be reverted until a real decision is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reached. Sorry that I&#8217;ve missed out on the conversation, so maybe there
</I>&gt;<i> was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some logic to making the home page say basically nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It still has the links, though, so I think it'll do for now.  I'd
</I>&gt;<i> propose that if we diddle around for more than two weeks that you just
</I>&gt;<i> put the old one back until we get our act together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But lacking that, I have made a new draft home page. I doubt I&#8217;ll have
</I>&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to defend it, but hopefully you as a group can improve it. Last time we
</I>&gt;<i> used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Votorola to come up with the home page, and it worked very well. I&#8217;d
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recommend using that again.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My draft is here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2014/05/Ed_Pastore">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2014/05/Ed_Pastore</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, it still has that pesky word &quot;consensus&quot; in it (watered down
</I>&gt;<i> though the context may be).  Again, my purpose here is not to hijack
</I>&gt;<i> this group, but instead to wake it up to the reality that there has
</I>&gt;<i> been a lot of research in this area and we need to at least take that
</I>&gt;<i> into consideration.  For my purposes the key fact is that we're going
</I>&gt;<i> to have a quarter to a third of the population that is going to oppose
</I>&gt;<i> any reasonable course of action in favor of preserving the status quo
</I>&gt;<i> (or worse).  Therefore, consensus is out as a decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i> Conveniently enough, of course, my 1/3 + majority decision rule
</I>&gt;<i> proposal *also* passed, and by more votes than this home page issue
</I>&gt;<i> did...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe as an exercise we each should list the top 5 concepts we'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to see covered on the new home page.  Here are mine:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Representative government is inherently corrupt because of the
</I>&gt;<i> money required/allowed to campaign for those offices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Representative government is inherently dangerous to the general
</I>&gt;<i> population because authoritarians, who are instinctively prejudiced
</I>&gt;<i> against and aggressive toward those they consider outsiders, gravitate
</I>&gt;<i> towards filling the role of representative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The general population (who I call the &quot;Neurotypicals&quot;) is better
</I>&gt;<i> suited to making the decisions about how they want to live directly
</I>&gt;<i> than relying on representatives to do it for them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The technology to run a direct democracy of more than a few dozen
</I>&gt;<i> people simply did not exist even 20 years ago.  But it does now, and
</I>&gt;<i> the day when a sufficient percentage of the population is comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> enough with it to run a government is rapidly approaching or in some
</I>&gt;<i> places has already arrived.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) If we want our government to function better, it's up to *us* to
</I>&gt;<i> design and implement a better system because for damn sure our
</I>&gt;<i> existing governments are not going to do it for us, nor can we trust
</I>&gt;<i> corporations to do it because we cannot provide any monetary incentive
</I>&gt;<i> without introducing inherent conflicts of interest and corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, a Call to Action (e.g., &quot;So come help us design/implement/test a
</I>&gt;<i> new system of government that we can use to govern organizations of
</I>&gt;<i> any size simply, safely, and effectively.&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Feel free to add yours using a similar URL.) I&#8217;d love to have a video
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matches the text, but obviously don&#8217;t have time now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That sort of stuff can come later too.  I'd love to have a flashy
</I>&gt;<i> multimedia presentation too, but let's take care of the foundation
</I>&gt;<i> work first.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
