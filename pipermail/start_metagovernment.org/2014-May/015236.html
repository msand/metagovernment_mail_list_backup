Agreed, except that in this message I believe you may be trying to
take on too much.  Definitely worth sharing but many of these points
look to be things that will need to be tweaked based on how we
discover people actually use the system.

&gt;<i> Some basic statements that have been discussed already, hopefully we all
</I>&gt;<i> agree with this stuff:
</I>
Again, roughly.  Please excuse my editing to only include the ones
that I have an issue with.

&gt;<i> - Some guy has a case for a change in the world. He creates a title, some
</I>&gt;<i> 140 character synopsis of his proposal and posts it to the site.
</I>
OK I think we've already gone into the weeds here.  The proposals
should not be considered mere tweets, but seriously researched and
developed legal documents.  They don't have to be polished to the
degree necessary to incorporate directly into a jurisdiction's
statutes at the start, but should include everything that the final
law will need to have.  To do otherwise is just a waste of everyone's
time because putting a tweet &quot;let's ban animal research!&quot; will get
people riled up but will simply not be possible to revise into a form
where it can actually be implemented as law.

I realize that this puts a big burden on the proposers, but this is
serious business: If they can't be bothered to read the existing
statutes/ordinances at the appropriate level of jurisdiction they
shouldn't be mucking about trying to create or modify those laws.  Of
course this plays into my more general proposal (in my book) that
*all* of those laws need to be rewritten to be intelligible because
most of them are horrible: The lawyers who write them have a definite
style and in many (most?) cases it seems like preserving that style is
more important to them than being clear.  I ran a recent California
bill on funding for humane societies through the Flesch&#8211;Kincaid tool
in Word and it came out grade level 23, which is means it was only
readable by people with two PhDs.

&gt;<i> - Click on a proposal synopsis and you're taken to the expanded proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> where a more detailed account is presented in point form. Again, each point
</I>&gt;<i> is a synopsis of 140 characters or something.
</I>
Again, I don't see the benefit of limiting the length of the proposal
or the comments.  Certainly being concise should be rewarded and we
may even want a &quot;TL;DR&quot; flag, but sometimes (a lot of time, actually)
really understanding an issue takes a page or more of text (i.e.,
thousands of characters).

&gt;<i> - A reply that's an objection should be addressed by the supporters of the
</I>&gt;<i> original post and attempt to work out differences and reach a compromise.
</I>
This is where the rubber hits the road in my opinion, and probably in
the opinion of most of the consensus aficionados.  The process of
revising proposals and comments needs to be as smooth as any piece of
software ever developed.  For example, I find Loomio's process of
managing revisions confusing and cumbersome.  There needs to be an
indication of the number of revisions and a way to quickly click
through them.  My system will also have a separate section for
&quot;questions&quot;, which are different in character from pro/con statements
and so need to be treated specially.

&gt;<i> - Once a proposal is ready to go the voting stage it should be cleaned up to
</I>&gt;<i> include any alterations that have been agreed upon in the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> process. It should be presented in a clear and concise manner with all
</I>&gt;<i> information being available should the voter wish to know more.
</I>
I'd disagree here because the refinement (and writing up the actual
legal wording) should be *complete* at the proposal stage to avoid the
possibility that some proposer will slip in objectionable material
(intentionally or not) during this rewrite.

&gt;<i> - Upon voting I think it would be a good idea to include a comment section
</I>&gt;<i> where voters can express their opinions on why they voted a certain way.
</I>&gt;<i> This is to allow an outlet for pure opinion rather than encouraging it
</I>&gt;<i> during the discussion process. The discussion process should attempt to be
</I>&gt;<i> as fact based as possible.
</I>
A good idea, and one I hadn't thought of: This would not only increase
moral buy-in, but also provide useful information for the proposers
for a possible revision should the measure fail.  Not everyone will
follow the proposal stage and these actual voters may have different
motivations than the people who worked against the proposal in the
first phase.

&gt;<i> - Criticism that does not get properly addressed or countered in the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion process cannot be added to the proposal and does not count as
</I>&gt;<i> participation points, they remain the top criticism even if the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> does manage to make it to the voting stage anyway.
</I>
I'm still on the fence about these &quot;points&quot; (i.e., a reputation
system).  My current thinking is that the average rating given to a
poster's comments (and the percentage of them being flagged) needs to
be easily accessible (perhaps even included in the header of their
subsequent posts), but I'm uncomfortable with the idea that some
people's posts will be prioritized merely because they were
instrumental in getting bills passed in the past.  This sounds to me
like a recipe for recreating the political machines (parties) that
plague our current systems.
  Regards,
    Scott
