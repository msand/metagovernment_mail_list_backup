<PRE>I'd be interested to see how the numbers would work out once a system is
going so you could tweak it. One thing I think that might be helpful is
what does an up-vote mean in your system. Does it mean, &quot;I agree with what
the decision they are making&quot; or &quot;I think that this is noteworthy and we
need to think about it&quot;. Because the system would record those as being the
same when they are actually not the same thing. Does that make sense?

Cheers,
James

&gt;<i> The discussion process of drafting a proposal needs to be regimented to an
</I>&gt;<i> extend in order to keep the  focus directed on the project and not have it
</I>&gt;<i> go off track. I think two types of posts should be highlighted for this
</I>&gt;<i> process to be efficient. Posts that are highly accepted and posts that are
</I>&gt;<i> highly criticised. These two types of comments usually create a good degree
</I>&gt;<i> of debate and input from all sides, which is want we want. I think my
</I>&gt;<i> system should work well for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To start off I want to introduce a concept for the structure of the forum
</I>&gt;<i> that helps me understand the overall layout a little better. I think of
</I>&gt;<i> each proposal starting out as a stem, a sprout that emerges from the
</I>&gt;<i> ground. This stem then forms a few leaves (responses), the more leaves the
</I>&gt;<i> more energy it absorbs and the stronger the stem becomes. The leaves might
</I>&gt;<i> turn into branches themselves and host their own leaves (responses)
</I>&gt;<i> eventually. Over time it becomes a full fledge tree with many different
</I>&gt;<i> branches and leaves going off in many different directions shaping the
</I>&gt;<i> tree's look. Every leaf is still connected in some way back to the stem,
</I>&gt;<i> through a chain of branches. Every sprout has the potential to become a
</I>&gt;<i> tree, every tree sits in a in a forest of other trees (proposals). The
</I>&gt;<i> largest and strongest trees might eventually be chosen to be used for
</I>&gt;<i> production purposes (voting stage).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever a new leaf (response) is created the entire chain of branches all
</I>&gt;<i> the way down to the stem (original proposal) is temporarily strengthened
</I>&gt;<i> (raised to the top of their lists, it becomes post number one). However if
</I>&gt;<i> the newly formed leaf does not acquire sufficient sunlight (up votes) it
</I>&gt;<i> can quickly wither and the tree will divert more energy to the more
</I>&gt;<i> successful leafs to grow that area instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Okay hopefully enough with the tree analogy. Now to get a little
</I>&gt;<i> technical.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each new response to a post or a new proposal starts with a score of zero
</I>&gt;<i> (0). Zero is actually the best score a post can get. Upon each posts
</I>&gt;<i> creation a timer starts. Every time the timer goes off, say 60 seconds, it
</I>&gt;<i> loses a point. So a post that's 3 minutes old (180 seconds) will have a
</I>&gt;<i> score of negative three (-3). This score ranks the order in which responses
</I>&gt;<i> to a post or proposals are displayed. Closest to zero and down the list you
</I>&gt;<i> go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other aspect of this formula is that every time a post receives an up
</I>&gt;<i> vote the timer is increased. So instead of a post losing a point every 60
</I>&gt;<i> seconds, a post with one up vote could instead lose a point ever 70
</I>&gt;<i> seconds, a post with two up votes could lose a point every 80 seconds. So
</I>&gt;<i> you can see the more agreed upon posts will drop at a slower rate ensuring
</I>&gt;<i> that they eventually overtake a post that generates fewer up votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another layer is that a fresh response to a post bumps up the entire
</I>&gt;<i> thread (chain of branches back to the original stem) up to the top of their
</I>&gt;<i> individual lists, original proposal included. Each post associated with the
</I>&gt;<i> fresh post starts back at zero and starts losing points again at the rate
</I>&gt;<i> of the fresh post. So each associated response piggy backs on the fresh
</I>&gt;<i> posts score and mimics it's attributes, 60 seconds timer or what have you.
</I>&gt;<i> This happens until the fresh posts score becomes lower than the actual
</I>&gt;<i> score of its associated posts. These posts then revert back to their score
</I>&gt;<i> and timer. The timer doesn't actually stop on the associated posts it just
</I>&gt;<i> pretends like it has a higher score until it doesn't anymore. The chain of
</I>&gt;<i> posts cherry picks whichever response attached to it has the highest score
</I>&gt;<i> and uses that number until their own score becomes the highest, which
</I>&gt;<i> happens quickly if the new response receives no up votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means any fresh insight to a proposal gives it it's chance in the
</I>&gt;<i> spotlight but if it does not generate support that it falls out of sight
</I>&gt;<i> and gives way to more popular conversations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not include any down votes in this system, as it not only brings on
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary negativity but has no actual useful purpose in this model. If
</I>&gt;<i> you do not agree with a post can ignore it or respond to it, however a
</I>&gt;<i> response bumps it up to the top again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The correct math formula is obviously not sorted out yet but think it's
</I>&gt;<i> something easily established when we get some measure of consistent
</I>&gt;<i> activity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if I repeated myself a couple times in this explanation, just wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to make sure it was clear because it took some time for myself to fully
</I>&gt;<i> wrap my head around. Again please with the questions, happy to answer. This
</I>&gt;<i> model keeps the proposals circulating but continuously reverting back to
</I>&gt;<i> the projects that have drummed up the most support overall. This process of
</I>&gt;<i> giving priority to the emerging proposals and comments hopefully can
</I>&gt;<i> progress proposals in the right direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much love
