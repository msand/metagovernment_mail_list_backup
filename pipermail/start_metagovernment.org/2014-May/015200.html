<PRE>On Sun, May 11, 2014 at 6:54 PM, Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> I do not intend to solve all warfare, nor do I think anyone can; at least not until we mature more as a species (which I believe collaborative governance will help promote). But I don't see government of ecoregions either; I just gave that as an example. Governance will become distributed; nuanced; and largely disconnected with geography. If one town wants to build a bridge, there should be nothing stopping people on the other side of the planet from voting it... except that they won't care, so they wont vote. Except in cases where they *do* care for some reason, such as that the bridge will destroy a monument sacred to them: then they can and will vote against it, despite not being anywhere near that region.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm fine with that, and in fact having the global population involved
in local decisionmaking is something sorely lacking in our current
systems.  A lot of times problems we face locally are problems that
others in far away places have already solved (e.g., too bad the US
couldn't follow a lead on health care, ha!)  But I'm inclined to have
them involved at the proposal-refining stage but *not* get a vote on
issues that only affect a Locality (my Plan has only two levels of
government, Globality and Locality, the latter being something on the
order of a metropolitan area for urban areas or an ecoregion for rural
areas).

But then, I guess I'm not understanding your position: Is there to be
one global government (which BTW *would* solve that pesky warfare
problem), or not?

&gt;<i> As for controlling authoritarians, their authority roots in the threat of violence. It's difficult to threaten violence against a distributed community. Further, there's nothing stopping people from using violence back at them. Their authority starts with the threat of violence, but it only succeeds if people are cowed by that threat and/or don't see a way to counter it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm thinking you're considering only popular conception of
authoritarians (the leaders).  The sense I'm using it is primarily the
followers who muck up the system even without the threat of violence
or even an authoritarian leader to support.  Again, Altemeyer's book
is a good introduction to this issue:
<A HREF="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/">http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/</A>


&gt;<i> So let's decide what color pants you should wear tomorrow. I say bright purple. It's a decision: better than nothing, right? Okay, now let's decide what you'll eat tomorrow. I say dirt. Great, another decision! Let's decide if the world should launch all its nuclear weapons right now. Sure, do it. There, another decision! They were better than no decision, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I like purple! Eating dirt no so much.  But mostly I like carbon
emissions or abortion policy as issues that we as a species *need* to
make a collective decision on rather than continuing along with the
status quo because we can't reach consensus on them.

&gt;<i> How can you possibly justify rash decisions? There is no need for decisions unless they are good ones. Bad decisions, unpopular decisions, hasty decisions... they are all undesirable. My proof? See above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is your justification for the opposite?
</I>
Mostly seeing an *existing* system that is completely non-functional
in solving these hard problems and preferring, and believing we can
achieve, something better.  Pretty much *all* the decisions the US
congress makes are suboptimal, but even last year's paltry output of
60 bills (again many of which were useless stuff like renaming
buildings) is better than having no government at all which is what
you seem to me to be proposing at least for any issue where a
significant minority would prefer that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for what percentage of the voting population equals consensus; that's answered in my other post. If voting is iterative, then you know you have consensus when most voters agree... and also that that agreement holds for a while. If a proposal is about to go into effect, more people will hear about it and can easily prevent it if they disagree. So there's no hard number. It's a process.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OK, I got the supermajority rule from your previous posts, but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still missing the termination condition.  How do you know when you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done?  And see my other post asking about the time burden you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing to impose on people...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The way we set it up in our working case on the Metagov website
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> is that no decision is final until a consensus has held for a week. That can be tweaked for the scale of the decision: it's just a working idea for now. The idea is to give enough time for people to notice, react, and break the consensus if necessary. I'll answer the rest in the other thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This seems fine to me (though the 80% threshold seems high).  And I've
also no problem with labeling it as experimental (I'm going to be in
that mode for years!)  It seems on this one we only disagree with the
use of the term &quot;consensus&quot; to describe what it is delivering.
  Regards,
    Scott
