</I>&gt;<i> Definitely, and I've always been a fan of &quot;the right people show up&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> when trying to decide whether a committee or other working group has a
</I>&gt;<i> quorum/mandate to develop a new proposal.  But that is not the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing as allowing that group to hold a vote *binding* the entire
</I>&gt;<i> population to a decision...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

its currently nothing more than experimentation + when it comes to
political voting, with what we use here,you can make a counter proposal any
time you want and start to market it unless in peoples every days life.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we&#8217;ve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learned here that one week is too short of a timeframe, so we should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lengthen that. But we cannot define a quorum by a percentage of the list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; membership (that is 159 at this moment).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this were a normal government, that low of a participation rate
</I>&gt;<i> would be pretty terrifying.  But most of those people obviously don't
</I>&gt;<i> care because we are not actually binding them to anything, and I'd
</I>&gt;<i> even suspect that a significant number of those addresses are just
</I>&gt;<i> effectively dead.  So I agree that we can't use any conventional
</I>&gt;<i> definition of quorum to set a criteria for whether a vote is binding
</I>&gt;<i> or not.   But I'm inclined to accept the legitimacy of my decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule as it applies to votes we've held on Loomio (currently 9
</I>&gt;<i> registered members of the group).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Decisions should stick when they are made. This is a tough one, and I
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a lot of people arguing with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree: The time to voice your opinion is when you first hear about
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal, not later when you see that it didn't go your way.  This
</I>&gt;<i> custom must apply not just to governing this group, but also to the
</I>&gt;<i> general systems we eventually produce.  I worry about flapping too,
</I>&gt;<i> but in a larger population *everything* is going to just take a lot
</I>&gt;<i> longer and so reversals will not happen often because of the amount of
</I>&gt;<i> work it would require.
</I>

we currently have one week of time a consensus has to hold before it
becomes active.
if u have a better idea how to prevent flapping, make a proposal.



&gt;<i> But I would be happy if they happen more often
</I>&gt;<i> than in our current representative-based governments, where reversing
</I>&gt;<i> an earlier (bad) decision is like pulling teeth and so is extremely
</I>&gt;<i> rare.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So please go forth with proposals to change the home page. Heck, someone
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make a proposal to restore it. I might vote for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see that you are not a member of the Loomio group, but would again
</I>&gt;<i> encourage you to try it out.  Same goes for anyone else who want to
</I>&gt;<i> make this sort of proposal.  I'm certainly no big fan of Loomio, but
</I>&gt;<i> it works and I believe we should continue to use it until something
</I>&gt;<i> better comes along.  That web site again is loomio.org, and the group
</I>&gt;<i> name is &quot;Metagovernment&quot;.  Note that you have to apply for membership,
</I>&gt;<i> so it's a two step process (i.e., don't wait until the last minute and
</I>&gt;<i> expect everything to happen instantly, better join now so that when
</I>&gt;<i> something important comes along you won't get held up).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
