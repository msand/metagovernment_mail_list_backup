<PRE>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Ned&gt; Loomio is an example of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     decision system that enables blocking without enabling any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     effective means through which to resolve unreasonable blocks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does a group decide if a block is unreasonable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Ned&gt; ...it would be a bad idea for us to enable blocking (except on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Vilfredo), which means that we are stuck (for now) with having to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     cast and count votes to reach decisions, and with majority or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     super-majority rule. Bummer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>In Vilfredo:
there is of course no definition for reasonable and unreasonable blocks,
said that there are in general 3 possible results long term
1) consensus
2) real polarity, with many people on each side, and few supporting both
(note this can have more than 2 poles)
3) one of the above, but also 1 or more options supported by a single
person (or few others that he pays, or similar) that do not vote for
anything else to avoid being dominated.

The problem with the third is that is that is is practically impossible to
define, because it depends on what happens outside nearly as much as it
depends on what happens inside. But you can definitely see some pattern in
the voting way. Still there are exceptions. When we made the question on
how to solve the problems with the banks, and Manuel was the only one to
say to let them fail. And he kept the proposal in check for 17 generations,
it would have been easy to decide that he was just an unreasonable
minority. 2 years later I thought he was actually right (now I am not so
sure anymore, I fluctuate).

In any case in Vilfredo you can also measure how many votes you receive.
This cannot have any effect on the internal process, but it can have an
effect on the outcome. You can decide that if you find a 70% or 80%
majority around a proposal for 3 generations, that is considered accepted.
Or that you take all the proposals in the Pareto front for the homepage, as
alternatve versions, with a probability of appearing proportional to the
number of votes. Or
that you take all the proposals in the Pareto front __(that have the
majority of votes)__ for the homepage, as alternatve versions, with a
probability of appearing proportional to the number of votes.

So the problem of unreasonable block cannot be fully solved, but it can be
tackled. And in Vilfredo we do it.
