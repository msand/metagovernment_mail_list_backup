I'm OK with the &quot;global entity&quot; concept, but recognize that it will be
a red flag for some and that it wasn't on the old page (or in Ed's
latest proposal).  This is offset by the fact that the people who will
object are probably authoritarians (nationalists, racists, etc.) and
so there's no real harm in tweaking their sensibilities because
they're not going to be willing participants in this process anyway.

Another issue that I haven't seen brought up is the issue of proxies.
Again, I'm OK with that and think I'd like to see it on the home page,
but since no one else mentioned it it seems there may not be consensus
on the issue?
  Regards,
    Scott
