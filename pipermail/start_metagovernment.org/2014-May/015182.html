</I>
I do not intend to solve all warfare, nor do I think anyone can; at least not until we mature more as a species (which I believe collaborative governance will help promote). But I don't see government of ecoregions either; I just gave that as an example. Governance will become distributed; nuanced; and largely disconnected with geography. If one town wants to build a bridge, there should be nothing stopping people on the other side of the planet from voting it... except that they won't care, so they wont vote. Except in cases where they *do* care for some reason, such as that the bridge will destroy a monument sacred to them: then they can and will vote against it, despite not being anywhere near that region.

As for controlling authoritarians, their authority roots in the threat of violence. It's difficult to threaten violence against a distributed community. Further, there's nothing stopping people from using violence back at them. Their authority starts with the threat of violence, but it only succeeds if people are cowed by that threat and/or don't see a way to counter it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Collaborative governance is a disruptive process, not a direct replacement for the current systems. It is a system for use in communities of any kind: geographic, common-interest, or common-mission. Those typically are not the scale of large nations; nor do they need to make decisions rashly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see the need to separate those two.  It's almost as if you
</I>&gt;<i> believe that a slow decision is a better decision.  I disagree, and
</I>&gt;<i> restate my claim that this is a recipe for gridlock and that *any*
</I>&gt;<i> decision is better than no decision.
</I>
So let's decide what color pants you should wear tomorrow. I say bright purple. It's a decision: better than nothing, right? Okay, now let's decide what you'll eat tomorrow. I say dirt. Great, another decision! Let's decide if the world should launch all its nuclear weapons right now. Sure, do it. There, another decision! They were better than no decision, right?

How can you possibly justify rash decisions? There is no need for decisions unless they are good ones. Bad decisions, unpopular decisions, hasty decisions... they are all undesirable. My proof? See above. 

What is your justification for the opposite?

&gt;&gt;<i> Issues like climate change are more nuanced. All of the above applies there too (no gigantic governments making massive decisions), and so that opens up a lot more flexibility and nimbleness. Smaller groups can come up with innovative plans that make progress against climate change without having to get everyone's buy-in. Compare that to what we have now. We have very high scientific consensus about climate change, and national governments are doing next to nothing about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, if they're going to start seeding the atmosphere with particles
</I>&gt;<i> to try to deal with this (a serious proposal in some quarters), I want
</I>&gt;<i> everyone on the planet to have voted to approve this first.  Your way,
</I>&gt;<i> any enterprising &quot;ecoregion&quot; can take the ball and run with it because
</I>&gt;<i> there *is* no global government...
</I>
No, again, you're stuck in the mentality that governance has to be geography-based, and that decisions are limited to geographies. I propose that public decisions should be open to everyone. A home owners association or a nonprofit group can have limits to participation, since they have a franchise, but public decisions should have no limit to participation at all.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for what percentage of the voting population equals consensus; that's answered in my other post. If voting is iterative, then you know you have consensus when most voters agree... and also that that agreement holds for a while. If a proposal is about to go into effect, more people will hear about it and can easily prevent it if they disagree. So there's no hard number. It's a process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I got the supermajority rule from your previous posts, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still missing the termination condition.  How do you know when you're
</I>&gt;<i> done?  And see my other post asking about the time burden you're
</I>&gt;<i> willing to impose on people...
</I>
The way we set it up in our working case on the Metagov website
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
is that no decision is final until a consensus has held for a week. That can be tweaked for the scale of the decision: it's just a working idea for now. The idea is to give enough time for people to notice, react, and break the consensus if necessary. I'll answer the rest in the other thread.
