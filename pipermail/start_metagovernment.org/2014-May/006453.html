<PRE>Spent a few hours up at the CU library researching open vs secret
ballots (it's so nice to be able to just download and read PDFs rather
than having to search the stacks for bound journals, many of which end
up not being where they're supposed to be!)

Most of the research in this area in the last 20 years concerns
corruptions like vote buying and voter intimidation in third world
countries.  Most of the rest concerns byzantine methods for ensuring
vote privacy/anonymity/reliability in electronic voting machines
and/or internet voting. The  bulk of the research in this area seems
to have been done in the 50s and 60s as a result of the civil rights
movement and it feels kind of like a backwater now, none of the above
being really relevant to our current projects.

I did find a handful of recent articles that do relate, however, and
all of them roughly support my contention that public voting will be
acceptable for our systems (see references below, and I can send PDFs
of any/all of them to anyone who wants them):

1) I'd completely forgotten about caucuses, which are used in
primaries in many states (including Colorado).  I went to one a few
years ago and found it to be a bizarre and uncomfortable experience,
with people having to move around the room to express their support
for particular candidates.  I'd *much* rather vote on-line using a
screen name than ever have to ever do that again (although I've since
unaffiliated myself with any party and so guess I don't have to worry
about that anymore ;-)

2) More than half of people already freely share their voting position
with others (70 percent were willing to do this in one study).  Half
also already don't believe their ballots are truly secret and that
anyone who really wanted to could match ballots to individuals, this
being particularly a concern for mail-in voting which is becoming
increasingly common.  One paper even noted the surge in &quot;voting
parties&quot;, where people gather to discuss the issues and fill out their
mail-in ballots together.  I've participated in these myself and it's
a *way* more comfortable experience than caucuses are.

3) The people who were most interested in keeping ballots secret turn
out to be the people who are least informed about the issues and so
who would most benefit from public discussion and voting.  None of the
articles mention this, but of course I'm inclined to think that many
or most authoritarians are going to also fall in this category, prone
as they are to vote based on prejudice rather than informed opinion.

4) Although the canard about feeling coerced if you hold a minority
position is brought up (primarily fear of retribution from employers
or customers) by some subjects, no research evidence was provided that
this a fear grounded in fact.  They also don't point out that it is
the #3 people most likely to fit in this category, nor address my
earlier point about it being authoritarians who are most likely to be
on both sides of this dynamic if indeed it ever occurs.  So the best
example I can come up with is still Brendan Eich, who had to step down
as CEO of Mozilla after being exposed as a contributor to the anti-gay
marriage prop 8 in California.  Although he and many of his supporters
claim he is a victim, after some debate my brother and I agreed that
this was more an example of Karma, Eich being the guy who invented
Javascript and there just *had* to be some sort of Karmic retribution
for that ;-)

So, again, I believe we can dispense with the entire issue of secret
balloting (and of course as a result the vast majority of the
authentication issues) and instead concentrate on writing PR for why
open voting is the superior design.  The Metagovernment site being an
ideal repository for that material...

    Scott
