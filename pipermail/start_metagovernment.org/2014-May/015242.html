<PRE>it's been my experience that great software, especially great
*new* software, is not developed by teams or by collecting bits and
pieces from other projects but instead usually by a single person with
a vision. 

&gt;&gt;<i> I believe the developers, artists, and engineers who work at *Valve* would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wholeheartedly disagree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure they would, and actually would be willing to bet you that
</I>&gt;<i> most of their projects start out this way.  
</I>
&#8220;this way&#8221;&#8230;.being what?   An individual comes up with a plan for reorganizing the entire structure of the socialized world, develops a software program to provide a method of global collaboration, pushes the *start* button and presto&#8230;.the world begins to self-organize into a civil and sustainable society?   That would be cool.   I wish you would get on with it.   ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> There is a certain irony to the theory that software designed to facilitate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaboration could not be successfully created in a collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment.   Just saying!  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of&#8230;..this is similar to a software development organization,
</I>&gt;<i> with an &quot;Engineering Dominator&quot; doing their own thing to get
</I>&gt;<i> the job done rather than sitting in interminable design meetings.       
</I>
Well, we seem to be having those anyway.   
We might as well get something done while we&#8217;re at it.   :-)

&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
</I>
All the best,
Steve
