&gt;<i> Below is a list of some proposed changes to Loomio&#8230;.(from their website).

</I>&gt;<i> Scott Raney asked if anybody had &quot;checked out Loomio&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>

I should watch that too, but until they fix their email digest (which,
curiously, is not even on their feature-request list) it's not a practical
option for me (their current email sends you a note every day *regardless*
of whether anything has changed!)


&gt;<i> I like what they're doing and am wondering if there is some (sensible)
</I>&gt;<i> reason why we're not currently using Loomio for some of the discussions

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because no one is leading the charge ;-)


&gt;<i> Seems like it could be helpful to organize our conversations and any
</I>&gt;<i> proposals that might get off the ground.
</I>&gt;<i> And maybe we could help them out as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There's nothing like actually using a system to get some ideas of what you
like and don't like, so again I suggest that we do at least do *something*
with Loomio even if it's just a group experiment on one or two proposals.

Thanks for posting this update!
  Regards,
     Scott
