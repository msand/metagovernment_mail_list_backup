Maybe, or maybe I'm a realist and you're just being naive ;-)

</I>
Ah, that would be evidence in favor of the second hypothesis ;-)

But it's actually easier than that: Remember that that 30% (or
hopefully less) are more fearful and more motivated and yet less
ethical than the rest and as a result are capable of (and actually
quite effective at) manipulating the rest of us, many of whom have
their own &quot;issues&quot; that allow this.

Now who's pessimistic?  My proposal is not about &quot;spotting&quot; them, it's
about sorting/filtering the input so you seldom run into the
problematic or just useless stuff, regardless of its source.
Sometimes Social Dominators and Authoritarians *do* have useful things
to contribute.  It's probably relatively uncommon, particularly for
those who have decided to take the full-on troll tactic, but it still
happens often enough that our best tool is sorting/filtering based on
the content itself rather than on the producer.

Open Annotation looks like a bunch of smart people with good ideas,
but a slick video does not a revolution make.  If they get some
traction then that system can certainly be integrated with ours.  But
IMHO they have misidentified the real problem and have given up on
public voting in favor of privacy and anonymity (which is what
authoritarians want and in fact *need* to maintain their control), so
they're working with one hand tied behind their backs and my
predictions is that they're therefore unlikely to amount to much.

&gt;<i> Nevertheless here is some aspect that goes beyond being authoritarian or
</I>&gt;<i> liberal or what ever we may be labeled.
</I>&gt;<i> I read some article about this new research into human psychology
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TpRItKtamw</A>  Probably we need to enforce some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of genetic DNA test to find the extreme-ist character and enforce a
</I>&gt;<i> karma handicap in online voting!
</I>
Yeah, but that would be an authoritarian tactic and so unfortunately
is not available to us.  Fortunately there's a whole world of this
sort of psychological information available to us to use in designing
a system that works without explicitly discriminating against
anyone...
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: Finished with Django and have ruled that out, and am now knee-deep
in revIgniter which is a LiveCode clone of codeIgniter, a PHP
framework.  The more of these things I look at, the more they all
start to look the same.  They're all basically doing the same things
the same way and yet are all much harder to learn and harder to use
than they need to be.  Part of this is that they're also a lot more
general purpose than what I need so the path forward is starting to
reveal itself to me: It seems it doesn't really matter which framework
I use since I'm probably only going to use a fraction of what it
offers and now that I've got the lay of the land I can pick and port
whichever bits I need from those other frameworks if they're not
already available in the one I end up using.  Taking this &quot;machete
mode&quot; route is going to make *me* a lot more productive at the cost of
maybe making it a bit harder for experts on my base framework to pitch
in and help.  But I don't see them lining up anytime soon and given
the cross-framework competition I'm seeing creating a &quot;catholic&quot; route
like this might actually make it easier for zealots for other
frameworks to pitch in because they won't have to cross enemy lines...

&gt;<i> Kind Regards
