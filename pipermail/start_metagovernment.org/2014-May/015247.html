&gt;<i> Clicking on the 'tweet' opens up the proposal which is separated into

</I>
Ah, got it.  In which case I only disagree with the 140 character
limit, which is too long to fit on one line.  Slashdot only allows 45
characters in a subject line, but I note that when they &quot;greek&quot; a post
what they do is show the first line of it rather than the subject
line...

&gt;<i> Making a proposal should be a lot of work for the proposer. Some proposals
</I>&gt;<i> will be quite long but this method structures the proposal into a familiar
</I>&gt;<i> format for everyone to easily view and digest the material.
</I>
Good, this is the important part.  I want the actual legal part
available, but even if it's written as clearly and concisely as it
could possibly be, it's still going to be too hard for most people to
understand both because of the specificity and the lack of context.
Which is why there actually has to be 3 different versions of the
proposal available, a 1-line subject, a human-friendly synopsis
including links to references (could be several pages), and the actual
text of the bill which will probably range from a few sentences up to
a page or so.

&gt;<i> Again you got me wrong, I'm not suggesting a reputation system. Each post
</I>&gt;<i> should be scored independently, unrelated to a users past successes.
</I>
Agreed, I apparently confounded the meta-information about when a
proposal was ready to be voted with attaching specific information to
posts.  I think the past success stuff *is* useful to have for
filtering and maybe when searching for a good proxy, but it shouldn't
be used for any default (unfiltered) presentation of the posts.

&gt;<i> Perhaps a user could have a viewable rank of how well they generally score
</I>&gt;<i> but the score should not be a determining factor in their positioning for
</I>&gt;<i> each of their comments.
</I>
Unless the user wants to do that: I've written up my first draft of
the database schema and it will support filtering based not only on
tags on the actual post, but tags on the user who created it.  We'll
just have to see how it works before deciding whether or not to keep
it.

&gt;<i> How to rank the comments is another aspect I've given thought to but didn't
</I>&gt;<i> dive into here because as you said, I didn't want to take on too much.
</I>
Bring it on!

&gt;<i> Hope this clears things up.
</I>
Thanks, it seems like we're on the same page anyway.
  Regards,
    Scott
