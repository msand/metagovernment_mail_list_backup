<PRE>Hi Pietro and Michael,
 
maybe you're right both? I believe it is very unlikely to get any consensus on topics such as e-democracy platforms. It's a strange phenomenon that I didn't meet any person who only basically agreed with me how to build such a platform. On the other hand, we won't approximate to our goal without having any consensus how to cooperate.
 
So, what about some kind of consensus about a &quot;meta&quot; strategy?
 
1) We might create a network connecting various platforms - this is the approach of our AG-MFT.
2) How about a programming library commonly used to join forces?
3) I think we should try to divide our problem &quot;E-Governance&quot; into smaller problems.
4) ..???
 
Regards, Paul
