<PRE>Hi Steve,

&gt;<i> I have some questions about PROPOSAL 1: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What constitutes acceptance of this proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> -  What is the requisite quorum to pass this proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> -  What is the requisite percentage of that quorum to pass this proposal?
</I>
Traditionally it's just a rough consensus reached through discussion,
with Ed moderating.  (Looks like I'm standing in for Ed, temporarily.)
So that means no quorum (1's enough) and we talk about objections and
try to get the largest consensus possible.

Alternatively, Ed said this rule now applies:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
I disagree.  I was wrong to say the rule makes no sense (I figured it
out eventually) but it wasn't passed correctly in the first place, so
it isn't in force.  If it *was*, then there'd be no quorum (again, 1
person's enough) and it would take a 66% majority held continuously
for 1 week in order to pass.

So it's pretty much the same, either way.

&gt;<i> If this proposal passes, would you be willing to establish a sunset
</I>&gt;<i> on the length of the discussion?
</I>
That isn't for me to decide.  If discussions were ever forbidden, then
it would have to be the administrator (Ed) who decides that, and he'd
almost certainly defer the decision to the group.

&gt;<i> I think this is a great place to start. Thanks Michael.
</I>
You're welcome, Steve.  Maybe it could eventually lead to the long
delayed &quot;start&quot; that the list was created for.  But I promised myself
I wouldn't be getting too deeply involved in any more start attempts.
So hopefully Ed will return before long, or someone else will take
over the moderation role till he does.

Mike
