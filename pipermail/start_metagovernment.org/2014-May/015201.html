Budgeting is a big one for me: There needs to be a separate system
where budget items are shown and you can move them up or down to
prioritize them rather than only being able to vote yes or no.

Got in.  Not sure if you want bug reports, but I'm using the current
version of Chrome and had problems with:
1) Nice intro tutorial, but it's in Italian and google translate never
gives an option to translate it.
2) &quot;Write and show contributions&quot; is broken (can't write, and the
display is mucked up).
3) Doesn't update the &quot;groups&quot; menu at the top when I joined the
metagovernment group.

I'm also curious about the &quot;Maturity&quot; concept. Can you explain how that works?
  Regards,
    Scott
