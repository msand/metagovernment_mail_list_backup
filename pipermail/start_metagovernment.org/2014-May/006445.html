<PRE>An area that we might be able to reach some agreement on, an important part
of any functioning system in the least and one that I think deserves some
attention.



Some basic statements that have been discussed already, hopefully we all
agree with this stuff:


- Complete consensus is ideal but unrealistic in a lot of situations, it is
something however we should strive for. Significant approval for a proposal
should be reached before being moved to the voting stage.


- If there is overwhelming criticism against a certain proposal that cannot
be addressed or countered it should not be capable of getting to the voting
stage, the proposal should just fall off.


- A proposal should be able to be restructured to allow for the most
accurate and updated information to be included in the proposal before
going to a voting stage.




Now, my idea of a structured discussion forum is to keep it as simple and
organized as possible to allow easy access and understanding of topics. For
a bare bones look of what the overall structure might resemble refer to my
website www.theinternetswebsite.com I'll attempt to spell it out here
though in better detail.


- Some guy has a case for a change in the world. He creates a title, some
140 character synopsis of his proposal and posts it to the site.


- This proposal is one of many, it sits in a list of proposals on the
website and fluctuates in ranking based on its popularity.


- Proposals are weighed to consistently highlight a few projects at a time
so the bulk of the community is drawn to those areas to aid in the process
of working through them.


- Click on a proposal synopsis and you're taken to the expanded proposal,
where a more detailed account is presented in point form. Again, each point
is a synopsis of 140 characters or something.


- Each point can be clicked and expanded to reveal addition information,
references and sources.


- This creates an easily viewable breakdown of the project.


- Replies to the proposal, can be either addressing the entire project or
can be for a specific point.


- Replies can be either adding or objecting to specific areas of the
proposal. The distinction can be made upon clicking the reply button.


- The reply, like the proposal, has a title (140 characters) along with
related points if necessary.


- Replies fall under the original posters points. There is a column for
adding to the point and a column for objecting to the point


- These replies too are subject to the weighting formula that ensures the
most popular relies are highlighted to focus the discussion.


- Replies can be made to replies expanding the chain of debate down as far
as users are willing to go.


- A reply that's an objection should be addressed by the supporters of the
original post and attempt to work out differences and reach a compromise.


- If this compromise to the objection gains favorable support it can then
be moved into the original proposal as a stipulation, should the proposal
go to the voting stage.


- The objectionable post title is moved and presented as another point in
the proposal. It's replies are all transferred with it. This way nothing
get's edited or twisted, the exact content remains intact.


- This adding of objections along with compromise goes towards the overall
participation requirement of the proposal.


- Any unique user who supported the objection has now had a say in the
final product and their input counts as participating in the crafting of
the project.


- The same can be applied to replies that add to the proposal, minus the
need of a compromise.


- Proposals need to reach a minimum participation level before going to the
voting stage. Which will most likely have to include a number of additions
and corrections to the original proposal.


- Time should be another aspect of proposals going to the voting stage, the
larger in scale the proposal, the longer the time frame necessary.


- A popcorn analogy works here. As long as there is significant activity on
the proposal it should not go to the voting stage, allow time for all the
kernels to pop up and make noise.


- Once a proposal is ready to go the voting stage it should be cleaned up
to include any alterations that have been agreed upon in the discussion
process. It should be presented in a clear and concise manner with all
information being available should the voter wish to know more.


- Upon voting I think it would be a good idea to include a comment section
where voters can express their opinions on why they voted a certain way.
This is to allow an outlet for pure opinion rather than encouraging it
during the discussion process. The discussion process should attempt to be
as fact based as possible.


- Criticism that does not get properly addressed or countered in the
discussion process cannot be added to the proposal and does not count as
participation points, they remain the top criticism even if the proposal
does manage to make it to the voting stage anyway.



I hope I have explained this articulately enough, any confusion or
questions happy to clear up.

Much love.
