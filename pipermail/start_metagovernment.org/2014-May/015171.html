<PRE>Ed vs Scott or viceversa are inconciliable  and very interesting aspects.
But one definitive outcome is that different voting system should be
applied for different type of issues. I believe we should concentrate on
this aspect and look for specific solution.
We can confine ourselves in a single system
In Airesis is possible to make discussion in anonymous mode.
Today i decided to open a *metagovernment *group on Airesis and invite all
of you to participate.
I really have a hard time follow the discussion on the ML... is a personal
handicap!
I hope all of you can participate, I will have the system invite you
automatically.
Peace

&gt;<i> Scott, to answer both of your scenarios below (climate change and defense
</I>&gt;<i> spending) my answer is that government shouldn't be operating on the scale
</I>&gt;<i> that it is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> New-style governments (the ones I'm hoping to see us foster) won't be
</I>&gt;<i> deciding on defense spending, because that is a issue of a national
</I>&gt;<i> government. What point is there in having national governments? They are
</I>&gt;<i> just political artifacts that have little to do with natural geography or
</I>&gt;<i> ethnicity as much as they have to do with kingdoms and their legacies. A
</I>&gt;<i> government so vast that it decides the fate of hundreds of millions of
</I>&gt;<i> people is ludicrous. Maybe someday collaborative governance could operate
</I>&gt;<i> on that scale for the occasional question, but for the most part governance
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be for areas larger than an ecoregion or city... and usually for
</I>&gt;<i> much smaller, or more importantly less-geographically-specific communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative governance is a disruptive process, not a direct replacement
</I>&gt;<i> for the current systems. It is a system for use in communities of any kind:
</I>&gt;<i> geographic, common-interest, or common-mission. Those typically are not the
</I>&gt;<i> scale of large nations; nor do they need to make decisions rashly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Issues like climate change are more nuanced. All of the above applies
</I>&gt;<i> there too (no gigantic governments making massive decisions), and so that
</I>&gt;<i> opens up a lot more flexibility and nimbleness. Smaller groups can come up
</I>&gt;<i> with innovative plans that make progress against climate change without
</I>&gt;<i> having to get everyone's buy-in. Compare that to what we have now. We have
</I>&gt;<i> very high scientific consensus about climate change, and national
</I>&gt;<i> governments are doing next to nothing about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for what percentage of the voting population equals consensus; that's
</I>&gt;<i> answered in my other post. If voting is iterative, then you know you have
</I>&gt;<i> consensus when most voters agree... and also that that agreement holds for
</I>&gt;<i> a while. If a proposal is about to go into effect, more people will hear
</I>&gt;<i> about it and can easily prevent it if they disagree. So there's no hard
</I>&gt;<i> number. It's a process.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Breaking this issue out again, since I think I'm still not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understanding the approach of Ed (et al):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to
</I>&gt;<i> force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not
</I>&gt;<i> for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the
</I>&gt;<i> people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let's take climate change as a sample issue: Do you believe that if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can't get consensus, or at least a 2/3 majority, that the government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should take no action on addressing it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or defense spending:  If 1/3 of the population wants a strong national
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defense, do they have a right to enforce that status quo on the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2/3s, even when we now *know* (based on research on SDAs) that that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1/3 is primarily made up of people who have provably irrational
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought processes on the subject?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, please address the relationship between &quot;consensus&quot; and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; percentage of the total population who vote.  Is it consensus when 1/3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the population agrees on something but the other 2/3 don't even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; express an opinion?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Scott
