    concepts we'd like to see covered on the new home page.

Excellent! Here are mine (modeled after Scott's):

   1. Electing individuals to any governance office of any kind is
      inherently corrupt because of the money required/allowed to
      campaign for those offices.
   2. Vesting power to make public-matter decisions in any office or
      private individual is inherently dangerous to the general
      population because authoritarians, who are instinctively
      prejudiced against and aggressive toward those they consider
      outsiders, gravitate towards filling *ANY* role that has such
      power vested in it.
   3. You (as an individual) are best suited to make the decisions
      regarding which particular public-matter decisions you will
      participate in making. It would be better for you (and for
      humanity) for you to retain that power to choose which decisions
      you will participate in making, rather than handing it over to
      *ANY* others (be they elected officials, capitalists, bankers,
      courts, bureaucracies, or whatever).
   4. The technology to run a direct democracy of more than a few dozen
      people simply did not exist even 20 years ago. But it does now,
      and the day when a sufficient percentage of the population is
      comfortable enough with it to run a government is rapidly
      approaching or in some places has already arrived.
   5. If we want a better global governance system, it's up to *us* to
      design, develop, test, demonstrate, popularize and then implement
      that better system because for damn sure our existing governments,
      corporations, capitalists and such are not going to do it for us.
