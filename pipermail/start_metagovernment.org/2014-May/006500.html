<PRE>So I know that a group decision was made and I was asked to move this to
another thread so I am. Let me give an example of what just happened here
in a different context. If you want to keep the decision as is that's okay,
but don't say I didn't warn you.

Lets imagine you are drilling for oil. You work on a plan as a company and
decide to move forward. Right before you start mining someone visits and
says, &quot;Hey you know, I have actually drilled there before and that angle
you chose will actually cause a bunch of damage to your equipment and cause
unforeseen losses. You might want to revisit.&quot; The group responds, &quot;well,
since we already decided we have to honor that decision so we are going to
drill anyway&quot;.

Really? I would ask anyone who has experience in this field to challenge me
on this. I just didn't want to sit back and say nothing.  And really, you
want to sit behind a group decision that went on for a week in light of new
information that should effect your decision? I would hope the group is
smarter than that. Again, if anyone has experience in this field I would
gladly hear from him.

And again, if you want to stick with it by all means do. If the group
want's to I will support that decision. I just hope we won't hide behind
the &quot;We have already decided, because we have already decided, and that is
the reason why we will do it&quot; when there is new information to consider.

Cheers,
James
