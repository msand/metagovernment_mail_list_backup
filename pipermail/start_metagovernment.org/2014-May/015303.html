Umm, I think you have this backwards: It's authoritarian to assume
that there *is* a leader.  I've always been told that this is an
&quot;ad-hocracy&quot; in which case whoever shows up is the right group to make
decisions like this.  And a week seems short to me too, which is why I
proposed two weeks as a deadline.  But we're not going to make that
either unless more of you step up to voice your opinion on what
statements the home page should contain...

</I>
I've no problem with professional courtesy and definitely empathize
with his situation (I've got an ailing mother myself and am currently
embroiled in the nursing home vs home-care debate and decision and so
know that it is a very difficult, timeconsuming, and emotionally
draining process).  But I'll repeat my statement from my first post:
This group and this project is occupying very valuable mind-share and
so we have an *obligation* to make good use of it and if sometimes
that means forging ahead without our full complement that is
unfortunately what we must do.  Now that this process has started and
the home page is already down, let's go ahead and finish it with the
implied consensus that when Ed (or whoever) wants to revisit it we
will do that.

So, back to the big question, what is *your* current vision of what
this project is about?
  Regards,
    Scott
