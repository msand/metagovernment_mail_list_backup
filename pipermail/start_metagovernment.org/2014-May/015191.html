<PRE>Hi Scott,

&gt;<i> &gt; I don't think so: As far as I can see, there are cryptographic possibilities such as public-key cryptography to ensure an unique pseudonym but on the other hand to hide the relationships for everyone not owning a supercomputer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, this deals with hackers (or the government) snooping on the
</I>&gt;<i> communication lines, but not those who hack into the main database or
</I>&gt;<i> employees of the organization running the servers.  There *must* be a
</I>&gt;<i> screen-name to individual mapping kept someplace to ensure that people
</I>&gt;<i> don't just create bogus accounts to commit voter fraud.
</I>
Just a raw example. You want to register on such a platform. There will, of course, be some procedure to check whether you are a real person. After that, you receive a one-time key to sign up. When doing this, the script creates your account and saves to the database that you already have an account. But there needs not to be a connection or mapping in the database between these two files! This is only necessary for registration and won't be available later.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's really a very important point. Looking on a bigger time span, in fact almost every pseudonym will be assignable to the underlaying real identity. This already happens by the fact that someone may want to promote one's contribution in offline life to other people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and as I've been saying all along, there is no real need for
</I>&gt;<i> this sort of privacy/anonymity, and most people (especially young
</I>&gt;<i> people) are simply not as concerned about it as some people raised in
</I>&gt;<i> an environment where totalitarianism was common (like us old farts).
</I>
Well, but that should be no reason for us (me?). Privacy/anonymity (P/A) can be important even if nobody cares about it.

&gt;<i> Sure, this registry would be a favorite tool of the likes of
</I>&gt;<i> Stalin/Hitler/Mao, but the point is that our primary goal has to be to
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that no one like that ever comes to power again. If we achieve
</I>&gt;<i> that, being able to tell who voted how is no more a threat to people's
</I>&gt;<i> freedom than asking them to sign petitions, speak at a city council
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, or meet with their neighbors to organize a block party.
</I>
It is.

1) Talking to somebody is no piece of data remaining available for a nearly unlimited time. (Well, as long as there's no CCTV.)
2) It is also no piece of data available for many people.

The contrary is true for a public online discussion! Some militant group *could* exist also in the USA or in Europe. I think, it's not the fact now, but if it's the fact in ten or twenty years, data are still available. There is always some risk and nobody knows the world of tomorrow.

I also still don't know the best approach, but I think we still have to discover it. I don't think, voting should be influenced by any social effects because it's just an atmospheric picture of the people. Social effects could be useful in discussion to avoid Spam or trolling, but not during voting, electing etc.

There are many proposed ideas to solve the problem but all are not optimal. There are filtering (user-based, crowd-based, moderator-based), public voting and more (and combinations of these).

Regards,
Paul
