<PRE>(I table proposal 1 and ask if anyone disagrees.  I also answer Ed.)

There is strong disagreement about the home page, and maybe strong
feelings too.  But here are several things I think we can agree on:

   * Ed owns the mailing list and wiki.  He pays the bills himself and
     largely does the upkeep himself.  Ed is therefore free to do
     anything he likes with the list and wiki, and to write anything
     he likes on the home page.

   * Nobody here (neither Ed nor anyone else) wants to see a home page
     that's false, misleading or otherwise dishonest.

   * The current home page is false and misleading.  It makes claims
     that are clearly untrue, and implies that we and others have
     reached agreement on goals etc, where actually we have not.

Let's not blame Ed.  He consistently favours group consensus and shows
personal integrity in his actions.  But since the issue has come up,
let's address it.  I have 2 proposals:


   PROPOSAL 1
   ----------
   Blank the home page and insert the following:

      Owing to a dispute, the content of the home page is currently
      under discussion.  &lt;link to discussion thread&gt;

   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.


   PROPOSAL 2  (after 1)
   ----------
   Let's *also* add this to the home page, since it's clearly true and
   useful information:

      Metagovernment is a discussion group.  &lt;link to archive&gt;

   Again, this follows Bentley's suggestion, except I remove the
   reference to &quot;collaborative governance&quot; since it's misleading.
   That's not primarily what's discussed here.  So let's leave the
   topic of discussion for other proposals to settle.


   PROPOSAL [your number here]  (after 1)
   ---------------------------
   Other things can be added to the home page, of course.  Let's
   therefore hear people's proposals and talk about them.


Ed said:
&gt;<i> ... Defining what function something has at this moment limits what
</I>&gt;<i> it is able to be.  Do we want to be nothing but a discussion group?
</I>
Who knows?  But if we want to become something more (say X) then we
might say so.  We'd ensure that (i) we actually *do* agree to X, and
(ii) we clarify that X is what we want to be, not what we already are.
We might also say (iii) what resources we think are necessary to reach
X, and (iv) which of these we have and which we're missing.  All of
this information would be helpful and useful, provided (of course)
that it's true.

We certainly don't want to imply that we're already X when we're not.
That would verge on fraud.  It would also repel the very people who
might help us reach X.

&gt;<i> If we're discussing modification of the home page, please note that
</I>&gt;<i> these rules apply: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>
I'm afraid that rule is invalid.  It makes no sense (majority of who?
voting how?  Votorola is not designed for decision purposes).
Moreover it wasn't properly passed in the first place, and has no
current consensus.  Therefore I suggest we fall back to the original
decision rule, which is a rough consensus moderated by you, Ed.  It
always worked well in the past and it makes sense, especially as
you're the one with power over the list and wiki.  (If you're
temporarily busy, then someone trustworthy can stand in till you're
free.  You can always undo any changes later, as you prefer.)

In any case, does anyone disagree with proposal 1 above?

Mike

&gt;<i> I am in the middle of two crises and cannot catch up on my reading in this list right now, but I strongly disagree with this proposal. Defining what function something has at this moment limits what it is able to be. Do we want to be nothing but a discussion group? Should we delete the wiki? Should we stop participating in each others' projects?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the very least, I would change &quot;discussion group&quot; to &quot;community,&quot; as it opens the door for other forms of community. Additionally, this group has performed and continues to perform functions as a testbed for projects to experiment on. Michael, you can say that hasn't worked for you, but we have used Votorola (very successfully!) to come up with the rules for defining the home page, we have also used Vilfredo and Candiwi to come to decisions, as well as some other platforms on occasion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, the wiki does perform functions outside of what you may know. It gets a fair amount of traffic (see the footer of any page), is linked to from ~10 pages in Wikipedia (which is huge), and the lists of active/related projects have potential to evolve into a really great resource (something that I would love to work on, and would encourage others to improve).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, the purpose of a home page should be to inform people about what the group/project/community/whatever is about: why we exist, what the mission is. If we're going to change the home page, I'd rather it be to something like the elevator pitch:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>
</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps with some modification to the second sentence.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry I cannot participate more at this time. If we're discussing modification of the home page, please note that these rules apply:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Maybe a better summary would be &quot; Metagovernment is a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; group about tools that enable collaborative governance.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that would be an improvement.  It's more honest.  So I suggest we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replace the home page with just that sentence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PROPOSAL
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Following on Bentley's suggestion, I propose that we replace the home

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Metagovernment is a discussion group about tools that enable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   collaborative governance.  &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anyone disagree with this proposal?  Does anyone have an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternative proposal for the home page?
