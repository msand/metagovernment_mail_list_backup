IMHO, this is not a viable option.  I'll confess to being old-school,
but it's been my experienced that great software, especially great
*new* software, is not developed by teams or by collecting bits and
pieces from other projects but instead usually by a single person with
a vision.  Once a project has been *released* and established itself
as a useful tool something like open source (or a corporate
development team) can take over and polish it up to its potential, but
if you introduce that too soon you end up with the &quot;too many cooks&quot;
problem and the project is doomed to failure as a result of
featuritis/scope creep or sometimes even simple politics.

For my part when I get stuck on something I'll surely bring it up
here, and my project will be open source so that eventually it may be
possible to integrate good ideas (or even good code) from other
projects into it.  But I would not even be willing to pitch in on the
Loomio or Airesis projects because their vision simply doesn't jibe
with mine.

As for what I'd like to see the list members working on, I'd still
like to get more research on the issue of secret ballots vs open
voting, feedback on what people think about how those other systems
actually work, determining the workload we can actually expect voters
to take on, or gathering any other high-level parameter-setting
information *all* of these projects will need to have.
  Regards,
    Scott
