Fortunately a lot of the groundwork is already being laid by other
people, intentionally or not.  I figure it's more like surfing than
software engineering: We can't predict when the straw that will break
the camel's back will come or even what form it will take, we just
have to have a plan ready so that when that last straw comes it will
be our system that gets implemented instead of one by another
Lenin/Hitler/Mao/etc.  I've read their works and their biographies and
am sure they've got nothing on us (though Mao in particular was almost
supernaturally lucky not to have been killed at a dozen different
points before he had amassed enough power to take out all of his
enemies).  I'm also pretty sure at this point that a willingness to
kill large numbers of people is not even a requirement for the
revolution itself, but merely an unfortunate side effect of the
personalities of the people who typically end up leading them.

You joke about The Plan, but I note that *all* of the problems that
brought low Zuckerberg's Newark education reform project ($100 million
apparently down the tubes) are specifically addressed and robustly
solved in The Plan (bad schools, bad parenting, rent-seeking unions,
authoritarian behavior, etc.). If you didn't see this, the New Yorker
article is a good (albeit very long) read:
<A HREF="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/05/19/140519fa_fact_russakoff?currentPage=all">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/05/19/140519fa_fact_russakoff?currentPage=all</A>

I also note that the Facebook motto of &quot;Done is better than perfect&quot;
is prominently mentioned in that article, a motto I happen to agree
with although Newark I think shows that &quot;done&quot; sometimes doesn't
happen unless the plan is a lot closer to &quot;perfect&quot;.  This I guess is
common ground between Ed and I.

&gt;<i> There is a certain irony to the theory that software designed to facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration could not be successfully created in a collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> environment.   Just saying!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of&#8230;..this is similar to a software development organization,
</I>&gt;<i> with an &quot;Engineering Dominator&quot; doing their own thing to get
</I>&gt;<i> the job done rather than sitting in interminable design meetings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, we seem to be having those anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> We might as well get something done while we&#8217;re at it.   :-)
</I>
Yeah, I've got a database designed and built and stuff up on the
screen, so that's something.  I have also decided to do the prototype
as an app (cross platform, of course) rather than as a web site.  We
can port it later, but I've discovered by studying the stuff being
output by Netflix/Amazon/Slashdot etc. that it takes a order of
magnitude (or sometimes two) more code to do something in a web page
than doing it in an app built in a high-level language.  This will
free up time for that language thing: I've been lurking on the
constructed languages mailing lists for a couple months now, and
although it's looking like more &quot;cat herding&quot;, there is a hunger there
for something other than the usual fantasy-world languages most of
them seem to be working on...
  Regards,
    Scott
