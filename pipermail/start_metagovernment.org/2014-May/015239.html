I'm not sure they would, and actually would be willing to bet you that
most of their projects start out this way.  Google too has a formal
system in place where engineers are supposed to spend 20% of their
time doing their own thing in hopes that they'll come up with a
prototype for a product that can then be put into a full-fledged
development queue.  Valve's system has the advantage that it is
dynamically scalable (unlike most companies, where projects tend to
get managed to within an inch of their lives), but I've read that
employee guide and although that gives us insight into how the system
works in principle, it'd probably take a social or organizational
psychologist a year or more to actually understand and write up how it
works in practice (it'd be a great PhD topic!).  I'd predict that
Valve projects start out just like our voting projects have (and I
would say must), with one person with a vision working on an actual
prototype and a bunch of others kibitzing to help them through the
hard parts.

&gt;<i> There is a certain irony to the theory that software designed to facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration could not be successfully created in a collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> environment.   Just saying!  :-)
</I>
Sort of, but I deal with this in the book in several places: There is
a place for Social Dominators in the executive branch of government,
just not in the legislative branch.  This is similar to a software
development organization, with an &quot;Engineering Dominator&quot; doing their
own thing to get the job done rather than sitting in interminable
design meetings  We need both branches and they need to be distinct
and the fact that they serve different purposes is not a contradiction
or flaw (although it may be as you say an example of irony).
  Regards,
    Scott
