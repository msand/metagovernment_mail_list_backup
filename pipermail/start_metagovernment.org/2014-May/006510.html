<PRE>Sigh.  I did not participate in the discussion or in the vote because I did
not want to dignify the proceeding by my participation.  So try to reflect
on a  system that would have allowed Ed to halt the proceedings for a few
months until his personal issues allowed him to fully participate.  I am
irritable.  I have also decided independently rationality here about is in
fact a negative.

Under RRO Ed could have at least rose to a point of personal privilege and
gotten a vote on postponment.  As I say, I am irritated.  It is not that I
did not know that this operation was bad news.  I do believe that my
correct action is to block this list and feel better as a result.

Bye
