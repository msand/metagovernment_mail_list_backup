<PRE>Again: I oppose (reason given in the other email)
Reason in short: Current Process on massive scale will always have some
proposals somewhere which &quot;time out&quot; before everyone had the chance to
review them, but as soon as negative effects arise, its up to them to argue
and create a counter proposal and gather voters to build a counter
consensus which has to be valid for a week to make it happen.

Although technically currently not feasable, given a large scale of the
process, i could imagine rules which prevent certain proposals from being
raised at all and where &quot;the system&quot; would feedback which rules these are,
so that before those certain proposals are being made, there first has to
be a proposal to change the &quot;proposal preventing rule&quot; or alternatively
phrase the proposal to being made in a way, so that its not blocked  by the
system.

</I>&gt;<i> should come up with a time span that must pass before a decision should be

</I>&gt;<i> than it can move forward before that time comes.

</I>&gt;<i> Most of us while passionate and have valuable ideas also have to maintain

</I>&gt;<i> hear the opinion of someone who might make a difference. Or at least give
</I>&gt;<i> them enough time to respond. Rushing decisions leads to poor decisions with
</I>&gt;<i> not all the facts and unforeseen problems as a result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would allow us to move at a pace we all agree while giving people the
</I>&gt;<i> chance to chime in if they have important information. To have been so sick
</I>&gt;<i> you can't read for a week to be told that sorry you missed the boat on a
</I>&gt;<i> time limit you didn't even agree to seems unfair. To have agreed upon
</I>&gt;<i> a limit that you then miss knowing that your voice won't be heard after
</I>&gt;<i> that time seems fair. No &quot;I turned the way for a moment&quot; and boom I have no
</I>&gt;<i> say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If agreed to the concept we can work together on establishing a minimum
</I>&gt;<i> time limit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also we would need to agree on the definition of the size of the list. As
</I>&gt;<i> well as conditions that would put you as part of the group that must be
</I>&gt;<i> heard from before the minimum time limit is made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Input is appreciated.
