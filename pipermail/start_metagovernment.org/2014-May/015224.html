<PRE>Scott,
I'm appreciating the clarity you bring to these discussions. 

I've been on this list for several years and have learned so much reading the various posts, (and yet am still technically &quot;stupid&quot; as Max pointed out earlier) :-)~.  Nevertheless, I have a great passion for this emerging technology and I want to help in anyway I can. 

I'm often frustrated with the discussions that seemed to go round and round&#8230;.and then fade away.  I don't understand why, with all of the talent on this list, we're not collaborating on a specific project. 

I like what you've put together in &#8220;The Plan&#8221;.   As a platform for facilitating discussions and decision making, I like what Loomio has to offer, however simple or baseline it may be. 

My question is this: Would it be possible to merge various bits and pieces of code that individuals on this list have written onto a platform like Loomio or Airesis? Or stated differently:  Given all of the talent and passion available on this list, what would be possible if we were to collaborate with either one of those projects?

All the best,
Steve

&gt;<i> Rather than respond individually to a bunch of emails that seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> from people unhappy with some aspect of metagovernment or another, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to generally counter that IMHO the system is fine, it's people's
</I>&gt;<i> use and expectations that may need adjusting:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I've been through this forum/discussion system vs. email list many
</I>&gt;<i> times on many different lists and my conclusion has always been the
</I>&gt;<i> same: I prefer mailing lists, primarily because it shows up in my
</I>&gt;<i> inbox where I don't forget about it like I seem to always do with
</I>&gt;<i> forums.  Perhaps the best combination is what sites like slashdot and
</I>&gt;<i> quora have where they email you a digest every day with the best
</I>&gt;<i> threads of that day.  Not so good if you're going to be an active
</I>&gt;<i> participant in a news-related story (the conversations are stale by
</I>&gt;<i> the time you get to them) but great for a lurker, especially for
</I>&gt;<i> long-term design issues (which is what we're all working on here,
</I>&gt;<i> right?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The archives for the email list IMHO are always better than trying
</I>&gt;<i> to find old stuff on forum sites, although you do have to jump through
</I>&gt;<i> some hoops to use the Metagovernment list archives (e.g., using the
</I>&gt;<i> site: tag in Google search).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) If the volume of this list is too high, I'd recommend switching to
</I>&gt;<i> digest mode except for one thing: Most people don't properly trim
</I>&gt;<i> their posts.  Being a mailing-list junkie for 30 years it *still*
</I>&gt;<i> bothers me that people can't take 10 seconds to remove the unneeded
</I>&gt;<i> stuff from a message they're responding to.  The proper technique, as
</I>&gt;<i> practiced religiously back in the day for bandwidth reasons (and now
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for attention span reasons) is to leave one or two sentences
</I>&gt;<i> you're responding to, then put your response after that.  If this is
</I>&gt;<i> too much of a burden, please reconsider posting at all: If you can't
</I>&gt;<i> spend 10 seconds editing someone else's post down, do you really have
</I>&gt;<i> the time to compose a message that's truly worth cluttering up
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's inbox with?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I don't expect metagovernment to come up with the &quot;One True&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> on-line government system, or even to function as a &quot;recruiting&quot; tool.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm here because this is where a lot of bright people who've thought
</I>&gt;<i> a lot about the issues are.  Seems to me our role here is to ask
</I>&gt;<i> questions and point out potential flaws in other people's systems.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you're not working on a system, that's fine, just being a critic is a
</I>&gt;<i> valuable contribution.  But to be useful as a critic you've got to go
</I>&gt;<i> out and try out the systems (now Loomio and Airesis) to see what you
</I>&gt;<i> like and don't like about them, and be prepared to say why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) The name &quot;Metagovernment&quot; means a replacement government to me.
</I>&gt;<i> Which means any systems we come up with should be scalable to millions
</I>&gt;<i> or even billions of people.  I've nothing against decision support
</I>&gt;<i> systems for smaller groups, it's just that that's not what I'm here
</I>&gt;<i> for and not what I believe metagovernment.org was set up to discuss.
</I>&gt;<i> This again is why I believe sorting/filtering is *the* key issue in
</I>&gt;<i> any system design, and why I believe that none of the existing systems
</I>&gt;<i> (or even their prototypes) are even on the right path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) The Affero GPL license is the only thing any of us should accept
</I>&gt;<i> for any project we &quot;review&quot;.  Fortunately both Loomio and Airesis use
</I>&gt;<i> that, as will my project.
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
