<PRE>Steve, Marc and Reid, (cc Thomas)

Marc said:
&gt;<i> ... we should keep the current content, because this is based on a
</I>&gt;<i> former decision until we have a newer decision, isn't it??
</I>
No, I think the former decision wasn't valid.  Our common desire to
change the home page at the time was valid, but we did it improperly.
Thomas might disagree, but I think he'd change his mind if we spoke to
him about it.  I can explain more, if you like.

Speaking for myself, I vote to blank the page till we agree what to
put there.  The current content is false and misleading, and a blank
page is always better than a false page.

That's just my own opinion.  Please speak your mind, Marc.  I haven't
registered your vote, yet.

&gt;<i> I don't mind blanking the home page just so long as we come up with
</I>&gt;<i> things to put on it relatively quickly. ... If I was to come across
</I>&gt;<i> a homepage that just read &quot;Owing to a dispute, the content of the
</I>&gt;<i> home page is currently under discussion. ... &quot; I doubt I would be
</I>&gt;<i> inclined to explore further or get involved.
</I>
You agree with Steve and I that it shouldn't stay blank for long.  Ed
will agree too, I'm sure.  Together we'll ensure it gets some proper
content.  So I take your vote as 'Yes', for now.

You're right, the message is a little too off-putting, especially the
&quot;Owing to a dispute&quot; part.  Maybe we can just drop that?  And maybe we
should link to the whole archive, not to any particular thread; there
may be multiple threads.  These changes are relatively minor, so I
make them below.  Please speak if you disagree.


In summary, here's where we currently stand:

   PROPOSAL 1
   ----------
   Blank the home page and insert the following:

      The content of the home page is currently under discussion.
      &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;

   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike, Reid, Scott, Steve
   Against: (nobody)
