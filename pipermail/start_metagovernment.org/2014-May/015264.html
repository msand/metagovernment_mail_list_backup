<PRE>Hi Mike, and all ;o)

Mike said:
&gt;<i>Marc said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... we should keep the current content, because this is based on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> former decision until we have a newer decision, isn't it??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I think the former decision wasn't valid.  Our common desire to
</I>&gt;<i> change the home page at the time was valid, but we did it improperly.
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas might disagree, but I think he'd change his mind if we spoke to
</I>&gt;<i> him about it.  I can explain more, if you like.
</I>
IMHO there are two fundamental characteristics of
A decision
(1) is always valid, that means the decision itself holds even if the 
backing assumptions change
(2) should be in a flow, that means if the backing assumptions change, a new 
decision should be made

&gt;<i> Speaking for myself, I vote to blank the page till we agree what to
</I>&gt;<i> put there.  The current content is false and misleading, and a blank
</I>&gt;<i> page is always better than a false page.
</I>
Given the characteristics above, even if the content of the home page is not 
optimal (you said 'false and misleading'), it is better than nothing (blank 
page).

&gt;<i> That's just my own opinion.  Please speak your mind, Marc.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> registered your vote, yet.
</I>
Hence I'll vote for keeping the content until we decide for a better one and 
place a remark at the top of the home page stating that the content needs 
improvment and link to the discussion thread. It's a wiki.

&gt;<i> Reid said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't mind blanking the home page just so long as we come up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things to put on it relatively quickly. ... If I was to come across
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a homepage that just read &quot;Owing to a dispute, the content of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> home page is currently under discussion. ... &quot; I doubt I would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inclined to explore further or get involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You agree with Steve and I that it shouldn't stay blank for long.  Ed
</I>&gt;<i> will agree too, I'm sure.  Together we'll ensure it gets some proper
</I>&gt;<i> content.  So I take your vote as 'Yes', for now.
</I>
MIke, two questions on this:
(1) what's your definition of &quot;not for long&quot;?
(2) how would you like to &quot;ensure proper content&quot;?

Cheers
Marc
