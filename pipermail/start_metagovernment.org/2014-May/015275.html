<PRE>Responding here to external discussions, (cc Jacopo and Ned)

In &quot;(testing airesis platform)&quot;, Jacopo Tolja said:
&gt;<i> On the current ML voting my vote is NO because the subject is not
</I>&gt;<i> vital and the page can remain as is until a new one is
</I>&gt;<i> decided. Priority should be given to deciding the new content not on
</I>&gt;<i> blanking something not done well but somehow useful to get an idea.
</I>
Thanks Jacopo.  I think you speak of this blanking proposal, so I've
marked you down as a 'No'.

May I answer for my part?  I think it *is* vital.  People won't take
responsibility for a home page that doesn't belong to them, a home
page they can't identify with.  The only way to convincingly make it
*theirs* is to blank it, erasing the content they never agreed to and
handing it over to them.  Then they can start to care a little. *


In &quot;Closing in 24 hours&quot;, Steve Coffman said:
&gt;<i> Ned Conner agreed Except, I would suggest dropping &quot;Owing to a
</I>&gt;<i> dispute&quot;, unless you can link specifically to the dispute (in which
</I>&gt;<i> case, link specifically to the dispute).
</I>
Thanks Steve and Ned.  We've since dropped &quot;dispute&quot; from the wording.
Here's where we currently stand:


   PROPOSAL 1
   ----------
   Blank the home page and insert the following:

      The content of the home page is currently under discussion.
      &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;

   This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
   leaving the door open to further proposals and content.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------
       For: Mike, Ned, Reid, Scott, Steve
   Against: Jacopo, Marc



 * We tried to do something like that long ago, Ed, Christian and me.
   Here's the (not quite blank, but very simple) home page we agreed
   to: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>

   Now, by the decision rules that you and Marc (and Ed) say we should
   obey, that page should immediately become the new home page.  It's
   held a steady majority of 66% for something like 3 years now:
   <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho&amp;u=Ed-EdpastoreCom">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho&amp;u=Ed-EdpastoreCom</A>
   <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

   See?  But even back then, we'd begun to suspect that the decision
   process was invalid.  Our use of Votorola repelled people (such as
   Votorola's competitors) and prevented them participating, which is
   problematic in group that's supposed to be open to alternative
   solutions.  So I claim the formal decision rule and the current
   home page (both decided in this way) are both invalid.

   Anyway, now we're trying to fix things.
