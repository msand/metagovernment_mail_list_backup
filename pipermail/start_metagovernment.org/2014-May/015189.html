<PRE>Hi Michael,
when Metagov started the idea was to build a software. We started
discussing one that eventually became Candiwi. At about the same time some
of us (ma and Giovani) participated in a EU grant application. We did not
win the grant, but in this process the idea for Vilfredo goes to Athens
where born. So for some time there were two software. Then other software
started joining, and Metagov became a metagroup for various software. Most
of them were either discontinued, or found that the discussion inside here
was not that relevant to them. SO the participation went down.

Also there were some concepts inside metagov that I think pushed some
people away. If you find yourself disagreeing with someone at a fundamental
level, but do not have the time, or the patience, to discuss it, you will
just walk away and do your thing. I think this is what happened in many
instances.

So what remained was mostly people talking (still better than many other
places), and a wiki that no one reads. And the most important: a long list
of relevant softwares.

I am now considering to make a series of pages in the wiki about my
positions in the various topics. Anonimity, consensus. And invite other to
do theirs as well. Something like: Pietro on consensus, and Michael on
consensus, and so on. This mirrors better what happens in science where
people write rarely, and each person tend to present his point of view. I
don't want to have to defent my point every time someone says something.
Instead I think it should be the other way around. If someone says
something that strikes me as really really good, and makes me change my
mind, then (and only then) will I change my position. Less discussion, more
personal research.

&gt;<i> Sorry to differ, Ed,

</I>&gt;<i> I doubt that'll work.  Nobody reads the wiki except by accident, like

</I>&gt;<i> on, or it's out of date, or serves no purpose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Several people on this list have asked what they can do to help if

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe folks are happy with their own personal ideas of what it's all
</I>&gt;<i> about, content to pretend that others agree.  And when the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> goes in circles, back and forth across issues long ago done to death,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Several people on this list have asked what they can do to help if
</I>&gt;<i> they are not programmers and/or don&#8217;t have a lot of free time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Several people on this list have bemoaned that it is difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> follow long, complex conversations that produce many diverse ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you are one of the people in #1, you can help out the people in
</I>&gt;<i> #2! All you have to do is help transcribe little bits of conversations on
</I>&gt;<i> this list into the wiki. I don&#8217;t mean copying verbatim, but rather summing
</I>&gt;<i> up some noteworthy ideas or conclusions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You don&#8217;t have to take sides. Following in the footsteps of Wikipedia,
</I>&gt;<i> when there&#8217;s a disputed topic, you write about both sides of the topic and
</I>&gt;<i> explain why each side feels that way. Here&#8217;s an example:

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, you do not have to do a god job! You can write anything, and
</I>&gt;<i> others can help improve it later. Or you can be one of those who jumps in
</I>&gt;<i> and improves things. You can start by improving the above article. :) Even
</I>&gt;<i> fixing a typo is appreciated. Please help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In five minutes you can make some sort of contribution to the wiki. Give
</I>&gt;<i> it a try. There are no wrong moves in a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if you have any trouble, just let me or the list know, and you&#8217;ll
</I>&gt;<i> get assistance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can you help?
