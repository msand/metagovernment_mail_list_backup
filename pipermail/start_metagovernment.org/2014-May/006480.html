<PRE>On the current ML voting my vote is NO because the subject is not vital and
the page can remain as is until a new one is decided. Priority should be
given to deciding the new content not on blanking something not done well
but somehow useful to get an idea.
Jacopo

I created in Airesis a proposal to work on the new text to be placed on the
home page
The debate will end in *14 days and 23 hours* (until 04 Jun 2014 at 07:45
pm)
The proposal will go to the vote if it has a maturity greater than *50%*
 and *a person* will have participated, otherwise it will be abandoned.

<A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page">http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals/4968-write-and-vote-the-new-text-to-place-on-the-metagovernment-home-page</A>
The debate is on, I divided the proposal in paragraph and we are going to
use the side contribution to suggest the part of the text that you wish to
change
If I get more than 3 green faces on a suggestion I will  edit the text on
the proposal. If someone still not happy with the editing they can propose
a different text and collect consensus..
See you around
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Thanks Marc.  Here's where we currently stand:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    PROPOSAL 1
</I>&gt;<i>    ----------
</I>&gt;<i>    Blank the home page and insert the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       The content of the home page is currently under discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>       &lt;link to discussion archive&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    This solves the problem of false and misleading information, while
</I>&gt;<i>    leaving the door open to further proposals and content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;<i>    -------------
</I>&gt;<i>        For: Mike, Reid, Scott, Steve
</I>&gt;<i>    Against: Marc
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Marc asked:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MIke, two questions on this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) what's your definition of &quot;not for long&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd defer to the group on that.  But if the home page is still blank
</I>&gt;<i> in a few weeks *and* it's looking like it'll be staying that way, then
</I>&gt;<i> it means there's a deep problem here.  That shouldn't happen.  At that
</I>&gt;<i> point, we should probably speak with Ed about taking some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> corrective action.  Ed can do that, of course, because he owns the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki and the list.  He could fix things if necessary.  But I'm sure he
</I>&gt;<i> won't do that unless the group itself proves incapable of taking
</I>&gt;<i> action.  And I doubt that very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) how would you like to &quot;ensure proper content&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By talking about it and agreeing to it.  You'll see; if the decision
</I>&gt;<i> passes, then people will come together and do the right thing.  They
</I>&gt;<i> always do, when it's important.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> marc said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mike, and all ;o)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;Marc said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; ... we should keep the current content, because this is based on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; former decision until we have a newer decision, isn't it??
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; No, I think the former decision wasn't valid.  Our common desire to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; change the home page at the time was valid, but we did it improperly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thomas might disagree, but I think he'd change his mind if we spoke to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; him about it.  I can explain more, if you like.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO there are two fundamental characteristics of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) is always valid, that means the decision itself holds even if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; backing assumptions change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) should be in a flow, that means if the backing assumptions change, a
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision should be made
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Speaking for myself, I vote to blank the page till we agree what to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; put there.  The current content is false and misleading, and a blank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; page is always better than a false page.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Given the characteristics above, even if the content of the home page is
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; optimal (you said 'false and misleading'), it is better than nothing
</I>&gt;<i> (blank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's just my own opinion.  Please speak your mind, Marc.  I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; registered your vote, yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hence I'll vote for keeping the content until we decide for a better one
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place a remark at the top of the home page stating that the content needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improvment and link to the discussion thread. It's a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Reid said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't mind blanking the home page just so long as we come up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; things to put on it relatively quickly. ... If I was to come across
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; a homepage that just read &quot;Owing to a dispute, the content of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; home page is currently under discussion. ... &quot; I doubt I would be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;&gt; inclined to explore further or get involved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You agree with Steve and I that it shouldn't stay blank for long.  Ed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; will agree too, I'm sure.  Together we'll ensure it gets some proper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; content.  So I take your vote as 'Yes', for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; MIke, two questions on this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) what's your definition of &quot;not for long&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) how would you like to &quot;ensure proper content&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Marc
