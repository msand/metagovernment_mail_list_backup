&gt;<i> Stepping up one more level of meta on proposals within this community&#8230; we really need a uniform, easy-to-understand way to track and understand proposals within this community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I propose each proposal have a unique number, be presented in a uniform format, and be tracked in a centralized place:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instructions are on that page. This too is a proposal, so following this new format, I called it PROPOSAL 1. If you agree with this simple, helpful format, please re-introduce any active proposals using this format so that any onlooker can understand what is going on.
</I>
Hi Ed,
Below are a couple of screenshots of [MG] on Loomio. The format is so much more user friendly and well organized than the wiki. Every time I go to the wiki I get lost and spend way more time than I want to looking around for pertinent info. Case in point: I followed the link you suggested to the proposal page you created. I read it (backwards and forwards) clicked on your proposal&#8230;and nothing happened. Where is your proposal? I clicked on &#8220;add yours here&#8221;&#8230;and nothing happened. The wiki has always been very frustrating for me. I think it&#8217;s a bit shortsighted to expect that newcomers (or most anyone for that matter) will sift and sort through all of the various pages, and links to other pages, etc.  Maybe I&#8217;m a complete dolt, but I have to say the wiki really doesn&#8217;t work that well...for me.

Whereas Loomio is a walk in the park. It&#8217;s simple, straight forward, easy to use&#8230;.and keeps track of all basic info for a group on the groups home page. I don&#8217;t understand the resistance to using it. Sure it doesn&#8217;t have all of the bell and whistles that everyone would like&#8230;.but it&#8217;s being developed fairly quickly. The Loomio people are very open to feedback and suggestions...and I imagine a developer could create anyone of the bits and pieces people on this list have suggested are missing&#8230;.(but then again, I&#8217;m not a developer so I can&#8217;t say for sure.)

Anyway, I&#8217;m really trying to figure out what is actually going to work here. I apologize if this seems critical or unappreciative of all of the work you have done.  In truth I&#8217;m just really frustrated. 

I hope you are doing well with all of your current personal challenges.
All the best,
Steve
