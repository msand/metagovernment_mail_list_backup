I do plan to start up a new mailing list for this purpose at some
point, but I consider it only &quot;alpha test&quot; quality at this point.
When I get to &quot;beta test&quot; phase is when I'll start opening it up for
public debate.  Note that new versions are put up every week or so and
you should always download the current version before reading (or
re-reading):

&gt;<i> I&#8217;d like to
</I>&gt;<i> see it condensed into a line item format (similar to the structure Reid is
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting in the other thread), and then posted on Loomio (or wherever) so
</I>&gt;<i> we can keep track of the discussion and vote on each of the bits and pieces.
</I>&gt;<i> You may not want to subject to that level of scrutiny or inquiry&#8230;but it

</I>
I had had this thought as well.  But of course I'd want to have my
*own* system set up before doing this (eating my own dog food, as it
were).  This will be part of the beta test for both the book, and The
System.

&gt;<i> we just have to have a plan ready so that when that last straw comes it will
</I>&gt;<i> be our system that gets implemented instead of one by another
</I>&gt;<i> Lenin/Hitler/Mao/etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like it that you said *our* system&#8230;but I'm not really clear what you mean
</I>&gt;<i> by that.   It sounds like an implication of collaboration.  ;-)
</I>
I need co-consipirators for defensive purposes is all ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
