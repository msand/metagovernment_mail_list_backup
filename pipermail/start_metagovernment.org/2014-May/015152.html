<PRE>Hi Reid,
You didn&#8217;t hear the news?  The world just came to an end.  It&#8217;s just you and I now.  :-(
We&#8217;ll need to set up a new form of government of course. My guess is that majority rule is probably out.  :-)
Any thoughts&#8230;.?
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> Very good Scott, thanks for clearing some of that up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You mention moderators. What do you foresee their job being exactly? Since most is done by the flagging system. We may need moderators at first to work out glitches. Ideally though I think you would agree would be a system without moderators, a system that could run on the participation of its members alone. I believe it's achievable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fail to see how missing posts doesn't distort the conversation. If a user with no filters attached to their profile gets into an argument with an individual who's been flagged as a troll, users with the troll filter on would see a neutral user just arguing with himself pointlessly. This is unnecessary space and time being wasted by actual users trying to read and learn about real issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My envisioned model would not be &quot;The System&quot; that punishes them but in fact other users. A post is flagged/reported several times. A message is then sent out to a random unconnected active user that an infraction has occurred. This user can then check the infraction and make a call whether to punish the culprit or not based on the established rules of the forum. If the user feels the culprit broke a rule they lock the post from receiving any further replies and attaches a comment to the original post on why the decision was made. The culprit must then take a time out from posting. If the culprit does not feel the verdict was justified then I think a situation like the &quot;Forum Court&quot; you suggested could be utilized. However the punishment would have to be more severe in this stage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the penalty aspect puts these annoying users out of commission for an extended period so the rest of the site can get back to business. I think we should be attempting to discourage rampant posting, keeping the overall structure as clean and simple as possible.  This would make the site easier to navigate through and promoting a higher standard of posting etiquette would ensure a greater ratio of quality posts, which would encourage individuals to read more conversations since they know they're not wasting their time with pointless posts.      
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your method although nice to give everyone the freedom to post whatever, I feel opens the site up to a lot of unnecessary discussion and confusion. I feel like it would be an ongoing problem as there's no actual punishment for being annoying, annoying people will just keep doing it, complicating the site's view ability.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> www.theinternetswebsite.com is my project. It's a working prototype of sorts, though doesn't yet have the activity to realize its full potential as a functioning forum of debate. The basic concepts at least for what we're trying to accomplish are presented. I'd be interested to hear what you thought of it as our views appear to be similar. I currently lack the funds and the knowledge to continue to improve upon it. I'd be willing to let you have access to build upon it if you thought it could make a solid platform. Would save you some time and would make my efforts worth something. If we were to partner up I would step up my efforts on promotion of the idea. Media creation is more my strong suit and I believe it's going to take a massive public awareness campaign to empower individuals to believe in this new system, something that can come through viral videos. We live in a very exciting time where all of this is possible even with limited resources, collaboration is what we need.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To get back to the filtering issue, I'd appreciate some clarity on the issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you intend to have filters on particular language like any post that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; included the word &quot;homosexual&quot; an individual could omit those results from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their feed? I think you can see that this would both confuse the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conversations to have randomly missing posts as well as deprive the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual of a different opinion and a chance to expand their mind. This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way they could just vote against any gay rights without even hearing what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the other side had to hear. This is problematic would you not agree?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wasn't proposing filtering on words, but instead on flags.  There
</I>&gt;<i> would be obviously be some interaction between the two, so for example
</I>&gt;<i> if some individual repeatedly use racial or sexual orientation *slurs*
</I>&gt;<i> instead of whatever the PC term-du-jour is that their posts would
</I>&gt;<i> likely get flagged and as a result filtered by some/many people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Missing posts in a feed are not that big of a deal and you see this
</I>&gt;<i> all the time on newspaper sites (someone will respond to a post prior
</I>&gt;<i> to a moderator getting around to deleting it).  Whether or not some
</I>&gt;<i> clue that there was a filtered post is shown in the feed I think is a
</I>&gt;<i> UI issue we'll have to decide once we see how it works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other option which you seem to be hinting at is that users would be able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to flag other users into categories like, flammer, troll etc. and then set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; filters to hide those individuals. My concern with this is people being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; flagged as a troll will be stuck in that. What happens if someone comes to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their senses and decides to try and change, their already stuck as a troll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and mostly everyone has filtered them out already, they'll be invisible for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life. Seems like it would be very hard to correct their state once their put
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in a box.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Good point, and one I've been struggling with myself.  I've come up
</I>&gt;<i> with three solutions to this problem:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Flag expiration.  Maybe they only stick around for a month or two,
</I>&gt;<i> so the affected user's posts will gradually start appearing in
</I>&gt;<i> people's feeds again, in proportion to how tight that individual's
</I>&gt;<i> filters are set.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) On-line training: An individual could take a course on on-line
</I>&gt;<i> forum etiquette and have their flags cleared.  Kind of like traffic
</I>&gt;<i> court, where taking a class reduces the points on against your
</I>&gt;<i> license.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) &quot;Forum Court&quot;, where an individual could appeal the flags to a jury
</I>&gt;<i> of their peers (self selected, or maybe chosen at random like regular
</I>&gt;<i> juries are) where the offending posts would be discussed and a vote
</I>&gt;<i> taken to reverse the user flags if warranted.  I think we need this
</I>&gt;<i> option anyway because it would also be used to appeal moderator
</I>&gt;<i> decisions: Although user flagging should make up the bulk of the
</I>&gt;<i> moderation process (specifically there must not be any post removal by
</I>&gt;<i> moderators based on profanity or personal attacks) we're still going
</I>&gt;<i> to need moderators and we need a way for The People to review and
</I>&gt;<i> override those moderators both to help weed out the bad ones and to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent the moderators themselves from becoming a too-powerful
</I>&gt;<i> influence in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My recommendation is to instead have guidelines established, rules of what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of behavior is acceptable on the system. Break a rule and enough people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; report/flag you, your post is locked and you are served a time penalty where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you are not allowed to post. Once the time period is up you're free to post
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again but the next time you're caught breaking a rule the time penalty
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; increases. This enables and encourages individuals to clean up their act but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; punishes continual offenders and rids the site of problem people without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having to sensor or omit any information, we should all be on the same page
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and see what the community is talking about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I expressed in my other posts I'm opposed to these types of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;punishments&quot; because they're a relatively poor way to achieve the
</I>&gt;<i> desired outcome (as punishment for antisocial behavior is in general
</I>&gt;<i> according to just about all the psychological research (e.g., see the
</I>&gt;<i> section in the book on crime and punishment)).  It *is* censorship and
</I>&gt;<i> also turns the whole process upside down: It should never be perceived
</I>&gt;<i> that The System that is punishing a user, it should always be known
</I>&gt;<i> that it is only the other users who are individually making the
</I>&gt;<i> decision to banish or ostracize a problem individual.  This is the
</I>&gt;<i> technique that we *evolved* to use and be responsive to, and resorting
</I>&gt;<i> to authoritarian techniques is not only less effective, but has a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of negative side effects that come along with it (i.e., this
</I>&gt;<i> huge problem we have of people hating on the government when in fact
</I>&gt;<i> *we are* the government).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do think we should allow filtering but they should be inclusive instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Keywords - so you can search &quot;homosexual&quot; if that's your area of expertise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and have a list populated with all topics including that word.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We definitely need global search features and saved searches to
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate this.  In the book I also propose ways to specify these
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of things in an individual's &quot;Goals&quot; settings area such that
</I>&gt;<i> like-minded individuals could find each other to work on a proposal if
</I>&gt;<i> no one of them has the time or skill to take on creating a proposal by
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with a lot of what you're saying but this area is still unclear to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As it is to me.  This back-and-forth is how this thing *should* be
</I>&gt;<i> designed and I appreciate all the questions/comments as it really
</I>&gt;<i> helps me clarify my own understanding of the issues.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
