<PRE>Please respond individually to each line item below. Following one week of discussion, I will edit each item (per your feedback) and post them as proposals on Loomio for the group to make (or block the making of)  a *binding* decision for each. Unless there's strong opposition (a block), these decisions will be made by consensus as it is currently stated in proposal number 4.

1. We allow everyone on this list a certain window of time to state whether they are willing and able to participate in this groups discussions and decision making (I'm thinking 2 weeks). If a lurker changes their mind, or if someone joins the list at a later date, they can sign on and participate from that point on.

2. We choose a platform (Airesis, Loomio, Vilfredo, Votorola, or &#8230; ) to use for a given length of time. All [MG] decisions will be made on that platform for that period of time (maybe 6 months). This window should allow us time to adjust to the platform, test it, use it, and offer constructive feedback to the developer. Then we move on to another platform and do the same. 

3. For each proposal/decision, the quorum is comprised of those participating. The time allotted for the discussion is relative to the significance or gravity of the proposals effect on the group. The proposer decides the respective window. Others can challenge it if it seems unsuitable for the matter at hand.

4. In all decisions we strive for consensus. A decision becomes binding if, in the window of time allotted for the proposal, there are no blocks to its passing. If the proposal is blocked and someone in the group feels that, with more time, a consensus could be reached, they can then restate the proposal and choose a new window for it&#8217;s discussion and possible passage.


I realize there is a certain chicken and egg conundrum with respect to the initial decision about how this group will make a decision, as well as what constitutes a quorum to decide our necessary quorum, as well as the amount of time necessary to make a decision about how long we allow for decision-making, as well as the platform we use to decide on which platform to use&#8230;...but we must start somewhere. Please indulge the list with your constructive feedback.
