<PRE>I'd like to get the application basically working in time for a big
ColdFusion conference in mid-May, where I hope to at least lead a
Birds-of-a-feather discussion on all of this:
<A HREF="http://engage.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/topicSuggestions/">http://engage.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/topicSuggestions/</A>

But with a full-time job and four kids, I'm lucky to find more than an hour
or two a week to devote to this.  :)

It would be nice to get it done in time for next year's SXSW conference,
where <A HREF="https://popvox.com/">https://popvox.com/</A> just took first place in SXSW Accelerator contest:
<A HREF="http://sxsw.com/node/7079">http://sxsw.com/node/7079</A>

VoxPop is similar to CrowdVote, only you can't delegate your vote, you can't
vote from Twitter or FaceBook, and there's only one Docket: the
Congressional Agenda.

Hence I sort of think of CrowdVote as &quot;VoxPop on steroids.&quot;

But as far as my own personal goals, I just want to build this app for use
in my own condo community of 62 members, who are eager to try this out.

Votorola definitely looks very interesting.  Still wading through it.  Heady
stuff!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community email directory to come join his docket.  62 people join,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most just tie their votes to their favorites of those 5 or 6 people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who diligently attend the meetings.  The only thing that's changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now is that he is representing the community now on every decision,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not just once a year, because condo members can log in to manually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; override the vote inherited from anyone they're following.  Most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably won't.  But at least now they can't grumble about not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having a voice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that make sense? ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it makes perfect sense.  You're joining a handful of projects
</I>&gt;<i> that are working on techniques of recursive delegation or proxy
</I>&gt;<i> voting: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Welcome again!  One project is Votorola.  Aside from voting and voter
</I>&gt;<i> registration facilities, we work on the intersection of voting,
</I>&gt;<i> drafting and discussion media.  We're currently alpha testing and
</I>&gt;<i> protyping.  We're *always* alpha testing and protyping... ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are the priorities for your own work, say in the next month or
</I>&gt;<i> two?  What so you hope to accomplish?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... I wonder if this is an accurate description of how it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; compare with traditional voting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate chooses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing (as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       voters of their own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way this wording makes the difference really clear. It is the same,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what we have previously talked about as the diff between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;communicative delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delegation&quot;. Both form trees. If you picture them as 2-D trees, you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could they, these trees stand orthogonal on each other, creating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3-D-thing. The first one is limited to inside polls. The second one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can span across one/many/all polls. In the first one you own your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote and use it as an expert to influence other experts. In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; second one you give your vote away to an expert, cause you are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layman.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hah!  But this is my invention, since Jason denies it. :-)
