</I>&gt;<i> Conversely, however, those who have not earned wealth by ingenuity and hard
</I>&gt;<i> work should not be empowered to take it by force (including by votes)
</I>&gt;<i> simply because they outnumber those who have earned, saved, and invested
</I>&gt;<i> over long periods of time.
</I>
There exists no such thing like ingenuity and hard work is barely tied to 
wealth. This is no. 1 ideology of capitalism. I don't impose this reflection on 
you, but we don't have a consensus here. Therefore we need a democratic 
process for metagovernment or we are stalled. 
I have no problem to rewrite the Metagovernment Wiki in ways where most people 
here would reject it. I might do that if nothing comes out of that here to see 
what happens... I want a democratic process for metagovernment, do you reject 
me?
 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By definition, there will always be fewer people with more wealth than with
</I>&gt;<i> less.  So they will always be in the minority of the voter pool.  While
</I>&gt;<i> they may be able to influence elections disproportionately by their
</I>&gt;<i> campaign contributions, wealthy individuals often lose elections and no
</I>&gt;<i> candidate can win if the majority of the voters believe they have been
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bought&quot; by the wealthy minority.  Believe me, as one who worked on
</I>&gt;<i> Capitol Hill for more than a decade, I can assure you no politician will
</I>&gt;<i> accept a dime if they think it might have the net effect of hurting their
</I>&gt;<i> chances of election or re-election.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, it is in the long-term self-interest of wealthy
</I>&gt;<i> individuals and families to figure out how best to help grow the middle
</I>&gt;<i> class, lest they ultimately lose their wealth not to votes but to
</I>&gt;<i> revolution.  And with limited exceptions, it seems to me that most wealthy
</I>&gt;<i> folks not only understand that but also feel a moral obligation to &quot;give
</I>&gt;<i> back&quot; to society.  (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and many &quot;celebrities&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> good examples.)
</I>
You don't really believe that they have respect for the masses, do you? This 
is completely impossible when you are a billionaire, since you unscrupolously 
have to enforce your profit by any means in the first place. No way to take 
&quot;average&quot; fundless people serious then. Said in your own terms, they have no 
ways to act since they lack capital and can only sell themselves... they are 
just hirable puppets for you.
This charity is simply the best way to translate this ridiculously new heights 
of wealth into legitimate power... In any country or region where these 
foundations invest, stricter rules for private property like patents for 
pharmacy are imposed at the same time... 
If you would translate Apple's revenue to its workers, they would earn an 
additional 40000$+ a month. What do you think what happens if Steve jobs stays 
in hospital? And what do you think if all the programmers, engineers and 
workers stay at home? Or only a third?
If they had fear of a revolution then neoliberlism would not exist. This was 
the post-wwii ideology of social welfare states imo.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, government  often plays a negative role, not only because those
</I>&gt;<i> striving to rise in the middle and upper-middle class feel they have
</I>&gt;<i> already given &quot;at the office&quot; (via taxation) but also because they fear
</I>&gt;<i> how much more the government, backed by the votes of the less-well-to-do
</I>&gt;<i> majority, may take from them by the force of law.  Of course, too, they
</I>&gt;<i> also question the efficiency and effectiveness with which government
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucracies can spend their money even in the pursuit of objectives they
</I>&gt;<i> support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, while I have no illusions about prospects for &quot;reforming&quot; government
</I>&gt;<i> anytime soon, I do believe that, empowered by technology, those who share
</I>&gt;<i> objectives can come together much more efficiently to apply their own
</I>&gt;<i> resources and efforts to accomplish those objectives much more effectively
</I>&gt;<i> than ever before.  And I believe it would be better to focus on those
</I>&gt;<i> objectives directly, rather than to continue trying to wordsmith &quot;policies&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> whose implicit purpose is to try, indirectly, to force others to do things
</I>&gt;<i> they might not otherwise be inclined to do.
</I>
Yep we share that vision, although it is still too fuzzy imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Toward that end, I continue to hope that Metagov developers will offer
</I>&gt;<i> tools and services enabling those who document their goals and objectives
</I>&gt;<i> in open StratML format on the Web not only to identify those who share
</I>&gt;<i> their objectives but also to provide input and feedback -- including
</I>&gt;<i> offers of time, money, effort and other resources -- in the pursuit of
</I>&gt;<i> those objectives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To me, that is a far more enticing vision than improving the wording of
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov.org's home page (or any other wordsmithing operation).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To reiterate, it seems to me that it is not words but actions that truly
</I>&gt;<i> matter.
</I>
I find it kind of weird of you to say that you hope others will ensure some 
practice and in the same moment imposing that this need not be backed up by a 
democratical process/policy.  Why do you need consensus building then after 
all? If you want StratML to succeed with the tools available to Metagovernment 
then you have to create a poll and a ruleset on how the work towards that end 
is shared and organized with the people developing the tools. Giving advice is 
not a democratic proccess and what you &quot;hope&quot; for is a lot of work after 
all... Nothing in this world stops you from implementing StratML solutions 
anyway, if all you seek is action... I think we all know that talk is cheap, 
yet this is most what happens here (and in this mail I have to have my share 
again :-( )

I would like to emphasize that Metagovernment is in bad shape. We have a lot 
of wall of texts here and I have difficulties to find valuable information in 
that without having to scroll through tons of repeated personal thoughts and 
loose opinions. Metagovernment does not in itself have any practice nor even 
democratic processes... Vilfredo and Votorola are first experiments, but we 
need to be able to manage the crucial part of our resources (Wiki, server 
decisions, ...) if we really want to take ourselves serious and come to some 
results imo. If this is not the target, then what is the goal of metagov 
anyway?
