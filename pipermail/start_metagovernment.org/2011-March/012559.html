I think it *did* work in the past.  If it fails in future, we could
revisit the issue then.  On the other hand, the home page redesign is
currently suffering from low participation, and I think it was your
original idea, Thomas, that the decision mechanism could help here.
This is a priority for me, as well.

Ed, would you consider dropping the 21 days down to 7?  Just for
starters?  If people saw that action was imminent, or in fact taking
place, then I bet they'd be more inclined to participate.

In any case, I feel we ought to be voting for Ed on this particular
issue (G/p/m00).  We can't act legitimately on the home page, so long
as he opposes us (quite rightly) in this particular manner.

&gt;<i> &gt; Most other governance software projects have decision-rules for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defining when proposals get passed. It is both a strength and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weakness of Votorola that it does not. (Strength in that it allows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for flexibility between different kinds of communities, weakness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because of this potentially significant recursion problem.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps Votorola could have a default setting, which the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community/administrator is able to change?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If Votorola had such a default setting, then we would have to
</I>&gt;<i> decide, if we wanted to use a tool with such a setting. And this is
</I>&gt;<i> the same metaquestion again. There is no way around it, I guess.
</I>
Technically, it shouldn't be a problem.  Votorola can function as a
decision support mechanism without impairing it's other functions.
I'll propose a method once we start discussing the nuts and bolts of
the decision rule, itself.  (It would involve running a dedicated
governance-server (vgov) in parallel with the public vote-server (v),
and mirroring its votes.)
