It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a way 
this wording makes the difference really clear. It is the same, what we 
have previously talked about as the diff between &quot;communicative 
delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract delegation&quot;. Both form 
trees. If you picture them as 2-D trees, you could they, these trees 
stand orthogonal on each other, creating a 3-D-thing. The first one is 
limited to inside polls. The second one can span across one/many/all 
polls. In the first one you own your vote and use it as an expert to 
influence other experts. In the second one you give your vote away to an 
expert, cause you are a layman.
