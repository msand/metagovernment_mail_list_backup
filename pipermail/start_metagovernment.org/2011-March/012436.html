<PRE>Hello, John.

Your post was held up in the moderation queue because you aren't a  
member of the list. I pushed it through now, but I would encourage you  
to join our list not only so you can see any replies to you but also  
because we may be able to benefit from each others' ideas.

I appreciate that you mentioned metagovernment.org in the book, but I  
would like to point out that we don't really fit with those other  
organizations. We don't seek to get citizens more involved in  
government: we seek government of the citizens. In a democracy, any  
division between citizens and government is a betrayal of the core of  
democracy. We (or at least many of the people on this list) don't  
think the citizens should have a larger voice in the ears of their  
leaders, but rather that either a. the leaders should be completely  
beholden to the wishes of the people or b. that there should be no  
empowered leaders at all.

What we advocate is not like traditional direct democracy, which is  
very susceptible to mob rule and demagoguery, but rather new forms of  
governance allowed by the advent of collaborative technologies. I  
invite you to explore our brief overview here:

Again, we welcome your input and hope to hear from on the list.
