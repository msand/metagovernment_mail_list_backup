<PRE>I've added CrowdVote to the wiki. Please update it when you can, since  
my understanding of it is still limited:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/CrowdVote">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/CrowdVote</A>

Concerning your idea of distributed service and Michael's question  
about API, the point is the ability for it to be integrated into the  
Crossforum Theater, which is a way of aggregating discourse among our  
various projects into a unified view. So if a debate starts in one  
medium, it isn't stuck there... it can migrate and/or spread to  
whatever tools serve it best. See <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A> 
  for an introduction.

Since you talk about CrowdVote being distributed, I thought this may  
be of particular interest, since the Crossforum is a sort of meta- 
distribution. Enabling the Crossforum developers to tie into CrowdVote  
should help to make both stronger.

On a separate note, apart from distributing the implementation of your  
software, you can also look at the idea of distributing the  
administration. The idea is entirely theoretical at the moment, but  
better to think about it sooner rather than later:

</I>&gt;<i>  and deployed for free on Google's App Engine.  We think this  
</I>&gt;<i> deployment model is going to get a lot of attention in the Gov 2.0  
</I>&gt;<i> community, so we're eager to get a few examples out there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we would be honored to have it listed on your Active  
</I>&gt;<i> Projects page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Heh all I meant by &quot;heady stuff&quot; is I just saw some quotes from  
</I>&gt;<i> Habermas and Gadamer on the Votorola Theory page and thought: &quot;boy  
</I>&gt;<i> these guys are serious!&quot;  But these are difficult issues so I can  
</I>&gt;<i> understand the line you have to walk between making it approachable  
</I>&gt;<i> but not watering things down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also Michael asks in the next email but I'll answer here - yes  
</I>&gt;<i> CrowdVote definitely will have a fully REST-ful API at some point.   
</I>&gt;<i> We want CrowdVote to be more of a distributed platform than a  
</I>&gt;<i> service from any one provider.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, has anyone seen <A HREF="https://www.votizen.com/about/">https://www.votizen.com/about/</A> ?  Really  
</I>&gt;<i> interesting stuff.  It lacks CrowdVote's &quot;social representation  
</I>&gt;<i> market,&quot; and it's tied to one Docket (State or National offices).   
</I>&gt;<i> But it does a fascinating job with looking users up on Voter  
</I>&gt;<i> Registration Lists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Between your work and sites like <A HREF="https://popvox.com/">https://popvox.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://votizen.com">http://votizen.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> , momentum really seems to be gathering towards a radical re- 
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of representative democracy.

</I>&gt;<i> at all a reflection of my desire to participate, but rather a sad  
</I>&gt;<i> comment on the quantity of demands on my time.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jason, I have only had a chance to give a cursory glance at  
</I>&gt;<i> CrowdVote so far, but since there appears to be a fair amount of  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about its similarities to Votorola I have to ask if you  
</I>&gt;<i> are committed to developing solo instead of seeing if you can  
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to its already somewhat advanced codebase. I think it's  
</I>&gt;<i> great to have a lot of players in the governance software ecosystem,  
</I>&gt;<i> but it sure would be awesome if some projects had more than one or  
</I>&gt;<i> two active developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're too far along and/or too divergent in code or philosophy,  
</I>&gt;<i> then in any event I would encourage you to consider adding your  
</I>&gt;<i> project to the Metagovernment wiki. It should have its own page,  
</I>&gt;<i> like the other active projects have and it certainly should be on  
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Related projects&quot; page (I'll put it there if I get time and no  
</I>&gt;<i> one else has). But I also want to encourage you to consider listing  
</I>&gt;<i> it as an active project:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
</I>&gt;<i> since at this point you seem to meet the (admittedly minor)  
</I>&gt;<i> qualification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Separately, I'm concerned that you have repeatedly described parts  
</I>&gt;<i> of the Metagov site as &quot;heady stuff.&quot; While there are a few PhDs in  
</I>&gt;<i> the group, they're not political scientists. Come to think of it, as  
</I>&gt;<i> far as I know, we haven't attracted a single one of them. Most of us  
</I>&gt;<i> are just (in a sense) making this stuff up as we go, since all of  
</I>&gt;<i> the territory we are exploring is still quite uncharted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been having a drawn-out discussion about how to make the  
</I>&gt;<i> site and the project more accessible, which is reflected here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but your input would certainly be appreciated. Can you give an  
</I>&gt;<i> example or two of what on the Metagov site seems particularly  
</I>&gt;<i> daunting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks both for your input and your work.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VoxPop is similar to CrowdVote, only you can't delegate your vote,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hence I sort of think of CrowdVote as &quot;VoxPop on steroids.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But as far as my own personal goals, I just want to build this app  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for use in my own condo community of 62 members, who are eager to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> try this out.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Welcome again!  One project is Votorola.  Aside from voting and voter

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;communicative delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could they, these trees stand orthogonal on each other, creating a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3-D-thing. The first one is limited to inside polls. The second one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can span across one/many/all polls. In the first one you own your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; vote and use it as an expert to influence other experts. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; second one you give your vote away to an expert, cause you are a
