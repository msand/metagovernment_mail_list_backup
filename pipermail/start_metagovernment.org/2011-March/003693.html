<PRE>Hey everyone,


Just by way of introduction: I'm a ColdFusion/Java programmer with zero
background in political science but I had an idea few months ago for an
application I'm calling &quot;CrowdVote&quot; and on which I would really appreciate
any thoughts or feedback.  I've been following your list a little and it
seems like the kind of thing you folks are working on.  But I'm kind of a
n00b, so please forgive me if this isn't the right place.

It'll be Open Source of course and I'm building it in CFML because this
allows the application's full stack to be not only open sourced, but freely
and easily deployable on Google's App Engine by anyone with a gmail address
(more on that here:
<A HREF="http://blog.mattwoodward.com/fun-with-google-app-engine-my-demo-app-from-o">http://blog.mattwoodward.com/fun-with-google-app-engine-my-demo-app-from-o</A>)

Anyway, the project lives here: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/crowdvote/">http://code.google.com/p/crowdvote/</A>

I'm staging it here (still in *very* early stages.):
<A HREF="http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/.">http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/.</A>  It'll eventually live at
<A HREF="http://crowdvote.org.">http://crowdvote.org.</A>

Mockup and domain model are sketched out here:
<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/crowdvote/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/crowdvote/downloads/list</A>

There's a mailing list of developers who are working with me if you'd like
to get involved: <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/crowdvote">http://groups.google.com/group/crowdvote</A>

Oh and here's a very rough practice run for a lightening talk I gave to
generate interest among my fellow CFML developers:
<A HREF="http://vimeo.com/20283778(password:">http://vimeo.com/20283778(password:</A> zanzibar)

I'll also have an intro video on the home page at some point - here's a very
rough draft of what that might look like:
<A HREF="http://vimeo.com/19363663(password:">http://vimeo.com/19363663(password:</A> zanzibar)


I don't have much background in this sort of thing, but several people have
told me they feel there's some fatal flaw in the whole vision, but they
can't figure out what.  I tell them I feel the same way!  I'm hoping you
folks can point it out?

If nothing else, I'd love fodder for the help/FAQ page:
<A HREF="http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/index.cfm/help/">http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/index.cfm/help/</A>

Also, and most importantly, if you already know of something doing this, I'd
of course rather contribute to their effort.


Thanks!

-Jason

Sorry for not sending this sooner.

Yeah, just always happy to get feedback if you want to pass this on to
anyone.


I &quot;pitched&quot; the vision at the opencfsummit conference, so probably easiest
to watch through this short video of my presentation: <A HREF="http://vimeo">http://vimeo</A>
.com/20283778

Also here's a draft of a cartoon video I made a few months back that still
needs a lot of work, but which might clarify a few things: <A HREF="http://vimeo">http://vimeo</A>
.com/19363663

The password for both is zanzibar

And if it helps, here's a mockup of the application in pdf:

Several people have told me there's something fatally wrong with the whole
idea - but they can't figure out what.  I tell them I have the same feeling.

Oh P.S. If anyone wants to follow along on the development of the app,
there's a mailing list: <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/crowdvote">http://groups.google.com/group/crowdvote</A>

And we're staging the app here: <A HREF="http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/">http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/</A>
