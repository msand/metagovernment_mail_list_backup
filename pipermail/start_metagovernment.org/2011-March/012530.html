I can make a proposal, but I'm not yet sure I'm in support of it (see  
below). I just haven't really given it enough thought yet.

I'm on my way to bed now, and I have to agree with your other post:  
this is too complicated. When I am looking at a proposal or at a list  
of proposals, those are the times when I want to be able to add my  
own. And for someone non-technical, the barrier is certainly far too  
high at the moment.

A separate question: what if I want to simply register dissent? That  
is, I don't agree with the current proposals, but I am not sure I have  
a better proposal (or I have not yet been able to formulate a better  
proposal). So if I want to advocate the status quo, how would I do that?

This goes back to my original objection to leaving everything open.  
There is now the meta-meta-question: how does a group decide when it  
has decided how a decision should be made? This seems to invite  
infinite recursion.

When can we say that we have reached a decision, when the definition  
of &quot;decision&quot; is subject to the same question?
