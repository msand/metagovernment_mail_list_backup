Yes, I believe so. The status quo inherently always has inertia. Once  
something has established itself with the force of consensus  
(especially if it has had some time to sink in), it becomes the status  
quo.

But if we wanted to get complicated, I would suggest a reversion  
mechanism, for cases where, for example, a law gets passed and then  
people realize it's a disaster. They shouldn't have to wait another  
few weeks to be able to overturn it. So I would say something like: if  
more than half of the people who originally supported a new policy  
withdraw their support within the next 20 days, then the policy  
reverts back to mere proposal status.

Most other governance software projects have decision-rules for  
defining when proposals get passed. It is both a strength and weakness  
of Votorola that it does not. (Strength in that it allows for  
flexibility between different kinds of communities, weakness because  
of this potentially significant recursion problem.) Perhaps Votorola  
could have a default setting, which the community/administrator is  
able to change? (The former if they achieve the decision-rule and thus  
apply a new one, the latter in cases of initial setup for new  
communities.) Aktivdemokrati has an interesting model to consider...
