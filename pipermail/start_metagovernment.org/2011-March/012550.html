<PRE>&gt;<i> Conversely, however, those who have not earned wealth by ingenuity and

What I wanted to say is, that it should be mandatory to choose a mechanism
for &quot;financing the decision&quot;.

That might be direct spending, personal commitment, spending a share of
personal income, spending a share of a tax pool,

spending a flattr-share, or any other mechanisms or combinations of those.

 

I think every made decision has a flip side. By this i mean that every
decision has a positive side, thats why people vote

for it, but on the flip side, it has to be payed for to bring it into
reality... sometimes a decision might be expensive to realize,

sometimes not...

 

If there is not mechanism like the mentioned one, after every decision there
will be another discussion on how to realize what was agreed upon... and
during this decision people might conclude, that the made decision wasnt so
good, because its too expensive to have any positive effects. (exagerated
e.g. People vote for: &quot;build a bridge across the atlantic ocean&quot; (if only
naiv people vote, they propably wont think of any costs when they decide...
but when everyone has agreed, people might find out that the money or work
that has to be invested is to high to still justify the decision)

 

&gt;<i> And I believe it would be better to focus on those objectives directly,
</I>rather than to continue

&gt;<i> trying to wordsmith &quot;policies&quot; whose implicit purpose is to try,
</I>indirectly, to force others

&gt;<i> to do things they might not otherwise be inclined to do.
</I>
 

Good point :)

 

&gt;<i> Toward that end, I continue to hope that Metagov developers will offer
</I>tools and services enabling those who document their goals and &gt; objectives
in open StratML format on the Web not only to identify those who share their
objectives but also to provide input and feedback -- &gt; including offers of
time, money, effort and other resources -- in the pursuit of those
objectives.

&gt;<i> To reiterate, it seems to me that it is not words but actions that truly
</I>matter. 

 

Very true :)

 

 

And Yes, I agree with Ed Pastore, there definitely are different kinds of
decisions. I guess there is scientific research about the different kinds of
decisions that are possible. Can anyone mention some papers or names? I'm
interested in this topic and don't know much about it yet.

 

And for the &quot;cost side&quot; of a decision, whatever that might be, there should
be mechanisms as mentioned above and these mechanisms should consider the
kind of decision to be made.

Maybe for some kind of decisions there is no need to have it &quot;financed&quot;, but
for many it may be vital.

Good points, Alexander.  Money is not all that counts.  Often it is not even
the most important resource.  If that were true, the Washington, DC, schools
might be among the best in the world. which is far from being the case.

 

Conseo's point is also well taken that it should not be possible for those
with disproportionate wealth to buy governance that discriminates against
those who are less well-to-do.

 

Conversely, however, those who have not earned wealth by ingenuity and hard
work should not be empowered to take it by force (including by votes) simply
because they outnumber those who have earned, saved, and invested over long
periods of time.  

 

By definition, there will always be fewer people with more wealth than with
less.  So they will always be in the minority of the voter pool.  While they
may be able to influence elections disproportionately by their campaign
contributions, wealthy individuals often lose elections and no candidate can
win if the majority of the voters believe they have been &quot;bought&quot; by the
wealthy minority.  Believe me, as one who worked on Capitol Hill for more
than a decade, I can assure you no politician will accept a dime if they
think it might have the net effect of hurting their chances of election or
re-election.

 

On the other hand, it is in the long-term self-interest of wealthy
individuals and families to figure out how best to help grow the middle
class, lest they ultimately lose their wealth not to votes but to
revolution.  And with limited exceptions, it seems to me that most wealthy
folks not only understand that but also feel a moral obligation to &quot;give
back&quot; to society.  (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, and many &quot;celebrities&quot; are
good examples.)  

 

However, government  often plays a negative role, not only because those
striving to rise in the middle and upper-middle class feel they have already
given &quot;at the office&quot; (via taxation) but also because they fear how much
more the government, backed by the votes of the less-well-to-do majority,
may take from them by the force of law.  Of course, too, they also question
the efficiency and effectiveness with which government bureaucracies can
spend their money even in the pursuit of objectives they support.

 

Thus, while I have no illusions about prospects for &quot;reforming&quot; government
anytime soon, I do believe that, empowered by technology, those who share
objectives can come together much more efficiently to apply their own
resources and efforts to accomplish those objectives much more effectively
than ever before.  And I believe it would be better to focus on those
objectives directly, rather than to continue trying to wordsmith &quot;policies&quot;
whose implicit purpose is to try, indirectly, to force others to do things
they might not otherwise be inclined to do.

 

Toward that end, I continue to hope that Metagov developers will offer tools
and services enabling those who document their goals and objectives in open
StratML format on the Web not only to identify those who share their
objectives but also to provide input and feedback -- including offers of
time, money, effort and other resources -- in the pursuit of those
objectives.  

 

To me, that is a far more enticing vision than improving the wording of
Metagov.org's home page (or any other wordsmithing operation).  

 

To reiterate, it seems to me that it is not words but actions that truly
matter.

No it does not depend on your wallet, because instead of giving money, you
could also commit yourself to do something. Beside that, a share of a
&quot;money-pool&quot; could be assigned to the voted issue, like flatter does. (could
be a share of your personal money, could be a share of the total tax volume)

If a total income was generated by taxes, it could be devided by the number
of voters to create many equal shares.

There are many different possibilities, (assigning money directly, a flattr
mechanism, a share of a tax pool, direct commitment, etc.)

I think it's a good thing to make it possible to assign money and work force
to issues you can vote on.

&gt;<i> Sounds like a good thought.
</I>
&gt;<i> Maybe every vote should be coupled with money or personal commitment.
</I>
&gt;<i> Money could be a share of personal income or a share of taxes or something
</I>
&gt;<i> similar, while personal commitment forces a person to become active in the
</I>
&gt;<i> process of reaching the goal that was voted for...
</I>
&gt;<i> ...
</I>
But as a default solution this means participation depends on your wallet...
which is highly undemocratical.
