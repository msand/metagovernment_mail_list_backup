<PRE>2011/3/6 Thomas von der Elbe &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">ThomasvonderElbe at gmx.de</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'm sorry Matias! You are right, I forgot about the others. Besides you
</I>&gt;<i> there are 3 others, who have an own proposal.
</I>
No problem! I wrote my proposal before yesterday.

&gt;<i> Concerning the content of your draft, Matias, I disagree: I would not limit
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernments scope to a sole mailinglist. For example the crossforum
</I>&gt;<i> theatre is running here and much more could be in the future.
</I>
Well, what you say is true, so I added a subtitle explaining that we
also develop joint projects (it's an example and should be changed
later). My proposal is focused in the first impression that one can
get from this project: we are &#8212;mostly&#8212; a mailing list, a very good
one. It's fine! I think that that is what visitants want to hear. They
don't want to involve themselves in another project, they have enough
with their own; but certainly they might want to be where &quot;all the
projects&quot; are... where they don't have to participate, just to be.
That's why I like the concept of hub or club or consortium. (And once
they are in, maeby they would want to participate in a conversation
and/or contribute to a joint project.)
