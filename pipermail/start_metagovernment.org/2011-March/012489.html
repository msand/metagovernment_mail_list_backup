<PRE>Jason and Thomas,

Thanks Jason, I was on the wrong track.  Thanks for explaining.

Yes, it makes perfect sense.  You're joining a handful of projects
that are working on techniques of recursive delegation or proxy
voting: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting</A>

Welcome again!  One project is Votorola.  Aside from voting and voter
registration facilities, we work on the intersection of voting,
drafting and discussion media.  We're currently alpha testing and
protyping.  We're *always* alpha testing and protyping... ;-)

What are the priorities for your own work, say in the next month or
two?  What so you hope to accomplish?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate chooses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing (as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further choose

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a
</I>&gt;<i> way this wording makes the difference really clear. It is the same,
</I>&gt;<i> what we have previously talked about as the diff between
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;communicative delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract
</I>&gt;<i> delegation&quot;. Both form trees. If you picture them as 2-D trees, you
</I>&gt;<i> could they, these trees stand orthogonal on each other, creating a
</I>&gt;<i> 3-D-thing. The first one is limited to inside polls. The second one
</I>&gt;<i> can span across one/many/all polls. In the first one you own your
</I>&gt;<i> vote and use it as an expert to influence other experts. In the
</I>&gt;<i> second one you give your vote away to an expert, cause you are a
</I>&gt;<i> layman.
</I>
Hah!  But this is my invention, since Jason denies it. :-)
