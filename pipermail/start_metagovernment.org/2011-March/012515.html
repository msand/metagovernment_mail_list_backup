I think it would be better in the form of a single sentence.  And it
would be better if the scope of that sentence were restricted as far
as possible.  Example:

  The home page is to be modified by consensus whenever the proposed
  modification has been agreed by a plurality of members, and the
  plurality holds for a week.

We could then work on the content of that sentence.  We could try to
agree on the content before we did anything that might jeopardize the
chances of agreement.  So we wouldn't enlarge the form to two or more
sentences, because it's always more difficult to read an enlarged
text, never mind agree to it.  And we wouldn't expand the scope to
cover other pages, or other types of decision, because it's always
more difficult to understand (never mind agree to) a proposal of far
reaching consequences.

I don't say that G/p/m00 is wrong, but only that we don't need an
agreement on that particular issue in order to move forward, at least
not yet.  Still, I voted for you Thomas and you'll see it on the next
count.  I'm only making a suggestion, I don't want to hold up the
process over it.
