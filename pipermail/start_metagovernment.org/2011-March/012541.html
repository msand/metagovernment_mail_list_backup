<PRE>&gt;<i> Sounds like a good thought.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe every vote should be coupled with money or personal commitment.
</I>&gt;<i> Money could be a share of personal income or a share of taxes or something
</I>&gt;<i> similar, while personal commitment forces a person to become active in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of reaching the goal that was voted for...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>But as a default solution this means participation depends on your wallet... 
which is highly undemocratical.

1. Budgeting

This* is what I am planning to implement next (after the Harvester for 
Crossforum). A budgeting mechanism to raise necessary resources (esp. labour 
imo, but also money or goods) is necessary. Besides a nice budget overview to 
see how much backup and how much need every position has we really need to 
have levels of rules for application (execution/government) if we want to 
target economy. 

* <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:4consensus_WebDe/Budgeting_system">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:4consensus_WebDe/Budgeting_system</A>

I would really like to join forces... anybody interested?

2. Definition of formal rules in general

2.1 
The &quot;perfect&quot; default consensus would be imo:
Actions based on one position might not exclude or disqualify actions intended 
by any other position OR Every shared resource has to be changed on consensus 
only (represented by the poll's text).

2.2 The problem of formal prejudices
As Pietro has already pointed out action usually means that the voting tools 
define a &quot;sane&quot; default set of rules (e.g. plurality defaults...). For Votorola 
this is more generic and means that the set of actions are defined in the poll 
itself (the shared consensus of all positions). This works, because the shared 
consensus might be defined in a fine-grained rule set with any kind of plurality 
rules (as e.g. suggested by Thomas for the metagov home page) or other rules 
and can be defined in any shared &quot;meta&quot;-poll. 

2.3 A sane default majority for Votorola?
 I think a simple majority might be enough as a default for Votorola, since 
the position with the most support still can imply a meta-rule which forces 
higher level of consensus (this can also be necessary by external means). 
While this allows a simple majority of people to dominate a poll in a certain 
moment, consensus-building is intended in the tools and it is, as is stated in 
the metagov-wiki, the way of synthesis which really brings positions forward 
socially. As long as we assume that a simple majority of voters in any poll 
agree upon consensus building, we can trust them to enforce stricter (or even 
loser) rules on consensus building and action with said simple majority if 
necessary and appropriate (e.g. for optional actions only little support may 
be necessary). Votorola's difference patching highly encourages consensus 
building with collaborative drafting.
Since the consensus itself has no impact on any position in Votorola, nothing 
is lost if the consensus is checked in short intervals. As long as the 
majority implicitly agrees on consensus building in general, it can at any 
time force stricter rules if it feels dominated by uniting after a draft with 
a stricter rule set and nothing else.
It is a &quot;petitio principii&quot; imo to state that things might only be done by 
consensus if people do not agree on consensus-building itself. So if you don't 
trust the public in consensus building there is nothing that rules for the 
tools can do for you (e.g. default of 50%, 66%, 100%). The only thing that 
tools can do is show that synthesis in form of consensus building enables 
massive action and therefore convince people of consensus building. But we are 
not there yet, the task is to get there socially not technically... 
I think budgeting will help here a lot, if people can start to build and 
manage real resources together and see the benefit of a shared (and therefore 
larger) consensus directly.
Maybe I am wrong here... Let the arguments flow in :-p

3. Metagovernment governance

The draft_rules are needed from a metagovernment perspective since the 
Votorola poll is new and an outside institution which has to be at least 
agreed upon in the first place. This has nothing to do with Votorola but is an 
internal decision of Metagovernment. The easiest already implied way by Ed 
(for the Wiki licence) was to ask if the process is OK for all members and 
implement it if they don't disagree in some months. That way we can assume 
that all people involved (reading the list) agree with it as stated in 2.1. 
So I assume that we draft a set of rules, build consensus and on the way 
discuss the process here. During this process we can set and update a 
timeframe for objections once a consensus is reached. 
But I agree with Mike that the entry bar is technically still too high, so 
this has to be fixed first.
Since we don't do final decisions but you can at any time decide in the 
Mainpage poll that an external draft is used for the page or in draft_rules 
that the rules should be changed even to use another tool, nobody should be 
offended imo. You can even decide to go back to Ed being the ruler... Atm. we 
don't have any consensus building at all which stops us from seriously working 
together, so I am (independently of Votorola) interested in a process to team 
up in Metagovernment. With the status quo we dismiss ourselves and haven't 
even brought up any cooperation yet.

&gt;<i> The possibility to do such a coupling might lead to better decision
</I>&gt;<i> making. Maybe you also can support something that might be called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;
</I>cotw is interested in that already.  <A HREF="http://coalitionofthewilling.org.uk">http://coalitionofthewilling.org.uk</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to sound like a broken record, but it continues to seem to me that it
</I>&gt;<i> is not the words that matter so much but, rather, the actions.  No matter
</I>&gt;<i> how well-crafted the policy, it matters little if it engenders little or no
</I>&gt;<i> action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it not be better to focus on the desired results and the actions
</I>&gt;<i> required to achieve them (i.e., the plan) than the prose?  Might policies
</I>&gt;<i> not be a step or two too far removed from reality to be meaningful in the
</I>&gt;<i> cyberage?  Or at least might they not be less than optimally effective in
</I>&gt;<i> the face of better alternatives, e.g., direct, collaborative action by
</I>&gt;<i> those who already agree on the objective?
</I>
You can skip drafting the prose and simply define the action in Votorola. Text 
drafting doesn't force you to write a novel ;-) But you will face conflicts 
rather earlier than later and then the text drafting is necessary to 
communicate the different perspective or you are stuck. Mike has quoted that on 
the Votorola page somewhere from Habermas as you need to go through the 
complicated and sometimes painful process of communicating your positions to 
change or enable a social practice.

</I>&gt;<i> Just a thought ... for whatever it might be worth.
