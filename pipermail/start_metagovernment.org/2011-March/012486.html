<PRE>&gt;<i> Sorry, yes of course not through a prediction engine. I was not aware, that
</I>&gt;<i> the paragraph was limited to this. There must have been an older much
</I>&gt;<i> broader version of this text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I know, that there is much skepticism out there in the e-dem-community
</I>&gt;<i> concerning this type of delegation. They feel, that someone (X) who has no
</I>&gt;<i> clue on the subject, but votes for it, because A votes for B votes for C
</I>&gt;<i> which votes for it, shouldn't be allowed. Instead just C should be allowed.
</I>&gt;<i> An idea: How if we let each user decide, how to filter the results? So one
</I>&gt;<i> could only count C. Or one counts all equally.
</I>&gt;<i> Or one could decrease the voting power the longer the chain: C has 1 vote.
</I>&gt;<i> B has 0.5 votes. X has 0.1 votes. ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Interesting.  Not sure I completely follow.  My first reaction is that this
is a &quot;term&quot; of the Docket Owner's representation of his community, and as
such, is strictly between him and his community - i.e. a matter for him to
sell them on in the first place during his campaign.

But I agree CrowdVote should offer him features to toggle on or off to
support those terms.  And perhaps one could be a way to diminish the
influence of votes inherited from a distance?  If I am understanding you
correctly?

On the other hand I think &quot;Crowds&quot; like the Twitter-sphere or the New York
Times Bestseller list all somehow still provide a consensus...  In any free
market, there's always somehow a &quot;best-seller.&quot;  That's why we have this
expression that you can vote with your dollar.  CrowdVote just wants to give
you a wallet-full of votes, so that you can also vote with your vote in a
free market of representation.

Heh I am sure my terminology is all over the place.  I have no formal
training in anything like this so I really appreciate the suggestions and
clarifications.
