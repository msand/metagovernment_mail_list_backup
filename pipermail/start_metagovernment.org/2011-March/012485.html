<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts.

I'm actually not sure I'm using any of this terminology correctly.  As I
said, I have no background at all in this stuff.  That's why I've kind of
taken the liberty of coining terms like VoteSource, VoteStream and VoteURL,
which I try to define here:
<A HREF="http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/index.cfm/help/">http://crowdvotegae.appspot.com/index.cfm/help/</A>

I'm not completely sure I understand your characterization of anyone
choosing anyone.  A Docket Manager (the representative of a community) can
*invite* people to join, and people can search for his docket and request
admission.

I hope CrowdVote can work for communities of any size, but this example is
always at the back of my mind:

The weary President of the Condo Association.  There are 62 members, but
only 5 or 6 ever show up at the meetings.  His annual reelection is coming
up and he decides this time to invite everyone in the community email
directory to come join his docket.  62 people join, most just tie their
votes to their favorites of those 5 or 6 people who diligently attend the
meetings.  The only thing that's changed now is that he is representing the
community now on every decision, not just once a year, because condo members
can log in to manually override the vote inherited from anyone they're
following.  Most probably won't.  But at least now they can't grumble about
not having a voice.

Does that make sense?  Really appreciate the feedback guys!

-Jason

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> There could be something unique about your idea.  I wonder if this is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (a) Instead of a vote source choosing a community representative, the
</I>&gt;<i>     community representative chooses her own vote sources.  Instead

</I>&gt;<i>     a community representative of her own, the vote sources may
</I>&gt;<i>     further choose votes source of their own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Translated into the language Thomas and I are more familiar with,
</I>&gt;<i> which is closer to tradition, this would become:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate chooses
</I>&gt;<i>     her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing (as a
</I>&gt;<i>     delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further choose
</I>&gt;<i>     voters of their own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That seems to be the correct translation.  But do I have (a) correct
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place?
