<PRE>I agree, Mat&#237;as.  Ed's welcome template says the mailing list is the
&quot;core of our community&quot;:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Template:Welcome,">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Template:Welcome,</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Welcome">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Welcome</A>
So why not give it more prominence on the home page?

I also agree that the political and technical stuff needs to be toned
down.  The community speaks for itself.

Mat&#237;as, I have a suggestion.  Why not start with the draft that others
have reached a rough consensus on, and propose incremental changes to
it?  Move it in the direction you want it to go, but do it slowly.
Then we could work together if you like.  (Don't worry about using the
tools and such.  There's no need for that, in your case.)

What do you think?

</I>&gt;<i> No problem! I wrote my proposal before yesterday.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, what you say is true, so I added a subtitle explaining that we
</I>&gt;<i> also develop joint projects (it's an example and should be changed
</I>&gt;<i> later). My proposal is focused in the first impression that one can
</I>&gt;<i> get from this project: we are &#8212;mostly&#8212; a mailing list, a very good
</I>&gt;<i> one. It's fine! I think that that is what visitants want to hear. They
</I>&gt;<i> don't want to involve themselves in another project, they have enough
</I>&gt;<i> with their own; but certainly they might want to be where &quot;all the
</I>&gt;<i> projects&quot; are... where they don't have to participate, just to be.
</I>&gt;<i> That's why I like the concept of hub or club or consortium. (And once
</I>&gt;<i> they are in, maeby they would want to participate in a conversation
</I>&gt;<i> and/or contribute to a joint project.)
