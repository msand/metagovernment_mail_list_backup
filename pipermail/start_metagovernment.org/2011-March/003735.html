<PRE>I have transcribed (and updated) the below onto the wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision</A>

Please have a look and help expand this page. I think defining the  
kinds of decisions a community needs to make is a crucial step in  
figuring out how software can facilitate those decisions.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cataloguing them?  Perhaps someone's already done this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been thinking this as well. In this thread and elsewhere we  
</I>&gt;<i> use one kind of decision-making scenario and generalize from it,  
</I>&gt;<i> making conclusions that wouldn't apply to other kinds of scenarios.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a ton of information out there about kinds of decision- 
</I>&gt;<i> making. For example:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem seems to be not one of finding it, but of honing it down  
</I>&gt;<i> to relevant aspects for the purposes of this group. We may be better  
</I>&gt;<i> off making a page on the wiki and just making our own list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some exemplar scenarios that occur to me are:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A civic regulation such traffic signal light. These sorts of laws  
</I>&gt;<i> are only useful if everyone follows them. An opt-in system of  
</I>&gt;<i> obeying traffic signals would make them entirely useless.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A business regulation such as requiring the accurate statement of  
</I>&gt;<i> food ingredients, which helps protect the citizenry from harmful  
</I>&gt;<i> behavior by enterprises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A civic project such as building a road. Here there is the  
</I>&gt;<i> possibility for opt-in/opt-out. However, there are wider issues  
</I>&gt;<i> relating to opting. For example, do people who opt out of paying for  
</I>&gt;<i> the road still get to use it? Or, perhaps building the road will  
</I>&gt;<i> have environmental impacts that affect people nearby; so they want  
</I>&gt;<i> to not simply opt-out of the project but actively stop it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - An ongoing community service such as a fire brigade or a homeless  
</I>&gt;<i> shelter. Another scenario where opt-in/opt-out is imaginable, but  
</I>&gt;<i> the service provides a social good to the entire community  
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of who in particular pays for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Bureaucratic government actions, such as hiring and paying vendors  
</I>&gt;<i> to carry out community decisions. If the community decides to build  
</I>&gt;<i> a road, who administers the details of the project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Laws of civil order; and their enforcement. Laws against murder  
</I>&gt;<i> are easy to support, but there are countless other laws that become  
</I>&gt;<i> much more fuzzy. At what point does the community get to decide that  
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of law gets passed, and at what point do they get the  
</I>&gt;<i> authority to enforce such a law with the power of coercion? A 100%  
</I>&gt;<i> opt-in system certainly doesn't work against, say, crimes of  
</I>&gt;<i> property, because one person could break consensus and then claim  
</I>&gt;<i> the right to break into other peoples' houses and rob them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Responding to an impending disaster, invasion, etc. Consensus is  
</I>&gt;<i> not nearly as imperative as quick action; however there can be  
</I>&gt;<i> substantial disagreement about what action to take.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are just some examples. I probably should have just started  
</I>&gt;<i> this list in the wiki, but my time is up for now. Anyone else, feel  
</I>&gt;<i> free to transcribe this there and start work on organizing it. Or  
</I>&gt;<i> point to a good list that is already out there, if you can find one.
