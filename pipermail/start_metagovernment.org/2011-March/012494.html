<PRE>(Once again, sorry for my limited involvement recently... it is not at  
all a reflection of my desire to participate, but rather a sad comment  
on the quantity of demands on my time.)

Jason, I have only had a chance to give a cursory glance at CrowdVote  
so far, but since there appears to be a fair amount of discussion  
about its similarities to Votorola I have to ask if you are committed  
to developing solo instead of seeing if you can contribute to its  
already somewhat advanced codebase. I think it's great to have a lot  
of players in the governance software ecosystem, but it sure would be  
awesome if some projects had more than one or two active developers.

If you're too far along and/or too divergent in code or philosophy,  
then in any event I would encourage you to consider adding your  
project to the Metagovernment wiki. It should have its own page, like  
the other active projects have and it certainly should be on the  
&quot;Related projects&quot; page (I'll put it there if I get time and no one  
else has). But I also want to encourage you to consider listing it as  
an active project:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
since at this point you seem to meet the (admittedly minor)  
qualification.

Separately, I'm concerned that you have repeatedly described parts of  
the Metagov site as &quot;heady stuff.&quot; While there are a few PhDs in the  
group, they're not political scientists. Come to think of it, as far  
as I know, we haven't attracted a single one of them. Most of us are  
just (in a sense) making this stuff up as we go, since all of the  
territory we are exploring is still quite uncharted.

We have been having a drawn-out discussion about how to make the site  
and the project more accessible, which is reflected here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign</A>
but your input would certainly be appreciated. Can you give an example  
or two of what on the Metagov site seems particularly daunting?

Thanks both for your input and your work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does that make sense? ...

</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it makes perfect sense.  You're joining a handful of projects

</I>&gt;<i> Welcome again!  One project is Votorola.  Aside from voting and voter
</I>&gt;<i> registration facilities, we work on the intersection of voting,
</I>&gt;<i> drafting and discussion media.  We're currently alpha testing and

</I>&gt;<i> What are the priorities for your own work, say in the next month or
</I>&gt;<i> two?  What so you hope to accomplish?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... I wonder if this is an accurate description of how it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; compare with traditional voting.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate  
</I>&gt;<i> chooses
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing  
</I>&gt;<i> (as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further  
</I>&gt;<i> choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       voters of their own.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way this wording makes the difference really clear. It is the same,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what we have previously talked about as the diff between
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;communicative delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delegation&quot;. Both form trees. If you picture them as 2-D trees, you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could they, these trees stand orthogonal on each other, creating a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3-D-thing. The first one is limited to inside polls. The second one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can span across one/many/all polls. In the first one you own your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote and use it as an expert to influence other experts. In the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; second one you give your vote away to an expert, cause you are a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; layman.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hah!  But this is my invention, since Jason denies it. :-)
