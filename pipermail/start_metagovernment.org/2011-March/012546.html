<PRE>Hello,

@ Ed:

I admit, the 100% rule has beauty to it! Even though it can lead to 
(long?) periods of time, where 90% disagree with the current homepage 
and favor a new version instead ... quite the opposite of consensus for 
the current version.
I'd like to know what the others think?

&gt;<i> Most other governance software projects have decision-rules for 
</I>&gt;<i> defining when proposals get passed. It is both a strength and weakness 
</I>&gt;<i> of Votorola that it does not. (Strength in that it allows for 
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility between different kinds of communities, weakness because 
</I>&gt;<i> of this potentially significant recursion problem.) Perhaps Votorola 
</I>&gt;<i> could have a default setting, which the community/administrator is 
</I>&gt;<i> able to change?
</I>
If Votorola had such a default setting, then we would have to decide, if 
we wanted to use a tool with such a setting. And this is the same 
metaquestion again. There is no way around it, I guess.


@ Pietro:

&gt;<i> It is like a rugged terrain, and the consensus are peaks. Mountainpeaks.
</I>&gt;<i> You only see peaks that are tall enough. But a peak will hide farther
</I>&gt;<i> away peaks that are of the same or shorter hight.
</I>
Yes, this is how Votorola does it too! Multiple solutions are no problem 
in the poll-wiki. Here you can see the 3 mountain-peaks of the 
home-page-poll:

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho</A>

The good thing is: no mountain-peak must last forever. It can easily 
fall, if consensus changes.


@ Owen:

&gt;<i> Toward that end, I continue to hope that Metagov developers will offer tools and services enabling those who document their goals and objectives in open StratML format on the Web not only to identify those who share their objectives but also to provide input and feedback -- including offers of time, money, effort and other resources -- in the pursuit of those objectives.
</I>
Owen, these tools are already here (in prototype)! And we are also 
working on them. Right now we are testing them within Metagov. If you 
dont see the use for Metagov, there is still the use in testing itself, 
right? And you are very welcome to join! If you have another group to 
test with them, please connect us!


@ Marcos:

Isnt what we are working on designed to take responsibility away from 
single people and give it to the masses?

@ Alexander &amp; Conseo: I'll answer to the budgeting issue separatly.


Thomas
