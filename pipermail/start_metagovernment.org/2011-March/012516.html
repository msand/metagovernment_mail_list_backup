<PRE>Ok, I agree, right now the homepage matters most.

And I can also agree to your proposal:

&gt;<i>    The home page is to be modified by consensus whenever the proposed
</I>&gt;<i>    modification has been agreed by a plurality of members, and the
</I>&gt;<i>    plurality holds for a week.
</I>
My draft consists only of this one sentence now:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe/draft_rules</A>

Is anybody here, who can not agree to this?

Thomas

</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be better in the form of a single sentence.  And it
</I>&gt;<i> would be better if the scope of that sentence were restricted as far
</I>&gt;<i> as possible.  Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    The home page is to be modified by consensus whenever the proposed
</I>&gt;<i>    modification has been agreed by a plurality of members, and the
</I>&gt;<i>    plurality holds for a week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could then work on the content of that sentence.  We could try to
</I>&gt;<i> agree on the content before we did anything that might jeopardize the
</I>&gt;<i> chances of agreement.  So we wouldn't enlarge the form to two or more
</I>&gt;<i> sentences, because it's always more difficult to read an enlarged
</I>&gt;<i> text, never mind agree to it.  And we wouldn't expand the scope to
</I>&gt;<i> cover other pages, or other types of decision, because it's always
</I>&gt;<i> more difficult to understand (never mind agree to) a proposal of far
</I>&gt;<i> reaching consequences.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't say that G/p/m00 is wrong, but only that we don't need an
</I>&gt;<i> agreement on that particular issue in order to move forward, at least
</I>&gt;<i> not yet.  Still, I voted for you Thomas and you'll see it on the next
</I>&gt;<i> count.  I'm only making a suggestion, I don't want to hold up the
</I>&gt;<i> process over it.
