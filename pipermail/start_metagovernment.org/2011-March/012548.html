&quot;Policy&quot; has a lot of different meanings, and I do believe that any  
society is inherently based on policies. Restaurants don't allow  
people to enter without shoes, internet bulletin boards ostracize  
spammers, townships punish thieves, companies reprimand employees who  
slack off. But then there are completely different things our software  
deal with as well...

I want to again draw the list's attention to the page about the  
different kinds of decisions:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision</A>

I think it is crucial that we start recognizing that there is not just  
one kind of decision that our softwares might help with, but rather  
several quite different ones, some of which are interdependent and  
some of which are quite apart.
