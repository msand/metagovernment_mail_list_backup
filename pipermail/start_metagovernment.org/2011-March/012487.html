<PRE>As longer-term subscribers to this listsev know, I believe it would be good if candidates for elective office were to document their campaign platforms on the Web in open, machine-readable format, like Strategy Markup Language (StratML) -- as U.S. federal agencies will now be required to do with their plans and reports under section 10 &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10</A>&gt;  of the GPRA Modernization Act.

 

I also believe it would be beneficial to focus on contributions (inputs and processing) toward the realization of shared objectives to be accomplished by the &#8220;voters&#8221; themselves, rather than merely delegating authority without resources to others (which creates scapegoats while absolving the rest of us from responsibilities that only we can assume).

 

While the notion of one dollar/one vote may be unpalatable for many purposes, the practice of casting votes without providing resources is at best ineffective, if not counterproductive in the long run.  The results are becoming more and more apparent at all levels of government.  What is required is not more of the same (paving the proverbial cow path) but something different.

 

Toward that end, I hope the StratML standard (ANSI/AIIM 21:2009) can play a useful role.  Something very much like it is required to mature the social networking services for business-quality purposes, including the business of governance.

 

Owen

Sorry, yes of course not through a prediction engine. I was not aware, that the paragraph was limited to this. There must have been an older much broader version of this text.

BTW, I know, that there is much skepticism out there in the e-dem-community concerning this type of delegation. They feel, that someone (X) who has no clue on the subject, but votes for it, because A votes for B votes for C which votes for it, shouldn't be allowed. Instead just C should be allowed. An idea: How if we let each user decide, how to filter the results? So one could only count C. Or one counts all equally. 

Or one could decrease the voting power the longer the chain: C has 1 vote. B has 0.5 votes. X has 0.1 votes. ?




Interesting.  Not sure I completely follow.  My first reaction is that this is a &quot;term&quot; of the Docket Owner's representation of his community, and as such, is strictly between him and his community - i.e. a matter for him to sell them on in the first place during his campaign.

But I agree CrowdVote should offer him features to toggle on or off to support those terms.  And perhaps one could be a way to diminish the influence of votes inherited from a distance?  If I am understanding you correctly?

On the other hand I think &quot;Crowds&quot; like the Twitter-sphere or the New York Times Bestseller list all somehow still provide a consensus...  In any free market, there's always somehow a &quot;best-seller.&quot;  That's why we have this expression that you can vote with your dollar.  CrowdVote just wants to give you a wallet-full of votes, so that you can also vote with your vote in a free market of representation.

Heh I am sure my terminology is all over the place.  I have no formal training in anything like this so I really appreciate the suggestions and clarifications.
