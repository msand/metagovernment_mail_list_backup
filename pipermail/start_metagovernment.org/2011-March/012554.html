<PRE>Hi Ed,

I think you've made a great start on this subject.  The top section of the
page is strong, but I think the &quot;Types of Decisions&quot; portion too quickly
jumps to concrete examples in the real word, and muddles the distinction
between making a decision and the actions taken to implement them.  I think
more appropriate would be to discuss &quot;Decision Contexts&quot;, and examples of
decision mechanisms appropriate to each context.

My quick feedback.  I hope to be able to contribute to the page in my
elusive down time...

</I>&gt;<i> Please have a look and help expand this page. I think defining the kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> decisions a community needs to make is a crucial step in figuring out how
</I>&gt;<i> software can facilitate those decisions.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  Perhaps someone's already done this?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been thinking this as well. In this thread and elsewhere we use one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of decision-making scenario and generalize from it, making conclusions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that wouldn't apply to other kinds of scenarios.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is a ton of information out there about kinds of decision-making.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem seems to be not one of finding it, but of honing it down to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relevant aspects for the purposes of this group. We may be better off making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a page on the wiki and just making our own list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Some exemplar scenarios that occur to me are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - A civic regulation such traffic signal light. These sorts of laws are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only useful if everyone follows them. An opt-in system of obeying traffic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> signals would make them entirely useless.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - A business regulation such as requiring the accurate statement of food
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ingredients, which helps protect the citizenry from harmful behavior by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enterprises.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - A civic project such as building a road. Here there is the possibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for opt-in/opt-out. However, there are wider issues relating to opting. For
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example, do people who opt out of paying for the road still get to use it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or, perhaps building the road will have environmental impacts that affect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people nearby; so they want to not simply opt-out of the project but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actively stop it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - An ongoing community service such as a fire brigade or a homeless
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shelter. Another scenario where opt-in/opt-out is imaginable, but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> service provides a social good to the entire community regardless of who in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular pays for it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Bureaucratic government actions, such as hiring and paying vendors to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> carry out community decisions. If the community decides to build a road, who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administers the details of the project?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Laws of civil order; and their enforcement. Laws against murder are easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to support, but there are countless other laws that become much more fuzzy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At what point does the community get to decide that this kind of law gets
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> passed, and at what point do they get the authority to enforce such a law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the power of coercion? A 100% opt-in system certainly doesn't work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> against, say, crimes of property, because one person could break consensus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and then claim the right to break into other peoples' houses and rob them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Responding to an impending disaster, invasion, etc. Consensus is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nearly as imperative as quick action; however there can be substantial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagreement about what action to take.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These are just some examples. I probably should have just started this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list in the wiki, but my time is up for now. Anyone else, feel free to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transcribe this there and start work on organizing it. Or point to a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> list that is already out there, if you can find one.
