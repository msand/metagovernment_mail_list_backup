<PRE>Hi Thomas,
I am not convinced we are speaking about the same thing.

Am I right in saying that you essentially using approval voting (each
person votes on all they agree on, and then you sum the results), and
showing the results of one round of voting?

But what I was describing is different.

Please look at the first graph in this page:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=53</A>

The graph url is long but I shorten it to:
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/fd1dKn">http://bit.ly/fd1dKn</A>

Now. Look at the yellow dots, those are the generations where we had a
consensus. The x tells you the generation, the y tells you the number
of people that agreed in that consensus.
We now have 6 moment of full consensus over an history of 16
generations. The 6 consensus happened at generations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
and 16. And involved 2 people for generations 1, 2, 6 and 16. And 3
people for generation 3 and 5. Then there are all the proposals for
all the other generations. Now the other proposals are just ignored in
this analysis. We only look at the moment of consensus.
Out of those 6 yellow dots, some will stand out. Those are the bright
yellow ones.
And of those 6 consensus, we take the generation 16 (the latest),
which touches 2 people. Then we ignore generation 6, because it is
older and also includes the same number of people. Instead we consider
generation 5 which involved 3 people. And this covers up everything
before.

I am not ranking results that competed one against the other. It is a
different thing. This is why you can speak about percentage (100%,
75%, 25%) which I cannot. Those are all 100%, just 100% in different
moments.

Regards,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> that it does not. (Strength in that it allows for flexibility between

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If Votorola had such a default setting, then we would have to decide, if we

</I>&gt;<i> again. There is no way around it, I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @ Pietro:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is like a rugged terrain, and the consensus are peaks. Mountainpeaks.
</I>&gt;<i> You only see peaks that are tall enough. But a peak will hide farther
</I>&gt;<i> away peaks that are of the same or shorter hight.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this is how Votorola does it too! Multiple solutions are no problem in
</I>&gt;<i> the poll-wiki. Here you can see the 3 mountain-peaks of the home-page-poll:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?p=G!p!mho</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The good thing is: no mountain-peak must last forever. It can easily fall,
</I>&gt;<i> if consensus changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @ Owen:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Toward that end, I continue to hope that Metagov developers will offer tools
</I>&gt;<i> and services enabling those who document their goals and objectives in open
</I>&gt;<i> StratML format on the Web not only to identify those who share their
</I>&gt;<i> objectives but also to provide input and feedback -- including offers of
</I>&gt;<i> time, money, effort and other resources -- in the pursuit of those
</I>&gt;<i> objectives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owen, these tools are already here (in prototype)! And we are also working
</I>&gt;<i> on them. Right now we are testing them within Metagov. If you dont see the
</I>&gt;<i> use for Metagov, there is still the use in testing itself, right? And you
</I>&gt;<i> are very welcome to join! If you have another group to test with them,
</I>&gt;<i> please connect us!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @ Marcos:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Isnt what we are working on designed to take responsibility away from single
</I>&gt;<i> people and give it to the masses?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @ Alexander &amp; Conseo: I'll answer to the budgeting issue separatly.
