<PRE>There is something we do on vilfredo that maybe you could use here.

Speaking about relation between status quo and new consensus

It is common in vilfredo for people to reach a consensus, and then to
keep on discussing. So how to handle this situation.

The idea is that each time a consensus is reached a line is drawn.
Like a line in the sand by the waves. New consensus will only delete
previous consensus if they have the same number of people or less. An
example will clarify this:
There is a question. After some time 6 people agree on the result.
This sets up a solution:
Solution 1.
Then people keep on discussing, more people join in and eventually 10
people reach a new agreement. This deletes the old one.
So now we have solution 2. Solution 1 is forgotten.
Then people keep on discussing, but some people live, and 5 people
reach a consensus.
So now we have BOTH solution 2 (older, supported by 10 people) AND
solution 3 (newer supported by 5 people). Then people discuss and 5
people reach a consensus. This deletes the solution 3 but not the
solution 2.
So now we have solution 4 and 2.
Then 3 people have another consensus so now we have
Solution 2, 4, 5

It is like a rugged terrain, and the consensus are peaks. Mountainpeaks.
You only see peaks that are tall enough. But a peak will hide farther
away peaks that are of the same or shorter hight.

Not sure if it can be applied in your case, also it requires to have
multiple solutions active at once which in a wiki can be tricky :)

Cheers,
Pietro
