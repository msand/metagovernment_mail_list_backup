<PRE>Regarding the listserv, from my perspective, it would be good if there were (at least) two of them &#8211; one for technical exchanges among the developers and another for folks like me who&#8217;d prefer to receive fewer, higher-level announcements.  

 

Perhaps I should unsubscribe from the listserv and just check the website periodically for results of interest to me.  (If the listserv archives are open to anonymous, public access, that would be good but I doubt I&#8217;d want to take the time to wade through the volume and types of messages it contains.)

 

Here&#8217;s a wild thought:  How about using a Metgov type application to filter the kinds of messages that each of its subscribers (&#8220;voters&#8221;) receive?  For example, I might only want to see messages endorsed by, say, Ed or by a certain percentage of the other subscribers.  The latter would be analogous to a referendum, in which a certain number of petition signatures is required in order to place an issue on the ballot.

 

Another way of looking at it from a social networking perspective would be to give users a more conditional choice than merely &#8220;following&#8221; another individual&#8217;s postings (or not).  For example, I may wish to see all of Ed&#8217;s postings but only the postings of others if they are endorsed by a certain number of other subscribers (or perhaps by Ed).  I generally try to direct my messages to those who I think may have an interest in them, rather than to the listserv, but it would be good to give folks more control over the types of information they care to see.

 

Of course, too, for developers who&#8217;d like folks like me to test/use their sites/services, it would be good if we could access any and all of them with a single UID and password.  Personally, I might prefer to use my LinkedIn ID.  However, my Facebook ID would also suffice.

 

BTW, with reference to Ed&#8217;s observation about the lack of political scientists in the group, I only took one political science course in college &#8230; and I didn&#8217;t like it.  However, I did work on Capitol Hill for 14 years and was the Congressional liaison for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for 7 &#189; years after that.  So two-thirds of my career were spent in the practice of political science &#8211; before I got my masters in computer systems management, co-founded the U.S. federal governmentwide XML community of practice, initiated the StratML standard, etc.

Hi!

2011/3/10 Michael Allan &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mike at zelea.com</A>&gt;

I agree, Mat&#237;as.  Ed's welcome template says the mailing list is the
&quot;core of our community&quot;:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Template:Welcome,">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Template:Welcome,</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Welcome">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Welcome</A>
So why not give it more prominence on the home page?

I also agree that the political and technical stuff needs to be toned
down.  The community speaks for itself.

Mat&#237;as, I have a suggestion.  Why not start with the draft that others
have reached a rough consensus on, and propose incremental changes to
it?  Move it in the direction you want it to go, but do it slowly.
Then we could work together if you like.  (Don't worry about using the
tools and such.  There's no need for that, in your case.)

What do you think?


I totally agree. Do you remember which are the drafts that have consensus?
