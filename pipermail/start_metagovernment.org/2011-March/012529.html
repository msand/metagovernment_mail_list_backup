You basically agree with us, C.  But you've added detail concerning
what a &quot;proposal&quot; is.  You've also expanded the scope to cover other
pages.  So you're asking us to agree to something *more*.  But I feel
the consensus is too fragile at this stage to ask more of it.  (I
don't mean you should change your draft, but I hope Thomas delays
pulling from it.)

Ed, could you express your own proposal in a single sentence?  We have
an entry problem with the tools just now, but that shouldn't slow us
up.  (Let the tools catch up later.)  We have:

  Thomas, Mike, C:

    The home page may be modified by consensus whenever the proposed
    modification is agreed by a plurality of members, and the
    plurality has held for a week.

  Ed:

    The home page may be modified ...

  Others?

    The home page may be modified ...

Or if we really need tooling, then we could move to Vilfredo.
Votorola is proably overkill at this early stage.  (I wish these tools
worked together more smoothly.)  Or are there other suggestions on how
to get started?

</I>&gt;<i> no coverage). This does not mean we have to discuss everything, but
</I>&gt;<i> if somebody creates a poll for it, we have to go through it (or a
</I>&gt;<i> ruleset for this type of content). Which then raises the next
</I>&gt;<i> question: Under which conditions can a poll be dropped and the Wiki
</I>&gt;<i> again edited directly (any resource get opened up to any content)?
