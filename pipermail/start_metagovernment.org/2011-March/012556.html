<PRE>Thanks for your reply Alexander.

&gt;<i> I don't know, but for me, what you describe as proxy voting is also what
</I>&gt;<i> liquid democracy means.
</I>
I'm just curious as to where this definition comes from. I haven't
been able to find any articles/papers about this.

&gt;<i> I've never heard of the concept which you describe as &quot;liquid democracy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which
</I>&gt;<i> Associates a parliament with a fixed amount of representatives to it. But if
</I>&gt;<i> you don't have a fixed amount of representatives associated with a
</I>&gt;<i> parliament.... you could define parliament as all representatives, that is
</I>&gt;<i> all people who vote, some represent only themselves, some represent
</I>&gt;<i> themselves plus others...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you use the latter definition of parliament, it will become what you
</I>&gt;<i> described as proxy voting.
</I>
My original idea was to couple Habermas' ideas about the public sphere
(deliberation) with the internet concept mass-to-mass communication
(term from Bohman 2010). I found that proxy-voting could do exactly
this; create small &quot;minipublics&quot; (again, see Bohman 2010) where active
deliberation would do exactly this. So I turned to the legislature;
It's very idealistic to completely remove the parliament and rely on
proxies as such. That's where the concept I (wrongly it seems)
referred to as &quot;liquid democracy&quot; comes in. This would essentially
allow the political structure to persist, but would still include
strong elements of e-democracy. As mentioned I discussed this with
Michael Allan who proposed the term &quot;liquid legislature&quot;. It actually
sounds much more appealing to me now...

Best regards,
Jens Egholm
