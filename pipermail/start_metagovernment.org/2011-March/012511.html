<PRE>Hey,

For Ed and Matias I put your name on top of your draft, because it 
doesnt tell it in the page-name and I always got confused. Maybe we 
should agree on a common handling for the future. I thought it was a 
good idea, if everybody had his draft under his user-pages. What do you 
think?

@ Mike and Matias: I pulled a few good ideas from you, thx.

 From Conseo I pulled this:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D/?a=4047&amp;aR=2802&amp;b=4048&amp;bR=2812">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D/?a=4047&amp;aR=2802&amp;b=4048&amp;bR=2812</A>

Ok, since Mike and Owen (offlist) agree, I start a poll for the 
metaquestion then.

I also agree, that for some people the very technical stuff might be too 
much. So what to do? Setup a new list? The other one was explicitly for 
Candiwi, wasnt it?

Ok here now some technical feedback:

&gt;<i> Do you like the new location of the link in the footings?  I'm not sure, myself.
</I>
Yes, I like it! Thats where it belongs! And I like the footing-controls 
very much too! :-) One wish though: For me it would be more intuative, 
if one click on a user-button would always just show his footings in the 
draft, and two clicks would always lead to his draft, no matter who is 
highlighted atm.

And just another thought. It feels like ideally I would want to have all 
users drafts accessible from my draft. Ofc the space is the problem 
then. Now, why not cover the whole navigation field in the page with the 
controls, e.g.? Or miniaturize the top left logo? I know, you like the 
light touch, but ... ?

Thomas
