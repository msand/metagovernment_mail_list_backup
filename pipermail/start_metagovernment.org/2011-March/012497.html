&gt;<i> Regarding the listserv, from my perspective, it would be good if there were
</I>&gt;<i> (at least) two of them &#8211; one for technical exchanges among the developers
</I>&gt;<i> and another for folks like me who&#8217;d prefer to receive fewer, higher-level
</I>&gt;<i> announcements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agree. Indeed there exists a list for development related subjects, I guess
we only have to retake it.


&gt;<i> Here&#8217;s a wild thought:  How about using a Metgov type application to filter
</I>&gt;<i> the kinds of messages that each of its subscribers (&#8220;voters&#8221;) receive?  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, I might only want to see messages endorsed by, say, Ed or by a
</I>&gt;<i> certain percentage of the other subscribers.  The latter would be analogous
</I>&gt;<i> to a referendum, in which a certain number of petition signatures is
</I>&gt;<i> required in order to place an issue on the ballot.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Really nice idea for a list server application.


&gt;<i> Another way of looking at it from a social networking perspective would be
</I>&gt;<i> to give users a more conditional choice than merely &#8220;following&#8221; another
</I>&gt;<i> individual&#8217;s postings (or not).  For example, I may wish to see all of Ed&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> postings but only the postings of others if they are endorsed by a certain
</I>&gt;<i> number of other subscribers (or perhaps by Ed).  I generally try to direct
</I>&gt;<i> my messages to those who I think may have an interest in them, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> to the listserv, but it would be good to give folks more control over the
</I>&gt;<i> types of information they care to see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We could import many web 2.0 kind of ideas to the mail service to make it
more interactive (and call it mail 2.0 perhaps? :P). I would like this.
