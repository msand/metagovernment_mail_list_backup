<PRE>@ Conseo, in the spririt of keeping it simple (as Mike proposes for 
now), I postpone my answer to you. But I agree with you, we need to 
adress the wider scope at some point.

@ Ed, here is our diff:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D/?a=4221&amp;aR=2844&amp;b=4198&amp;bR=2848">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D/?a=4221&amp;aR=2844&amp;b=4198&amp;bR=2848</A>

A question: What happens in your case, if on the twenty third day 
someone expresses an objection he just newly realized? A new discussion 
would start, but the new version of the home page would stay in place?

It is not as easy as just to press a button &quot;Reject&quot;, but you would make 
the current version of the home page your draft.

Yes, I like the joke, which lies in this somehow! This recursion only 
ends at the number of meta-layers, where pure consensus is reached. I 
hope, we dont have to go to the meta-meta-meta-question for that! :-) 
But consensus should become easier the more &quot;meta&quot; it gets, shouldnt it? 
I actually hope we find consensus for the metaquestion already.
