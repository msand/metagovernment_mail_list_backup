</I>&gt;<i> default rule...

The proposal will have time to gain support. As the proposal gets more
recognition, it will have to convince larger and larger groups of people.

Proposals are sorted out for people based on
 1. Proposal topic is a close match to your special interest
 2. How near the end of the voting period it is
 3. Your advisors has voted in different directions
 4. The proposal is related to a proposal you are watching
 5. Positive change in the yes/no ratio
 6. The speed of incoming yes votes
 7. Interest in the proposal in your community

This sorting will bring proposals to the attention to more and more
people as long as it keeps having support. All people will have a fair
chance to make a decision about if they care enough to participate.

Each person can have an unlimited amount of delegates and advisors. A
delegate has your permission to vote in your place. An advisor has no
right to vote for you, but will provide you with information. Both may
in turn use other delegates and advisors.

Each person will choose how to prioritize among the delegates and
advisors. But the default will be to use one or more advisors that
categorize the proposals and then use different delegates for different
categories. The delegates may be prioritized but the default position is
to cast a blank vote if two or more of your delegates has voted in
different directions. You will be prompted to make the choice.

It will be very easy to support causes. The usual way to support a cause
is by a widget or link embedded in a social network or blog. This link
will take you to the cause page on a trusted site there you can delegate
your vote to the cause. This will make it easy for people ro support
thousands of different causes. And you will be prompted if any two or
more of your delegates has voted in different directions on a proposal.

There will always be a minimum amount of days before the end of a vote
in which delegates can't change their vote. This will give you time to
react if any of your delegates does something you didn't expect.

All proposals should be limited in scope. If it's about your local town,
the calculation of the voting period should be based on the population
of the town.

Most proposals should be reversible. The voting can continue after the
point of decision and if the support changes, the change will be
reversed. The calculation for this can use the same algorithm.

Mostly all of this is my own ideas. (It's not the official position of
Aktiv Demokrati.)


&gt;<i> It has a valid point for polls regarding economic action where the amount of 
</I>&gt;<i> participation is fairly shared (e.g. working hours). You can prioritize tasks 
</I>&gt;<i> that way imo. If you can digg out the link, I would be happy :-)
