<PRE>I'm wishing I was able to track this discussion sooner!

My response blends ideas inspired by some of the prior comments with recent
work on open stewardship in coalition of the willing and on the ground in
the Chicago Digital Access Alliance.

First - I have to challenge the notion that the online/offline contexts are
really any different in this matter wrt what constitutes &quot;binding decisions&quot;
or how to arrive at such decisions.

I do agree with the general point against a &quot;perpetually bounded set of
options for the future&quot; which leads me to reflect on the importance of
 &quot;duration&quot; and mechanism to &quot;reverse&quot; wrt agreements or decisions.

This thread started by exploring how to deal with a group that could not
make a commitment obligating future members/selves.

I'd say we have to segment matters that pertain to the &quot;group reflected upon
itself&quot; from &quot;group's agreement with third party&quot;... (I'd wonder with the
group in question -- do they have any group website, phone service, etc..
i.e. any tool that they have to pay a third party?  presumably these trivial
cases are regarded as trivial, appropriately so .. and they dont feel
obligated in the long term, i.e. they can change service provider if and
when group decides)

So, for agreement, or setting up an option with a third party - I don't see
how there can be a perpetual agreement (except in case of transaction, i.e.
sale of an asset) - so the agreement to work with another party requires a
sense of duration, even if only the period at which the arrangement would be
revisited.  So these should be set out in the agreement... along with
provisions for early termination of the agreement under reasonable change of
circumstances.   i.e. this is not perpetually binding, but it allows for
basic decisions.   None of this seems too far out of normal practice, but
online communities or other informal groups need to speel these things out
more explicitly.

Now, as to what is binding , we also need to make distinctions between
&quot;binding principles&quot; and &quot;binding actions&quot;  - I think this connects with
Owen's comments - in my own language I see it as requiring commitment of
resources/capacity as  part of the negotiation/deliberation, or for the
meaningful right to have a say in the decision.

In the groups I mentioned - CotW and CDAA -- we're dealing with open network
approaches with umbrella groups and multiple working groups and subgroups,
with fluid participation (running into same problem of binding decisions and
changing membership).

We request a clearly stated &quot;Scope &amp; Mandate&quot; for each group, as well as
defined &quot;Processes&quot; for each group, whereby members of  a group understand
clearly what the processes are, and whereby intergroup work refers to
processes defined by each group.  The processes are subject to continual
revision (and testing), and the groups have not reached a massive scale by
any means.  We also work hard to have an on-ramp/orientation for the groups.
 Often issues come up in one group that are clearly something that belongs
to another group or which should be considered from the perspective of the
umbrella group.  it takes some effort and discipline to redirect these
issues to the appropriate places.

I'm leaving a lot out of course ... we're using multiple channels/media for
communication and work.
