So sometimes 'My' would behave as a modal switch (as originally
suggested), and at other times as a direct link?

&gt;<i> &gt;     You have no draft in&lt;G/p/m00&gt;.  You may create a new draft:

OK.

</I>&gt;<i> they were in an extra row? ...
</I>
I agree it might be better that way, if it were done right.  But I've
tasked some layout changes for the footings, and we'd need to wait for
those.  (My mistake in coding the &quot;forest&quot; link to the poll page has
made me realize that we need to stablize the position of these nav
controls.  They mustn't be jumping around when we navigate from page
to page.)  Once that's coded, it'll buy us room to tier the pin-ups
above the voters, as you suggest.  But at the additional cost of
overlapping the top-left logo.

Then again, I might be spending too much time on this.  I think the
crucial thing is to get a few more thoughtful people interested in the
issue of the home page, and to get them using the tools.  So I really
should be coding with a better focus on that.  (Note to myself: get
focused.)

&gt;<i> ... And concerning the issue of space: How if we had a collapsable
</I>&gt;<i> menue like in the theatre map? This could then be really big,
</I>&gt;<i> covering the whole left wiki menue. Wouldnt that be great?  The
</I>&gt;<i> whole delegation tree would fit in there, and the vote-space-page
</I>&gt;<i> could be shrinked to a simple &quot;vote now&quot;-page without tree.
</I> 
&gt;<i> One more idea: If you click on a user, the footing gets fixed. To unfix 
</I>&gt;<i> it you have to click this user again. Additionally I'd like to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to click on the orininal user to unfix the footings.

Currently if you click by mistake, say out of curiosity, then you can
always click again to undo the result.  It'll be hard to remain
consistent with that behaviour if we allow clicking on the origin
(4c.).  What happens when we click there first, like just after the
page loads?  Whatever happens will be a surprise, and that's bad in a
nav UI.

On the other hand, it does *look* like the origin (4c.) is clickable,
and (surprise) it is not.  So maybe I should be correcting the look of
it, and not the function?
 
&gt;<i> A question: How does the naming come: Tg, TZ, Te? Its changing is a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> confusing and again due to too little space I understand. Here:

</I>
It's for consistency with the difference bridge.  Traverse to the
bridge, and you'll see.  All these test voters have names beginning
&quot;Test-&quot;!  But that shouldn't be much of a problem with real voters.
