I had the same impression.  It's potentially a very open and very
extended voting UI.  It brought to mind Mark Murphy's POSH
interface. [1] I recall, too, that it was our discussions with Murphy
here in the list that eventually inspired us (Thomas being a
contributor by then) to turn Votorola's own UI in a radically open
direction.  Thomas's invention of vote mirroring has been a pillar of
that openness on the voting side. [2]

Jason, will your Docket and VoteSource tables have a public Web API?
When your code is running, we could probably teach our vote-server to
do the jobs of Queuer, Scraper and Calculator, and also to publish its
own votes in a compatible Docket/VoteSource protocol. [3] I don't know
what you may think of that proposal, but I offer it.

I also don't know what you may think of Ed's suggestion, but I share
his openness to critique.  I hope you find time to read up on our
efforts and give us your feedback, most especially on the technical
architecture (since I'm a technical guy).  How do our two approaches
differ?  What is your critical appraisal of the difference?

&gt;<i> (Once again, sorry for my limited involvement recently... it is not at  
</I>&gt;<i> all a reflection of my desire to participate, but rather a sad comment  
</I>&gt;<i> on the quantity of demands on my time.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jason, I have only had a chance to give a cursory glance at CrowdVote  
</I>&gt;<i> so far, but since there appears to be a fair amount of discussion  
</I>&gt;<i> about its similarities to Votorola I have to ask if you are committed  
</I>&gt;<i> to developing solo instead of seeing if you can contribute to its  
</I>&gt;<i> already somewhat advanced codebase. I think it's great to have a lot  
</I>&gt;<i> of players in the governance software ecosystem, but it sure would be  
</I>&gt;<i> awesome if some projects had more than one or two active developers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're too far along and/or too divergent in code or philosophy,  
</I>&gt;<i> then in any event I would encourage you to consider adding your  
</I>&gt;<i> project to the Metagovernment wiki. It should have its own page, like  
</I>&gt;<i> the other active projects have and it certainly should be on the  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Related projects&quot; page (I'll put it there if I get time and no one  
</I>&gt;<i> else has). But I also want to encourage you to consider listing it as  
</I>&gt;<i> an active project:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
</I>&gt;<i> since at this point you seem to meet the (admittedly minor)  
</I>&gt;<i> qualification.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Separately, I'm concerned that you have repeatedly described parts of  
</I>&gt;<i> the Metagov site as &quot;heady stuff.&quot; While there are a few PhDs in the  
</I>&gt;<i> group, they're not political scientists. Come to think of it, as far  
</I>&gt;<i> as I know, we haven't attracted a single one of them. Most of us are  
</I>&gt;<i> just (in a sense) making this stuff up as we go, since all of the  
</I>&gt;<i> territory we are exploring is still quite uncharted.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have been having a drawn-out discussion about how to make the site  
</I>&gt;<i> and the project more accessible, which is reflected here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but your input would certainly be appreciated. Can you give an example  
</I>&gt;<i> or two of what on the Metagov site seems particularly daunting?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks both for your input and your work.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But with a full-time job and four kids, I'm lucky to find more than  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an hour or two a week to devote to this.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It would be nice to get it done in time for next year's SXSW

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; VoxPop is similar to CrowdVote, only you can't delegate your vote,  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can't vote from Twitter or FaceBook, and there's only one  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Docket: the Congressional Agenda.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hence I sort of think of CrowdVote as &quot;VoxPop on steroids.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But as far as my own personal goals, I just want to build this app  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for use in my own condo community of 62 members, who are eager to  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; try this out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Votorola definitely looks very interesting.  Still wading through  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.  Heady stuff!
