<PRE>Hi Ed,

I don't know that I'm going to be able to review Votorola's documentation
any time soon.  I need to get CrowdVote to at least a proof-of-concept stage
in time for a ColdFusion conference in May.

I think we are going to continue along our current path only because four
other developers are already working with me at this point and a big
side-objective of ours is just getting out a solid ColdFusion application
running on the Open Source CFML Server <A HREF="http://openbluedragon.org/">http://openbluedragon.org/</A> and
deployed for free on Google's App Engine.  We think this deployment model is
going to get a lot of attention in the Gov 2.0 community, so we're eager to
get a few examples out there.

I think we would be honored to have it listed on your Active Projects page.


Heh all I meant by &quot;heady stuff&quot; is I just saw some quotes from Habermas and
Gadamer on the Votorola Theory page and thought: &quot;boy these guys are
serious!&quot;  But these are difficult issues so I can understand the line you
have to walk between making it approachable but not watering things down.

Also Michael asks in the next email but I'll answer here - yes CrowdVote
definitely will have a fully REST-ful API at some point.  We want CrowdVote
to be more of a distributed platform than a service from any one provider.

BTW, has anyone seen <A HREF="https://www.votizen.com/about/">https://www.votizen.com/about/</A> ?  Really interesting
stuff.  It lacks CrowdVote's &quot;social representation market,&quot; and it's tied
to one Docket (State or National offices).  But it does a fascinating job
with looking users up on Voter Registration Lists.

Between your work and sites like <A HREF="https://popvox.com/">https://popvox.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://votizen.com,">http://votizen.com,</A>
momentum really seems to be gathering towards a radical re-thinking of
representative democracy.

&gt;<i> (Once again, sorry for my limited involvement recently... it is not at all
</I>&gt;<i> a reflection of my desire to participate, but rather a sad comment on the
</I>&gt;<i> quantity of demands on my time.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Jason, I have only had a chance to give a cursory glance at CrowdVote so
</I>&gt;<i> far, but since there appears to be a fair amount of discussion about its
</I>&gt;<i> similarities to Votorola I have to ask if you are committed to developing
</I>&gt;<i> solo instead of seeing if you can contribute to its already somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> advanced codebase. I think it's great to have a lot of players in the
</I>&gt;<i> governance software ecosystem, but it sure would be awesome if some projects
</I>&gt;<i> had more than one or two active developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're too far along and/or too divergent in code or philosophy, then in
</I>&gt;<i> any event I would encourage you to consider adding your project to the
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment wiki. It should have its own page, like the other active
</I>&gt;<i> projects have and it certainly should be on the &quot;Related projects&quot; page
</I>&gt;<i> (I'll put it there if I get time and no one else has). But I also want to
</I>&gt;<i> encourage you to consider listing it as an active project:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
</I>&gt;<i> since at this point you seem to meet the (admittedly minor) qualification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Separately, I'm concerned that you have repeatedly described parts of the
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov site as &quot;heady stuff.&quot; While there are a few PhDs in the group,
</I>&gt;<i> they're not political scientists. Come to think of it, as far as I know, we
</I>&gt;<i> haven't attracted a single one of them. Most of us are just (in a sense)
</I>&gt;<i> making this stuff up as we go, since all of the territory we are exploring
</I>&gt;<i> is still quite uncharted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have been having a drawn-out discussion about how to make the site and
</I>&gt;<i> the project more accessible, which is reflected here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign</A>
</I>&gt;<i> but your input would certainly be appreciated. Can you give an example or
</I>&gt;<i> two of what on the Metagov site seems particularly daunting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks both for your input and your work.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence I sort of think of CrowdVote as &quot;VoxPop on steroids.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as far as my own personal goals, I just want to build this app for use

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Does that make sense? ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, it makes perfect sense.  You're joining a handful of projects

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Welcome again!  One project is Votorola.  Aside from voting and voter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> registration facilities, we work on the intersection of voting,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drafting and discussion media.  We're currently alpha testing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protyping.  We're *always* alpha testing and protyping... ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What are the priorities for your own work, say in the next month or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> two?  What so you hope to accomplish?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... I wonder if this is an accurate description of how it would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; compare with traditional voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate chooses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing (as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further choose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;       voters of their own.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It's a funny way to express it, but I'd say you are right. And in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; way this wording makes the difference really clear. It is the same,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; what we have previously talked about as the diff between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;communicative delegation&quot; and &quot;non-communicative or abstract
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; delegation&quot;. Both form trees. If you picture them as 2-D trees, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; could they, these trees stand orthogonal on each other, creating a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3-D-thing. The first one is limited to inside polls. The second one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can span across one/many/all polls. In the first one you own your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; vote and use it as an expert to influence other experts. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; second one you give your vote away to an expert, cause you are a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; layman.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hah!  But this is my invention, since Jason denies it. :-)
