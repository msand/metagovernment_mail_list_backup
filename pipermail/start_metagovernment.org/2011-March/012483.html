<PRE>Welcome Jason,

I have a question that falls in line with Thomas's.

There could be something unique about your idea.  I wonder if this is
an accurate description of how it would compare with traditional
voting.  In your own terms:

 (a) Instead of a vote source choosing a community representative, the
     community representative chooses her own vote sources.  Instead
     of the community representative further choosing (as a delegate)
     a community representative of her own, the vote sources may
     further choose votes source of their own.

Translated into the language Thomas and I are more familiar with,
which is closer to tradition, this would become:

 (b) Instead of a voter choosing a candidate, the candidate chooses
     her own voters.  Instead of the candidate further choosing (as a
     delegate) a candidate of her own, the voters may further choose
     voters of their own.

That seems to be the correct translation.  But do I have (a) correct
in the first place?
