</I>Hi everyone,

I browsed the site just now, acting as someone who had never been there.

Here are some thoughts from that frame of mind:

One thing I feel missing is an easy way for a user to quickly jot-down some
simple ideas about what *THEY* think such a project should be about.  This
internet traveler might begin an avalanche of work in a very different
direction ending at a much better result.

Users don't enjoy the formality of creating an 'account'.  It feels like too
much of a commitment, plus the possibility of spam and just annoyance, etc.

Giving users a 'voice' through a simple edit-box will give the site a more
'alive' feeling where the user has a greater possibility of interacting with
other people.  Of course we'll need to address the trouble of spam, but we
can do it!

Somewhat paradoxically, I also want the site to remember me anyway -
probably with a cookie - so when I come back to see what others have had to
say about my ideas I will be recognized by the software through my session
as the an 'unverified' account that the site is incrementally building and
storing on my behalf without my needing to register in such a formal manner.
 There should be also a simple ways to increase my account 'level', such as
associating an email address, achieving some community goals, etc.

Lowering these barriers-to-entry will help us 'harvest' value from those who
are willing to share, and will also increase the number of users because of
the more immediately engaging chance to interact with others toward being
truly effective.
