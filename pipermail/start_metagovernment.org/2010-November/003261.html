<PRE>When we started the competition-style method of re-drafting the  
Metagovernment homepage, I noticed it was resembling the Votorola  
drafting paradigm.

In Vototrola, individuals draft proposals and then others can support  
those proposals or make their own. Then through the process of dialog  
and debate, competing resolutions are encouraged to borrow from and/or  
synthesize each other in order to gather more support. (Did I get this  
right?)

In the re-drafting of the homepage, we have followed this paradigm  
generally, but without any of the external structure of voting. There  
is a lot of borrowing and synthesis in this process, but it also has  
the benefit of being very limber and fast-moving.

I am wondering how far this sort of free-form process can scale. It  
seems to me to be a great way to start out the drafting of proposals,  
before they enter into the more formal mechanisms of voting systems.  
Or perhaps that it could benefit from its own formalization: a  
structure that actively promotes the blending and synthesis of diverse  
proposals.

Am I right, or would this process have worked just as well or even  
better if it had been run through, say, Votorola from the outset?

</PRE>
