<PRE>Hello Ed,
hello everybody

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Very
</I>&gt;<i> frequently, when I discuss the concept with others and the idea of a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus decision-rule comes up, their reaction is: &quot;But government will be
</I>&gt;<i> gridlocked! How can we pass any laws if we have to have widespread agreement
</I>&gt;<i> on them first?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And my reply is, basically: Why do we need so many laws?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even more deeply: How can we pass laws that *don't* have widespread
</I>&gt;<i> support?
</I>
Hi Ed, I appreciate that you speak about widespread agreement, and not
about complete consensus.
I don't agree that we always need to have complete consensus. For
once, there are people who do not have the good of society (or even
their own good) as their aim, but enjoy confusion. Or just want to
show that a system does not work.

But even if we assume that everybody was totally honest in its
decision, and omniscient over what they should do to reach their best
aim, still the society might be divided, and you still might have
situations were it is better for everybody if a decision is taken, but
no available has more than a relative simple majority.

Let's make an example:
Let's say you are on a boat on a river, we have some rapids in front
that would surely destroy the boat. It is important to reach a bank.
No one wants to go to through the rapids. But the people in the boat
have different agenda. Some people have their house on one bank, some
on the other. The boat is also sinking, thus once it arrives on the
side, it will take a long time before it can be moved again (if ever).

What to do here, is hardly an open question. And you can adapt the
scenario to exclude one by one the creative possibilities you might
come out.

As much as open questions are important. There are situations where
there are only few alternatives. Not deciding is worse than any
alternative, and eventually you will need to vote. They might be rare.
They are surely rarer than what we are used to think. But whatever
system of governance we want to suggest, it must take into account
that people need to be able to say: enough, we need a decision among
those alternatives, and we need it now.

Do you see what I mean?

Pietro
