<PRE>Hello, Zohar.

I belong to a political party from Spain: &quot;Partido de Internet&quot; (PdI). Our
elected candidates will vote the way people decide througth an internet
voting system, so we MUST build such secure voting system over internet with
delegation.

We are centering on the voting aspects of the system because we expect it
will be used mainly by delegation to the traditional political parties; the
discussion and direct voting issues will be addressed later, as the system
evolves and people get more involved in democracy.

David Ruescas have been working on security issues. It seems mixed-network
approach is not valid, because it is imposible to invalidate delegated votes
when an user cast a direct vote, and we have some other troubles with the
length of the options vector, but it seems we have a valid security scheme
(in the sense of privacy, verifiability, etc)

By the other hand, we are starting to define the requisites so a real
elected candidate can use it conveniently. We are preparing a road map, and
perhaps our approach wont be not so modular because we need a system running
as soon as posible, so the idea is come up with something secure and
modularize it later.

This is the web of our political party (spanish):
<A HREF="http://www.partidodeinternet.es">http://www.partidodeinternet.es</A>
We are launching the project web site, it will be avaliable in
<A HREF="http://agoraciudadana.org/">http://agoraciudadana.org/</A> in about two weeks. At the moment It will be
avaliable only in spanish .

The voting system will be an opensource project somewhat independent from
PdI, so people interested in this kind of project but not in our political
party can colaborate with more confort.

Unfortunately we have more will than funds (we would kill for two full time
programmers!); but we are very stubborn, so the system will be built sooner
or later.

If you think we can colaborate, please feel free to write me (
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">alvaro.maceda at partidodeinternet.es</A>), David (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">fastness at gmail.com</A>) or
preferably to the project mailing list (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">pdi-aplicacion2 at googlegroups.com</A>)

&gt;<i>  *- Open Source Voting System* -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The Idea:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     To build a modular, open-source, ultra-secure, Internet based voting
</I>&gt;<i> system. An extensive API will make it easy for anyone to write modules,
</I>&gt;<i> which can be added(and removed) at both user and server admin levels. This
</I>&gt;<i> will allow the system to be adaptable and be used by businesses, schools,
</I>&gt;<i> unions, legislative bodies etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The Details:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *  *Because of the great flexibility of the modular system many of the
</I>&gt;<i> systems 'details' do not need to be worked out by the system's architects
</I>&gt;<i> but will be added in the future by independent module writers. Below are
</I>&gt;<i> some of the ideas that should be part of the systems architecture, but could
</I>&gt;<i> be turned off depending on the systems intended use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Extremely secure*
</I>&gt;<i>    - Modular constriction*
</I>&gt;<i>    - Voting along party lines* (As module)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Ability for users to confirm their vote
</I>&gt;<i>    - Ability for anonymous voting
</I>&gt;<i>    - Interactive (Wiki, information about things being voted on
</I>&gt;<i>    pros/cons)  (As module)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Open-source
</I>&gt;<i>    - Multi-lingual
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>           **Modular Construction*
</I>&gt;<i> Users and server admins can add and remove modules allowing the system to
</I>&gt;<i> change its functionality. An extensive API will exist to allow all sorts of
</I>&gt;<i> modules such as genetic algorithms(Vilfredo goes to Athens), social
</I>&gt;<i> networks, wiki's, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> *Extremely secure *
</I>&gt;<i> - The ability for anyone to create a vote storing server(VSS). There will
</I>&gt;<i> be a public server with a list of IPs of all the VSSs. When a user votes,
</I>&gt;<i> the vote will be sent simultaneously to all the VSSs. The VSSs will talk to
</I>&gt;<i> each other to make sure the databases are identical. This will prevent any
</I>&gt;<i> single admin from tampering with the vote. * (This is for large
</I>&gt;<i> operations, for smaller operations an alternative will be worked out.)*
</I>&gt;<i> - It should be so secure that even a server admin cannot hack the voting
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>&gt;<i> - Option to use Security tokens&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> or SMS
</I>&gt;<i> - More details must be worked out
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> **Voting along party lines *
</I>&gt;<i>     As most users don't have time to research and vote on every issue they
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to subscribe to a virtual political party that will
</I>&gt;<i> automatically vote for them. The user can override and unsubscribe from that
</I>&gt;<i> political party at any time. Additionally any user can create a political
</I>&gt;<i> party. Similar to a podcast.
</I>&gt;<i>   Users could also choose to align themselves with different parties on
</I>&gt;<i> different issues. For example a man who is conservative on immigration,
</I>&gt;<i> economy, and gay marriage, but liberal about everything else. Could choose
</I>&gt;<i> to align himself with conservative parties for those three issues and a
</I>&gt;<i> liberal party for every other issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The Plan**:
</I>&gt;<i> *    To assemble a team of programmers to live together communally and
</I>&gt;<i> work full time on developing the software. A house(in Chicago) and funding
</I>&gt;<i> for food and basic needs have already been setup. The team will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> live expense free and work solely on the project. All we need now are
</I>&gt;<i> programmers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *If you are interested in joining this team in Chicago or working on the
</I>&gt;<i> project remotely please contact*
