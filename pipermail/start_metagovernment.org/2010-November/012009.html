WHat you say above speaks to a core aspect of Metagovernment. Very  
frequently, when I discuss the concept with others and the idea of a  
consensus decision-rule comes up, their reaction is: &quot;But government  
will be gridlocked! How can we pass any laws if we have to have  
widespread agreement on them first?&quot;

And my reply is, basically: Why do we need so many laws?

But even more deeply: How can we pass laws that *don't* have  
widespread support?
