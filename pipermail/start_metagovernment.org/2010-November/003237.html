I think a home page redesign competition would be a wonderful idea.  
Several months ago I effectively made an &quot;entry&quot; in the competition  
with:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-06/v2</A>
It's not really what I wanted to say, but it's a start.

As you suggest, it doesn't have to be a strict winner-takes-all sort  
of competition. But it would be wonderful if several people make  
whatever design they want and then we all talk about them and see if  
we want to adopt one or perhaps blend two or more.

I suggest that entries be made in the form of:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign/YourName">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign/YourName</A>
then add your entry (or entries) to a new page called:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign</A>
