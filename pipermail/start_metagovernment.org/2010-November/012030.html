<PRE>I've submitted a proposal too, at
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign-4">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign-4</A>

My feeling is that the Main Page should still state, first and foremost,
what the project is and its reason for being. This probably goes against
what I've said previously about attracting and persuading first-time
visitors, but the main page has represent something for returning and
regular visitors too.

I think the arguments used in Ed's &quot;Version 2&quot; are valid and even essential
in gaining people's interest. But when I read that page I immediately
imagine it as the script for a video which has the aim of persuading people
to visit the site. Regardless of what we decide for the front page, I think
a video is something we should create and spread through facebook and the
other social networks.

My sections &quot;Collaborative, not representative&quot; and &quot;Overcoming divided
interests&quot; also fall into this category of 'arguments for Metagovernment',
and could also be incorporated elesewhere.

I agree with Richard that, for the sake of focus, the list of participating
projects should be linked to, but not displayed, on the main page.

I've added an explicit reference to the FAQ and Map of the site to help
people find their way around the site. These links are in the side bar
already, but I never saw them there.

&gt;<i> It seems to me (or at least I hope) the text overstates the case a bit,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I am not necessarily adverse to a bit of exaggeration -- if the
</I>&gt;<i> effect might be to engage some folks who might not otherwise take notice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Substantively, as I've stated before, I'd rather focus on longer-term goals
</I>&gt;<i> and particularly shorter-term objectives (action) rather than on &quot;policy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So instead of saying &quot;People work on issues they care about, and if they
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> build a consensus, then a policy is made,&quot; I'd prefer to say: &quot;People
</I>&gt;<i> document their objectives, discover others who share their objectives, and
</I>&gt;<i> work directly together to refine them and to marshal the resources to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve them.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what it means to &quot;work on issues&quot; if not in pursuit of common
</I>&gt;<i> objectives, and it seems to me that &quot;policy&quot; is usually about trying to

</I>&gt;<i> do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My hypothesis is that it would be better (more productive) just to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> shared objectives and less on &quot;policies&quot; (beyond the basic statement of
</I>&gt;<i> values, i.e., principles, shared by members of the virtual community).

</I>&gt;<i> I liked elements of both of your entries, so I smushed them together
</I>&gt;<i> with some light editing.  But since I mostly copied existing, I'll
</I>&gt;<i> list the changes I made ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * New logo -- easier to read, removes duplicate &quot;government&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> * Bullet points at top, meat at the bottom.  Easy to start reading,
</I>&gt;<i> and there's more on the front-page to chew upon.
</I>&gt;<i> * Removed the inline list of participating projects, kept the link.
</I>&gt;<i> More of a focus issue than anything else - if you're trying to explain
</I>&gt;<i> something, then you start talking about a half-dozen other things,
</I>&gt;<i> then you're going to lose people.
</I>&gt;<i> * Facebook link -- I think it would increase discussion overall. &quot;Main
</I>&gt;<i> discussion&quot; can still be the list.  But this removes a big barrier of
</I>&gt;<i> entry for people who don't do email-lists, as most of their
</I>&gt;<i> communication is via mobile devices and social networking hubs.
</I>&gt;<i> * Tone - edited to be a bit more forceful.  Reasons are twofold - I
</I>&gt;<i> think that sometimes perhaps, it could be said that often the right
</I>&gt;<i> amount of confidence holds attention.  By removing weasel-words it's
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to attract the ire of people who want to join just to tell
</I>&gt;<i> us that we're &quot;doing it all wrong&quot;.  Let that be Facebooks bandwidth
</I>&gt;<i> problem, and we'll get better arguments in the end.
