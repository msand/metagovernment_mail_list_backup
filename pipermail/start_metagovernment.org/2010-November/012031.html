<PRE>I liked your proposal a lot, and incorporated some of your changes
into this one:
  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign-5">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2010-redesign-5</A>

The &quot;transition&quot; section is currently the weakest element of the page.
 I think it has a place on the front-page, as it has potential to
stimulate thought, but I feel that it's only &quot;good&quot; rather than
&quot;great&quot;.  Perhaps it's too wall-of-text-y.

I agree - the lack of a mission statement was a definite omission from
redesign-3.  So I stole your first two lines and placed them above the
argument section ;-)

I do feel strongly that at this stage the front page should have one
primary objective - to convert more of the ~100 page hits a day into
participants - and aim to do that as well as possible rather than do
several things not so well.

But what about a &quot;current events/activity/news&quot; page and link to it
from the &quot;more information&quot; section?  Bumping such a feed to the front
page can probably wait until the size of the community/activity level
calls for it.
