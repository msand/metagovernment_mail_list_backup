<PRE>It seems to me (or at least I hope) the text overstates the case a bit,
e.g., with respect to the opening assertion: &quot;In every aspect of social
life, you rely on someone else to make decisions for you.&quot;

However, I am not necessarily adverse to a bit of exaggeration -- if the
effect might be to engage some folks who might not otherwise take notice.

Substantively, as I've stated before, I'd rather focus on longer-term goals
and particularly shorter-term objectives (action) rather than on &quot;policy&quot;.  

So instead of saying &quot;People work on issues they care about, and if they can
build a consensus, then a policy is made,&quot; I'd prefer to say: &quot;People
document their objectives, discover others who share their objectives, and
work directly together to refine them and to marshal the resources to
achieve them.&quot;

I'm not sure what it means to &quot;work on issues&quot; if not in pursuit of common
objectives, and it seems to me that &quot;policy&quot; is usually about trying to
force someone else to do something them may not otherwise be inclined to do.


My hypothesis is that it would be better (more productive) just to focus on
shared objectives and less on &quot;policies&quot; (beyond the basic statement of
values, i.e., principles, shared by members of the virtual community).

I liked elements of both of your entries, so I smushed them together
with some light editing.  But since I mostly copied existing, I'll
list the changes I made ;-)

* New logo -- easier to read, removes duplicate &quot;government&quot;.
* Bullet points at top, meat at the bottom.  Easy to start reading,
and there's more on the front-page to chew upon.
* Removed the inline list of participating projects, kept the link.
More of a focus issue than anything else - if you're trying to explain
something, then you start talking about a half-dozen other things,
then you're going to lose people.
* Facebook link -- I think it would increase discussion overall. &quot;Main
discussion&quot; can still be the list.  But this removes a big barrier of
entry for people who don't do email-lists, as most of their
communication is via mobile devices and social networking hubs.
* Tone - edited to be a bit more forceful.  Reasons are twofold - I
think that sometimes perhaps, it could be said that often the right
amount of confidence holds attention.  By removing weasel-words it's
more likely to attract the ire of people who want to join just to tell
us that we're &quot;doing it all wrong&quot;.  Let that be Facebooks bandwidth
problem, and we'll get better arguments in the end.
