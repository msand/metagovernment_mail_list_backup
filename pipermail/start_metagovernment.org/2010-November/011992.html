We're aiming to put a UI layer over all of e-democracy, one &quot;big tent&quot;
to cover all the separate shows and acts, all the essential tools and
media.  It'll run on mobile devices as well as PC's.  We have nothing
concrete at this point, only the realization that (yes) it's
technically challenging.  Maybe the biggest challenge though is
imagination.  If folks want to help, here's one way:

  Close your eyes, clear your head, and think &quot;politics&quot;.  Over the
  course of your life - not just today, but always - what has politics
  meant to you?  What images come to mind?

    1. 

    2. 

    3. 

Write them down in whatever order they occur to you.  It's the essence
of those things we need to put in the UI, front and center.
