<PRE>Good points, Richard.  

One counterpoint I'd offer is that, while it is good to envision the more
ideal future, it is also good (even better) to deal with reality as it
exists right now, and in that respect, E-Democracy might be a very good way
to characterize (name) our mutual objective.  If the &quot;E&quot; were to become
pass&#233;, that would be a good problem to have.  However, for many, if not most
people in the world, I suspect that problem may not occur within our
lifetimes.

With respect to accountability and power flows, I'm not sure it will ever be
possible to hold truly accountable those to whom we have ceded
disproportionate power -- particularly if we are unwilling or unable to hold
ourselves accountable for that which is within our own power to do for
ourselves.  That's the focus of my series of papers at
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping,">http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping,</A> i.e., why we as human beings may
prefer not to have good records and record-keeping systems.

Regarding power flows more specifically, as a retired Fed with 34 years of
.gov experience, including 14 on Capitol Hill and 7 1/2 as the Congressional
liaison at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, I never cease to be amazed at
how much of our money (and the money of future generations as yet unborn) we
are willing to allow our elected officials to spend so inefficiently and
ineffectively.

It would be good if Metagov applications/services could be productively
employed in support of the mission of the President's National Commission on
Fiscal Responsibility and Reform (NCFRR).  In particular, it would be great
if E-Democracy apps could prohibit the divestiture of power (including
money) from those who have not been given the opportunity to participate
(including the unborn).

The NCFRR Co-Chair's draft proposal is available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRRwStyle.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRRwStyle.xml</A> 

Obviously, this is not just or even primarily a U.S. problem.  God may save
the Queen but can Germany save Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and other nations
of the EU (from themselves)?

Subject: [MG] Distributed Democracy

Through faults entirely my own, I keep missing the window for &quot;is
there a better phrase than open source democracy?&quot; submissions in
vilfredo.  So I'm going to write up a few thoughts here, and if they
gain any traction, and if there's another proposal round in the
vilfredo vote, then I'll try and add it then.

I like &quot;Open Democracy&quot;, and I'd be happy to use it more than &quot;Open
Source Democracy&quot;, which is descriptive only through an implicit
understanding of open source software models.  The one issue I have
with it is in the form of the rebuttal -- &quot;But our democratic
practices are open already, you can run for office and you can vote!&quot;
So then you're left with the nuance - well actually, by &quot;Open
Democracy&quot; we mean that power is decentralised as much as possible and
we're using technology to achieve this.  And you can cite high
barriers of participation and so forth.  But as the political phrase
goes: &quot;if you're defending, then you're losing&quot;.

I liked &quot;E-Democracy&quot; for a while, and certainly it has some use today
in discussions, but it's too easily confused with E-Voting.  Also, it
doesn't have longevity.  If we envision a future where all forms of
democracy are computerised/electronic, then appending the &quot;E-&quot; prefix
will become meaningless and redundant.  In addition, my personal
feeling is that the one-letter prefix i-this and e-that will quickly
be seen as a hallmark fad of the early 21st century.

The problem as I see it is that Democracy should mean all of these
things that we're trying to distinguish it with, but the term has
become synonymous with expansive representative democracy.
Furthermore, representative democracy isn't all that bad.  We want
people in place who are able to do what the populace can't - which is
to to make certain tough quick decisions in an emergency situation
when there isn't time for prolonged deliberation, while being held
fully accountable for their actions in those rare emergencies.  I
wouldn't expect discussion to ever end on the limits and conditions of
this.

But in almost all cases decision making power flows down, when we
think it should flow up.  A person in power should be tasked with
using that power to enact the will of the all the decision making
entities at a lower level of the pyramid.

Most of the time, the Texas Board of Education would be left to its
own devices - its membership defined only by those interested
stakeholders who choose to participate in its decision-making process.
 But at the end of the day, you'd need some feet on the ground to
perform actions as a result of those decisions.  The US Department of
Education would have much cross-over in membership with the
state-level boards, open to the same rules of membership.  The point
being that many of our hierarchical mechanisms of governance are both
functional as they are disfunctional.  The point being that for
everyday non-controversial issues, the core stakeholders would form
hierarchies naturally, and work with those to get the job done.


&quot;Hierarchically-Distributed Accountable-Representative Democracy&quot;
hardly rolls off the tongue though.

As a term, &quot;Distributed Democracy&quot; strips away the implicit
descriptors of what Democracy should be and those which are redundant
due to the evolution of the popular conception of it is.  You can
describe it in a one-liner as: &quot;Decision making power distributed
amongst all those who wish to take part, however and whenever they
like.&quot;


There is some precedent with a similar term:
<A HREF="http://www.search.com/reference/Dynamically_Distributed_Democracy">http://www.search.com/reference/Dynamically_Distributed_Democracy</A>
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CY/0412047">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CY/0412047</A>

But, the dynamic aspect is implicit and their description defines
implementation-level criteria that are entirely subject to change.

Richard
