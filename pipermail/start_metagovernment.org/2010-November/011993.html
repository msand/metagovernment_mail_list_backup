<PRE> *- Open Source Voting System* -



*The Idea:*

*
*

    To build a modular, open-source, ultra-secure, Internet based voting
system. An extensive API will make it easy for anyone to write modules,
which can be added(and removed) at both user and server admin levels. This
will allow the system to be adaptable and be used by businesses, schools,
unions, legislative bodies etc...


*The Details:*

* *

*  *Because of the great flexibility of the modular system many of the
systems 'details' do not need to be worked out by the system's architects
but will be added in the future by independent module writers. Below are
some of the ideas that should be part of the systems architecture, but could
be turned off depending on the systems intended use.



   - Extremely secure*
   - Modular constriction*
   - Voting along party lines* (As module)
   - Ability for users to confirm their vote
   - Ability for anonymous voting
   - Interactive (Wiki, information about things being voted on pros/cons)
   (As module)
   - Open-source
   - Multi-lingual



          **Modular Construction*
Users and server admins can add and remove modules allowing the system to
change its functionality. An extensive API will exist to allow all sorts of
modules such as genetic algorithms(Vilfredo goes to Athens), social
networks, wiki's, etc...

*
*Extremely secure *
- The ability for anyone to create a vote storing server(VSS). There will be
a public server with a list of IPs of all the VSSs. When a user votes, the
vote will be sent simultaneously to all the VSSs. The VSSs will talk to each
other to make sure the databases are identical. This will prevent any single
admin from tampering with the vote. * (This is for large operations, for
smaller operations an alternative will be worked out.)*
- It should be so secure that even a server admin cannot hack the voting
results.
- Option to use Security tokens&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_token</A>&gt;,
or SMS
- More details must be worked out

**Voting along party lines *
    As most users don't have time to research and vote on every issue they
will be able to subscribe to a virtual political party that will
automatically vote for them. The user can override and unsubscribe from that
political party at any time. Additionally any user can create a political
party. Similar to a podcast.
  Users could also choose to align themselves with different parties on
different issues. For example a man who is conservative on immigration,
economy, and gay marriage, but liberal about everything else. Could choose
to align himself with conservative parties for those three issues and a
liberal party for every other issue.



*The Plan**:
*    To assemble a team of programmers to live together communally and work
full time on developing the software. A house(in Chicago) and funding for
food and basic needs have already been setup. The team will be able to live
expense free and work solely on the project. All we need now are
programmers.

*If you are interested in joining this team in Chicago or working on the
project remotely please contact*
