I liked elements of both of your entries, so I smushed them together
with some light editing.  But since I mostly copied existing, I'll
list the changes I made ;-)

* New logo -- easier to read, removes duplicate &quot;government&quot;.
* Bullet points at top, meat at the bottom.  Easy to start reading,
and there's more on the front-page to chew upon.
* Removed the inline list of participating projects, kept the link.
More of a focus issue than anything else - if you're trying to explain
something, then you start talking about a half-dozen other things,
then you're going to lose people.
* Facebook link -- I think it would increase discussion overall. &quot;Main
discussion&quot; can still be the list.  But this removes a big barrier of
entry for people who don't do email-lists, as most of their
communication is via mobile devices and social networking hubs.
* Tone - edited to be a bit more forceful.  Reasons are twofold - I
think that sometimes perhaps, it could be said that often the right
amount of confidence holds attention.  By removing weasel-words it's
more likely to attract the ire of people who want to join just to tell
us that we're &quot;doing it all wrong&quot;.  Let that be Facebooks bandwidth
problem, and we'll get better arguments in the end.
