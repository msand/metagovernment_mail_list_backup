<PRE>Dear Owen,

good points. Nevertheless, if we have learned one thing out of those
years in Metagovernment, is that the biggest problem for participative
democracy, is that people need to participate.

In a democracy I understand people who refuse to vote on something,
when all the options have been chosen by others, and they had no way
to write their own. But in all the project we have here in
metagovernment (and for sure in Vilfredo) you are allowed to write
your own options. More than that, on Vilfredo we make sure this is
done in a fair way by not permitting anyone to vote (or read) anything
before time.

If you had such a strong position on something, would it not have made
sense to write it, so that we could all have voted it, instead of
taking the position of the person who just says: &quot;you might all agree
but this does not represent me!&quot; ?

Now the voting time is over, And we have reached a very skinny
agreement. I would suggest that you write your proposal there, showing
that the agreement is all but permanent.

Regards,
Pietro

P.S. Also, may I suggest that you send your replies to me on posts I
write in the mailing list to the mailing list itself. I think it would
make the whole process more transparent.
