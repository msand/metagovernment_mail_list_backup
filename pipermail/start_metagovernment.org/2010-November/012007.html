<PRE>There was some discussion off-list about how to implement a private
voting option within an open architecture that is based (by default)
on public voting.  Thomas and I had been mooting the design of a
&quot;proxy blind&quot; for this purpose back in January.  With Thomas's
permission, I've updated the wiki to add the results of that earlier
discussion, including the text of our private emails, in case anyone
else wants to join in the design effort.

<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Proxy_blind">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Proxy_blind</A>
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A proxy blind is a proposed method for implmenenting a private voting
option. It works by splitting the registrant's identity in two: 1) a
registration ID and 2) a voting ID or proxy. The equivalence of the
two ID's is a secret between the registrant and registrar (the
blind). The identity of the voter, as such, is therefore unknown to
anyone else.

No design sketch has been attempted yet. See the design discussions
under <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Streetwiki#Proxy_blind">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Streetwiki#Proxy_blind</A>
from which these notes are excerpted:

  * User registers under R-email, which gets trust from neighbours.
    Neighbours say that R-email is not a sock puppet.

  * User votes under V-email, which is vouched by registrar.

  * Only registrar knows that R and V-email belong to same person.

  * User promises never to vote using R-email.  Registrar checks now
    and again to confirm that R-email never votes.

  So you can never vote with R-email or do anything else that ties it
  to V-email.  You have two registrations in streetwiki:

    R-reg: R-email + street address (real)

    V-reg: V-email + street address (surrogate) + personal identifiers
           (OpenID and so forth) for other voting engines

  We have to be clear about the problems - basically that we cannot
  *really* assure them of privacy yet.  Otherwise, if we give the
  wrong intial impression, it will be difficult to defend the
  technology from attacks in the mass media.

 a) Streetwiki with trust network, to

       i) Verify residential address, and

      ii) Verify honesty of (b) and (c);

 b) Additional registries to authenticate residential address by other
    schemes, including by authority; and

 c) Proxy blind to keep registration and voter ID's separate, if
    that's what a user wants.
