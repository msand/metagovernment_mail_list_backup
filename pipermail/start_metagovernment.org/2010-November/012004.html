<PRE>Owen,
what I am personally interested in is the process that leads n people
with different ideas to find their common position.

Vilfredo could support xml, and then StraML would come as a corollary.
It would need someone to code it though. If you are willing to do that
(or pay for someone to do it), I am happy to encode the changes from
the code into Vilfredo. There is nothing wrong in paying someone to
code our ideas. I do it often, as I have more ideas than time.
Entering into your other critics:

&gt;<i> [I agree that participation is important but do not believe it should be
</I>&gt;<i> *imposed*. &#160;Individuals should be free to choose to engage in the pursuit of
</I>&gt;<i> any lawful objective *they* choose, wherever and whenever *they* choose.]
</I>

Sure, provided they don't after protest because the result is not what
they wanted.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [I view this not as a matter of transparency but, rather, courtesy. &#160;I know
</I>&gt;<i> that I've seen a lot of traffic on this listserv that has been of relatively
</I>&gt;<i> little interest to me. &#160;In fact, I often think about unsubscribing for that
</I>&gt;<i> reason. &#160;I have no desire to try to impose my views upon those who do not
</I>&gt;<i> wish to have them (or at least not to hear them yet again). &#160;With apologies
</I>&gt;<i> to those who may fall into that category, I offer these comments for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever they may be worth ... and, once again, I encourage subscribers to
</I>&gt;<i> this listserv to focus first on the data (i.e., an open, standard format
</I>&gt;<i> like StratML) rather than the software. &#160;(The software should be fungible,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas the data (records) should be reasonably well standardized,
</I>&gt;<i> completely &quot;open&quot; (not subject to any &quot;proprietary&quot; dependencies) and
</I>&gt;<i> relatively persistent and accessible.)]
</I>
Here we disagree. I think the algorithm is the key problem: how do you
integrate different perspective?

The comes the software, because having a running example that works
seamlessly so well that millions of people will want to use it for
every possible discussion they might have, is (according to me) the
easiest way to make our idea known, and used.

I know you don't see it this way. My only issue was not to protest if
you have no proposal that fits you.
Vilfredo follows the process: Write, vote, write, vote.

opposed to normal democracies that follow:
someone writes, vote, protest,

We don't keep a protest phase once the citizen has the right to
participate in the procedure.

Pietro
