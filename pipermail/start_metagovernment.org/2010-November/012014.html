&gt;<i>From the vantage of a new user, this is confusing considering my
</I>possible biases toward the words 'Open' and 'Democracy' and would make
me wonder about the domain name considering OpenDemocracy.org (which
redirects to OpenDemocracy.net)...

The list of projects on the wiki shows we are doing part of what I see
as the idea of Meta somehow taking us 'above'  any one approach toward
a position of arbitration and a sort of objective base for comparison
and remixing of ideas from every user.

So I think it would be best if *every* user could easily make their
own 'projects' that can borrow and modify ideas from others and where
they could &quot;show off&quot; their success or failure.

I am also working on an idea for Civilization Modeling (such as those
covered by &quot;Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation&quot;
[JASSS.SOC.Surrey.ac.uk]).

In the environment I envision, users could interact with the system in
2 possible ways:

1.) As 'Agents' in the simulation (there would be no artificial
Agents).  This would initially be about the same as a free-form 3D
Chat system, but one where your Agent must eat, drink, sleep, excrete,
etc., and via for Land and Capital to accomplish those goals.

2.) Users can submit a sort of &quot;Constitution&quot; or &quot;Laws&quot; or &quot;Terms of
Operation&quot; that they propose other Agents apply to their co-owned
property.  If these documents are written in a very high-level
language (VHLL), we could eventually understand enough to apply them
to simple artificial Agents and then be able to watch how different
proposals shape the way we organize.
