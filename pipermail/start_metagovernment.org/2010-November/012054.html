<PRE>Ed and Richard (and a question for all),

It's been called &quot;recombinant text&quot;.  It's interesting to see it
growing in the wild.

</I>
I agree.  I think it's better to start free-form, like you did in that
thread &quot;Home page redesign competition&quot;.  Ideally you shouldn't have
to uproot that process in order to tool it up, but rather the tools
should come to you.  I think that's possible with &quot;free-range
drafting&quot;.  We could maybe code a prototype of that next month if
there's sufficient need or interest.  You could then hook into the
open voting network (Outcast) without having to transfer your drafts
to a different wiki.  You'd then gain access to the difference bridge,
which would give you the kind of branching/merging support that
Richard mentions below.

Secondly, you'd gain the ability to vote.  You could use any
voteserver that's hooked into the voting network (or any server at all
if we can mirror its votes by guerilla techniques).  However the
purpose of voting is not to pick a winner, but rather to channel the
flow of amendments through a network of discussion cells, each a
staging area for a potential, emerging synthesis.  The entire
population of texts evolves in that process.

Lastly, hooking into the open voting network would give you visibility
in crossforum theatre: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/</A>
It's going to be a kind of marquee or umbrella UI over the entire
network.  (Our programmer said he can probably support Mailman lists
in the prototype.)

None of this is Votorola per se.  It's just that none of the other
projects has taken an interest in coding the early prototypes, so we
Votorolans do it alone.  (But that's probably my fault for labelling
it an &quot;open architecture&quot;, when &quot;open network&quot; is more appealing to
developers, and more accurate.)

(sorry for the long reply)

They also lack a good cherry-picking facility.  You can't predictably
pull that one &quot;tiny edit&quot; from another drafter's text without getting
a string of other edits attached to it.  That's one of the advantages
of employing a difference bridge.  (If you login under alias 'a' or
'b' here, you can play with the patch controls:

  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3355&amp;a=3220">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3355&amp;a=3220</A>
  
But the big advantage is to rationalize the discussion by centering it
on concrete differences of position.  The bridge makes it easier to
say things like, &quot;Hey B, What do you think of this amendment?&quot;
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3355&amp;a=3220#_2">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3355&amp;a=3220#_2</A>

If B likes it, he can press the Patch button.  Otherwise he can state
his reasons against it.  So it goes.  The edit naturally propagates
throughout the population of drafts, except where it is opposed by
reasons.


Question: Is &quot;Outcast&quot; a good name for an open voting network?
