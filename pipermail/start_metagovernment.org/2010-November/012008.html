<PRE>Owen, just one point,
but an important one:

&gt;<i> Pietro, with apologies to those who may not care to have them, see my
</I>&gt;<i> further responses to your new points below in [[double brackets]].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Owen
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> ... My only issue was not to protest if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have no proposal that fits you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not &quot;protesting&quot; but merely stating that I choose not to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> which CMS YOU choose to use ...
</I>
Even though I wrote the question, the question was not by me, and was
not about what CMS should &quot;I&quot; use.
The question was about metagovernment.  We decided to ask the question
together in a metting,
<A HREF="http://piratepad.net/fiuASvRqss">http://piratepad.net/fiuASvRqss</A>
and we decided at the time to use Vilfredo because it was an open
question. Not because it was the best system, but because being an
open question Vilfredo showed that it can somehow work. I was asked to
write it down on behalf of the group.
You are subscribed to the metagovernment list and as such question
might, should and would affect you.
For example, you say you find there are plenty of discussion that you
are not interested in. Well, the CMS we use is partially responsible
for that. If we had a discussion board, for example, you would not
need to receive email on topics you do not care.

&gt;<i>From my point of view raising the issue of &quot;people are discussing of
</I>things I do not care&quot;, and then not participating in the discussion on
the format the discussion should take is a contradiction.

The question remained dormant for some time, and then it was revived
when Zury Asse suggested a change of CMS.


</PRE>
