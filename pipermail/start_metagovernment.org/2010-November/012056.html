&gt;<i> Through faults entirely my own, I keep missing the window for &quot;is
</I>&gt;<i> there a better phrase than open source democracy?&quot; submissions in
</I>&gt;<i> vilfredo.  So I'm going to write up a few thoughts here, and if they
</I>&gt;<i> gain any traction, and if there's another proposal round in the
</I>&gt;<i> vilfredo vote, then I'll try and add it then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like &quot;Open Democracy&quot;, and I'd be happy to use it more than &quot;Open
</I>&gt;<i> Source Democracy&quot;, which is descriptive only through an implicit
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of open source software models.  The one issue I have
</I>&gt;<i> with it is in the form of the rebuttal -- &quot;But our democratic
</I>&gt;<i> practices are open already, you can run for office and you can vote!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> So then you're left with the nuance - well actually, by &quot;Open
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy&quot; we mean that power is decentralised as much as possible and
</I>&gt;<i> we're using technology to achieve this.  And you can cite high
</I>&gt;<i> barriers of participation and so forth.  But as the political phrase
</I>&gt;<i> goes: &quot;if you're defending, then you're losing&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I liked &quot;E-Democracy&quot; for a while, and certainly it has some use today
</I>&gt;<i> in discussions, but it's too easily confused with E-Voting.  Also, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have longevity.  If we envision a future where all forms of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy are computerised/electronic, then appending the &quot;E-&quot; prefix
</I>&gt;<i> will become meaningless and redundant.  In addition, my personal
</I>&gt;<i> feeling is that the one-letter prefix i-this and e-that will quickly
</I>&gt;<i> be seen as a hallmark fad of the early 21st century.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem as I see it is that Democracy should mean all of these
</I>&gt;<i> things that we're trying to distinguish it with, but the term has
</I>&gt;<i> become synonymous with expansive representative democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, representative democracy isn't all that bad.  We want
</I>&gt;<i> people in place who are able to do what the populace can't - which is
</I>&gt;<i> to to make certain tough quick decisions in an emergency situation
</I>&gt;<i> when there isn't time for prolonged deliberation, while being held
</I>&gt;<i> fully accountable for their actions in those rare emergencies.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't expect discussion to ever end on the limits and conditions of
</I>&gt;<i> this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in almost all cases decision making power flows down, when we
</I>&gt;<i> think it should flow up.  A person in power should be tasked with
</I>&gt;<i> using that power to enact the will of the all the decision making
</I>&gt;<i> entities at a lower level of the pyramid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the time, the Texas Board of Education would be left to its
</I>&gt;<i> own devices - its membership defined only by those interested
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders who choose to participate in its decision-making process.
</I>&gt;<i>  But at the end of the day, you'd need some feet on the ground to
</I>&gt;<i> perform actions as a result of those decisions.  The US Department of
</I>&gt;<i> Education would have much cross-over in membership with the
</I>&gt;<i> state-level boards, open to the same rules of membership.  The point
</I>&gt;<i> being that many of our hierarchical mechanisms of governance are both
</I>&gt;<i> functional as they are disfunctional.  The point being that for
</I>&gt;<i> everyday non-controversial issues, the core stakeholders would form
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies naturally, and work with those to get the job done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hierarchically-Distributed Accountable-Representative Democracy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> hardly rolls off the tongue though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a term, &quot;Distributed Democracy&quot; strips away the implicit
</I>&gt;<i> descriptors of what Democracy should be and those which are redundant
</I>&gt;<i> due to the evolution of the popular conception of it is.  You can
</I>&gt;<i> describe it in a one-liner as: &quot;Decision making power distributed
</I>&gt;<i> amongst all those who wish to take part, however and whenever they
</I>&gt;<i> like.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is some precedent with a similar term:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.search.com/reference/Dynamically_Distributed_Democracy">http://www.search.com/reference/Dynamically_Distributed_Democracy</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CY/0412047">http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CY/0412047</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, the dynamic aspect is implicit and their description defines
</I>&gt;<i> implementation-level criteria that are entirely subject to change.
