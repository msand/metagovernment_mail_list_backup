<PRE>Hi RIchard,
I am a bit worried by:

On 27 November 2010 19:58, Richard Franks &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">spontificus at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> Through faults entirely my own, I keep missing the window for &quot;is

</I>
As the person representing Vilfredo here I would like to understand
what can we do to make sure that you, and people like you do not miss
the various phases. Do you receive an email when the question moves to
the next phase?
If you do not, is this because you have not added your email address?
Or it is because you did not vote?

If you do not vote you can still receive the email, if you click on
the subscribe to this question &quot;button&quot;.

Please let me know if there is anything you think we could do to make
sure that you are aware of when is the right time to write proposals.
The line between spamming users, and keeping them unaware of what is
going on is sometimes a thin one. Maybe we need to send more emails?

Cheers,
Pietro
