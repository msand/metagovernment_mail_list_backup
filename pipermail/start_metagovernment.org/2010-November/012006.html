Owen,
what I am personally interested in is the process that leads n people
with different ideas to find their common position.

[[Your objective is different than mine.  That's a point I've been trying to
make in some of my postings on this listserv:  It is not clear that many of
us share common objectives.  A lot of points of view have been aired but not
many common objectives have been identified, much less accomplished.]]

Vilfredo could support xml, and then StraML would come as a corollary.
It would need someone to code it though. If you are willing to do that
(or pay for someone to do it), I am happy to encode the changes from
the code into Vilfredo. There is nothing wrong in paying someone to
code our ideas. I do it often, as I have more ideas than time.
Entering into your other critics:

[[I am conducting my efforts strictly on a voluntary basis, with no intent
of profiting personally.  I have little incentive to pay anyone else to do
anything they may not otherwise desire to do anyway.  However, I am very
interested in working with those who share my objectives -- not because they
are &quot;mine&quot; but because we hold them in common.]] 

&gt;<i> [I agree that participation is important but do not believe it should be
</I>&gt;<i> *imposed*. &#160;Individuals should be free to choose to engage in the pursuit
</I>of
&gt;<i> any lawful objective *they* choose, wherever and whenever *they* choose.]
</I>
Sure, provided they don't after protest because the result is not what
they wanted.

[[My assumption is that they will not be affected by the proposed action
and, thus, may not care about the result.  I also believe the instances in
which results affect individuals without their consent should be fairly
limited.]]

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [I view this not as a matter of transparency but, rather, courtesy. &#160;I
</I>know
&gt;<i> that I've seen a lot of traffic on this listserv that has been of
</I>relatively
&gt;<i> little interest to me. &#160;In fact, I often think about unsubscribing for
</I>that
&gt;<i> reason. &#160;I have no desire to try to impose my views upon those who do not
</I>&gt;<i> wish to have them (or at least not to hear them yet again). &#160;With
</I>apologies
&gt;<i> to those who may fall into that category, I offer these comments for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever they may be worth ... and, once again, I encourage subscribers to
</I>&gt;<i> this listserv to focus first on the data (i.e., an open, standard format
</I>&gt;<i> like StratML) rather than the software. &#160;(The software should be fungible,
</I>&gt;<i> whereas the data (records) should be reasonably well standardized,
</I>&gt;<i> completely &quot;open&quot; (not subject to any &quot;proprietary&quot; dependencies) and
</I>&gt;<i> relatively persistent and accessible.)]
</I>
Here we disagree. I think the algorithm is the key problem: how do you
integrate different perspective?

[[You are trying to do more than I at this point.  All that I am trying to
do is to make it easier for those who already do have common personal
values, goals, and objectives to more easily discover each other and,
hopefully, act more effectively together to realize their shared objectives.
That is not to minimize the importance of what you are trying to do, merely
to note that it is not MY objective at this point.]]

The comes the software, because having a running example that works
seamlessly so well that millions of people will want to use it for
every possible discussion they might have, is (according to me) the
easiest way to make our idea known, and used.

[[I wish you every success in your endeavor.  Perhaps someday your software
might help me accomplish my goals and objectives.]]

I know you don't see it this way. My only issue was not to protest if
you have no proposal that fits you.
Vilfredo follows the process: Write, vote, write, vote.

[[I am not &quot;protesting&quot; but merely stating that I choose not to vote on
which CMS YOU choose to use ... because I choose not to use any CMS for the
purpose of enabling individuals to express their own goals and objectives
anywhere on the Web that THEY choose.  They may choose to re-write their own
goal and objective statements, particularly in response to input and
feedback from their stakeholders.  Indeed, the reason I subscribed to this
listserv was to explore prospects for using Metascore to enable stakeholder
feedback on goals and objectives of interest to them.  However, in many
instances, it is not necessary to try to achieve consensus among those who
disagree in order to make progress by working together with those who
already do agree on particular objectives.  It certainly should not be
necessary for individuals to use any particular CMS to discover and work
together with those who share their objectives.]]

opposed to normal democracies that follow:
someone writes, vote, protest,

[[It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government ... except
for all the others.  <A HREF="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/364.html">http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/364.html</A> However,
in my view, the very concept of &quot;governance&quot; has been greatly oversold.  Not
only has it moved fairly far beyond necessity in many cases but it also
creates a perverse incentive by implicitly relieving individuals of
responsibility for themselves, their own families, and communities. (As if
only others could see it their way, we could all live in harmony and
everything would be wonderful.)  What I am pursuing is not another form of
government, which implies coercion to a greater or lesser degree, but a
better way for individuals to work together of their own free will ... to
achieve goals and objectives on which they *already* agree. If and when that
becomes very easy to do, anywhere and anytime, the need for &quot;governance&quot; can
be put into more proper perspective and, hopefully, with the benefit of that
perspective, we can move on to more difficult problems like those you and
others on this listserv are aiming to address, e.g., when it is necessary
and, if so, how best to &quot;enforce&quot; consensus and/or roll roughshod over those
who disagree.]]

We don't keep a protest phase once the citizen has the right to
participate in the procedure.

Pietro
