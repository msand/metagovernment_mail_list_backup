I once got into a prolonged argument over the fact that any electronic form
of democracy would disenfranchise the computer illiterate and those without
full time access to computers - as such these problems should be addressed
first.  Never mind the faults of our own democratic systems,  many of which
actively disenfranchised women, the illiterate and poor when they came into
being.

I don't know why that rebuttal failed to stick, but I definitely think we
should emphasize MG as an incremental improvement rather than a joyride to
utopia.


I am open to suggestions for how we can market more effectively. I'm getting
&gt;<i> people to the site, but as we've noted before, it's message still isn't
</I>&gt;<i> working. We may just have to prove ourselves before anyone will believe us,
</I>&gt;<i> but... it would be nice if we could make our case more effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>

In all honesty, I think the homepage sucks now.  I don't know what happened.
 Compare the current page:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page</A>

with an old one I picked at random:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=1024">http://www.metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=1024</A>

It has the Jefferson quote, which initially inspired me.  It has a
semi-rambling -but engaging- discussion of basic principles.  It gives just
enough ideas to chew upon to make you hungry for more.  It's not perfect,
but it is inviting.

I'm not altogether convinced that we should &quot;eat our own dogfood&quot; with
regards the front-page.  It's an issue of design.  Of art, even.  It needs a
&quot;big picture&quot; vision.  You cannot evolve towards that through line-by-line
edits by individuals with different perspectives.  To that end, I think we
should hold a little competition to redesign it, then see if we can't get
consensus on which direction to go in.

Also, I don't think you can do much to increase list-serv traffic without a
wider audience.  People are now less likely to join a mailing list, than
they are to click &quot;Join our Group&quot; and connect via Facebook.  It's not an
ideal platform by any stretch of the imagination, but it could run in
parallel to the mailing list, and serve to cultivate interest.  Or at the
very least expose some of the basic principles of Metagovernment to many
more people.
