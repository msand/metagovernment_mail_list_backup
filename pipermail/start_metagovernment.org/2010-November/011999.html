Dear Owen,

good points. Nevertheless, if we have learned one thing out of those
years in Metagovernment, is that the biggest problem for participative
democracy, is that people need to participate.

[I agree that participation is important but do not believe it should be
*imposed*.  Individuals should be free to choose to engage in the pursuit of
any lawful objective *they* choose, wherever and whenever *they* choose.]

In a democracy I understand people who refuse to vote on something,
when all the options have been chosen by others, and they had no way
to write their own. But in all the project we have here in
metagovernment (and for sure in Vilfredo) you are allowed to write
your own options. More than that, on Vilfredo we make sure this is
done in a fair way by not permitting anyone to vote (or read) anything
before time.

[I commend you for trying to make Vilfredo as flexible as possible.
However, as I am sure you know, you still have a long way to go in that
regard. In particular, no one should be required to use your software or
anyone else's software to document their own goals and objectives.  I
believe we can do far better than that, e.g., by using the StratML standard
to enable individuals to document their own goals/objectives anywhere on the
Web and building applications and services leveraging the data contained in
those &quot;plans&quot;.]

If you had such a strong position on something, would it not have made
sense to write it, so that we could all have voted it, instead of
taking the position of the person who just says: &quot;you might all agree
but this does not represent me!&quot; ?

[I *have* been doing this, both on this listserv as well as on the
applications hosted by other subscribers to this listserv and in myriad
other places on the Web.  You can be certain I will continue to do so.
However, I will also try to be judicious in the avoidance of attempting to
impose my views upon those who may not wish to hear them (or at least may
think they've already heard enough from me).]

Now the voting time is over, And we have reached a very skinny
agreement. I would suggest that you write your proposal there, showing
that the agreement is all but permanent.

[If I thought it were worth my time and trouble, I would want to do so.
However, at this point, I cannot make that judgment.  If you have any plans
to incorporate the StratML standard into Vilfredo, that would certainly
change my perspective.]

Regards,
Pietro

P.S. Also, may I suggest that you send your replies to me on posts I
write in the mailing list to the mailing list itself. I think it would
make the whole process more transparent.

[I view this not as a matter of transparency but, rather, courtesy.  I know
that I've seen a lot of traffic on this listserv that has been of relatively
little interest to me.  In fact, I often think about unsubscribing for that
reason.  I have no desire to try to impose my views upon those who do not
wish to have them (or at least not to hear them yet again).  With apologies
to those who may fall into that category, I offer these comments for
whatever they may be worth ... and, once again, I encourage subscribers to
this listserv to focus first on the data (i.e., an open, standard format
like StratML) rather than the software.  (The software should be fungible,
whereas the data (records) should be reasonably well standardized,
completely &quot;open&quot; (not subject to any &quot;proprietary&quot; dependencies) and
relatively persistent and accessible.)]
