<PRE>Hey everyone,
Hi Michael,
Hi Thomas,
Hi Ed,
Hi Pietro,
Hi Alex,
Hi Thomas,

with some friends of mine, we try to create ad &quot;coding school for kids&quot;.
We are half a dozen people and we didn't want to have a boss, so we came up
with a system how to manage the &quot;company&quot; (which we call network).
So we started with everyone having the same amount of Points (which are
shares) and determine how much money everyone gets if there is revenue -
it's distributed based on the shares you currently have. (We call them
Points - Reputation Points)

Everything we do is based on a web platform were everyone can create TASKS
and attach a &quot;price&quot; in points to it, then others can vote on the task
which the &quot;executors&quot; earn when they finish the task.

Everyone who voted with less than the &quot;median guy&quot; on tasks will pay a
penalty into a pool which is evenly distributed to everyone.

*What do you think of this system?*

For details, check out:

2. <A HREF="https://www.ethercalc.org/rnk82r04zm">https://www.ethercalc.org/rnk82r04zm</A> (this link contains some scenario
calculations)

*It feels to be very scalable and we couldn't figure out a way how to &quot;game
the system&quot;.*

things, no matter what kinds of words i did use(e.g. &quot;always&quot;, &quot;never&quot;,
&quot;impossible&quot;, &quot;waste of time&quot;, ....).*

*Such extreme words only do indicate, that my experience/opinion on
something is very strong and i currently cannot imagine that there are
other possibilities until new arguments/insights/whatever open my eyes that
there are alternative perspectives too :-)Please do not feel discouraged to
challenge my opinion if you have a different one.*
