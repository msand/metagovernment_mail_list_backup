<PRE>I'm glad this is a functioning system now, congrats Scott for seeing it
through this far. I've signed up now and will be voting on a few proposals
soon.

I had a couple comments about the profile questionnaire. Questions like
&quot;Can be somewhat careless&quot; or &quot; Is sometimes shy&quot; seem out of place for the
ranking system, weird to have a strong reaction to something that's
&quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot;. Strongly agree that sometimes I'm shy. See what
I'm saying?

Question 41 tripped me up &quot;Has few artistic interests&quot; I read &quot;Has a few
artistic interests&quot; which changes the context completely. Might want to
rephrase that as I suspect others might screw that up and not realize.

I'm also curious how the second half of the questionnaire will work as
those answers are subjective dependant on your circumstance and locality.
Like I don't have a strong opinion on children's health because I don't
have kids, I have no idea if we're spending too much or too little in the
area. If I lived on the farm my opinion of government infrastructure would
be different than if I lived in the city.

Finally, I don't know if this is an observed phenomenon but I caught myself
being more conservative with my assessment of traits early on not venturing
past a little agree or disagree but by the end, I felt more comfortable
picking the strong options. Just something to keep in mind maybe.

The site looks nice overall, few other comments but I'll save those for the
forum maybe.

&gt;<i> OK, we've let representative democracy thrash around for long enough

</I>&gt;<i> a new decision-making system that can replace it: Democracy by Matched
</I>&gt;<i> Proxy. An alpha-test version of this new system can now be found at:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me">https://www.proxyfor.me</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most important thing for everyone to do is register (log in) and
</I>&gt;<i> then fill out your profile. Then vote on whichever proposals you find
</I>&gt;<i> interesting and/or important (the system has been preloaded with about
</I>&gt;<i> a dozen of them, with another couple dozen already in the development
</I>&gt;<i> queue). I'd recommend *not voting* on at least one upcoming proposal
</I>&gt;<i> so that you can test the automated proxy calculation: You'll get
</I>&gt;<i> reminders by email each week telling you what your proxy vote will be
</I>&gt;<i> if you haven't cast a direct vote, and because this is the way
</I>&gt;<i> (eventually) the vast majority of The People's votes will be cast it's
</I>&gt;<i> important that it works well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can post and/or cite after voting, that'd be great too as we
</I>&gt;<i> need some content to help incoming voters make their decisions. Note
</I>&gt;<i> that although the UI is still just alpha-test and so may change, the
</I>&gt;<i> intention is to keep the data (proposals, votes, and posts) live all
</I>&gt;<i> the way through to production use (i.e., your votes and posts may be
</I>&gt;<i> used by thousand or even millions of others as this project scales
</I>&gt;<i> up). If you're multilingual, please consider making a post in some
</I>&gt;<i> language other than English. Even better would be a multi-language
</I>&gt;<i> post where you include the translation(s) for us so that we can get
</I>&gt;<i> some idea how well automated translation tools work for this type of
</I>&gt;<i> content (e.g., try <A HREF="http://translate.google.com,">http://translate.google.com,</A> which if there is
</I>&gt;<i> enough interest could be integrated into the app).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback can be provided directly to me, to this list, or on the new
</I>&gt;<i> forum (which is also the place to debate the proposals if you're
</I>&gt;<i> having trouble making up your mind):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/forum/">http://www.matchism.org/forum/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't cross-post this announcement outside of this list/group
</I>&gt;<i> at this point because we need to get some benchmarks on how much
</I>&gt;<i> server resources we'll be needing to scale up first. Once we get to a
</I>&gt;<i> 1.0 release, though, we hope that you will be able to help spread the
