</I>&gt;<i> Ok, individually their do big mistakes. But are there mistakes (use your

IMHO definitely not, at least not if what you're measuring are
outcomes rather than making some sort of objective measurements (i.e.,
put every individual in the population in an fMRI scanner and see what
they *really* think/feel). If the latter were translated directly into
public policy decisions you'd end up with the Matchism-prescribed
society (albeit because of the aggregation step it would be a kind of
majority-rules kind of place which some people on this list would find
unacceptable, at least on a philosophical basis if not on a practical
one).

But the problem with our current decisionmaking and government systems
is that not only are they poor at performing the measurements you
propose (i.e., most people don't even vote, and even those that do
often make logical errors even when they intend to vote their morals,
not to mention the issue of them not even being offered the choices
that would truly match their morals or their rational analysis), but
also that most decisionmaking is done outside of even that poor
measurement system (i.e., by SDAPs in the judicial and executive
branches).

Again, I'm not sure where you're going with this, but I'm pretty sure
you lack the technology you need to get there. Proxyfor.me might be a
part of what  you need, but even it only relies on sampling instead of
aggregation and it also has *overriding* morals with rational analysis
whenever possible as one of its design goals. A system that tries to
use moral codes directly for decisionmaking I can only think would
quickly degenerate into a true mob-rule society (e.g, 50% of the
population would become activated authoritarian, the very definition
of a &quot;mob&quot;).
