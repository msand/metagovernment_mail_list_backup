<PRE>As we near release of proxyfor.me I wanted to link to that essay I
wrote for The Next System competition and asked them for a status
update on the judging for that. They told me that the winners and
runners up have all been contacted and they're now editing the entries
for publication on their site. Which I guess means that none of us
placed ;-)

Not that I'm disappointed, actually: Despite claiming to be an
organization of &quot;visionaries&quot;, nothing published on that site rises
above the level of the average blog-entry in terms of actual
implementable proposals for how to fix anything (i.e., IMHO the stuff
they've published so far is about 40% lamentation, 40% handwaving, 10%
recycling of old ideas, and 10% wacko). I think we can safely draw the
conclusion that &quot;revolutionary academic&quot; is an oxymoron.

Or have I missed something? Did anyone else find any proposals on that
site that were &quot;shovel ready&quot;?
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: Interesting discussion on Slashdot yesterday, although of course I
think most of the posters missed the point (yeah, I'll get to the
guerilla marketing later, after the release):
