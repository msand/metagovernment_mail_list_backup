&gt;<i> Where is it that we are using &#8220;consensus&#8221; that you are objecting to? To my understanding, consensus decision-making is about the process; and I think it is what most of us support. It is not about the 51% imposing their will on the 49%, but on building a deliberation process whereby all (or most) involved can live with the solution.
</I>
I asked a *specific* question, and you didn't answer it. Here it is again, FYI:
-- An example from the &quot;Collaborative Government&quot; page
-- <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:</A>
-- &quot;Nobody is expected to participate in each decision, but those who do
-- must come to a consensus or no action is taken.&quot;
-- 
-- What does this mean? Please be specific (i.e., please respond as the
-- social engineer you're claiming to be by participating in this group).

Again, to summarize, what *specifically* has to be the outcome before
you will claim that &quot;consensus&quot; has occurred? If the answer is not &quot;At
least 51% of the people agree on something and the rest can go suck
rocks&quot;, again, you have to stop using the word &quot;consensus&quot; to describe
the outcome of any decisionmaking process.

&gt;<i> To that end, I take exception with focusing on the decision-rule; and prefer the focus on process.
</I>
Great, then you must stop using the term consensus, which is *BY
FUCKING DEFINITION* an outcome, not a process.

&gt;<i> Brexit provides a great example. The British were asked to decide if they should leave or stay in the EU. I find fault with the way this was asked more than the fact that it was passed with a slim majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
There are a whole bunch of things to dislike about that decision ;-)

&gt;<i> What if instead, the British had been asked: &#8220;Many of us have a problem with the effects the EU membership is having on immigration. What can we do to alleviate those concerns while minimizing negative impacts on our membership in the EU?&#8221; That would have been a much more complex, nuanced issue to tackle; but it also would have likely produced a different and MUCH better result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, it would have produced *no* usable result: That's an invitation to
debate, not a specific proposal that could result in a decision.

&gt;<i> But the British had no system by which they could ask that question of the people. All they had was their representatives in Parliament. So my thought is that we are working on building tools that could facilitate such questions being tackled by citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I have no problem with asking open-ended questions as part of the
process. But we can't confuse that with making a decision. In fact,
back to the topic, it's even *less* likely to result in any sort of
&quot;consensus&quot; at the end of that stage of the process.

&gt;<i> Concerning participation and consent; my point is not at all that non-participants just have to acquiesce to the decisions of participants.
</I>
Good, then we agree that that sentence needs to be rewritten.

&gt;<i> There are literally millions of public policy decisions made that affect your life; and there is no way you are going to participate in all of them. I propose that anyone should be allowed to participate in any deliberation at any moment they want to. If they see a decision being made that they disagree with; they can jump in and change the course of the conversation. But they don&#8217;t have to; nor should they be expected to.
</I>
You didn't answer the question, though: What happens if they *don't*?
Does that mean they have given tacit approval for those that *did*
participate to do whatever they want? If not, again, you agree with me
that the active participants have a *duty* to represent those who
don't. And if they can't or won't do that (which is usually the case)
then the decisionmaking system needs to be designed to ensure this
outcome anyway. Which is why that paragraph on the Wiki needs to be
rewritten, perhaps to include a discussion of how proxyfor.me works
because it is, to my knowledge, the only decisionmaking system that
even attempts to do this.
  Regards,
    Scott
