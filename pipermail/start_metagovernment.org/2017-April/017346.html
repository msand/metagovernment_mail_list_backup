</I>&gt;<i> Scott, I think you may be arguing semantics. &#8220;Consensus&#8221; does not inherently

</I>
To the extent that it doesn't it's vague and therefore a poor choice
of words. To the extent that it does, it allows the minority to
override the Will of The People and is therefore an example of
authoritarian rule. I guess I just don't see the need to continue to
use that term because it makes us (you) look like we don't know what
we're doing. Building a decisionmaking system *is* social engineering,
and no engineer would use a word like that because it's either
imprecise or not what we're doing. Note that I don't have a problem
with &quot;deliberative&quot; or &quot;collaborative&quot; methods in general, however,
because those describe a process, not an outcome.

&gt;<i> I think most of us would agree that the general idea
</I>&gt;<i> behind this description is what we are working toward:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
</I>
I note that the vast majority of that article assumes &quot;consensus&quot; is
synonymous with &quot;unanimity&quot;. Which is also the first definition in
Webster's:
<A HREF="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus</A>

And to the extent it doesn't imply unanimity it at least implies
&quot;solidarity&quot; or acquiescence. Which again is *not* something we have
any hope of achieving in any general-purpose decisionmaking system.

&gt;<i> Note the &#8220;Decision rules&#8221; section, which shows that consensus can mean
</I>&gt;<i> unanimous, super-majority, or even simple majority:
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Other groups use a consensus process to generate as much agreement as
</I>&gt;<i> possible, but allow participants to finalize decisions with a decision rule
</I>&gt;<i> that does not require unanimity.&quot;
</I>
OK, then if the word doesn't mean anything useful, why don't we just
stop using it? It's a misrepresentation to say that you have achieved
consensus when a significant minority (perhaps as much as half minus
one) disagree with the decision. Or do you disagree?

An example from the &quot;Collaborative Government&quot; page
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:</A>
 &quot;Nobody is expected to participate in each decision, but those who do
must come to a consensus or no action is taken.&quot;

What does this mean? Please be specific (i.e., please respond as the
social engineer you're claiming to be by participating in this group).

I also have a problem with another sentence on that page:
&quot;with the implicit understanding that anyone not participating on a
particular issue consents to allow others to decide the issue&quot;

I run into this a lot with politicians and other amateur social
engineers. The assumption seems to be that if people don't show up for
a meeting or protest or whatever that they've given their implied
consent to whatever decision the people who do show up, or who bother
to claim power, make. This is heinous in my opinion and the worst of
the fatal flaws in representative democracy. It's also, of course, the
very problem that inspired the development of proxyfor.me, and which
that system is, perhaps uniquely, designed to solve.
  Regards,
    Scott
