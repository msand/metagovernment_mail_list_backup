<PRE>Not really an alpha-test yet because I'd request that you not actually
enter your data yet (any changes you make will probably disappear as
I'm still tweaking the proposals, database schema, and bot behavior),
but if you'd like to take a look at the overall structure and the
first dozen proposals, please visit:

<A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me">https://www.proxyfor.me</A>

Note that the terms &quot;AutoMatch&quot; and &quot;MatchSys&quot; are now deprecated:
I've gone back to &quot;The System&quot; as the top-level organization (with
decisionmaking (proxyfor.me), credential keeping, health-care records,
etc. as modules) and created this new term and web site for the
decisionmaking component (I don't *hate* the name &quot;proxyfor.me&quot;, but
will admit that it was about my 10th choice. Damn cybersquatters: A
pox on all of them!).

If you want to log in and check out matching and voting (which
requires a completed personality profile), please log in as one of the
bots. Their passwords are the same as the names, which are &quot;bot0&quot;
through &quot;bot199&quot;. Bots 0 to 99 have voted on all proposals, 100-199
haven't voted at all (they're for testing proxy matching and
notification). Pick one at random. Again, feel free to change
anything, since everything in there is automatically generated and
will be regenerated prior to the actual alpha-test release.

If you want to try *editing* a proposal, log in as &quot;gm&quot; (with &quot;gm&quot;
also as password). You can't edit closed proposals, or the current or
next proposal (nor will you ever be able to do this), but the ones
farther in the future will show an &quot;edit this proposal&quot; button that
brings up the (very primitive) editing screen. This is also how you
create a new proposal (just change the ID of one chosen as a template
and a new proposal will automatically be generated). Note that you
currently have to reload the app to see the new proposal in the &quot;all
proposals&quot; list. The &quot;gm&quot; can assign responsibilities for proposals to
other users, but again I don't expect any normal users to be able to
come up with quality proposals so this ability will be reserved for
the executive branch until some sort of petitioning system gets built
(see the Help FAQ for more on this). If you want to claim one of the
existing proposals and take responsibility for versioning and
answering questions on it, let me know and I'll assign it to you in
the next round of testing.

Things to look for:
1) Any misbehavior (duh ;-)
2) Anything confusing.
3) How the proposals read.
4) How the help reads.
5) Any comments on the personality/ideology inventory (in your (bot) profile).
6) Cross-platform operation: I've only tested it in Chrome and IE on
Windows and would be interested to know how (or even if) it works
elsewhere. If you run into conflicts, please send me browser name and
version, and any information printed out in the browser console (from
&quot;Developer Tools&quot; in the &quot;gear&quot; or &quot;settings&quot; menu).

Also, please register on the new forum <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/forum">http://www.matchism.org/forum</A>
and post any questions or comments you have there. I assume
cross-posting here would be fine too, but it's harder to simulate
people on a forum with bots and we want it to look operational by the
time we start doing public announcements. If anyone can pitch in for
moderator duty, I'd appreciate it. Just send me an email with your
username.

If all goes well, we can probably do a real alpha test next week.
  Thanks!
    Scott
