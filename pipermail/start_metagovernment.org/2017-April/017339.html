Works, thanks!

Main problem now is that it needs to be upgraded to reflect current
thinking/technology. For example, I believe that we've reached
&quot;consensus&quot; that consensus is not a viable goal for decisionmaking
systems (at least, there no longer seems to be anyone willing to
defend it, which by the &quot;last man standing&quot; rule means we've reached
consensus ;-) So any references to that as a goal need to be removed,
possibly leaving a footnote that it is a deprecated concept. I suggest
we replace it with the concept of large supermajorities having the
effect of increasing legitimacy of decisions and therefore increasing
compliance with them (i.e., as close to consensus as possible can
still be a goal, but we can't use that word anymore without adding
weasel words in front of it, invalidating the concept).

I only found one reference to the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; rule:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO</A>
Ned apparently created that, but there are no internal links to it,
there was no discussion of it on the wiki, and apparently he won't
defend it anymore (at least he has passed on numerous attempts to
engage him on the subject on this list). I note that this proposal
failed even before I got here...

I'd also like to see more on LiquidFeedback, including a link to that
article that describes how it actually works (or more accurately,
doesn't work). I've put that on the matchism site:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf.">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Kling_2015_LQFBforPP.pdf.</A> Anyone
interested in taking that on?

I'll put creating an entry for proxyfor.me on my to-do list.

&gt;<i> After your feedback I'll remove the maintenance warning and remove the old
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>
Looks good to go!
  Regards,
    Scott
