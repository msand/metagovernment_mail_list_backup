Unfortunately the only narratives that are compelling enough to cause
people to adopt them as philosophy are those designed to play on
emotions (particularly fear). But because that always works to degrade
progress in civilization, I think we have to take the only other
viable approach I've thought of which is to provide them with a
working system that contains enough bells and whistles that the
*technology* wins them over, and then use that as the entry point for
the philosophy. proxyfor.me has the additional benefit that so much of
it is automated: Most of The People will only need to spend the 10
minutes it takes to sign up and fill out the profile for them to get
good representation. The philosophy will only need to be impressed
upon the most active users to get good results from the whole system,
and for The People in general.
