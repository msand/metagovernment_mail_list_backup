I would say &quot;society&quot; doesn't do morality at all: It's an individual
endeavor. It's worth noting, however, that the propensity to make
moral judgments is not uniformly distributed in the population (yeah,
it's authoritarians that mostly feel compelled to do this).

&gt;<i> I would like to know if there is any research,
</I>&gt;<i> when public is asked an obvious moral question and is statistically failing
</I>&gt;<i> to answer it &quot;right&quot;, just for the reason of some fatal moral flaw in genes
</I>&gt;<i> or culture.
</I>
There is no &quot;right&quot; answer when it comes to moral judgments: It
totally depends on the environment the individual was raised in and on
the context in which the judgments are made. I think this is made
pretty clear in the Matchism manifesto
(<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/internal-moral-codes/">http://www.matchism.org/internal-moral-codes/</A>) and I've yet to see
anyone make a coherent argument otherwise.

&gt;<i> Something like asking: &quot;Do you like people to suffer?&quot; and there would be to
</I>&gt;<i> many percents of &quot;yes&quot;.
</I>
And many would also say &quot;I don't care one way or the other&quot;. But I
think mental illness is a separate issue here: The vast majority of
people do have a functioning morality system. Unfortunately it is very
difficult to determine how it is structured for any given individual,
and nearly impossible to change it past a certain age unless the
individual happens to be able to reason above Kohlberg stage 4 (and
most people can't).

&gt;<i> I would say that poeple are good at morality even if they know little about
</I>&gt;<i> ethics. What do you think? Do you agree?
</I>
There are two separate issues here: Whether an individual's moral code
is already functioning at t + 1, and whether they can function above
Kohlberg stage 4 and therefore change their moral code if not. The
answer for both of those questions is &quot;no&quot; for most people, although
there's at least hope for the latter group. Maybe a more fruitful path
for you would be to determine if people can be educated to function
above stage 4. My guess is probably not, but I wouldn't rule out the
possibility, especially if training started very young (at least
before age 7).
  Regards,
    Scott
