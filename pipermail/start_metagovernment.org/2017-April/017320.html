&gt;&gt;<i> You probably know my solution to this particular problem: Eliminate

I would agree to characterizing it as &quot;ambitious&quot;, perhaps even overly
so. But it definitely isn't a &quot;weak spot&quot;, and indeed I'd argue that
the one-government plan is the *only* reliable solution to a great
many problems.

&gt;<i> Well, I also hope we are clever enough to know how many children we should
</I>&gt;<i> have, but what if not?
</I>
Speaking of &quot;overly ambitious&quot;! As part of my research on this for the
Matchism Manifesto I came across this enlightening statistic: In the
US *half* of all pregnancies are unplanned. And while you might be
inclined to toss off &quot;abortion&quot; as the automatic solution to this
problem, I'd advise against being so cavalier about what in most cases
is a gut-wrenching decision.

&gt;<i> I better dare to have the same gut as you, and I hope I will be
</I>&gt;<i> scientifically &quot;ridiculed&quot; if I am wrong.
</I>
It's not the scientists or scientifically-minded you have to worry about here...

&gt;<i> I wouldn't say that it is cherrypicking, democratic feedback is the basic
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism for selection of a system. Sometimes is the feedback flawed and
</I>&gt;<i> that is what I am writing about - some other criterions than feedback need
</I>&gt;<i> to be invented too.
</I>
No, I meant cherrypicking your problem domains (albeit reproduction
rates being one of the harder cases). Whatever metrics for &quot;goodness&quot;
you propose should be applicable to *all* public policy issues, not
just a few specific areas.

&gt;<i> As for the &quot;fragmentary&quot;. There might be a lot of systems (as in current
</I>&gt;<i> states), but there is always at least one that solves them best, even if it
</I>&gt;<i> is system that gets 20%( it may be still the best if no other gets over 20%
</I>&gt;<i> in the problematique). I do not see the cracks.
</I>
So each state crossed with each problem domain can have a unique
&quot;most-good&quot; system for it? You may not see the &quot;cracks&quot; but it looks
like a jigsaw puzzle with a lot of pieces missing to me...

    Scott
