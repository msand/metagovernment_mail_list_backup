</I>
That's backing off a lot on your first proposals (which seemed to set
a goal that required some sort of objective measure), but I agree that
this is sufficient.

&gt;<i> 2. Good system creates good results.
</I>
I would propose this is *by definition*, and again not by any sort of
post-hoc analysis of the actual outcome. The latter I'd argue is
impossible to achieve (expectations change, externalities affect the
results, etc.)

&gt;<i> 3. Good processes makes good system.
</I>
A little more tenuous, but OK.

&gt;<i> 4. Discussion-decision-implementation-effects is elementary process of a
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> but the 1. is problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> It may work fine at municipal level.
</I>&gt;<i> It will fail at some moments imho, foreign policy might be a good example.
</I>
You probably know my solution to this particular problem: Eliminate
the need for &quot;foreign policy&quot; by ensuring that *all* decisions are
made using the same system.

&gt;<i> So I started searching for other definitions of &quot;good result&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I have not found for foreign policy, but for birth rate. Let us accept 1 but
</I>&gt;<i> we should also add an condition imho and say that starvation must be zero to
</I>&gt;<i> accept the feedback. If it is not zero, I would say that the processes (
</I>&gt;<i> those like in 4)  influencing birth rate we not good. I mean bad result, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter what democracy says.
</I>
Again, I'd recommend staying away from &quot;birth rate&quot; or population as a
domain for measuring &quot;goodness&quot;. I've done a *lot* of research and
thinking about these issues and have come to the conclusion that it's
impossible to make specific predictions about how social engineering
in this area will work. Although my gut tells me that overall a slow
reduction is the best plan, at this point I've resigned myself to
defer to the need for individual freedom to &quot;automagically&quot; solve this
problem (e.g., studies show that including birth control in health
care systems substantially reduces birth rates).

&gt;<i> You may see it as a small flaw, but I think it is something bigger. For most
</I>&gt;<i> common human flaws we do need to compensate and we will need to find other
</I>&gt;<i> definitions of &quot;good results&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This means different different equations for different areas.
</I>&gt;<i> The compensation must happen at the field of science. Such compensations may
</I>&gt;<i> be impossible in running political system.
</I>
Agreed, which is why I've decided to punt on this whole issue ;-)

&gt;<i> Please do not confuse me with Scott. As I understand it Scott is designing
</I>&gt;<i> one system that compensates all flaws. I design mechanisms for evaluation of
</I>&gt;<i> systems. And I try to pair problematiques with systems.
</I>
Sounds fragmentary and therefore probably not viable: Better a system
that imperfectly solves all problems than one that lets key problems
fall through the cracks because there isn't a &quot;system&quot; design that
solves it really well. Cherrypicking problems is only going to cause
you (and maybe the rest of us) grief in the long run.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: Getting close to public testing on the Matchism System app! Warm
up those mice because I hope to do the first alpha-test release in a
week or two and hope that you'll all be able to participate.
