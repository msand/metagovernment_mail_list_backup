And be sure to comment: I'd prefer not to engage Ned in a debate to
start the ball rolling, and the other alpha testers have inexplicably
turned out to be shy...

&gt;<i> I had a couple comments about the profile questionnaire. Questions like &quot;Can

</I>&gt;<i> ranking system, weird to have a strong reaction to something that's
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;somewhat&quot; or &quot;sometimes&quot;. Strongly agree that sometimes I'm shy. See what
</I>&gt;<i> I'm saying?
</I>
I do, but I'm not touching that list: It's a psychological industry
standard and has been used in *thousands* of published experiments.

&gt;<i> Question 41 tripped me up &quot;Has few artistic interests&quot; I read &quot;Has a few
</I>&gt;<i> artistic interests&quot; which changes the context completely. Might want to
</I>&gt;<i> rephrase that as I suspect others might screw that up and not realize.
</I>
Fortunately that one loads on Extroversion (although now that I look
at it even that seems odd) which is the least predictive of voting
behavior (or at least party affiliation) of all of the Big 5
dimensions...

&gt;<i> I'm also curious how the second half of the questionnaire will work as those
</I>&gt;<i> answers are subjective dependant on your circumstance and locality. Like I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have a strong opinion on children's health because I don't have kids,
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea if we're spending too much or too little in the area. If I

</I>&gt;<i> than if I lived in the city.
</I>
LOL: My wife and I actually just had a debate on exactly this issue.
It's an empirical question and it'll be easy to validate it (or reject
it) once we have enough votes (*way* easier than what that paper on
LQFB had to do). But my theory is that your observation is exactly the
point: Your &quot;personality&quot;, and therefore your voting habits, *does*
depend on the context in which you're operating, and therefore proper
representation for you depends on your current environment. This
system, and Matchism in general, is therefore highly context-dependent
rather than operating on some idealized representation of people. This
is a property that it shares with representative democracy, but unlike
our current system if you father a child in the next couple of weeks
you can update your profile and have the new information used
immediately rather than having to wait for 6 years (or whatever) to
vote for a different candidate for senator.

&gt;<i> Finally, I don't know if this is an observed phenomenon but I caught myself
</I>&gt;<i> being more conservative with my assessment of traits early on not venturing
</I>&gt;<i> past a little agree or disagree but by the end, I felt more comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> picking the strong options. Just something to keep in mind maybe.
</I>
It'll make you harder to match, for sure, but this too I think is a
feature, not a bug: The idea is not to classify you somehow, but only
to find other people who would vote like you. All this second-guessing
you're apparently doing is (probably) not unique to you and the theory
is that other people who do the same are more likely to vote like you
than those who just breeze through the questions without every
worrying about any of them. There's lots of research on how different
kinds of people use Likert scales (some people are actually *afraid*
to use the extreme values), but again, this is not a problem because
we only need the data to match people, not classify them.

&gt;<i> The site looks nice overall, few other comments but I'll save those for the
</I>&gt;<i> forum maybe.
</I>
Thanks: Either place is fine, but it would be nice to fill out the
forum a little (people love to follow a crowd and even though we're
only in alpha-test it's just good marketing to make it look like a
real thing).
  Regards,
    Scott
