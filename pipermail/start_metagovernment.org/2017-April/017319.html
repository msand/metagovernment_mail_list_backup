</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Good system creates good results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would propose this is *by definition*, and again not by any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> post-hoc analysis of the actual outcome. The latter I'd argue is
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to achieve (expectations change, externalities affect the
</I>&gt;<i> results, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thank you :)
So, do you want to say, that if people mess it by themselves it is not so
bad. To some degree yes, but imho...
Decision makers should expect &quot;expectation change and externalities&quot;. I do
not care that thay cannot know, they should get better at guessing.
I still say ...good system creates good results.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Good processes makes good system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A little more tenuous, but OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Discussion-decision-implementation-effects is elementary process of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but the 1. is problematic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It may work fine at municipal level.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It will fail at some moments imho, foreign policy might be a good
</I>&gt;<i> example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You probably know my solution to this particular problem: Eliminate
</I>&gt;<i> the need for &quot;foreign policy&quot; by ensuring that *all* decisions are
</I>&gt;<i> made using the same system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I would say this is one of your weak spots.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I started searching for other definitions of &quot;good result&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have not found for foreign policy, but for birth rate. Let us accept 1
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we should also add an condition imho and say that starvation must be
</I>&gt;<i> zero to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accept the feedback. If it is not zero, I would say that the processes (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those like in 4)  influencing birth rate we not good. I mean bad result,
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; matter what democracy says.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'd recommend staying away from &quot;birth rate&quot; or population as a
</I>&gt;<i> domain for measuring &quot;goodness&quot;. I've done a *lot* of research and
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about these issues and have come to the conclusion that it's
</I>&gt;<i> impossible to make specific predictions about how social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> in this area will work. Although my gut tells me that overall a slow
</I>&gt;<i> reduction is the best plan, at this point I've resigned myself to
</I>&gt;<i> defer to the need for individual freedom to &quot;automagically&quot; solve this
</I>&gt;<i> problem (e.g., studies show that including birth control in health
</I>&gt;<i> care systems substantially reduces birth rates).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, I also hope we are clever enough to know how many children we should
have, but what if not?
I better dare to have the same gut as you, and I hope I will be
scientifically &quot;ridiculed&quot; if I am wrong.


&gt;<i> &gt; You may see it as a small flaw, but I think it is something bigger. For
</I>&gt;<i> most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; common human flaws we do need to compensate and we will need to find
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; definitions of &quot;good results&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This means different different equations for different areas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The compensation must happen at the field of science. Such compensations
</I>&gt;<i> may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be impossible in running political system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, which is why I've decided to punt on this whole issue ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please do not confuse me with Scott. As I understand it Scott is
</I>&gt;<i> designing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one system that compensates all flaws. I design mechanisms for
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systems. And I try to pair problematiques with systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds fragmentary and therefore probably not viable: Better a system
</I>&gt;<i> that imperfectly solves all problems than one that lets key problems
</I>&gt;<i> fall through the cracks because there isn't a &quot;system&quot; design that
</I>&gt;<i> solves it really well. Cherrypicking problems is only going to cause
</I>&gt;<i> you (and maybe the rest of us) grief in the long run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I wouldn't say that it is cherrypicking, democratic feedback is the basic
mechanism for selection of a system. Sometimes is the feedback flawed and
that is what I am writing about - some other criterions than feedback need
to be invented too.

As for the &quot;fragmentary&quot;. There might be a lot of systems (as in current
states), but there is always at least one that solves them best, even if it
is system that gets 20%( it may be still the best if no other gets over 20%
in the problematique). I do not see the cracks.

Cheers
m.

</I>&gt;<i> week or two and hope that you'll all be able to participate.
