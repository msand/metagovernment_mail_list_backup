</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott, I think you may be arguing semantics. &#8220;Consensus&#8221; does not
</I>&gt;<i> inherently
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean unanimous support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the extent that it doesn't it's vague and therefore a poor choice
</I>&gt;<i> of words. To the extent that it does, it allows the minority to
</I>&gt;<i> override the Will of The People and is therefore an example of
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian rule. I guess I just don't see the need to continue to
</I>&gt;<i> use that term because it makes us (you) look like we don't know what
</I>&gt;<i> we're doing. Building a decisionmaking system *is* social engineering,
</I>&gt;<i> and no engineer would use a word like that because it's either
</I>&gt;<i> imprecise or not what we're doing. Note that I don't have a problem
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;deliberative&quot; or &quot;collaborative&quot; methods in general, however,
</I>&gt;<i> because those describe a process, not an outcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think most of us would agree that the general idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behind this description is what we are working toward:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I note that the vast majority of that article assumes &quot;consensus&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> synonymous with &quot;unanimity&quot;. Which is also the first definition in
</I>&gt;<i> Webster's:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/consensus</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And to the extent it doesn't imply unanimity it at least implies
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;solidarity&quot; or acquiescence. Which again is *not* something we have
</I>&gt;<i> any hope of achieving in any general-purpose decisionmaking system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note the &#8220;Decision rules&#8221; section, which shows that consensus can mean
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unanimous, super-majority, or even simple majority:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &#8220;Other groups use a consensus process to generate as much agreement as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possible, but allow participants to finalize decisions with a decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that does not require unanimity.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, then if the word doesn't mean anything useful, why don't we just
</I>&gt;<i> stop using it? It's a misrepresentation to say that you have achieved
</I>&gt;<i> consensus when a significant minority (perhaps as much as half minus
</I>&gt;<i> one) disagree with the decision. Or do you disagree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example from the &quot;Collaborative Government&quot; page
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance:</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;Nobody is expected to participate in each decision, but those who do
</I>&gt;<i> must come to a consensus or no action is taken.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does this mean? Please be specific (i.e., please respond as the
</I>&gt;<i> social engineer you're claiming to be by participating in this group).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also have a problem with another sentence on that page:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;with the implicit understanding that anyone not participating on a
</I>&gt;<i> particular issue consents to allow others to decide the issue&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I run into this a lot with politicians and other amateur social
</I>&gt;<i> engineers. The assumption seems to be that if people don't show up for
</I>&gt;<i> a meeting or protest or whatever that they've given their implied
</I>&gt;<i> consent to whatever decision the people who do show up, or who bother
</I>&gt;<i> to claim power, make. This is heinous in my opinion and the worst of
</I>&gt;<i> the fatal flaws in representative democracy. It's also, of course, the
</I>&gt;<i> very problem that inspired the development of proxyfor.me, and which
</I>&gt;<i> that system is, perhaps uniquely, designed to solve.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
