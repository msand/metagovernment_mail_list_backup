I think this is my point: Academics self-censor any truly radical
ideas they have because they don't want to (and probably just can't
afford to) risk their reputations by spouting off about something that
may be truly visionary but might also turn out to be totally crackpot
because of hidden &quot;flaws&quot;. It's a luxury only independents really
have...

In addition to all being academics &quot;The Next System&quot; people have the
additional unfortunate constraint of being dependent on financing from
the very organizations that must be forcibly reformed as part of the
process of creating a &quot;next system&quot;. For example, one of the upcoming
proposals on proxyfor.me specifically calls for the abolishment of the
practice of inheritance, a position that is trivially easy to justify
(e.g., it would cut everyone's taxes by a *third*) but *none* of the
major non-profits, neither on the left *or* the right can seriously
propose this because doing so would probably require them to take a
major haircut or perhaps even shut down because they are so dependent
on donations from their wealthy benefactors (i.e., their &quot;masters&quot;)
who won't appreciate even a public *suggestion* that it's not right
that they can make their children part of the aristocracy with the
wave of a pen. But again, we independents (and indeed, we, The People)
don't have this constraint and I fully expect it to pass (e.g, it took
a little work, but when I proposed this on FaceBook awhile back it
took mere hours for a group of a dozen people to go from being
completely in support of unlimited inheritance to being radically
opposed to it).
  Regards,
    Scott
