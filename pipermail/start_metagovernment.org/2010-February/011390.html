<PRE>Matias, I don&#146;t believe it is correct to say that planning is not useful
because no one can be coerced into performing the activities required to
achieve the desired objectives (results).  

 

To the contrary, regardless of who may or may not agree to support any
particular objective, the inevitable result if *no one* agrees to perform
any activities in support of any objective is that nothing will be
accomplished 
 and I have little interest in remaining associated with such
a group.  I have more productive things to do with my life.

 

If anyone agrees to do anything under the auspices of Metagov, I will be
happy to document that(those) objective(s) in StratML format as part of our
strategic plan.  If no one agrees to do anything, that result speaks for
itself and I will simply find better things to do than worry about the lack
of productivity by this group.

 

Owen

[mailto:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start-bounces at metagovernment.org</A>] On Behalf Of Mat&#237;as Battocchia
Sent: Tuesday, February 09, 2010 3:20 PM
To: Metagovernment Startup Committee
Subject: [Start] Minutes, meeting 4

 

The agenda was open, but rapidly the main topic of the meeting emerged: the
development of strategic plans. Metagovernment is not progressing as desired
and it is thought that defining goals and objectives would help. In others
words, what comes next after consensus, in terms of getting the stuff done.
There was some disagreement with planning, since in this organization nobody
can be coerced to respect the plans, making them not useful. So, it was
accorded to experiment with strategic planning to see what happens... Owen
will take care of this.

The rest of the meeting turned around the CMS topic. What Metagovernment is
seeking must not be understood as a known CMS, such as Drupal; it's hard to
explain what is (although it will take much of the interoperability of the
active projects). Pietro will solve this, preparing a page in the wiki
exposing its features.

Next meeting is on February 20, 1700 GMT.
