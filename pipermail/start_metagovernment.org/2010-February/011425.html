<PRE>Answering this question may lead us to more answers, for example, to
the inquietudes 'What really does Metagovernment?' and 'What we have
to do to increase participation?'; which in turn would help us to
define objectives and goals (thanks Owen for pushing this out) that
would make possible the accomplishment of our vision. I transcribe
here what you can read in Wikipedia about umbrellas:

&quot;An&#160;umbrella organization&#160;is an association of (often related,
industry-specific) institutions, who work together formally to
coordinate activities or pool resources. In business, political, or
other environments, one group, the umbrella organization, provides
resources and often an identity to the smaller organizations.
Sometimes in this kind of arrangement, the umbrella organization is to
some degree responsible for the groups under its care. Compare to
franchises&#160;and&#160;subsidiaries. There may be many reasons for
establishing/joining an umbrella organization;

the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
alone, due to:
* economies of scale,
* a better pool of experts and experience,
* shared apprenticeship and exchange of know-how;

a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
derive utility from multilateral and shared activities:
* an increased&#160;brand/public awareness,
* legality of pursued action(s).&quot;

Let's work this out analyzing it by parts.

&quot;An&#160;umbrella organization&#160;is an association&quot;, then we should have a
contract with active projects, specifying roles and obligations, this
way we know when the association starts and ends.

&quot;who work together formally to coordinate activities or pool
resources&quot;, Metagovernment has the kind of activities that could be
coordinated, like the Conference or the Standardization. Obligations:
we do the coordination, then the active projects follow the plans
(top-down); active projects tell us what to coordinate (down-top).
Pooling resources... this is harder; what can active projects actually
throw in a common pool?
* Work force. Difficult, programmers have enough with its own projects.
* Knowledge. Maybe. Not about programming, there are better resources
elsewhere. About voting systems, could be.
* Money. Even worse. As an individual, I feel I should donate; what
about a $10 monthly fee, for those members who want to do it? Let's
open the road for that, using a PayPal account. (Ed's?)

&quot;provides resources and often an identity to the smaller
organizations&quot;, Resources, mmm, we don't have much to offer, the wiki
and some space in the server. We could take this further, if we had a
dedicated server or a virtual private server ($700 yearly) to expand
our services. Obligations: provide free full hosting to active
projects, while they use this service exclusively for developing
collaborative governance projects. (Identity? Well, in the future.
Metagovernment isn't famous... yet, and identity happens when others
recognize you.)

&quot;the umbrella organization is to some degree responsible for the
groups under its care&quot;, sometimes, not this case.

&quot;the ability to carry out activities which could not be accomplished
alone&quot;, can you add one more activity?

&quot;a sense of community and support that makes people and corporations
derive utility from multilateral and shared activities&quot;, ...public
awareness... Obligation: Metagovernment maintains a list of active
projects in the wiki's main page, active projects add a little banner
of Metagovernment on their sites. If we go to a conference, we present
all active projects, if an active project goes to a conference, it
introduces Metagovernment.

I invite you to enhance to list of things that Metagovernment can do
for its active projects, and vice versa.
