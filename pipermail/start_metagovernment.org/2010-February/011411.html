<PRE>Apologies for the slow reply,

(Thank you.)  I hope to get back to the prototype very soon.  I had
other things to work on, and it's been slow going lately.

You wrote earlier:
&gt;<i> The break point is what you refer to below as &quot;official  
</I>&gt;<i> consideration.&quot; How can we know what that is if there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative mechanism for defining it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am all for removing limitations wherever possible, but at some  
</I>&gt;<i> point a community needs to decide that they have reached agreement  
</I>&gt;<i> enough such that they can act. That decision needs to be made either  
</I>&gt;<i> by a person or by a vote of the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many of us don't want to see decision-making concentrated in anyone  
</I>&gt;<i> less than everyone who wants to participate. So that leaves an  
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative vote. Where does that vote occur? More precisely: How  
</I>&gt;<i> does the community know when a proposal has turned into a policy?
</I>
In this regard, I think there are two types of decision:

   i) Executive - what *is* to be done

  ii) Normative - what *ought* to be done

Which type do you mean?  These could be examples of the &quot;tiers&quot; you
mentioned earlier.  They are very different and they must be kept
separate, though they may enter into relations.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Where would it not apply?  Where would a voter's freedom of

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sorry, I didn't mean that some tools should be excluded entirely,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to be free-range voting, it may need to have several discreet
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ranges.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can you think of an example, though?  Where exactly might it be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary to enforce a limited range of choice, with regard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting tools?  Or with regard to any other type of tool?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It has already been pointed out that some tools have entirely

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they would work better in sequence (e.g., ideas are developed in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one and decided in another).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why not allow the voter to cut across all such boundaries?  She
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might vote for (or against) anything at all, using her favourite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting engine.  For example, she might use it to support an idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that was still under development *and* a decision that was already
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> under official consideration.  Why limit her freedom of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> application, in this regard?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Likewise, why not allow her to break out of the sequence of an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> official, administrative process?  So she might continue to vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for a measure, even after some organized group has made a &quot;final&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision in rejection of it. (Or vice versa.)  Why limit her
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> freedom of expression, ever?
