<PRE>Hello,

Ed, I'm not sure, if I understand you (maybe because of my english).


&gt;<i> The break point is what you refer to below as &quot;official  
</I>&gt;<i> consideration.&quot; How can we know what that is if there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> authoritative mechanism for defining it?
</I>
I believe, as always the voters should have to vote this mechanism up by themselves and no technological or other limitation should be forced on them beforehand.
Ofcourse the second question then would be: how is this first question being decided? and so on ad infinitum. But in my opinion for this second question there will be a large majority for: &quot;It is *NOT* decided until at least a very large number of the affected people have voted and reached consensus on this first question.&quot; 
In theory (just for the fun of it) it looks to me, that the further out you get (3. level, 4., ...) the easier it gets to reach 100% consensus among all (and not just, because it gets more and more annoying) ;-)

Greetings,
Thomas



&gt;<i> The break point is what you refer to below as &quot;official  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consideration.&quot; How can we know what that is if there is no  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authoritative mechanism for defining it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am all for removing limitations wherever possible, but at some  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point a community needs to decide that they have reached agreement  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; enough such that they can act. That decision needs to be made either  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by a person or by a vote of the community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many of us don't want to see decision-making concentrated in anyone  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less than everyone who wants to participate. So that leaves an  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authoritative vote. Where does that vote occur? More precisely: How  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does the community know when a proposal has turned into a policy?

</I>&gt;<i> Hey Folks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the copy that I will be distributing as a part of my outreach
</I>&gt;<i> process to funders and other potentially interested parties. Please feel
</I>&gt;<i> free to redistribute if you wish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OpenKollab's &lt;<A HREF="http://mudball.net/openkollab/">http://mudball.net/openkollab/</A>&gt; is developing infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> and processes to support its larger mission of Connecting Projects To Solve
</I>&gt;<i> Massive Social Problems. In service of this larger end, we are developing
</I>&gt;<i> the Ecosystem Pooled Fund
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/openkollab-pooled-fund">http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/openkollab-pooled-fund</A>&gt;initiative, the
</I>&gt;<i> objective of which is to develop a model to provide financing to early stage
</I>&gt;<i> social entrepreneurs (those that are developing projects that delivery both
</I>&gt;<i> social value and financial return). As you likely know, there is a gap in
</I>&gt;<i> the funding landscape that makes it very hard for social entrepreneurs to
</I>&gt;<i> raise seed funds. The gap exists due to the fact that social ventures
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship</A>&gt;typically carry high
</I>&gt;<i> risk but don't necessarily carry high enough financial return to offset this
</I>&gt;<i> risk since they are not solely focused on financial return.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I am wondering if it would be possible to arrange a time to chat to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce you to OpenKollab &lt;<A HREF="http://mudball.net/openkollab/">http://mudball.net/openkollab/</A>&gt;and the
</I>&gt;<i> following model.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The strategy of the Ecosystem Pooled Fund is, therefore, to offset risk by
</I>&gt;<i> bringing groups of early stage social ventures together collaboratively.
</I>&gt;<i> This has the following benefits:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Reducing Investment Risk By Developing Collaborative Process Amongst Early
</I>&gt;<i> Stage Social Ventures**
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Scale:* In grouping projects together, we create scale (more people,
</I>&gt;<i>    ideas, resources etc.).
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Modularity:* In viewing ones enterprise as a part of a system of
</I>&gt;<i>    relations, one can direct ones activities in a way that is aligned with ones
</I>&gt;<i>    ecosystem partners.
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Social cohesion: *we hope that some of what works in the Grameen Peer
</I>&gt;<i>    Lending &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_lending">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_lending</A>&gt; model, works in
</I>&gt;<i>    this context as well. In support of this idea, we will be developing
</I>&gt;<i>    non-binding collaboration agreements that formalize the commitments between
</I>&gt;<i>    groups.
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Offsets technology risk:* A constant challenge for investors is to be
</I>&gt;<i>    able to assess the value of technology and processes that have not already
</I>&gt;<i>    garnered market acceptance. In getting peers to use your technology,
</I>&gt;<i>    processes etc., (as ecosystem collaborators) the functional utility of the
</I>&gt;<i>    technology is validated by people that understand the technology.
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Increased Product Validation:* in fitting your technology or process
</I>&gt;<i>    into a value chain of collaborators, you will solve problems and enhance the
</I>&gt;<i>    product thereby making it more market worthy.
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Increased Network/Channel Capacity*: In working collaboratively with
</I>&gt;<i>    others, you will build networks and contacts that will open up other market
</I>&gt;<i>    opportunities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More details on the model can be found in this
</I>&gt;<i> paper&lt;<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/ecosystem-social-ventures">http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/ecosystem-social-ventures</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Collaborative Projects That OpenKollab is Preparing Investment Cases For*
</I>&gt;<i> OpenKollab organizes all its activity around the notion of an
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystem&lt;<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ASJ9wl9qbZEzZGM0Z2Jnc2pfMTQ4MG5zNjNmY2Rw&amp;hl=">https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ASJ9wl9qbZEzZGM0Z2Jnc2pfMTQ4MG5zNjNmY2Rw&amp;hl=</A>&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i> groups of projects that might be able to collaborate. We are currently
</I>&gt;<i> developing a collaborative funding strategy for four projects in the Open
</I>&gt;<i> Manufacturing Ecosystem&lt;<A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiJ9wl9qbZEzdGRYY2YzRlhHemVMT3ZFd1otSHp0anc&amp;hl=en">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiJ9wl9qbZEzdGRYY2YzRlhHemVMT3ZFd1otSHp0anc&amp;hl=en</A>&gt;and
</I>&gt;<i> are in discussion with several projects in the Open
</I>&gt;<i> Government Ecosystem.&lt;<A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsCSL3k5hoJTdE55ZFg2R19lTmRTREZ2R2RRd05lTmc&amp;hl=en">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AsCSL3k5hoJTdE55ZFg2R19lTmRTREZ2R2RRd05lTmc&amp;hl=en</A>&gt;This
</I>&gt;<i> process is being formalized through the creation of Collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> Agreements&lt;<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ASJ9wl9qbZEzZGM0Z2Jnc2pfMTU5NGc2N2ZiYmRj&amp;hl=en">https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0ASJ9wl9qbZEzZGM0Z2Jnc2pfMTU5NGc2N2ZiYmRj&amp;hl=en</A>&gt;that
</I>&gt;<i> define the collaboration process and the commitments that the various
</I>&gt;<i> groups are making to each other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Information Modeling*
</I>&gt;<i> Central to the OpenKollab &lt;<A HREF="http://mudball.net/openkollab/">http://mudball.net/openkollab/</A>&gt; strategy is the
</I>&gt;<i> development of information models which are designed to collect specific
</I>&gt;<i> data on projects within
</I>&gt;<i> ecosystems&lt;<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/openkollab?hl=en">http://groups.google.com/group/openkollab?hl=en</A>&gt;that
</I>&gt;<i> support driving collaborative activity between projects. The
</I>&gt;<i> information we are currently collecting is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Mission and Goals*: the objective is to see if collaboration
</I>&gt;<i>    possibilities arise if projects have aligned missions
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Collaborative Relationships*: projects self identify other projects
</I>&gt;<i>    they believe they can collaborate with
</I>&gt;<i>    - *Project Summaries;* specific information about business models, market
</I>&gt;<i>    strategies, unique differentiators etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Examples of the specific information being collected can be found in the
</I>&gt;<i> various tabs in, for example, the Open Manufacturing
</I>&gt;<i> Ecosystem&lt;<A HREF="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiJ9wl9qbZEzdGRYY2YzRlhHemVMT3ZFd1otSHp0anc&amp;hl=en">https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiJ9wl9qbZEzdGRYY2YzRlhHemVMT3ZFd1otSHp0anc&amp;hl=en</A>&gt;spreadsheet.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i> Technology Infrastructure Strategy*
</I>&gt;<i> An associated strategy that will, in time, be developed on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> information models is a technology layer that supports the matching of
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Details of the vision that underlies the technology strategy can
</I>&gt;<i> be found in the following presentations:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Open System Mobilization
</I>&gt;<i> Platform:&lt;<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/open-system-mobilization-platform-011509">http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/open-system-mobilization-platform-011509</A>&gt;This
</I>&gt;<i> describes a vision for a platform that matches projects to support
</I>&gt;<i>    mobilization of projects around large scale social problems.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Ecosystem Mobilization Platform:
</I>&gt;<i>    &lt;<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/ecosystem-collaboration-platform2">http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/ecosystem-collaboration-platform2</A>&gt;This
</I>&gt;<i>    offers some thoughts on what the user interface paradigm for such a platform
</I>&gt;<i>    might look like.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Project Matching:&lt;<A HREF="http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/openkollab-project-matching">http://www.slideshare.net/sureshf/openkollab-project-matching</A>&gt;This
</I>&gt;<i> describes how meta-data such as that being currently collected via our
</I>&gt;<i>    information models can be used to match projects and drive collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our mission is, in part, to solve the systemic problem that impedes the flow
</I>&gt;<i> of capital into social ventures because we believe that the development of
</I>&gt;<i> an infrastructure that supports social ventures would be beneficial to
</I>&gt;<i> humanity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If possible, I would like to arrange a time for a quick chat just to
</I>&gt;<i> introduce you to our work and to explore areas of potential collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is of interest, maybe we can connect on Skype. You can find me at
</I>&gt;<i> sureshf
