<PRE>The agenda was open, but rapidly the main topic of the meeting emerged: the
development of strategic plans. Metagovernment is not progressing as desired
and it is thought that defining goals and objectives would help. In others
words, what comes next after consensus, in terms of getting the stuff done.
There was some disagreement with planning, since in this organization nobody
can be coerced to respect the plans, making them not useful. So, it was
accorded to experiment with strategic planning to see what happens... Owen
will take care of this.

The rest of the meeting turned around the CMS topic. What Metagovernment is
seeking must not be understood as a known CMS, such as Drupal; it's hard to
explain what is (although it will take much of the interoperability of the
active projects). Pietro will solve this, preparing a page in the wiki
exposing its features.

Next meeting is on February 20, 1700 GMT.
