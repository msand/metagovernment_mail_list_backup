<PRE>See below for some recommendations from the tuxfamily.org site regarding
changing the wiki license.

We have been accepted with the restriction that we do not host the wiki with
them under its current license. But, should we change the license, this
would become an option.

They are currently setting up our webspace; I will let you know when the
blog is up

Re,
Le vendredi 05 f&#233;vrier 2010 &#224; 14:47 -0500, Jacki Buros a &#233;crit :

Unfortunately, it is not simple to change the license of the wiki

since the existing content was released by authors under the original

license. We cannot contact all authors to re-submit since we have, in

the past, allowed anonymous edits. And, it is not desirable to delete

or remove the content contributed previously. If you or your

organization has a better option of how we might migrate license, we

are all ears!


2 steps :
- new license (to discuss) applicable for _new_ content by YYYYMMDD
(specify a date) see for example
<A HREF="http://cookerspot.tuxfamily.org/wikka.php?wakka=WikiLicense">http://cookerspot.tuxfamily.org/wikka.php?wakka=WikiLicense</A>  (I had
forgotten one license)
- call for change of license for older content and approval by those
contributing identified

Our group has discussed this at length, having been dissatisfied with

the current license for some time, and concluded that changing license

to a less restricted types for wiki content is not simple. It is for

this reason that we are not planning to continue to use this license

for other projects (such as the blog) that we would like to host on

TuxFamily.org


fine, just track these discussions on the old wiki on a dedicated
page ;-) You may find suficient identified contributors to change as
many pages as possible and track approvals. Good luck, it took some
months for KDE &amp; wikipedia

Will this be a deal-breaker even though we are not hosting the wiki on

TuxFamily.org, and only plan to set up other contents which would all

be released under free licenses?


that's ok for us. Welcome at TuxFamily.org
<A HREF="http://faq.tuxfamily.org/License/En">http://faq.tuxfamily.org/License/En</A> may give you more precise links. Do
not hesitate to ask questions :-)
