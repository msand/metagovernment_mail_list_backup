<PRE>I'm very happy to see government agencies attempting to open up to  
public input more, but Ideascale is a poor way to do it. My objections  
are:

1. It is closed-source and privately controlled, so there is no way to  
verifiably audit the results it produces. One could claim that it's  
not being used for actual elections, so no big deal. But... if  
agencies are acting on the results it produces, then there certainly  
could be motivation for corruption of those results. I don't see why  
governments should ever use closed/private source for anything that  
might affect decision-making. They're inviting a scandal.

2. It makes the far-too-common assumption that something that gets the  
most votes must be the best, when history often shows otherwise. It  
seems downright archaic to use such a primitive concept of voting when  
we have the power of modern information technology at our disposal.  
They could learn something from our &quot;Consensus through synthesis&quot;  
principle. And from some, heck most, of our member projects. They all  
seem to have a more sophisticated vision of voting than a popularity  
contest.

Separately, I very much agree with your assessment of the misguided  
approach in doing this top-down. But what can you expect from  
politicians? If they were actually trying to do it right, they would  
be looking at how to open up the executive and legislative decision- 
making processes; an nobody is even talking about that. That is, after  
all, my motivation in being involved in this project... politicians  
aren't inclined to defer to citizens on a regular basis, and there's  
no reason to expect that to ever change.

</I>&gt;<i> a)      The &#8220;ideas&#8221; were documented on the Web as proposed goals and

</I>&gt;<i> Documenting ideas as goals and objectives in StratML format would

</I>&gt;<i> BTW, &#8220;citizen-centricity&#8221; was supposed to be a hallmark of President

</I>&gt;<i> Obama Administration may be satisfied with input and feedback  
</I>&gt;<i> systems based upon the structure of the bureaucracy rather than the  
</I>&gt;<i> objectives (and attributes) of citizens, there will be cause to  
</I>&gt;<i> wonder whether they understand or support that concept either.

</I>&gt;<i> Here's an excerpt:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In response to President Obama's &quot;Open Government Directive,&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> federal agencies now have &quot;/Open&quot; pages where you can learn about  
</I>&gt;<i> each agency's work to become more open and collaborative. Each of  
</I>&gt;<i> these pages also includes a link to a dialog tool where you can  
</I>&gt;<i> share your ideas and discuss or vote on ideas submitted by others on  
</I>&gt;<i> how agencies can:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --Work better with others inside &amp; outside the government
</I>&gt;<i> --Improve the availability &amp; quality of information
</I>&gt;<i> --Be more innovative &amp; efficient
</I>&gt;<i> --Create their Open Government Plans
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I encourage you to participate, share your ideas and help us improve  
</I>&gt;<i> how we deliver online services and information!
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks!
