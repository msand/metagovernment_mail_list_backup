<PRE>Dear All,

I just wanted to remind you that we are right now writing the new
proposal for the next webservices that should be used for
metagovernment.

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>

Right now only 1 persone has written a new proposal. Please, we need much more.

In particular I would invite those who did not suggest something the
first time to do so now. Fabian, Thomas and Manuel come to mind.

Also I have looked at the voting patterns, and it look like there are
some people who are in key positions, that is if they just voted for a
certain proposal, the number of proposals in the pareto front would
drop. So I would like to invite those people to propose alternative
ideas, inspired by the proposals that did not vote. Something that
should be ok for the people that already voted for that proposal, but
for them as well.

In particular:
Ed and Matias, both of you, can you write a version of this proposal:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1492&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1492&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>
that you feel you can give your support to, while being similar enough
to the previous version that you are not going to loose any of the
previous people who voted for it: (vilfredo OwenAmbur jb555 Thomas).

If you succeed each of you will be responsible for collapsing the
pareto front by one proposal (a different one).

I haven't done a full study this time, but it looks like only Ed and
Matias were in those key positions. This does not mean we should not
write more ideas. Especially since ideas came out in the last meeting.
Eventually I will make a function that calculates those
automatically...

Cheers,
Pietro
