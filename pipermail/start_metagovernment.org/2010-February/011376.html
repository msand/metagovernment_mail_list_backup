<PRE>Thanks Pietro, I have not submitted this for voting, per comments below.

Though, I will note that the draft was initially posted 5 days prior
to this notice (with a notice at that time as well). So, including the
12 hours, I gave 5 days for comments and feedback.

Perhaps it would be useful to have a vote 'to vote' -- so that users,
after making edits, can say 'this is ready for a vote' or 'this is not
ready'.

thoughts ?

</I>&gt;<i> An effort that I find probably as annoying as being on the receiving end.

</I>&gt;<i> the percentage of people who participate are often extremly low, and always
</I>&gt;<i> too low.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So giving to people more time, and even avoiding to move on until at least
</I>&gt;<i> enough people have turned up to vote seem to be the most sensible thing to

</I>&gt;<i> But suppose this:
</I>&gt;<i> we make a request on Vilfredo or Candiwi. And the request is something that
</I>&gt;<i> should have effect for the whole community. No one turns up to vote, but
</I>&gt;<i> only one or two people.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the request passes, and now everybody should follow it.
</I>&gt;<i> And then people, time after, protest: &quot;Hey, I don't agree with that...&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> As Ed correctly pointed out: what does consensus mean in among an open group
</I>&gt;<i> of people.
</I>&gt;<i> So, I would definitely would suggest that you keep it up for editing for at
</I>&gt;<i> least 3 days. If not even, 3 days after the last edit.
</I>&gt;<i> And in the meantime, may I nag people about the question on the CMS?

</I>&gt;<i> So far we have 6 proposals from 4 people. Please if you did not write your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, do it NOW. It will only take you a second. And your idea will help
</I>&gt;<i> shape the website(s) on which metagovernment should use in the future.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; An issue we didn't get to at the last meeting, but which certainly

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; project's software such as Candiwi or Draft2Gether.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If we decide to make such a transition, we would probably need to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; all the content from the old wiki, then vote on whether or not to go

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; with it. That would be the perfect opportunity to drop the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; non-commercial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; clause, since any previous editor who wishes to keep their contributions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; non-commercial would then technically be able to vote against that
