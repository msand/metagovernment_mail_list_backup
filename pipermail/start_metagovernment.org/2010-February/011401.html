<PRE>The break point is what you refer to below as &quot;official  
consideration.&quot; How can we know what that is if there is no  
authoritative mechanism for defining it?

I am all for removing limitations wherever possible, but at some point  
a community needs to decide that they have reached agreement enough  
such that they can act. That decision needs to be made either by a  
person or by a vote of the community.

Many of us don't want to see decision-making concentrated in anyone  
less than everyone who wants to participate. So that leaves an  
authoritative vote. Where does that vote occur? More precisely: How  
does the community know when a proposal has turned into a policy?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> free-range voting, it may need to have several discreet ranges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you think of an example, though?  Where exactly might it be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to enforce a limited range of choice, with regard to voting
</I>&gt;<i> tools?  Or with regard to any other type of tool?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has already been pointed out that some tools have entirely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different focuses. Rather than trying to make them work in tandem,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they would work better in sequence (e.g., ideas are developed in one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and decided in another).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not allow the voter to cut across all such boundaries?  She might
</I>&gt;<i> vote for (or against) anything at all, using her favourite voting
</I>&gt;<i> engine.  For example, she might use it to support an idea that was
</I>&gt;<i> still under development *and* a decision that was already under
</I>&gt;<i> official consideration.  Why limit her freedom of application, in this
</I>&gt;<i> regard?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise, why not allow her to break out of the sequence of an
</I>&gt;<i> official, administrative process?  So she might continue to vote for a
</I>&gt;<i> measure, even after some organized group has made a &quot;final&quot; decision
</I>&gt;<i> in rejection of it. (Or vice versa.)  Why limit her freedom of
</I>&gt;<i> expression, ever?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This adds additional layers of complexity to the concept of the free-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> range voting, but it also makes it seem more practical. Those layers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are: defining the ranges (such as the ones I suggested in my earlier
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> post), and then defining which tools apply to which ranges
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (understanding that some tools may apply to more than one).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The simple form of free-ranging - no restriction at all on choice of
</I>&gt;<i> voting tool - appears to be practical.  All it requires is
</I>&gt;<i> transparency of vote data across platforms.  I'm now wondering if we
</I>&gt;<i> can also have free-range registration, based on trust mirroring.  At
</I>&gt;<i> first glance, it also looks do-able.  (You can see an emerging
</I>&gt;<i> symmetry between voting and registration in the diagrams here:
