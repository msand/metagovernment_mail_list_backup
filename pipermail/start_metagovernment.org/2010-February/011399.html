Sorry, I didn't mean that some tools should be excluded entirely, but  
that they should not be grouped together. That is, if there is to be  
free-range voting, it may need to have several discreet ranges.

It has already been pointed out that some tools have entirely  
different focuses. Rather than trying to make them work in tandem,  
they would work better in sequence (e.g., ideas are developed in one  
and decided in another).

This adds additional layers of complexity to the concept of the free- 
range voting, but it also makes it seem more practical. Those layers  
are: defining the ranges (such as the ones I suggested in my earlier  
post), and then defining which tools apply to which ranges  
(understanding that some tools may apply to more than one).
