Subject: Re: [Start] FW: help US Govt improve transparency

 

I'm very happy to see government agencies attempting to open up to public
input more, but Ideascale is a poor way to do it. My objections are:

 

1. It is closed-source and privately controlled, so there is no way to
verifiably audit the results it produces. One could claim that it's not
being used for actual elections, so no big deal. But... if agencies are
acting on the results it produces, then there certainly could be motivation
for corruption of those results. I don't see why governments should ever use
closed/private source for anything that might affect decision-making.
They're inviting a scandal.

 

[I agree that the potential for misuse, if not also abuse, exists.  I'll be
surprised if anything truly &quot;scandalous&quot; results from the use of Ideascale
to accept input and feedback on open gov plans, and I personally don't
really care much about the software that is used - so long as the records
that are created and used are in open, nonproprietary format and, thus,
readily accessible for auditing.  In that respect, to me, it is a bit
scandalous that an open format (like StratML) is not being used to document
and share the &quot;ideas&quot; being generated.  However, rather than dwell on that
point, it seems to me that it would be better to try to engage the folks at
Ideascale in an initiative to specify an open standard format for the types
of records created and processed by their software.  If the folks involved
in Metagov.org are unwilling or unable to participate in specifying such a
standard(s), I personally consider them to be no better than the folks at
Ideascale (and in some respects worse).] 

 

2. It makes the far-too-common assumption that something that gets the most
votes must be the best, when history often shows otherwise. It seems
downright archaic to use such a primitive concept of voting when we have the
power of modern information technology at our disposal. They could learn
something from our &quot;Consensus through synthesis&quot; principle. And from some,
heck most, of our member projects. They all seem to have a more
sophisticated vision of voting than a popularity contest.

 

[I agree that we should strive to move beyond voting - to *doing* things
that are within our own power to do (rather than hoping that someone else
will do them for us or, worse, trying to force someone else to do them).  In
that respect, I don't even care so much about &quot;consensus&quot; as about what
those who do agree with the objectives are willing and able to contribute to
realizing them.  That is the kind of &quot;synthesis&quot; about which I care.]

 

Separately, I very much agree with your assessment of the misguided approach
in doing this top-down. But what can you expect from politicians? If they
were actually trying to do it right, they would be looking at how to open up
the executive and legislative decision-making processes; an nobody is even
talking about that. That is, after all, my motivation in being involved in
this project... politicians aren't inclined to defer to citizens on a
regular basis, and there's no reason to expect that to ever change.

 

[I personally expect more from politicians, and if enough others begin to do
so as well, the behavior of politicians will change . or they will no longer
be politicians (or at least not elected officials).  For example, if the
electorate comes to expect it, candidates for public office will publish
their plans in StratML format, accept and consider feedback on the goals and
objectives, and report progress (or lack thereof) against their objectives
in near-real time on the Web.  *I* am constantly &quot;talking&quot; about that.  Will
you join me?]

Dear Metagov Colleagues, a number of agencies are using <A HREF="http://ideascale.com">http://ideascale.com</A>
to enable input and feedback on their open gov plans, and while that's good,
it would be better if:

 

a)      The &quot;ideas&quot; were documented on the Web as proposed goals and
objectives in StratML format, and

b)      Any system conforming to the applicable standard(s) could be used to
provide input and feedback on those proposed goals and objectives.

 

Presently, there does not seem to be any way for users to conduct a queries
in their own terms and find &quot;ideas&quot; of interest to them regardless of where
they are posted (i.e., on which agency's feedback system), much less to use
any interface preferred by the user to provide input and feedback. 

 

Documenting ideas as goals and objectives in StratML format would enable the
creation of indices to address the former problem.  Hopefully, Metgov can
help address the second half of the problem.

 

BTW, &quot;citizen-centricity&quot; was supposed to be a hallmark of President Bush's
management agenda: <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml</A>
However, his Administration never demonstrated an understanding of what that
means, operationally speaking, and to the degree that the Obama
Administration may be satisfied with input and feedback systems based upon
the structure of the bureaucracy rather than the objectives (and attributes)
of citizens, there will be cause to wonder whether they understand or
support that concept either.

Here's an excerpt: 

In response to President Obama's &quot;
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive">http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive</A>&gt; Open
Government Directive,&quot; federal agencies now have
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/around">http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/around</A>&gt; &quot;/Open&quot; pages where you can learn
about each agency's work to become more open and collaborative. Each of
these pages also includes a link to a dialog tool where you can share your
ideas and discuss or vote on ideas submitted by others on how agencies can: 

--Work better with others inside &amp; outside the government 
--Improve the availability &amp; quality of information 
--Be more innovative &amp; efficient 
--Create their Open Government Plans 

I encourage you to participate, share your ideas and help us improve how we
deliver online services and information! 
Thanks!
-Rachel
