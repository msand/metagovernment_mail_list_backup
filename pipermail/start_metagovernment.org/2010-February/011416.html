<PRE>Deal all,
a few points:

Yesterday at the meeting it was just me, Ed and a third person who was
there for the first time.
Matias was there but didn't participate, and no one else even
appeared. I even saw on google chat a couple of members and I have
invited them.

Mostly it was me and Ed chatting.
If all this does not represent a failure of the meeting I don't know what does.
So now I think we should question the meeting. At least the schedule.
Is once every 2 weeks too tight? Should we move to once a month, or
once every 2 months?
Or, as we say in Italy, once every time the pope dies?

Please share your idea.

Next info:
We moved on the CMS question on Vilfredo. It looks like we have nearly
reached an agreement. Only Thomas did not agree on proposal 1552:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1552&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1552&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>

Thomas can we ask you two things:
1) can you please give a feedback on what according to you is wrong on
that proposal, so we can suggest something better according to your
guidelines?
2) Can you please write a new version of the proposal that you would
support? This would help us move on the conversation.

Regarding (1) I am not singling you out. Vilfredo should (and
eventually will) have the software to detect people who are in key
positions, and can particularly help. And will eventually contact them
directly.
Regarding (2) we are going to implement also a system for people to
send feedback. Especially on the questions in the pareto front they
did not support.

Dear all, I know it is annoying to spend time in discussing these
things but the point of participative democracy is you need to
participate.

Third point, yesterday there was a test of direct voting in Italy
where people could vote on the best singer for Sanremo. You might
remember that Italy is a Republic. We sent the king on an errand after
WWII. Recently the inheritor to the throne came back to Italy, after
suing Italy (in front of the EU) for having laws against him and his
family (it was illegal for him to come back). Somehow he managed to be
able to come back. Which should be ok... So he presented a song in
Sanremo about his love for Italy. The song is about the worse that has
ever been presented. Please don't take my word, judge yourself:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrLrb6mSH_8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrLrb6mSH_8</A>

Well, in this context people were invited to vote, by sending text
messages. 1 euro costly text messages! Well this song received so many
text messages that it arrived second. The musician of the orchestra of
Sanremo were so upset that they ripped the music sheet!

Some people now on youtube suggested that he might have bought the
votes (how hard is it to buy a service to send x text messages to a
number? Not much, I assume).
If it wasn't for him, still the judgement would have been biased by
the fact that some of the people participating appeared recently in TV
(maybe in the big brother? I don't know).
In short when people vote they don't vote at the question they are
asked (which is the best song, who is the best singer), but to a more
general question: who do you like best (in any regard).

It's something we should consider.


after all the critic I receive more often is:
you want to give direct power to the people?
In a world were 79% of american believes that the sun rotates around the earth
(ref: <A HREF="http://www.gallup.com/poll/3742/new-poll-gauges-americans-general-knowledge-levels.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/3742/new-poll-gauges-americans-general-knowledge-levels.aspx</A>
)
this is not necessarily wise.

Usually my response to this critic is that as long as people don't
have to make choices they will never learn.

Today for the first time I received an answer which was non trivial:
ok, you give direct power to the people, and as a result you go back
to have a monarchy in Italy. Then it takes 200 years for people to
wise up enough not to have a king anymore. It's a big cost.

&quot;Just sayin&quot;
