<PRE>Ed and Pietro,

I would expect them to act as before.  (Thomas might have more to say
on this.)  My own perspective is that vote mirroring per se is
concerned with imaging of individual votes.  It is not concerned with
consequences - the collective results, decisions and other ultimate
actions - that follow in response.  Consequences may vary from group
to group, such that two groups (or communities, or organizations) that
share the same vote pool may nevertheless respond in different ways.
(Technically speaking, we should accept this.)

  Proposal: To build a sandbox in the park
  Results:
    Candiwi:     Rejected :-(
    Votorala:    N/A, still open
    WhiteHouse2: N/A, still open

Votorola has no mechanism for acceptance or rejection.  (Neither does
WhiteHouse2, if I recall.)  You'd need a separate technical layer in
order to pin an ultimate decision on an issue, and seal it's fate.  If
you wanted, you could use the extra layer provided by Candiwi for this
purpose.  (That would be a personal choice, of course.  Others might
not choose to follow the same rules.)

In the latest design proposal (as of yesterday) there is a place for
common meta-tagging of issues, outside of Candiwi and Votorola, in the
common infrastructure of the street/statewikis.  That's where issues
are defined across all engines (by interlinking, if need be).  Users
are free to annotate the issue pages, subject (like in any wiki) to
the basic editing rules.  (If they disagree with even those rules,
they can fork the issue definitions, and annotate them separately.)
<A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/votorola/t/cc482c303b4d5c21">http://groups.google.com/group/votorola/t/cc482c303b4d5c21</A>

So, for example, the talk page for the sandbox issue might have an
entry like this:

  Hello neighbours.  I spoke with a friend in the City Parks
  department.  He was very interested in our proposal, and he
  recommended that we should ...

That's an action, of sorts (albeit only preliminary).  There might
also be a table of &quot;formal actions&quot; on the issue page.  It would
record significant actions that have occured in line with that issue.
This is where the decisions of private member groups, governments and
other organizations would be recorded.  But this is all up to the
users to define, implement, and maintain.  None of it is technical
infrastructure (thankfully).

However, it's safe to say that no political decision could be made
binding on individual users *through* the medium of the
street/statewiki.  That would invalidate the wiki as public ground,
and provoke an immediate fork by the disaffected.  The place for
binding decisions and enforcements is elsewhere.  (A public cannot be
bound by rules.)

The theorists don't know about vote mirroring, yet.  I admit there's a
risk, but I'd like to prototype it before trying to explain it to
them.  It will help to have something concrete to show.

Yes, I think so.  Here's some MUST rules for the imaging of individual
votes in &quot;vote scope&quot;, and (separate concern) the interpretation of
the overall results in &quot;poll scope&quot;:

(See the talk page for links to other discussions - all recent.
 Afaik, nobody's been down this road before.)
