<PRE>I agree with you Pietro, taking choices is the natural way to learn to
take choices. By opening up democracy I'm sure that one is not giving
place to ochlocracy, that would be a gross mistake and also a
misconception: not having representatives is the point of direct
democracy, not that everybody can cast a vote. (So, criticizing direct
(and indirect) democracy that way isn't smart.) Because of this
communities make distinctions between who can do it and who can't;
normally you can do it if you have reached majority of age, you know
the rule... ;)

That kind of rule depends on the community. I've been thinking, for
the University, to give more weight to the votes of those who have
more subjects passed. In Taringa!, this Argentinian online community,
newbies can post stuff but can't vote on others posts, till their
posts receive enough votes from &quot;full users&quot; and then they become full
users themselves.
