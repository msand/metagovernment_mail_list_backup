</I>
Can you think of an example, though?  Where exactly might it be
necessary to enforce a limited range of choice, with regard to voting
tools?  Or with regard to any other type of tool?

&gt;<i> It has already been pointed out that some tools have entirely  
</I>&gt;<i> different focuses. Rather than trying to make them work in tandem,  
</I>&gt;<i> they would work better in sequence (e.g., ideas are developed in one  
</I>&gt;<i> and decided in another).
</I> 
Why not allow the voter to cut across all such boundaries?  She might
vote for (or against) anything at all, using her favourite voting
engine.  For example, she might use it to support an idea that was
still under development *and* a decision that was already under
official consideration.  Why limit her freedom of application, in this
regard?

Likewise, why not allow her to break out of the sequence of an
official, administrative process?  So she might continue to vote for a
measure, even after some organized group has made a &quot;final&quot; decision
in rejection of it. (Or vice versa.)  Why limit her freedom of
expression, ever?

&gt;<i> This adds additional layers of complexity to the concept of the free- 
</I>&gt;<i> range voting, but it also makes it seem more practical. Those layers  
</I>&gt;<i> are: defining the ranges (such as the ones I suggested in my earlier  
</I>&gt;<i> post), and then defining which tools apply to which ranges  
</I>&gt;<i> (understanding that some tools may apply to more than one).
</I>
The simple form of free-ranging - no restriction at all on choice of
voting tool - appears to be practical.  All it requires is
transparency of vote data across platforms.  I'm now wondering if we
can also have free-range registration, based on trust mirroring.  At
first glance, it also looks do-able.  (You can see an emerging
symmetry between voting and registration in the diagrams here:
