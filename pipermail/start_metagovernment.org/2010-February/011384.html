<PRE>This question is primarily targeted at Michael, but others are very  
welcome to chime in. It has to do with his proposal for free-range  
voting, where a single issue can be opened to voting on multiple  
different software platforms (ie, active projects) and the results get  
normalized in some way such that all those votes can be understood as  
one whole.

Manuel raised a particularly interesting objection, which concerned  
decision-making. If people are voting on a single issue on multiple  
different platforms, then how would the community (the community  
relevant to the issue) decide how to act on those votes?

Say a proposal is rejected in Candiwi, is accepted in Votorola, and is  
ranked #17 in its topic area in WhiteHouse2. Then what meaningful  
information can be taken from that result? Or more concisely, even if  
the voting is more consistently positive (or negative) over different  
platforms: at what point does a community say that a proposal has been  
accepted or rejected?
