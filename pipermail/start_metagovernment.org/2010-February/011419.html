<PRE>I would to like to call the attention for the name of what we're
promoting. It happens that *collaborative governance* is&#160;&quot;a process
and a form of&#160;governance&#160;in which participants (parties, agencies,
stakeholders) representing different interests are collectively
empowered to make a&#160;policy&#160;decision or make recommendations to a final
decision-maker who will not substantially change consensus
recommendations from the group&quot;. This comes from Wikipedia, but it
also appears that this meaning is present in other places of the
Internet as well. (Google it.)

To make things worst, open source governance has *considerably* weight
in the Internet; one can be tempted to return to that previous name,
although it's an unfriendly one. Anyway, I feel that we can move
forward and try to pick a better name. I see two ways we could follow,
if the group agree:

a) To do some bibliographical research among science fiction,
political science (and the combined genre 'political science fiction')
books, looking for the first term coined. Recently, while reading, the
word *computocracy* assaulted me. Should we revive it? There is even a
1985 book by Archie J. Bahm with that name.

It seems to me that a term lasting with '-cracy' is a great choice:
technical and elegant.

b) To hear what Internet has to say about this subject, analyzing
search results. People use several synonyms for open source
governance, like democracy 2.0, open politics, open governance,
collaborative democracy, participatory democracy, and so on. The 2.0
suffix won't help, but the word 'open' tends to appear a lot, also
'democracy'. (For some reason open democracy isn't suitable.)

I like open governance the most, because is simpler than open source
governance, yet it can be easily related to it. We could convince
Wikipedia editors to point open source governance to open governance,
not otherwise, as actually occurs.
