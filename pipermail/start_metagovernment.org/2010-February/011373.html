<PRE>Great news about Vilfredo!
In brief:
A) an update version has just been inserted.
A.1. And this has (finally!!!, most of you will say) the division in
text of a proposal and abstract of the proposal. As it was requested
in the Wall of text question (we still need to add the measures, but
this was the most urgent part to do!). So from next time no one can
write a proposal longer than 1000 characters without inserting an
abstract. And only the abstract will be visible, unless someone clicks
on the show more button.
A.2 A retweet button on the question page.
A.3. a limit of a 100 ch in the length of the tytle of a question (to
make it tweetable).

B) Also, as most of you already know we started a twitter account for
Vilfredo. Both vilfredo and vgta were taken. Instead we discovered
that vg2a was not taken. So we now have the
@Vg2A account for Vilfredo.
Right now I am, by hand, tweeting the questions. But in future it
should be automatic.

C) There is a new question from Jackie in the politics page:
&quot;How can a government system reconcile the need for debate (and
perhaps endless debate) with the need for action?&#160;&quot;
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=84&amp;room=Politics">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=84&amp;room=Politics</A>

You can go there, answer, and test the abstract at the same time. How
is that of a deal?

D) the question on the CMS has moved on. It was an automatic move on.
I have set up the minimum move on to 3 days and the max to one week,
but seeing that only 5 people (out of the hundreds and hundreds in
metagovernment) has written something I was going to wait some more.
But alas my own coding played against me.

Already 3 people have voted for the proposal they like (or can live with).
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>
Please vote. Even if you haven't wrote a proposal, try to check which
ones you like. The more people vote the more the result will be
representative of this community.

And last an announcement.
We are right now working on the next upgrade which should let people:
a) log in with twitter
b) look at vilfredo even if they are not logged in
c) write and vote even without being logged in (but then having to
register before submitting on a pop up window).

Eventually we want to make a system where people can participate
anonymously (after all you don't need to be logged in for the pareto
front to work.).
But this should only be possible if the person who asks the question permits it.

One of the things that we have noticed (and I think most of you will
agree with me) is that questions where the people participating are
not always the same tend to have a hard time in reaching a consensus,
end up having a small consensus between few people, and the result is
hardly an integrated work of the proposals made. Somehow it looks like
continuity is important. This is an important result. Of course we
don't know to what extent this is true. Is it also true if there are
100 people participating in a question? What if every time you have
10% turnover of new people. All this is pointing to the fact that
although it is important to give to people the possibility to vote
anonymously, this should be decided on a case by case basis.

Also we want to implement the possibility to chose person by person
who can participate in a voting session. So a community might let a
discussion be trasprent while only letting people inside propose, or
vote, or both.

Any thoughts on any of this would be good.
