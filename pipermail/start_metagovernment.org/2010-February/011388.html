<PRE>Dear Metagov Colleagues, a number of agencies are using <A HREF="http://ideascale.com">http://ideascale.com</A>
to enable input and feedback on their open gov plans, and while that's good,
it would be better if:

 

a)      The &quot;ideas&quot; were documented on the Web as proposed goals and
objectives in StratML format, and

b)      Any system conforming to the applicable standard(s) could be used to
provide input and feedback on those proposed goals and objectives.

 

Presently, there does not seem to be any way for users to conduct a queries
in their own terms and find &quot;ideas&quot; of interest to them regardless of where
they are posted (i.e., on which agency's feedback system), much less to use
any interface preferred by the user to provide input and feedback.  

 

Documenting ideas as goals and objectives in StratML format would enable the
creation of indices to address the former problem.  Hopefully, Metgov can
help address the second half of the problem.

 

BTW, &quot;citizen-centricity&quot; was supposed to be a hallmark of President Bush's
management agenda:  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml</A>
However, his Administration never demonstrated an understanding of what that
means, operationally speaking, and to the degree that the Obama
Administration may be satisfied with input and feedback systems based upon
the structure of the bureaucracy rather than the objectives (and attributes)
of citizens, there will be cause to wonder whether they understand or
support that concept either.

 

Owen

See February 8, 2010 post on USA.gov's GovGab blog by Bev Godwin:

Here's an excerpt: 

In response to President Obama's &quot;
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive">http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/documents/open-government-directive</A>&gt; Open
Government Directive,&quot; federal agencies now have
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/around">http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/around</A>&gt; &quot;/Open&quot; pages where you can learn
about each agency's work to become more open and collaborative. Each of
these pages also includes a link to a dialog tool where you can share your
ideas and discuss or vote on ideas submitted by others on how agencies can: 

--Work better with others inside &amp; outside the government 
--Improve the availability &amp; quality of information 
--Be more innovative &amp; efficient 
--Create their Open Government Plans 

I encourage you to participate, share your ideas and help us improve how we
deliver online services and information! 
Thanks!
-Rachel
