</I>
Open, sure, but I haven't seen or thought of any reasonable
alternative.  Unless the system has a way to filter the information
presented to each user, I claim that it is unworkable because it will
simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
problem.  Anyone disagree?

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;my second issue, which is the use of the term &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> settleit.org and other debate systems.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To my knowledge you won't find the words 'fact' or 'truth' on the
</I>&gt;<i> SettleIt.org website. Everything is a statement which can be debated.
</I>
Truth is on there as is &quot;knowledge&quot; which I equate to &quot;facts&quot;.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;In the abortion debate, one of the &quot;facts&quot; is that the Bible says it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wrong.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your example of the abortion debate, one of the statements is that the
</I>&gt;<i> Bible says it's wrong. In SettleIt.org under that statement people would be
</I>&gt;<i> debating that the Bible does not say that abortion is wrong and others will
</I>&gt;<i> debate the weight of the bible on the abortion debate which includes if
</I>&gt;<i> someone should believe in the Bible.
</I>
OK, so every SettleIt debate has the option of including a branch
which will settle the issue of whether the Bible is true ;-)  Maybe
now you can see why filtering is a good strategy?

&gt;<i> I believe one of the major reasons for constant disagreement and inaction is
</I>&gt;<i> the tendency for people to disregard others concerns instead of addressing
</I>&gt;<i> and resolving those differences. If you just filter out religious statements
</I>&gt;<i> then you are not engaging with a large section of the group.
</I>
But that's my choice.  I'm not denying any of them their right to free
speech, I'm denying them the right to freely speak *to me*.  I don't
want to hear it as it is annoying, time-wasting, and of no value to
me.  When enough other people express the same opinion, instinctive
social behaviors will kick in and they'll simply stop being annoying
like that (again, this is covered more completely in my book and
Altemeyer's).

&gt;<i> You can't make
</I>&gt;<i> a group decision by ignoring the concerns of others in the group. You can
</I>&gt;<i> use the religious filter to realize and express the reasons for your current
</I>&gt;<i> opinion but it does not serve the group.
</I>
This sounds a little like that &quot;consensus&quot; thing again.  &quot;Serving the
group&quot; does not require serving every member of that group.  Some
people are just going to have to go along with what the majority (or
supermajority) prefer.  In a lot of cases, at least if we do things
right, it'll be the authoritarians who end up with the short end of
the stick, and this is as it should be because it has been clearly
shown that when they get the big end they turn around and beat people
with it.

&gt;<i> Obvious nonsensical and destructive
</I>&gt;<i> statements should probably be filtered out but it will take time to
</I>&gt;<i> determine those standards.
</I>
Right, and in my proposal there is an option even above flagging, and
that's moderation (which should be very rare, but is a necessary
component for dealing with the dangerously antisocial).

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;editing other people's stated opinions just feels 'icky'.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will work on making this more clear and answering it here is helping me
</I>&gt;<i> work through the text.  SettleIt.org is not a place for personal opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> Entering a statement is stating that this is a reason to believe or not
</I>&gt;<i> believe in another statement. It is assume to be reasonably shared by
</I>&gt;<i> multiple people and could be expressed in several ways with some ways being
</I>&gt;<i> clearer than others. All statements are an attempt to be a fact but the
</I>&gt;<i> extent to which they are true can always be debated.
</I>
It is certainly more elegant to use the same system for this part of
the evaluation, but again I'd be concerned about the length issue.
Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
flags it that way.

    Scott
