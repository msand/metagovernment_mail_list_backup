<PRE>James,

Thanks. That is a good point that the behavior is separate from the belief.

I slightly disagree with &quot;Your not going to be able to convince them to not
be religious just as much as they could never convince you to be religious.&quot;
I have known many people to change their position on this and other core
beliefs. Those changes were often because of information from other people.
I would prefer not to limit our possibilities. I agree it is a very
difficult conversation to have but in some cases it is necessary. In other
cases religions have changed on their positions. There are indications that
many evangelical Christians were pro-choice before the 60's.

I think our biggest challenge is oversimplification.

Cheers,
Bentley

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the limited length of a statement in SettleIt.org it's quite easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the system to identify that behavior and mitigate against it. Also, due
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to it's design a standard user would not need to enter a lot of statements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at one time so there can be a low cap on the frequency that one person
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could enter statements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It my efforts I have been able to work with many people that appear to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trolls at the start. There are exceptions but by in large communication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> skills can overcome most trollish behavior. You appear to use several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communication styles that would encourage trollish behavior that may be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reducing your effectiveness.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;But these are empirical questions and ones I'm assuming we're have to do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the research and answer ourselves&quot;
