<PRE>Scott Raney,

Just to be clear, I am not suggesting that we use SettleIt.org in this
group. I would be happy with any decisions process including the one you
propose. We can spend all our time poking holes in each others suggestions.
Every system will have it's perceived flaws and real flaws. There is no
perfect system. I think it's important that we try many systems and clearly
document our findings to build upon.

I do feel it is necessary to address any misperceptions about SettleIt.org
so I'll just add my comments to your statements.



&gt;<i> &quot;The can of worms it opens instead is
</I>&gt;<i> the issue of unequal votes: As there is no restriction on the number
</I>&gt;<i> of posts, any troll (read authoritarian) can game the system by&quot;
</I>

I claim that this issue already exists in a direct democracy but is not
addressed. There is no limit to the resources a group can use to manipulate
the citizens through media and spamming the internet with false facts. If
that issue is external to the system then it is difficult for the system to
mitigate it.


&quot;Much better is to *systematically*
&gt;<i> marginalize trolls by identifying them (via aggregate ratings and
</I>&gt;<i> flagging) and use this information to filter their disruptive input
</I>&gt;<i> out of the information stream&quot;
</I>

Any troll mitigation features I have seen can be added to SettleIt.org.
They are also more effective in a structured and specific system.


&quot;editing the troll posts (and what's up with that, anyway?)&quot;


A post in this system is similar to sentence in Wikipedia. It is not a self
expression but a piece of information which is not owned by anyone and is
the responsibility of everyone. You are not editing someone post, you are
clarifying a piece of information. There would be similar abuse prevention
controls as in Wikipedia but one again since it is specific and structured
the controls would be more effective.


&quot;The problem with our current system is that they (and their partners in
&gt;<i> crime the Social Dominators) gravitate toward positions of power and so
</I>&gt;<i> muck up the operation of representative governments by distorting the
</I>&gt;<i> numbers.&quot;
</I>

The Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are two of the many problems
facing people making a group decision. My gut reaction is that the issues
caused by the Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are smaller than the
problem of bias and misinformation when assessing proposals. To ask a
Neurotypical to make a complex decision in our misinformation rich
environment is analogous to making someone determine how much money is in
their bank account without allowing them access to the totals on their bank
records, computer, calculator or even pen and paper to sum up their
deposits and withdrawals. SettleIt.org is simply a checkbook register for
decision making. As a byproduct the impact of Authoritarians and the Social
Dominators is also mitigated in a systematic decision making process.

Respectfully,
Bentley
