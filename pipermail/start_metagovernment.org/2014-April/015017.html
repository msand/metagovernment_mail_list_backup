<PRE>Scott Raney,

To discuss further about the following statement you made:

&quot;..they're not even trying to solve the right problem,
&gt;<i> which is that there is a (fortunately small) segment of the population
</I>&gt;<i> which is *genetically programmed* to make their decisions based on
</I>&gt;<i> their prejudices and the direction given to them by their a priori
</I>&gt;<i> authorities. &quot;
</I>

On the contrary, SettleIt.org was specifically designed to encourage people
to state and defend their prejudices and authorities. If it is used instead
of voting then you can only rely on an authority or prejudice when it is
agreed to by all the other participants.

Voting encourages authoritarians as they do not need to directly justify
their decision.

I read quite a bit of <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A> . I was not able
to find what was new or unique about the decision making process in The
Plan that would discourage decisions based on prejudices and the direction
given by priori authorities.

The most specific description of the process I can find is:

&quot;Basic components of The System will include forums where topics to be
&gt;<i> debated are introduced and discussed, with the best ideas determined by
</I>&gt;<i> popular vote to be formulated into laws and promoted to a voting forum
</I>&gt;<i> where The People will vote to adopt or reject them (a meritocracy, or more
</I>&gt;<i> properly mericracy, of ideas). &quot;
</I>

This seems to be the same as many direct democracy systems. Is there a new
concept or angle I am missing?

Thanks you,
Bentley
.
