<PRE>+1 what Bentley said.

I do want to add that you can never convince someone of something they
don't want to believe. But that is not the point. It is about creating
understanding between people with different beliefs and representing both
sides.

In your abortion example. Your not going to be able to convince them to not
be religious just as much as they could never convince you to be religious.
It doesn't mean you can't keep people from trollish behaviors. You can hold
a belief very strongly and not be a troll about it. Trolling is a behavior
not a belief. In the above example you can convince (with communication
skills) both sides to not Troll the system while still maintaining and
representing their beliefs on the site.

Cheers,
James
