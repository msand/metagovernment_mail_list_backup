<PRE>Hi Ed, sorry for the slow reply

Summary: I require consensus on the ultimate goal with at least one
other person who contributes real work.  I think anyone who wants to
actually accomplish something will have the same requirement.

Ed Pastore said:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I get the point of your question; but I think the most
</I>&gt;<i> critical aspect of this group is some degree of
</I>&gt;<i> open-mindedness. That is a sort of necessary condition for achieving
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-through-synthesis. (Though that then makes me consider if
</I>&gt;<i> we're a good test group for our own dogfood... we as a group are
</I>&gt;<i> fairly open-minded, so compared to the norm, we may be to willing to
</I>&gt;<i> see others' point of view. The real acid test of our systems will be
</I>&gt;<i> when we enter arenas where people are entrenched in seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> uncompromising positions, such as the abortion debate.)
</I>
I think that's easy.  For a group to be open minded, it needs only one
other participant who is both open-minded and decent enough to reply
thoughtfully to your suggestions, etc.  I don't think you need to
worry here.  As long as you continue to set the example, then you'll
find at least that &quot;one other&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; Speaking for myself, the first thing I'd need to know is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purpose of these [procedures proposed by Bentley].  It sounds to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; me like we'd be pushing toward a goal (which is good).  So my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first question would be, What goal precisely?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My goal would be to foster communication. Discussing in the context
</I>&gt;<i> of an email list server presents difficulties in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. following a thread, especially as it branches.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. knowing where to jump into an ongoing conversation.
</I>&gt;<i> 3. understanding the history of a conversation
</I>&gt;<i> 4. reading massive amounts of text; often poorly/diversely formatted
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Numbers 1-3 are all closely related. Number 4 is a deep issue that
</I>&gt;<i> gets overlooked a lot, perhaps because it is so difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> address.
</I>
As an ultimate goal, this leaves me unmoved.  I'd rather aim for
something higher - near the heights proclaimed on the mission page -
but with at least two people (myself included) actually agreeing to
that goal and working toward it.  Then I think newcomers would help.

The group's real aims are unclear.  The mission page doesn't describe
anything that folks are actually working on.  Folks talk big, but they
don't act according to any common, agreed purpose.  It's goofy.

Fixing that problem would be my prerequisite for any substantial
participation.  But (and this is my point, though I could be wrong)
the same is true for anyone else who's ever likely to help in moving
things forward.

Mike
