<PRE>+1
I like that this is a more participatory system. I think Ed nails it on the
head that if you allowed a person more say, as in they actually
participated in crafting the decision, they would value it more. If they
valued it more they would participate more and you get a positive cycle
instead of the negative one we have today.

Enforcing would then be a lot easier because people who took part would
value the policy more.

Cheers,
James

&gt;<i> Scott, we seem to fundamentally differ here. I've explained my rationale,
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't see yours. So I'll restate mine:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hold that voting and proposal generation/tuning must go hand-in-hand and
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely should not be separate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A root problem with the status quo is that people are presented with a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal and asked to vote it up or down. In the U.S., we call this a
</I>&gt;<i> referendum, and it is horrible. The crafting of the proposal is where all
</I>&gt;<i> the actual decision-making happens (the devil is in the details), and
</I>&gt;<i> almost everyone is disenfranchised from that. And then when people are
</I>&gt;<i> asked to vote, they don't care, since they have so little influence on the
</I>&gt;<i> important parts of the matter: the details. A million vote for, a million
</I>&gt;<i> vote against: what does my input matter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Voting *guides* proposal-tuning. It tells you what is getting buy-in and
</I>&gt;<i> what is not consensus-building. While proposals are being crafted, we might
</I>&gt;<i> come to a point where half are for and half are against. You suggest a
</I>&gt;<i> majority-rule forced vote. I say that's a horrible solution. What if
</I>&gt;<i> instead one person said: &quot;Wait a minute, I have a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> idea; hey everyone, see if this solves your issues better.&quot; A lot of those
</I>&gt;<i> alternates might fail, but some genius might come up with something that
</I>&gt;<i> gets almost everyone onboard. I say that is infinitely better than forcing
</I>&gt;<i> a majority rule. And it cannot be done unless the voting and
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making are mixed. You know you have an answer when the votes pile
</I>&gt;<i> up on one proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to
</I>&gt;<i> force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not
</I>&gt;<i> for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the
</I>&gt;<i> people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Further, the conclusion is specious. How does my sentence support
</I>&gt;<i> majority rule? Are you claiming that the majority in fact do read volumes
</I>&gt;<i> before voting? I propose the opposite conclusion: a well-crafted consensus
</I>&gt;<i> system corrects for the ignorance of the majority by empowering the
</I>&gt;<i> minority to provide sane input into decisions that could otherwise be
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelmed by the ignorance of &quot;the masses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nope, the way to do that is to prevent the &quot;ignorant masses&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disrupting the crafting of the proposal that will be voted on.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a different process from the one where they get to vote on it, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as described in my book the actual voting process should include the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text of the proposal as well as the best crafted pro and con arguments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (just like the most helpful positive and negative reviews as shown on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Amazon, and what comes in the Blue Book (voter's guide) in many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; counties (and that few people read because it's not nearly as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; convenient as it will be in an e-democracy system)).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting
</I>&gt;<i> until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; And in the mean time?  No government at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; No hasty decisions, yes! What good is a decision that sucks for half
</I>&gt;<i> the people? Why should we rush to the wrong decision? Unless there is an
</I>&gt;<i> army about to invade or a giant meteor about to strike, do we really need
</I>&gt;<i> to rush governance? We are no where near the level of invading armies or
</I>&gt;<i> world-saving governance, so I don't see any need for hasty decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> here. Especially if it leads to awful results.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, you're confounding the proposal generation/tuning phase with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the actual vote.  They must be two separate steps in the process.
