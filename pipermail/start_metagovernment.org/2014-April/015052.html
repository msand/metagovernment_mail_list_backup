<PRE> &quot;I claim that it is unworkable because it will
simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
problem.  Anyone disagree?&quot;

I completely disagree. Technology has solved much more complex problems
than this. 4 years ago (maybe more) no one would have thought you could
talk into your phone and it would actually do something useful (siri).
Machine learning? A.I.? 3d printers? I mean come on, they landed on the
moon like 50 years ago. To create a system where you can easily sift
through large amounts of data is a UI issue. Those just take someone
creative enough with the right amount of resources to implement it and the
right access to the data.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) People won't trust it: Humans are lousy at probability and
</I>&gt;<i> statistics and so are just going to be innately skeptical that this
</I>&gt;<i> will work properly (even though we scientifically-minded folks would
</I>&gt;<i> have no problem with it).  Worse, because you can't prove randomness,
</I>&gt;<i> most people will consider any vote that doesn't go their way to be
</I>&gt;<i> invalid due to some sort of behind-the-scenes tampering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Even if they would have voted the same way, any new policy will
</I>&gt;<i> lack the necessary support because even those who would have supported
</I>&gt;<i> it didn't have to psychologically commit to it by pressing that
</I>&gt;<i> button.  This will lead to great difficulty implementing policy, and
</I>&gt;<i> probably cyclic behavior (repeated overturning and reinstating laws).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) It makes the &quot;rational voter&quot; problem worse: Political economists
</I>&gt;<i> already struggle with the concept of the &quot;rational voter&quot;, a concept
</I>&gt;<i> their field relies on, simply deciding not to vote because
</I>&gt;<i> *rationally* it doesn't make sense to invest any time doing this
</I>&gt;<i> because the probability that their vote will make a difference is
</I>&gt;<i> close to 0.  Reduce their opportunity to vote to 1 in 100 or 1 in
</I>&gt;<i> 1,000 decisions and vast numbers of people will simply drop out of the
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) After #3 what will remain is a self-selected sample of the very
</I>&gt;<i> people who we most need to *reduce* the participation rates of.  That
</I>&gt;<i> is, people who participate not out of a sense of civic duty but
</I>&gt;<i> because they crave power over others (i.e., Social Dominators and
</I>&gt;<i> Authoritarians).  Which again is what my and Altemeyer's books are
</I>&gt;<i> about and I think convincingly show would be a bad outcome.
