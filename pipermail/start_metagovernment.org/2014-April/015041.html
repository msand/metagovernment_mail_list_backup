<PRE>One correction to this.  Besides flag and filter, there is one other
possible technique for reducing the transaction costs of voting:
Sampling, as is proposed for Blinap and is how moderation is done on
Slashdot.  By randomly selecting a subset of the population and
*assigning* them the task of doing a more in-depth analysis and then
voting this method is not only much more efficient, but could
theoretically even improve the quality of the decisions because rather
than having a large number of people do a superficial analysis you'd
have a much smaller number of people doing a more complete one.  But
IMHO there are insurmountable problems with this design:

1) People won't trust it: Humans are lousy at probability and
statistics and so are just going to be innately skeptical that this
will work properly (even though we scientifically-minded folks would
have no problem with it).  Worse, because you can't prove randomness,
most people will consider any vote that doesn't go their way to be
invalid due to some sort of behind-the-scenes tampering.

2) Even if they would have voted the same way, any new policy will
lack the necessary support because even those who would have supported
it didn't have to psychologically commit to it by pressing that
button.  This will lead to great difficulty implementing policy, and
probably cyclic behavior (repeated overturning and reinstating laws).

3) It makes the &quot;rational voter&quot; problem worse: Political economists
already struggle with the concept of the &quot;rational voter&quot;, a concept
their field relies on, simply deciding not to vote because
*rationally* it doesn't make sense to invest any time doing this
because the probability that their vote will make a difference is
close to 0.  Reduce their opportunity to vote to 1 in 100 or 1 in
1,000 decisions and vast numbers of people will simply drop out of the
system.

4) After #3 what will remain is a self-selected sample of the very
people who we most need to *reduce* the participation rates of.  That
is, people who participate not out of a sense of civic duty but
because they crave power over others (i.e., Social Dominators and
Authoritarians).  Which again is what my and Altemeyer's books are
about and I think convincingly show would be a bad outcome.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: 381 words, so this doesn't require the TL;DR summary ;-)
