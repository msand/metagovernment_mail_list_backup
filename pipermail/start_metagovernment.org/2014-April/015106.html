<PRE>I suppose i might get into a tech religion argument instead but I instead
will say the obvious:

You need to make a guess about future tech to build your world domination
app upon.

You are not yet a cool kid.  Take a look at platform as a service   There
is a fine chance that an operation like Hereko? Would handle all your
versioning issues and take care of the scaling from a few users to a few
billion with you just writing checks. Cost will run from zero at one end to
the GDP of several small countries at the other end.  I rather like them in
particular because of ancient walk bys.  This is all cloud stuff of course
and i am sort of puzzled about people talking about scaling to 10**9 users
and not starting with choices that imply that capability.

Try this:  is there something in the non-existent  mission vision that
implies a need to scale smoothly over 9 orders of magnitude with 5  9's
reliability?  Is a vote error of 10 million votes on all world referendii
acceptable?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your technological ignorance is showing a little in your last post. Is
</I>&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ment to say.  You really wish we would have stayed with software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications instead of moving to the serverside applications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely.  Going a little off topic here, but the browser-based
</I>&gt;<i> architecture is incredibly limited, complicated, and brittle (meaning
</I>&gt;<i> it breaks with every little change, like version upgrades).
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone/Android is a little better because most things are apps and so
</I>&gt;<i> the developer has more control, but *ideally* versioning and
</I>&gt;<i> extensions would have been built into the OSs a long time ago so, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, instead of JavaScript which is a complete POS (and everyone
</I>&gt;<i> knows it which is why there are so many extensions and workarounds for
</I>&gt;<i> it), apps could have been built in any scripting language and the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary engines and libraries downloaded on the fly.  This problem
</I>&gt;<i> could have been solved at several different junctures (e.g., when
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft added automatically downloaded OS updates for Windows 95,
</I>&gt;<i> when HTML was originally defined to purposely exclude interactive
</I>&gt;<i> elements, or when Netscape chose to build in a weekend-hack scripting
</I>&gt;<i> language instead of defining an open architecture, etc.) but due to
</I>&gt;<i> shortsightedness and proprietary-think never has been.  Like I said,
</I>&gt;<i> if it the web had been *designed* instead of evolving with the bizarre
</I>&gt;<i> set of constraints it has, I'd have a working voting system up and
</I>&gt;<i> running in days or weeks whereas now it's going to take me months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;ignorance&quot;, I'll cop to that as, like I think I said, I burned
</I>&gt;<i> out and retired from software development about 10 years ago and so am
</I>&gt;<i> having to learn a lot about the current environment (and not liking it
</I>&gt;<i> much at all).  But I've been developing software from microcode and
</I>&gt;<i> assembly languages through 3GLs and 4GLs up to AI languages since I
</I>&gt;<i> was a kid (40 years ago) so I think I have a pretty good awareness of
</I>&gt;<i> what works and what doesn't.  And as for django/pyramid/flask or
</I>&gt;<i> anything based on Tcl or Python, talk about &quot;old school&quot;!  I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> touch either of those languages with a 10 foot pole.  Of course, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't help that the product I burned out developing was a major
</I>&gt;<i> competitor of those languages and yet still exists as a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product (after enabling me to retire, unlike the the developers of
</I>&gt;<i> those other languages, who got the fame instead ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I've finished the main Rails tutorial I'm considerably less
</I>&gt;<i> enamored of it.  The main concept that comes to my mind is &quot;bag on the
</I>&gt;<i> side&quot;.  The whole development environment is really just a collection
</I>&gt;<i> of hacks, kluges, preprocessors, and workarounds instead of a unified
</I>&gt;<i> architecture (which is why I had to spend the first few hours in the
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial *fixing* version incompatibilities in it!).  It's really
</I>&gt;<i> designed for professional full-time developers who must deal with a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of different projects for different clients and where a project
</I>&gt;<i> may get passed around among several developers not all of whom will be
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the overall design.  Which unfortunately doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> describe this project.   I've written to my old crew to see if maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it might be faster and easier to customize the old product (which is
</I>&gt;<i> now open source) than punish myself by doing it the Rails way, but
</I>&gt;<i> using Rails is still the backup plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I have a hard time believing this would eclipse Facebook someday.
</I>&gt;<i> In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the US you vote 1 time ever 4 years and how much time do they actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research and post opinions about it? Not very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe my FB &quot;friends&quot; are different, but although I'd agree that stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like cat videos and pictures of food are still the main fare, bitching
</I>&gt;<i> about governments, corporations, etc. make up a significant percentage
</I>&gt;<i> of the posts.  Imagine what it would be like if they actually believed
</I>&gt;<i> that posting would *change* things...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  How much do they hang
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out and talk with their friends? A lot lot more. They even watch cat
</I>&gt;<i> videos
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more. I think a good measure of this is day to day how much does the
</I>&gt;<i> average
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person talk politics? If you can answer that, I think you would get a
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea of how often people would use the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, *everyone* is interested in this, many of them *intensely*
</I>&gt;<i> interested.  It's just that they feel powerless and don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> waste their time, offend anyone, or end up looking foolish.  We're
</I>&gt;<i> going to change all that.  And even with filtering it'll still be a
</I>&gt;<i> lot less risky than talking politics with their family members,
</I>&gt;<i> friends, or neighbors ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And even if it did explode in usage it's scope is so much more focused
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data won't be the issue. Getting participation would be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's definitely a huge &quot;crossing the chasm&quot; issue here, which we'll
</I>&gt;<i> see when a few small organizations (HOAs, small towns, etc.) start
</I>&gt;<i> using the new system as their primary decisionmaking process.  The
</I>&gt;<i> pressure on higher levels (county/state/federal/global) will build
</I>&gt;<i> very gradually, but eventually I believe will become irresistible and
</I>&gt;<i> we have to have a plan in place to specify how the transition will
</I>&gt;<i> occur.  Which is why I wrote that book (learning from the mistakes of
</I>&gt;<i> the design of the WWW, and all our current types of government, as it
</I>&gt;<i> were).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
