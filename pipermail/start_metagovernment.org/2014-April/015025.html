<PRE>&quot;Q: If all this stuff has worked well for us, why doesn&#8217;t every company
work this way?
A: Well, it&#8217;s really hard. Mainly because, from day one, it requires a
commitment to hiring in a way that&#8217;s very different from the way most
companies hire. It also requires the discipline to make the design of
the company more important than any one short-term business goal.
And it requires a great deal of freedom from outside pressure&#8212;being
self-funded was key. And having a founder who was confident enough
to build this kind of place is rare, indeed.
Another reason that it&#8217;s hard to run a company this way is that it
requires vigilance. It&#8217;s a one-way trip if the core values change, and
maintaining them requires the full commitment of everyone&#8212;
especially those who&#8217;ve been here the longest. For &#8220;senior&#8221; people
at most companies, accumulating more power and/or money over
time happens by adopting a more hierarchical culture.&quot;
