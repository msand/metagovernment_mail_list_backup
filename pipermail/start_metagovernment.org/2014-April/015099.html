<PRE>Sorry I am on my mobile and hit send on accident.

Your technological ignorance is showing a little in your last post. Is what
I ment to say.  You really wish we would have stayed with
software applications instead of moving to the serverside applications?

Also, I have a hard time believing this would eclipse Facebook someday. In
the US you vote 1 time ever 4 years and how much time do they actually
research and post opinions about it? Not very much. How much do they hang
out and talk with their friends? A lot lot more. They even watch cat videos
more. I think a good measure of this is day to day how much does the
average person talk politics? If you can answer that, I think you would get
a good idea of how often people would use the system.

And even if it did explode in usage it's scope is so much more focused the
data won't be the issue. Getting participation would be.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Time (and resources) we don't have unfortunately.  In defense of
</I>&gt;<i> filtering again (once more unto the breach!):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) AI for analysis/sorting/filtering is not an option.  Even if we had
</I>&gt;<i> the resources to develop such a system it would almost certainly fail
</I>&gt;<i> to work properly (as all other public trials of these things have,
</I>&gt;<i> although I have to admit that Amazon's review system works pretty well
</I>&gt;<i> in the limited domain it has to function, although of course we don't
</I>&gt;<i> really know how much of that is some sort of &quot;Mechanical Turk&quot; kind of
</I>&gt;<i> trick). Even if we did build a system that worked, few people would
</I>&gt;<i> trust it (would *you* trust a machine to filter your feed for you?
</I>&gt;<i> People trust FB to do this, but IMHO that's only because it really
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter if it filters out something important because the
</I>&gt;<i> assumption is that there is very little in that category on FB ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) We will have moderators to handle technical problems and the worst
</I>&gt;<i> offenders (criminal acts), but don't have enough resources (especially
</I>&gt;<i> starting up) to rely on them to do any actual content filtering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) People are very good at identifying trolls and other problem users,
</I>&gt;<i> and they'll do it for free if we provide them the tools to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me this is a tremendous opportunity to not only solve the
</I>&gt;<i> filtering problem itself, but also the resource limitations we face in
</I>&gt;<i> building a filtering system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Banning problem users is not an option: This is their government
</I>&gt;<i> too and they have to be allowed to participate.  We just need a way to
</I>&gt;<i> apply social pressure to them to improve their behavior (pressures
</I>&gt;<i> that are constantly in place out in the real world but are lacking in
</I>&gt;<i> cyberspace), or, if that fails, a way to minimize their disruption
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., making it so that people don't have to see or deal with their
</I>&gt;<i> posts unless they really want to).

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Essentially Facebook is using an outside vendor to help scour their site
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for credible notable news in an effort to give journalism a reason to
</I>&gt;<i> turn
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to Facebook for breaking news.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, FB may one day be useful and relevant.  I'm not holding my
</I>&gt;<i> breath (and I'm also not shorting their stock although I'm quite sure
</I>&gt;<i> that someone who knew what they were doing could make hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> millions of dollars doing exactly that ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And Facebook has to deal with 684,000 pieces of content posted every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; minute to come up with legitimate news stories. That is much much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; complex then the problem you are dealing with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Umm, there are billions of people on this earth who should be
</I>&gt;<i> participating in their government, and far more of them will log in
</I>&gt;<i> regularly to this system than FB (half of their members log in less
</I>&gt;<i> than once a week, and that's assuming you trust FB's self reports (and
</I>&gt;<i> I don't)).  Sure, there's a lot more useless stuff that FB has to
</I>&gt;<i> manage (more pictures of someone's food, yay!) but if we do this right
</I>&gt;<i> the scalability issues we will face will be even larger than what FB
</I>&gt;<i> is currently dealing with.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: As for building the system, I've been doing Rails tutorials for
</I>&gt;<i> the past few days and believe it is the best option for a development
</I>&gt;<i> environment at this point.  It is unfortunately an incredibly brittle
</I>&gt;<i> and baroque platform and it still boggles my mind that this is really
</I>&gt;<i> the best we CS types have come up with after all this time.  I still
</I>&gt;<i> lament that we live in a browser-based world because if I could just
</I>&gt;<i> build this as an app I'd have a working prototype available already.
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, to be able to go back to the late 70s and be in a position to
</I>&gt;<i> guide development to prevent this abomination from evolving the way it
</I>&gt;<i> has...
