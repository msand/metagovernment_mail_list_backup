<PRE>I would be worried about this problem.

<A HREF="http://xkcd.com/927/">http://xkcd.com/927/</A>
And as far as the plan goes. It would be very hard to iterate quick cycles
and build the thing with public/crowd source funding alone. In the end you
talk about how you could accelerate features faster and innovate at a
quicker pace than existing social networks because you would not be as tied
to the secrecy that those social networks require. They spend billions of
dollars on those things for a reason, It's not easy to innovate. It takes
smart people. and smart people are expensive.  And, yes they have to make
money on them because sustainability is impossible without income(time +
money). Who is going to host the servers? Process the Data? Pay the
janitors of the data centers?

Let's operate on the assumption that your idea is great and survives it's
kick-starter campaign to fruition and people start using it. What is the
plan for sustainability? I agree with the &quot;If you build it. They won't
come&quot; idea mentioned before. It will be a hard grind to get something
working that as you mention will have a lot of kickback from the
authority/power at hand.

I also agree we should focus on finding people who want to use it. In small
communities or organization for example.

I think that a kickstarter to get money to have dedicated resources to find
and help the adoption of current systems in order to find out what works
and doesn't would be really effective. Although since it is not a product
kickstarter might not be the right platform. You get the idea though.

I think it is hard when you are building this for &quot;people&quot; as in for a
undefined group idea, compared to developing it for a Person, or some group
of people that already exist.

And your final example about Taiwan (where I am currently living).

&quot;&quot;&quot;
Guerilla attacks would be commonplace and impossible to stop. For example,
suppose as part of the
proposed peer-to-peer cell phone system upgrade a targeting app could be
installed such that any cell
phone could be used to call out the location of an occupying force
leadership target (be it by GPS,
pointing it out on a map, or taking a photo and having the phone determine
the location by matching it 64

up with street view and aerial photography). A companion mortar-aiming app
would allow any other
citizen within range to hit that target. Or perhaps a micro-drone targeting
app could be used to deliver
a bomb to that location instead of the usual pizza or package from an
ecommerce company
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Incredibly complex and expensive technology to just suddenly have. You
forget the first thing you would do when you invade is cut off all
communication channels.You don't think they could use the peer to peer
system against us? /jam/hack it? All it takes is one family who has access
to the micro-drone targeting app to be invaded and told, &quot;if you don't give
us your phone, we will torture and then kill your family in front of you&quot;.
Now the enemy can just send our own bombs against us.

and this
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Planish weapons systems would consist primarily of small and portable
devices, probably nothing larger
than could be hidden in a garage and towed behind a pickup truck, such as
small drones or cruise
missiles, and other low-cost, high-accuracy systems.
&quot;&quot;&quot;
low-cost and high accuracy... I am pretty sure those are two ends of a
continuum. You normally have to choose one or the other.

With the previous examples I don't mean to discourage your idea or your
passion. We need more of that. I just wanted to highlight the incredible
cost (time and money) your system would take. Something that doesn't show
up out of nowhere.

Ed Pastore made a good point when he said he didn't have time to read a
whole book right now. Everyone has their own real lives they have to worry
about. We need the right people and the money to buy their time for this to
really work. Not to mention, someone who really wants to use it.

Cheers,
James

&gt;<i> Scott Raney,

</I>&gt;<i> To discuss further about the following statement you made:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  &quot;..they're not even trying to solve the right problem,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is that there is a (fortunately small) segment of the population
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is *genetically programmed* to make their decisions based on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their prejudices and the direction given to them by their a priori
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authorities. &quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the contrary, SettleIt.org was specifically designed to encourage
</I>&gt;<i> people to state and defend their prejudices and authorities. If it is used
</I>&gt;<i> instead of voting then you can only rely on an authority or prejudice when
</I>&gt;<i> it is agreed to by all the other participants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Voting encourages authoritarians as they do not need to directly justify
</I>&gt;<i> their decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I read quite a bit of <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A> . I was not
</I>&gt;<i> able to find what was new or unique about the decision making process in
</I>&gt;<i> The Plan that would discourage decisions based on prejudices and the
</I>&gt;<i> direction given by priori authorities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The most specific description of the process I can find is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Basic components of The System will include forums where topics to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debated are introduced and discussed, with the best ideas determined by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popular vote to be formulated into laws and promoted to a voting forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where The People will vote to adopt or reject them (a meritocracy, or more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properly mericracy, of ideas). &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be the same as many direct democracy systems. Is there a new
</I>&gt;<i> concept or angle I am missing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks you,
