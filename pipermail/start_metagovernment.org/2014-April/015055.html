<PRE>TL; DR

Use a popular social network to propose missions/visions

I now start a new thread.  What i am thinking is that no one serious thinks
we have democracy and no one really thinks the reality of democracy would
be wonderful.  And it is not like the decisions that are made however are
identifiable successful.  On the last then maybe an action oriented
approach rather than a decision approach is a goal.  Oh i am not big on
equality either.  So here is a decision mode:  those that can agree on a
mission/vision and go from there.  It is not like there are a shortage of
missions and it is not like i should have to worry about someone thinking
their mission is different than mine so let us nuke them from orbit.  So
the new thread will now be created.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I used to take your own participation for granted [Ed].  But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that's a mistake, of course.  So let me ask, what would be your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; own answer?  What would send you packing if you didn't find it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure I get the point of your question; but I think the most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; critical aspect of this group is some degree of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open-mindedness. That is a sort of necessary condition for achieving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus-through-synthesis. (Though that then makes me consider if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we're a good test group for our own dogfood... we as a group are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fairly open-minded, so compared to the norm, we may be to willing to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see others' point of view. The real acid test of our systems will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when we enter arenas where people are entrenched in seemingly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uncompromising positions, such as the abortion debate.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that's easy.  For a group to be open minded, it needs only one
</I>&gt;<i> other participant who is both open-minded and decent enough to reply
</I>&gt;<i> thoughtfully to your suggestions, etc.  I don't think you need to
</I>&gt;<i> worry here.  As long as you continue to set the example, then you'll
</I>&gt;<i> find at least that &quot;one other&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Speaking for myself, the first thing I'd need to know is the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; purpose of these [procedures proposed by Bentley].  It sounds to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; me like we'd be pushing toward a goal (which is good).  So my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; first question would be, What goal precisely?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My goal would be to foster communication. Discussing in the context
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of an email list server presents difficulties in:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. following a thread, especially as it branches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. knowing where to jump into an ongoing conversation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. understanding the history of a conversation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. reading massive amounts of text; often poorly/diversely formatted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Numbers 1-3 are all closely related. Number 4 is a deep issue that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gets overlooked a lot, perhaps because it is so difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; address.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an ultimate goal, this leaves me unmoved.  I'd rather aim for
</I>&gt;<i> something higher - near the heights proclaimed on the mission page -
</I>&gt;<i> but with at least two people (myself included) actually agreeing to
</I>&gt;<i> that goal and working toward it.  Then I think newcomers would help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The group's real aims are unclear.  The mission page doesn't describe
</I>&gt;<i> anything that folks are actually working on.  Folks talk big, but they
</I>&gt;<i> don't act according to any common, agreed purpose.  It's goofy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fixing that problem would be my prerequisite for any substantial
</I>&gt;<i> participation.  But (and this is my point, though I could be wrong)
</I>&gt;<i> the same is true for anyone else who's ever likely to help in moving
</I>&gt;<i> things forward.
