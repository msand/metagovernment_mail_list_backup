<PRE>Scott Raney,

&quot;The best we can do is to design a system that supports filtering that
&gt;<i> stuff out of the feed&quot;
</I>
I wouldn't limit us to that one solution. Your statements read like you are
not open to other options.


&quot;my second issue, which is the use of the term &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; in
&gt;<i> settleit.org and other debate systems.&quot;
</I>
To my knowledge you won't find the words 'fact' or 'truth' on the
SettleIt.org website. Everything is a statement which can be debated.


&quot;In the abortion debate, one of the &quot;facts&quot; is that the Bible says it's
&gt;<i> wrong.&quot;
</I>
In your example of the abortion debate, one of the statements is that the
Bible says it's wrong. In SettleIt.org under that statement people would be
debating that the Bible does not say that abortion is wrong and others will
debate the weight of the bible on the abortion debate which includes if
someone should believe in the Bible.

I believe one of the major reasons for constant disagreement and inaction
is the tendency for people to disregard others concerns instead of
addressing and resolving those differences. If you just filter
out religious statements then you are not engaging with a large section of
the group. You can't make a group decision by ignoring the concerns of
others in the group. You can use the religious filter to realize and
express the reasons for your current opinion but it does not serve the
group. Obvious nonsensical and destructive statements should probably be
filtered out but it will take time to determine those standards.


&quot;editing other people's stated opinions just feels 'icky'.&quot;

I will work on making this more clear and answering it here is helping me
work through the text.  SettleIt.org is not a place for personal opinions.
Entering a statement is stating that this is a reason to believe or not
believe in another statement. It is assume to be reasonably shared by
multiple people and could be expressed in several ways with some ways being
clearer than others. All statements are an attempt to be a fact but the
extent to which they are true can always be debated.

Regards,
Bentley

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Just to be clear, I am not suggesting that we use SettleIt.org in this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group. I would be happy with any decisions process including the one you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; propose. We can spend all our time poking holes in each others
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every system will have it's perceived flaws and real flaws. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; perfect system. I think it's important that we try many systems and
</I>&gt;<i> clearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; document our findings to build upon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems there's room for balance here.  While it's not helpful to
</I>&gt;<i> criticize a prototype for being incomplete, I for one would hate to
</I>&gt;<i> invest a huge amount of time working on a project based on a design
</I>&gt;<i> that another set of eyes could have told me was doomed before I
</I>&gt;<i> started.  Better to share early and often so that *we* can find any
</I>&gt;<i> flaws rather than some demagogue doing it just before you're ready to
</I>&gt;<i> publicly release...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do feel it is necessary to address any misperceptions about
</I>&gt;<i> SettleIt.org
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I'll just add my comments to your statements.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very good, that's what I'm here for!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;The can of worms it opens instead is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the issue of unequal votes: As there is no restriction on the number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; of posts, any troll (read authoritarian) can game the system by&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I claim that this issue already exists in a direct democracy but is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addressed. There is no limit to the resources a group can use to
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the citizens through media and spamming the internet with false facts. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that issue is external to the system then it is difficult for the system
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mitigate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True, and there will never be a way to prevent that.  The best we can
</I>&gt;<i> do is to design a system that supports filtering that stuff out of the
</I>&gt;<i> feed that most people see while working on a proposal or when
</I>&gt;<i> researching the background of a proposal before casting their vote on
</I>&gt;<i> it.  My proposal is to support tagging/flagging and providing a tool
</I>&gt;<i> that can be used to filter or at least prioritize the feed using those
</I>&gt;<i> tags.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this also brings up my second issue, which is the use of the term
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; in settleit.org and other debate systems.  In the
</I>&gt;<i> abortion debate, one of the &quot;facts&quot; is that the Bible says it's wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>  That may be technically true (although the Bible itself is internally
</I>&gt;<i> inconsistent on the subject), but as an atheist I'd like a button to
</I>&gt;<i> just filter out any religion-based &quot;facts&quot; as I consider them all to
</I>&gt;<i> be based on an invalid authority.  Same with a wide range of
</I>&gt;<i> ideological &quot;facts&quot;, such as &quot;We already have too many laws, we just
</I>&gt;<i> need to enforce the ones already on the books&quot;.  With flag and filter
</I>&gt;<i> this is easy (although actually defining the set of flags is going to
</I>&gt;<i> take some work).  With Settleit?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;editing the troll posts (and what's up with that, anyway?)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A post in this system is similar to sentence in Wikipedia. It is not a
</I>&gt;<i> self
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expression but a piece of information which is not owned by anyone and is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the responsibility of everyone. You are not editing someone post, you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clarifying a piece of information. There would be similar abuse
</I>&gt;<i> prevention
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; controls as in Wikipedia but one again since it is specific and
</I>&gt;<i> structured
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the controls would be more effective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I have a problem with this.  Maybe it's just me, but although
</I>&gt;<i> I have no trouble expressing an opinion or even jumping into wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> to correct factual errors, editing other people's stated opinions just
</I>&gt;<i> feels &quot;icky&quot;.  Which is one big reason why I've been reluctant to just
</I>&gt;<i> jump into the metagovernment web site to make the changes I've
</I>&gt;<i> proposed.  I just feel that although I have a right (even an
</I>&gt;<i> obligation) to criticize, it's just not my place to mess with the
</I>&gt;<i> non-factual content directly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it just me or does this maybe explain why so few others have done
</I>&gt;<i> edits on the metagovernment site?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;The problem with our current system is that they (and their partners in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; crime the Social Dominators) gravitate toward positions of power and so
</I>&gt;<i> muck
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; up the operation of representative governments by distorting the
</I>&gt;<i> numbers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are two of the many problems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facing people making a group decision. My gut reaction is that the issues
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; caused by the Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are smaller than
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem of bias and misinformation when assessing proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could actually be the same problem: Who do you think is most
</I>&gt;<i> likely to be putting that stuff out?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Respectfully,
