Yeah, I'm going to have to disagree with that characterization.  An
analogy would be saying I'm prejudiced against the blind because I
would refuse to allow them to drive cars.  When a position is based on
scientific *facts* about inherent limitations it's not really accurate
to call it prejudice, it's merely social engineering (again, a lot
more on this in my book).

</I>
Well, if they provide that perq to *every* voter, that's not a broken
system, that's a benevolent dictator ;-)

&gt;<i> You could even excuse it

Seems like you're thinking of representative government.  I aim to
replace that entirely as *that's* the architecture that's inherently
broken because of how people are selected to serve in it.

&gt;<i> You're sort of saying two incompatible things.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;There is no &quot;decider&quot;, the final approval is by public vote&quot; &lt;-You think
</I>&gt;<i> they are deciding.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;a small group of people makes decisions about projects&quot; &lt;- They are the
</I>&gt;<i> people that really decide what happens. The final vote just says yes or no.
</I>&gt;<i> Very little actual participation from the masses.
</I>
Relatively, yes.  Spending a half hour a week reading proposals and
voting on them is not an insignificant contribution, however, and is
more than enough to override the SDAs who are running (and ruining)
our current governments.

&gt;<i> Even if the general public majority is not corruptible you still haven't
</I>&gt;<i> addressed how people will be among the chosen to decide the details? and how
</I>&gt;<i> to prevent corruption or prejudice among that small group?
</I>
That will all be handled in the proposal generation/refinement phase,
which again everyone is free to participate in to the best of their
abilities (subject to sorting and filtering, of course).  If they
finish and forward an inherently corrupt proposal to the voters for
approval I have faith that the Neurotypicals (at least) will be able
to spot this and will vote to reject it.

If you're talking about the possibility of corruption in the executive
branch, I solved that problem in my book The Plan too: They're
Managers who are *hired* rather than elected, and can easily be
replaced whenever a problem occurs (a simple majority vote and the
Manager is out!)
  Regards,
    Scott
