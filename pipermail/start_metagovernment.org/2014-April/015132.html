Self chosen (volunteer).  This is just the way things naturally work,
and work in our current systems: People interested in particular
issues (those pesky &quot;special interests&quot;) are the ones who will be
willing to get their hands dirty generating and refining proposals.
It is simply not reasonable to expect *everyone* to participate in
this part of the process because they don't have the time or the
knowledge or even the interest in doing so.  This is the fatal flaw in
most of the other systems I see on Metagovernment which seem to assume
unlimited participation rates.  The notable exception being Blinap
which solves this problem via sampling (which, although it would work,
has other shortcomings that I've addressed previously).

&gt;<i> Also,

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;

</I>
It doesn't matter: If they get corrupted, at least to the extent that
the resulting proposal conflicts with the needs of the many, the
majority-rule vote at the end will simply reject that proposal.  This
matter is discussed further in my book, but I think we have to assume
and adapt to the fact that the better funded/more motivated special
interests *will* have a much higher generation and approval rate for
their proposals.  But this is not necessarily a bad thing because it
is a counterbalance to the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; problem.  It's
mainly a problem in our current representative governments because of
practices like logrolling (vote swapping) where the corruption bubbles
up from the committee level to the floor vote level.  That can't
happen in a direct democracy because organizing it would be akin to
herding cats.
  Regards,
    Scott
