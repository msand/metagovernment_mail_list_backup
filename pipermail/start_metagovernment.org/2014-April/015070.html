So, what, I should be *forced* to wade through religious arguments and
ad hominem attacks because filtering them out would be against my own
best interests or the interests of society?  Maybe so I'll engage in
debate with those posters and educate *them*?  Thanks, but I'll pass.

Again, it's not the system filtering posts (or people) out
automatically (like Google and other search engines do), it's *me*
choosing to do this based on information provided by other users.
I'll certainly agree that this is a two-edged sword because in the
wrong hands it will lead directly to the kinds of confirmation bias
issues that we already see far to much of (although to be accurate far
more commonly by Authoritarians than Neurotypicals).  IMHO it's
clearly worth the risk because it will make everyone so much more
efficient (and so much more likely to participate) because they'll be
able to filter out all the noise that these forums are currently
deluged with.
  Regards,
     Scott
