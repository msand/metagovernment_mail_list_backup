<PRE>Very interesting thread. Im also of mixed opinions an thoughts having been
a lurker on this list a long time, and having tried myslef and watch other
idealistic projects crash and burn.

My two main observations as the reasons for failure are

A) the herding cats problem. Scott, i am imterested eager even to read what
you have written, yet the problem of advanced democracy not unlike
the climate change problem is oversolved and underimplemented, mainly
becuse the only thing people will do for free is advance their own pet idea
or project. It is dual layered collective action problem to use econ speak.
Even though rverybody benefits there are Too many choices what to do and if
to do it. The only way such a problem gets fixed is massive authoritarian
intervention it massive public groundswell. There are good reasons to
beleive that neither will ever happen in this case. Hard problem.

B) if you build it they dont come. The population of people who desire
advanced democracy is about 3% of the population. The other 97% is i have
to say, just dumb about this issue. As a species we tend to be
authoritarian boneheads. Also hard problem.

System wide change is then so unlikely no one seriously attempts it. Thus
it falls to the hobbists.
The hobbists could achive something meaningful if they boned up on the
utopian communities movement, joined up in gangs of about thirty, evolved a
common bushido for the new century, and started to take over small dying
towns of about a population of 500. Succed at that level and you can level
up from there.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the thoughtful post, Scott.

</I>&gt;<i> Many of your criticisms go to me (I'm not complaining), so I'll reply to
</I>&gt;<i> that sort in this thread. I have been doing a horrible job of being a
</I>&gt;<i> thought-leader, cheer-leader, etc. to keep this group going. I have plenty
</I>&gt;<i> of great personal reasons for that, but in the ned it's still a failure of
</I>&gt;<i> leadership which I'm not proud of. I am always more than happy to have
</I>&gt;<i> others step in as much as they are willing. And I also continue to try to
</I>&gt;<i> reorganize my life such that I would have more time to contribute
</I>&gt;<i> (preferably full time).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this list isn't hibernating as much as it appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> cyclical. We have times of great participation and times of none. I have no
</I>&gt;<i> idea why that is, but again it's something I could work through if I were
</I>&gt;<i> pouring more in. As could others, hint, hint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not a developer, so I won't speak to the development of software
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but I'll reply to one or two points separately and a couple
</I>&gt;<i> briefly right here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov does now have an elevator pitch:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been planning on proposing making that (or something very similar
</I>&gt;<i> to it) our home page and/or making a 30-second video containing that text
</I>&gt;<i> and putting that on the home page. Again, it's been a matter of
</I>&gt;<i> time-constraints for me, though others are welcome to step in. (Regarding
</I>&gt;<i> videos, I was also going to propose that everyone/anyone make videos about
</I>&gt;<i> the project... it's not like we need to have only one.) Also, at least
</I>&gt;<i> blinap appears to have a nicely-done elevator-video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation
</I>&gt;<i> I think most of us here are onboard with that. Reference:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you can put it that way, but I sure don't like to. If we do manage
</I>&gt;<i> to break into the mainstream, we're going to have enemies (read:
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians) characterizing us as all kinds of negative things. We don't
</I>&gt;<i> need to give them fuel in advance. I don't see us as revolutionaries simply
</I>&gt;<i> because I don't see any overthrow of the current system. Instead, I'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to see the current systems simply wither and die as people eventually
</I>&gt;<i> ignore them in favor of the much better, stronger solutions that have grown
</I>&gt;<i> around them. There is no treason in dispensing with a
</I>&gt;<i> representative-democracy government if everyone is onboard with it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing on Loomio?  Really?  Seems like this group is hibernating which

</I>&gt;<i> bio here as promised, I'll instead refer you to my book (working title &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> Plan: A Design for an Engineered Civilization&quot;) which has that info (and
</I>&gt;<i> much more) in it.  Get the current draft from my web site (and please mind

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tomorrow I'll also post the guts of the section on the voting and
</I>&gt;<i> budgeting system to this list so that you all can review that without
</I>&gt;<i> having to read the rest of the book.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I've read the archives (every post for the first year, sampled every
</I>&gt;<i> thread since then and read every post in any thread related to my project)
</I>&gt;<i> and believe I have some useful insights to share. Although this post is
</I>&gt;<i> going to strike some of you as that of a troll, it's probably more useful
</I>&gt;<i> to think of it as that of a zealot: &quot;I Have Seen the Light And Am Here To
</I>&gt;<i> Share The Good News&quot; (and if you read the book you'll maybe come to
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate my obsession with irony and how this is just one more example of
</I>&gt;<i> it).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My goal here is not to drive people from this forum or the concept of
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy, but, to be blunt, you've had 6 years now without much to show
</I>&gt;<i> for it and so it's time to &quot;defecate or abdicate&quot; (i.e., if even having
</I>&gt;<i> this debate makes you uncomfortable maybe you're part of the problem rather
</I>&gt;<i> than part of the solution).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So here are the problems I see.  If you're inspired to respond to any of
</I>&gt;<i> these items, please put it in a message by itself and change the subject
</I>&gt;<i> line.  Please nobody take this any of this as personal criticism or
</I>&gt;<i> criticism of Ed as Fearless Leader: I believe all of your hearts are in the
</I>&gt;<i> right place, now we just need to get your heads over there as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can't explain your idea in 30 seconds (the elevator speech),
</I>&gt;<i> nobody's going to trust (or use) your system.  Reviewing all the projects
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen lots of exquisitely baroque architectures that are simply
</I>&gt;<i> nonviable because it takes too long to understand how they work.  This also
</I>&gt;<i> means that in general they'll also take far to much time and effort (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> transactional costs) during operation.  So even if one of them somehow
</I>&gt;<i> miraculously got fully implemented and then adopted by some organization,
</I>&gt;<i> the participation rates would be so low as guarantee failure and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> set back e-democracy projects by years or decades.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) DSTSS: Authentication isn't an issue
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People move billions of dollars around every day with a simple login and
</I>&gt;<i> password, and are perfectly comfortable with systems that you don't even
</I>&gt;<i> have to log into but once.  By the time one of these e-democracy systems is
</I>&gt;<i> ready to actually take over operation of a government, people's attitudes
</I>&gt;<i> will be even more relaxed and the technology for authentication even
</I>&gt;<i> better. The ho-hum reaction to the recent Bleeding Heart exploit means that
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably not even worth obsessively worrying about back-end hacks as
</I>&gt;<i> long as data integrity can be maintained (or even reconstructed).  Compared
</I>&gt;<i> with the risks we all face due to the delays this question is causing in
</I>&gt;<i> implementing a system, authentication is so small an issue that even
</I>&gt;<i> bringing it up almost looks to me like a ploy by people working to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy (blasphemers!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Openness is a sufficient solution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The verdict is already in: Given the choice between freedom and
</I>&gt;<i> privacy/anonymity, freedom wins every time.  Full access to the raw data
</I>&gt;<i> solves not only the security issues but is a useful social engineering tool
</I>&gt;<i> to boot: If people are reluctant to use The System to *publicly* express
</I>&gt;<i> their opinions, and/or are overly concerned with the security issues, we
</I>&gt;<i> don't want them participating anyway (again, see my book for more on this).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) You're working on the wrong problem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob
</I>&gt;<i> Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly
</I>&gt;<i> zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems
</I>&gt;<i> with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of
</I>&gt;<i> representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> to serve in representative governments.  And those exact sa
