<PRE>*Executive Summary*
You saying, &quot;*me* choosing to do this based on information provided by
other users&quot; = euphemism for furthering your own bias justified that a lot
of people agree with you.

Then I provide an example of a user of the system and his thought processes
showing that religion is just one example. And, I state a few flaws that
the example illustrates.

   - People would make decisions on the filtering level before they
   actually had an educated opinion
   - This system leads to a false sense of reality because you are only
   seeing part of the population or argument
   - It doesn't help people see the nuances of the counter argument or the
   deeper levels that need to be discussed
   - It actually encourages and rewards closed mindedness
   - You keep people from arguments that might actually change their
   opinion furthering ignorance on the topic

Finally, it sounds like you would want to filter out people entirely based
on one held opinion essentially saying, &quot;Because you believe this one
thing. Everything else you believe is invalid&quot;. That in psychology is
called &quot;Black and White Thinking&quot; and is labeled in the category of
Thinking Errors.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The point of the system is to keep you from *wading* through it (which
through technology would be possible). One note that says xx number of
people are religiously opposed to this (more info link that then list out
the debates) is to much for you to read?.  Further, ignoring them just
because you don't agree with their point of view... that just keeps you
thinking what you already are thinking further separating groups instead of
fostering understanding. You find people who are like you and agree with
you and further separate yourself from others who don't. I am not saying
you have to agree with these people or convince them, but if you are going
to make decision that impact them. You should at least know what their
opinion is. If you are a leader you are expected to make informed
decisions. Which should include all of the information. It shouldn't be
easy to be a leader.

It translates to much more than just religion. I feel that this thread has
narrowed on that topic as an example and it has become &quot;I just don't agree
with religious people so I shouldn't have to bother with them&quot;. From your
book it is clear you are anti-religious so I am afraid your personal
beliefs are clouding your judgement on the issue. It applies to much more
than religion and I will illustrate below.

*Disclaimer*
I don't mean to make a judgement on the following or show my personal
views. I use them because they are controversial and heavily divided. Lets
create Jake. Here is Jake's experience when using your system.

&quot;
Oh, nice I can set up up filtering based on posters arguments. Let me
see... Well, my grandma had cancer and it was really hard to see her go
through that. So everyone that is against legalizing pot, i'll filter them,
(Oh wait, there are many sides to this argument, like medical verses
recreational, to late, he ignored them all). But, I am against gay marriage
just cause it doesn't make sense to me. I mean they can be together and do
whatever they want, but marriage we should encourage that between men and
women only. Let's filter all pro gay statements (wait, that includes way
more than just marriage, but being a new user he doesn't understand the
implications of it.). Abortion, woh... I don't even want to think about it.
Well, since I don't have a problem with it let's filter anti abortion out.
(wait, he is missing out on the nuances of the argument. Like at what point
in the child's development is abortion not appropriate? When is a baby born
considered alive? Does the father have any say or financial obligations?
Sure he might not agree with any of them, but by filtering them out he
might not even think of them or be exposed to ideas that might make him
question his own opinions. He essentially closes the argument saying, &quot;I
know what is right. I've thought of everything already. There is no new
information that might change my mind&quot;). Legal euthanasia of the infirm and
elderly... Well, I don't think a parent should be able to decide to end
their child's life just because they are sick. Lets, filter out all who
support that. All right great. Now, this is easy. I agree with all the
arguments I see on this site. Awesome it even helps me find people who feel
the exact way I do. Yay, Friends!
&quot;

&gt;<i>From this example you can see a few flaws in your system.
</I>
   - People would make decisions on the filtering level before they
   actually had an educated opinion. I mean why wade through all the counter
   arguments if you already know what is right. Boring...
   - This leads to a false sense of reality. It helps people find people
   who feel exactly the same way who then reenforce each others opinions
   further convincing them they are right based on the fact that the
   information they see agrees with what they believe. Even though what they
   see is not what everyone believes, it just filters out what they don't want
   to see.
   - It doesn't help people see the nuances of the counter argument or the
   deeper levels that need to be discussed. If you already decided you don't
   want to talk about it the discussion is over.
   - You keep people from arguments that might actually change their
   opinion furthering ignorance on the topic.
   - There is no effort to help people be openminded. It actually
   encourages and rewards closed mindedness. The more you filter the easier
   the system gets. And who doesn't want to read on and on all the reasons why
   they are right on a subject. That just makes them feel better about their
   decisions.


Lastly, if you are filtering out people altogether(for example a religious
person, or pro-LGBT) you are essentially saying that because a man holds
one belief all of the rest of his beliefs are invalid. That is pretty
judgmental and closed minded if you ask me.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks. That is a good point that the behavior is separate from the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I slightly disagree with &quot;Your not going to be able to convince them

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from other people. I would prefer not to limit our possibilities. I agree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it is a very difficult conversation to have but in some cases it is

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I do want to add that you can never convince someone of something they

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In your abortion example. Your not going to be able to convince them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to not be religious just as much as they could never convince you to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> religious. It doesn't mean you can't keep people from trollish behaviors.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You can hold a belief very strongly and not be a troll about it. Trolling
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is a behavior not a belief. In the above example you can convince (with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> communication skills) both sides to not Troll the system while still
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> maintaining and representing their beliefs on the site.
