I can't answer that question definitively, but my hunch is that you'd
be lucky to get *any* of them to install that way.  I've been doing
tutorials and demos of various tools and applications every day for
the past few weeks and I have yet to get a single one of the packages
to install and run on the first try.  It's pretty surprising and
disappointing, actually.  I remember always having these problems with
Linux and GNU software 10 to 20 years ago but had hoped that things
would have improved by now.  Unfortunately it seems they're even worse
now because most of the packages themselves are no longer
self-contained and rely on the user installing bits and pieces from a
variety of places, some of which have been &quot;upgraded&quot; and so introduce
incompatibilities.

So, my best recommendation is to see if any of those packages have a
demo site up and use that instead of trying to do your own install.
  Regards,
    Scott
