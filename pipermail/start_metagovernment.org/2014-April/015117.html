How?  I don't see any method of dragging the majority of the
population in for that final approval vote...

No, what I believe is that the Neurotypicals, who make up the majority
(albeit maybe only a slight majority) of the population are moral and
will make the right decisions when they vote.  If we all don't believe
*that*, well, we better start working on our &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;
system because that's the only viable alternative.

&gt;<i> You may argue your system wouldn't allow this, so I ask what is your system
</I>&gt;<i> for deciding who can make decisions and who can't? How are you going to
</I>&gt;<i> fight corruption of that system?
</I>
Read the book ;-)  But to summarize, everyone (at least everyone with
the system credential, which means they've done some sort of training
to know at a minimum how to log in, review the info, and cast their
vote) gets to participate any level and to any degree they wish.
There is no &quot;decider&quot;, the final approval is by public vote which
social pressure should be applied to everyone to make sure at least
the majority participate.  Otherwise we end up with the same system we
have now with the SDAs making the decision for everyone.  Again, if
you don't understand the SDA issue, IMHO you're bound to be trying to
solve the wrong problem.
  Regards,
    Scott
