<PRE>That the flagging system actually be hooked up to something ;-)
There's no way to filter based on the flags, no way to even see how
many times a user has been flagged (even on their own profile page,
which it doesn't even show if you log in from another site), and even
after you flag something, it still appears in your feed!  Flags by
themselves don't achieve much, but when we hook them up to some
*consequences* (other than maybe having the moderators just delete the
post)  I predict we'll see a different result.  Also with ratings:
That comment system, like most, doesn't have any way to rate the
quality of posts other than to &quot;Like&quot; them, so you don't even see the
most interesting/funny/insightful/etc. posts unless you're willing to
wade through *everything*.  That might be an acceptable design if
you're putting a site up for entertainment or just to attract eyeballs
to boost your advertising income, but we've got bigger fish to fry.
  Regards,
    Scott
