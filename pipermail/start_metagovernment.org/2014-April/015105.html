<PRE>But there are billions and billions of decisions to be made throughout the fullness of society at every level of organization. So we can:

1. vastly limit the number of people who are allowed to make any decisions (representative democracy; republics; monarchies; etc.)

2. pick a few major issues and ask everybody in a jurisdiction to vote on them (referenda)

3. open up every single decision and let every single person participate (collaborative governance)

In #3, the result will probably look quite similar to #1: only a few people will actually be involved in any decision or in the development of the proposal to be decided on. But it's completely different in that the group of deciders is self-defined and that anyone who wants to can jump in at any time and affect the proposal and the decision.

I put forth (with admittedly no evidence at hand) that this radically changes the decision-calculus you describe below. Because the authority of the decider is highly valid and the morality of the decision is significantly elevated... for every single one of those billions of decisions. Simply because the process by which the decisions were reached is completely different. It is a process that is inherently authoritative and moral, because nobody was excluded in the development of it.

</I>&gt;<i> 1 point for the risk of getting caught
</I>&gt;<i> 5 points for the legitimacy of the authority who defined or is enforcing the law
</I>&gt;<i> 15 points for whether they believe the law is moral
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposal is therefore operating in that 5 point range.  The 15

</I>&gt;<i> are far more likely to *also* be moral, but the key need is to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> the influence of the SDAs, not just increase that of the
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals).
