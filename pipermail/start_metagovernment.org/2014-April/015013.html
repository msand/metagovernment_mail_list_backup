<PRE>It is indeed a very interesting discussion but I believe that will bring
nothing in advancement.
Our words written here are lost
As a participant in a participatory platform I identify decisions as
something that come from a process of cause and action. This ML is
interesting and sometime I take inspiration, Max S, Scott, Ed and other
some time spot something interesting but a real project seem to me is
missing.
You signal many interesting platform but is missing the synergy between
them and an organic plan.
I do have an answer but is a tough work and cannot be sponsored by an
organization but can be sponsored by a group of smart people.
Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Very interesting thread. Im also of mixed opinions an thoughts having been
</I>&gt;<i> a lurker on this list a long time, and having tried myslef and watch other
</I>&gt;<i> idealistic projects crash and burn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My two main observations as the reasons for failure are
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A) the herding cats problem. Scott, i am imterested eager even to read
</I>&gt;<i> what you have written, yet the problem of advanced democracy not unlike
</I>&gt;<i> the climate change problem is oversolved and underimplemented, mainly
</I>&gt;<i> becuse the only thing people will do for free is advance their own pet idea
</I>&gt;<i> or project. It is dual layered collective action problem to use econ speak.
</I>&gt;<i> Even though rverybody benefits there are Too many choices what to do and if
</I>&gt;<i> to do it. The only way such a problem gets fixed is massive authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> intervention it massive public groundswell. There are good reasons to
</I>&gt;<i> beleive that neither will ever happen in this case. Hard problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> B) if you build it they dont come. The population of people who desire
</I>&gt;<i> advanced democracy is about 3% of the population. The other 97% is i have
</I>&gt;<i> to say, just dumb about this issue. As a species we tend to be
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian boneheads. Also hard problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> System wide change is then so unlikely no one seriously attempts it. Thus
</I>&gt;<i> it falls to the hobbists.
</I>&gt;<i> The hobbists could achive something meaningful if they boned up on the
</I>&gt;<i> utopian communities movement, joined up in gangs of about thirty, evolved a
</I>&gt;<i> common bushido for the new century, and started to take over small dying
</I>&gt;<i> towns of about a population of 500. Succed at that level and you can level
</I>&gt;<i> up from there.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the thoughtful post, Scott.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Many of your criticisms go to me (I'm not complaining), so I'll reply to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that sort in this thread. I have been doing a horrible job of being a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought-leader, cheer-leader, etc. to keep this group going. I have plenty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of great personal reasons for that, but in the ned it's still a failure of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leadership which I'm not proud of. I am always more than happy to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others step in as much as they are willing. And I also continue to try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reorganize my life such that I would have more time to contribute
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (preferably full time).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, this list isn't hibernating as much as it appears to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cyclical. We have times of great participation and times of none. I have no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea why that is, but again it's something I could work through if I were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pouring more in. As could others, hint, hint.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not a developer, so I won't speak to the development of software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects, but I'll reply to one or two points separately and a couple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> briefly right here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metagov does now have an elevator pitch:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been planning on proposing making that (or something very similar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to it) our home page and/or making a 30-second video containing that text
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and putting that on the home page. Again, it's been a matter of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time-constraints for me, though others are welcome to step in. (Regarding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> videos, I was also going to propose that everyone/anyone make videos about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project... it's not like we need to have only one.) Also, at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> blinap appears to have a nicely-done elevator-video.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think most of us here are onboard with that. Reference:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess you can put it that way, but I sure don't like to. If we do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manage to break into the mainstream, we're going to have enemies (read:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarians) characterizing us as all kinds of negative things. We don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need to give them fuel in advance. I don't see us as revolutionaries simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because I don't see any overthrow of the current system. Instead, I'd like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to see the current systems simply wither and die as people eventually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignore them in favor of the much better, stronger solutions that have grown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around them. There is no treason in dispensing with a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative-democracy government if everyone is onboard with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing on Loomio?  Really?  Seems like this group is hibernating which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means it's obviously time to shake things up a little.  Rather than put my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bio here as promised, I'll instead refer you to my book (working title &quot;The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plan: A Design for an Engineered Civilization&quot;) which has that info (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much more) in it.  Get the current draft from my web site (and please mind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the copyright notice: Until I get to beta-test please direct any comments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to me rather this or any other forum.  I'll provide a summary to this list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once input trails off):

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Tomorrow I'll also post the guts of the section on the voting and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> budgeting system to this list so that you all can review that without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having to read the rest of the book.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I've read the archives (every post for the first year, sampled every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread since then and read every post in any thread related to my project)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and believe I have some useful insights to share. Although this post is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going to strike some of you as that of a troll, it's probably more useful
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to think of it as that of a zealot: &quot;I Have Seen the Light And Am Here To
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Share The Good News&quot; (and if you read the book you'll maybe come to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appreciate my obsession with irony and how this is just one more example of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My goal here is not to drive people from this forum or the concept of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> e-democracy, but, to be blunt, you've had 6 years now without much to show
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for it and so it's time to &quot;defecate or abdicate&quot; (i.e., if even having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this debate makes you uncomfortable maybe you're part of the problem rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than part of the solution).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So here are the problems I see.  If you're inspired to respond to any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of these items, please put it in a message by itself and change the subject
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> line.  Please nobody take this any of this as personal criticism or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criticism of Ed as Fearless Leader: I believe all of your hearts are in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right place, now we just need to get your heads over there as well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; If you can't explain your idea in 30 seconds (the elevator speech),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nobody's going to trust (or use) your system.  Reviewing all the projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've seen lots of exquisitely baroque architectures that are simply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nonviable because it takes too long to understand how they work.  This also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means that in general they'll also take far to much time and effort (i.e.,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transactional costs) during operation.  So even if one of them somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> miraculously got fully implemented and then adopted by some organization,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the participation rates would be so low as guarantee failure and possibly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set back e-democracy projects by years or decades.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2) DSTSS: Authentication isn't an issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; People move billions of dollars around every day with a simple login
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and password, and are perfectly comfortable with systems that you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even have to log into but once.  By the time one of these e-democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems is ready to actually take over operation of a government, people's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attitudes will be even more relaxed and the technology for authentication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even better. The ho-hum reaction to the recent Bleeding Heart exploit means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it's probably not even worth obsessively worrying about back-end hacks
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as long as data integrity can be maintained (or even reconstructed).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Compared with the risks we all face due to the delays this question is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> causing in implementing a system, authentication is so small an issue that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even bringing it up almost looks to me like a ploy by people working to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent e-democracy (blasphemers!)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3) Openness is a sufficient solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The verdict is already in: Given the choice between freedom and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privacy/anonymity, freedom wins every time.  Full access to the raw data
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solves not only the security issues but is a useful social engineering tool
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to boot: If people are reluctant to use The System to *publicly* express
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their opinions, and/or are overly concerned with the security issues, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't want them participating anyway (again, see my book for more on this).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4) You're working on the wrong problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to serve in representative governments.  And those exact sa
