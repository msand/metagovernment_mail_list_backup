<PRE>Ciao Anthony B
At Airesis we are interested to see any new system that can improve the one
that we have already develop and that we are offering to the world. Please
have your peer try it and if you see that the one you have envisioned is
better you may become member of the development group and propose with
sound analysis yours to the group for evaluation. The process may be seem
slow but definitely is democratic! and the development is open and the
licence is the AGPL3. Copyright? is hard to make money with democracy!, The
only way I see is to become a politician!
@max your suggestion are always very interesting, I follow the links you
are suggesting and are really good.
Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> Hello!
</I>&gt;<i>      So I'm working with a number of my peers here at Evergreen College to
</I>&gt;<i> develop a web-resource that will enable anyone anywhere to begin
</I>&gt;<i> democratizing any space in physical or conceptual human reality. It's
</I>&gt;<i> actually a lot easier to show than it is to describe so we have a mock up
</I>&gt;<i> version of the site to make a lot of the details easier to see and
</I>&gt;<i> understand. We would love to show this to more people because any number of
</I>&gt;<i> these designs could help another really cool project succeed and we want to
</I>&gt;<i> gather more input from people in all kinds of positions, our only fear is
</I>&gt;<i> that someone might try copyrighting some of the content to eventually
</I>&gt;<i> prevent us from being able to use it.We would really like to know if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> can tell us if there's a safe way to share design concepts without them
</I>&gt;<i> being potentially legally usurped? None of us can tell if they're too
</I>&gt;<i> simple to officially patent, making the concern nul, or if we need to be
</I>&gt;<i> doing something to protect the communities right to use these designs. We
</I>&gt;<i> just want them to stay free to use for everyone you know?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anywhoo, this project has a layout that's very reminiscent of how Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> laid out problems and solutions, but we've done some really nifty stuff in
</I>&gt;<i> terms of enabling users, and organizers, so we want to build this up and
</I>&gt;<i> move forward with getting it crowdfunded, programmed, and operational
</I>&gt;<i> online.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone want to see the walk through file? or have advice on sharing
</I>&gt;<i> content like this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much,
