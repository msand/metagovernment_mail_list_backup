<PRE>On Sun, Apr 20, 2014 at 2:34 PM, Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> Thanks again for the spirited debate, Scott. I disagree with you a lot. :)
</I>
I hope you don't mind, I believe it helps us all find the weak points
in our positions.

&gt;<i> Your first criticism of this group was that we need to KISS: that things should be able to be presented in 30 seconds. Now you're saying I need to read a book to be able to refute you?
</I>
Umm, different rules for different audiences.  You need to follow the
KISS rule when explaining a system to somebody unfamiliar with this
domain, but you'd better come fully armed if you're going to try to
change the opinion of any of us who happen to know a little about
it...

&gt;<i> Further, the conclusion is specious. How does my sentence support majority rule? Are you claiming that the majority in fact do read volumes before voting? I propose the opposite conclusion: a well-crafted consensus system corrects for the ignorance of the majority by empowering the minority to provide sane input into decisions that could otherwise be overwhelmed by the ignorance of &quot;the masses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Nope, the way to do that is to prevent the &quot;ignorant masses&quot; from
disrupting the crafting of the proposal that will be voted on.  This
is a different process from the one where they get to vote on it, and
as described in my book the actual voting process should include the
text of the proposal as well as the best crafted pro and con arguments
(just like the most helpful positive and negative reviews as shown on
Amazon, and what comes in the Blue Book (voter's guide) in many
counties (and that few people read because it's not nearly as
convenient as it will be in an e-democracy system)).

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And in the mean time?  No government at all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No hasty decisions, yes! What good is a decision that sucks for half the people? Why should we rush to the wrong decision? Unless there is an army about to invade or a giant meteor about to strike, do we really need to rush governance? We are no where near the level of invading armies or world-saving governance, so I don't see any need for hasty decision-making here. Especially if it leads to awful results.
</I>
Again, you're confounding the proposal generation/tuning phase with
the actual vote.  They must be two separate steps in the process.

&gt;&gt;<i>  Your argument, and this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group's failure to produce a &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule (let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alone even a usable prototype) in 6 years is the proof we've been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> looking for *in itself* that a consensus-based decision rule is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-viable.  Don't you just love the irony of it all?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do have a decision rule, which was developed quickly using Votorola as the mechanism to reach consensus on it. It is at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recently, I got into a debate with one other person who disputed that decision rule. He hasn't defended his position recently, so it looks like the above stands for now. That decision rule was made about two years ago. See
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> for part of the development.
</I>
Ah, I hadn't seen those, and thanks for pointing it out. Seems the
problem here is that we disagree about the definition of the word
&quot;consensus&quot;.  Webster.com says: &quot;general agreement :  unanimity&quot;,
which is what I take it to mean.  My dad (a social psychologist) had
the same reaction after he asked me last week what I was working on
and I sent him a link to the metagovernment site.  He asked me if you
were serious about &quot;consensus&quot; as he considered that an impossible
goal. To be blunt, I thought sounded kind of flaky the first time I
saw it too.  And it's clearly not even what you mean: In your example
above the &quot;consensus&quot; of 6 people (out of 150 or so on this list)
defined &quot;consensus&quot; to mean a two-thirds majority.  Which is actually
a pretty low standard for a small and relatively homogeneous group
like this one.  It might even work for the general population,
although I consider this to be an empirical question that we won't be
able to answer until we get a good proposal-generation system working
and see how much that increases supermajorities (I'm predicting it
will have quite a large effect because in my experience referendums
are pretty poorly written and many of them pass by supermajorities
anyway).

&gt;<i> So where are we disagreeing? I already said I'm defining consensus not as unanimity, but rather large supermajority. Again, refer to the decision rule page above.
</I>
As above, we're disagreeing on the definition of &quot;consensus&quot; and I'd
propose that we remove that term from the metagovernment site and
replace it with &quot;supermajority&quot; or something that doesn't set off
people's BS detectors.

&gt;&gt;<i>  But again *requiring* this is an argument for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the status quo which I'm sure we all agree is not acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand this statement.
</I>
Requiring &quot;consensus&quot; (at least the common usage of the term) is a way
to ensure the status quo will never be overturned.

(snip)

&gt;<i> Early in the development of this group, it was the consensus (in this case unanimous) that we not have formal governance and rather work as adhocracy. Later on, through consensus (again unanimous), we adopted the decision rule above. How does consensus not work, and how is it not working here?
</I>
Mostly I'd say it's not working because you've got 150 people on this
list, only a handful of whom have expressed an opinion.   Now if you
had a voting system that people could just pop into, make a vote, and
then go back to lurking I think you'd see much higher levels of
participation.  Even better, getting their hands dirty with an actual
working system would help the lurkers get a handle on what it is
they'd like and not like to see in a functioning e-democracy as it's
probably all just a bunch of handwaving to most of them at this point.
 They want to understand and many of them probably want to help, but
there's just not enough infrastructure in their minds at this point to
be able to do so.

&gt;<i> When I look up consensus decision-making on Wikipedia, I see a lot of description of different models, how they operate, and how they have been used through history.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see much about how it is provably unworkable. I think the Quakers would disagree.
</I>
The Quakers aren't a good example, both because it is a much more
homogeneous group than the general population and because of the huge
amount of effort they are willing to expend to achieve their goals.
And that wikipedia page includes simple majority as one of the
decision rules, in which case the US is a consensus-based government
(ha!)

As I said, pending some experimentation, I'm probably fine with a
two-thirds decision rule, and although he doesn't come out and say it
anywhere that I recall, Mueller and the other public choice
researchers I think would also be on board with it as well because
it's a high enough standard that it dampens out almost all cyclic
behavior (which is his big concern with the simple majority rule).

&gt;<i> What is your elevator pitch, Scott?
</I>
Yeah, I'm going to need several of those since the book (and The Plan)
isn't just about one or two things.  But I'm actually more a &quot;working
prototype&quot; kind of guy anyway: I'd rather show somebody how something
works than tell them because I find that to be a much more effective
educational tool.  I've started looking around at development
environments and am not really liking anything I've seen so far: I
burned out and retired about 10 years ago and haven't written a line
of code since then, but I'm finding my mojo has recovered a bit and
think I'm probably up for another project if I can find (or make) a
development environment that won't frustrate me...
  Regards,
    Scott
