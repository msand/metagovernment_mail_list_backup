I highly recommend the video!  Unfortunately the github site doesn't
have much info, and both the bettermeans sites are broken.  I note
that the project is written in Rails (coincidence? I think not ;-)

As for the system, it seems to resemble the Valve organizational
structure which works for them but I'm pretty sure is not generally
applicable.  There are also serious problems with the bettermeans
voting system: Stuff passes without even the majority of people
voting, which again leads us right into that SDA problem again.  Not
to be a broken record, but the problem isn't with hierarchical
organizations themselves, the problem is that SDAs are highly
overrepresented in them and that SDAs are more prone to corruption,
prejudice, and other problems than Neurotypicals.

But there are some good ideas in there and I'll be studying this one some more.
  Regards,
    Scott
