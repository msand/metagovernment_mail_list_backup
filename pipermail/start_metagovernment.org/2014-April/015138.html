<PRE>Thank you Scott.  I sort of suspected this might be the case.  Did you try
out Aero?  It seems they have had an interest in scalability but maybe they
forked Rails.  If they did not fork Rails it might be interesting.  There
are multiple jurisdictions near me that like vote by cellphone bluesky.
Money to be had. Not very ethical on my part but I can rationalize in
twisty ways.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you James.  Bentley had made a reasonable proposal and he has what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looks like an improved spreadsheet.  I had made noise about Paas.  I know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone who is smart but not broadly experienced.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The question i want to answer is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Can i pick randomly a package from the spreadsheet and get a successful

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't answer that question definitively, but my hunch is that you'd
</I>&gt;<i> be lucky to get *any* of them to install that way.  I've been doing
</I>&gt;<i> tutorials and demos of various tools and applications every day for
</I>&gt;<i> the past few weeks and I have yet to get a single one of the packages
</I>&gt;<i> to install and run on the first try.  It's pretty surprising and
</I>&gt;<i> disappointing, actually.  I remember always having these problems with
</I>&gt;<i> Linux and GNU software 10 to 20 years ago but had hoped that things
</I>&gt;<i> would have improved by now.  Unfortunately it seems they're even worse
</I>&gt;<i> now because most of the packages themselves are no longer
</I>&gt;<i> self-contained and rely on the user installing bits and pieces from a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of places, some of which have been &quot;upgraded&quot; and so introduce
</I>&gt;<i> incompatibilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, my best recommendation is to see if any of those packages have a
</I>&gt;<i> demo site up and use that instead of trying to do your own install.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
