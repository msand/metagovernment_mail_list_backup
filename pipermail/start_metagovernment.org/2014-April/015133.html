Note that my system does not require or make any assessment of
personality characteristics or ability.  It is designed to accommodate
everyone and provides the same features and constraints to each
individual.  But the *design* of those features and constraints takes
into account individual differences such that Authoritarians and
individuals with other problematic characteristics will find their
behavior shaped to a greater degree than the Neurotypicals, who may
not even notice these constraints.

An analogy might be crowd control stanchions, like you see at the
airport.  For the majority of people they are not even required
because people know how to queue and can maintain queues miles long if
they are motivated to, as when wating to get into a concert.  But
there are those people who, if they don't have the stanchions guiding
them, will break the system by cutting in line or leaving gaps that
others will cut into or leave their stuff scattered about blocking
traffic in throughways.  Even though having those ropes and stanchions
guiding the line doesn't usually actually affect *my* behavior at all,
I'm glad they are there to help constrain those who are not so
conscientious.  And the same will be true of the analogous features in
my system.

&gt;<i>  If no, then you should use a
</I>&gt;<i> different word that more accurately describes what you mean. If yes, then by
</I>&gt;<i> all means use that word. When you said, &quot;&quot;Neurotypical&quot; (vs the more common
</I>&gt;<i> term &quot;normal&quot;)&quot;.  It sounds like you are saying Neurotypical = normal. When in
</I>&gt;<i> fact that is not the definition of the word. Unless you want to confuse
</I>&gt;<i> people?
</I>
&gt;<i>From a PC perspective, &quot;normal&quot; is a highly loaded term because it
</I>implies that everyone who does fit in that category is &quot;abnormal&quot;.
&gt;<i>From a scientific perspective, &quot;neurotypical&quot; *is* synonymous with
</I>&quot;normal&quot; however.  What I'm really trying to describe is the
statistical concept of &quot;mode&quot;, the most common value in a distribution
and my impression is what the autistic community is also intending to
convey when they use the term &quot;Neurotypical&quot;.  I'm not overly attached
to that term, but it is by far the most descriptive one I've found and
it comes with the bonus of some currency which any new term I coin
would lack.

But again note that this terminology is only necessary to design and
*understand* my system, and is not a necessary determination to make
at any point in its actual operation.
  Regards,
    Scott
