The first part is guaranteed, at least for a significant portion of
the proposals.  But the second part is our one great hope: Given
access to the appropriate information the Neurotypicals will make the
best decisions for themselves and everyone else.  Research on LPA
bands (Late Pleistocene Appropriate, aboriginal peoples (now almost
gone) living in the kind of social organization we had a for a couple
of million years and consequently evolved to function best in) shows
that that system *does* work, we just need to recreate it using
technology since there are there are just too many of us now (and we
don't have the option to do what the LPAs do when they run into
incorrigibly problematic individuals who don't respond to social
controls: banish them or sometimes just kill them ;-)

One thing you didn't bring up that is potentially a bigger problem
than direct corruption is advertising of the kind we are seeing with
the Koch brothers vs. solar energy.  I don't see any way to prevent
that without unacceptable limitations on *all* speech.  But if we
Neurotypicals do a good enough job preparing the &quot;con&quot; argument that
every individual should read prior to casting their vote, I believe we
can rely on the rationality of the rest of the Nuerotypicals to screen
out biased advertising and use only those pro/con statements when
making their decision.

Of course The Plan also includes a more effective way to prevent
problems like the Koch brothers: They inherited that money and I think
I make a pretty convincing case in the book that not only is that
inherently immoral, but it is simply not in the interest of the
majority of the population to continue to allow that archaic custom to
continue.  That address again is:

I don't even think we disagree so much as differ in outlook: I'm
optimistic that with the right *system* we can workaround these human
maladaptations.  You seem a bit more pessimistic...

    Scott
