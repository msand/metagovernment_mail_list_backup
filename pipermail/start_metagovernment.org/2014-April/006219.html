<PRE>Scott,

Kids these days.  When you touch a honeypot you do not want to autheticate.
Take that to heart.

</I>&gt;<i> the copyright notice: Until I get to beta-test please direct any comments

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tomorrow I'll also post the guts of the section on the voting and
</I>&gt;<i> budgeting system to this list so that you all can review that without
</I>&gt;<i> having to read the rest of the book.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've read the archives (every post for the first year, sampled every
</I>&gt;<i> thread since then and read every post in any thread related to my project)
</I>&gt;<i> and believe I have some useful insights to share. Although this post is
</I>&gt;<i> going to strike some of you as that of a troll, it's probably more useful
</I>&gt;<i> to think of it as that of a zealot: &quot;I Have Seen the Light And Am Here To
</I>&gt;<i> Share The Good News&quot; (and if you read the book you'll maybe come to
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate my obsession with irony and how this is just one more example of
</I>&gt;<i> it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My goal here is not to drive people from this forum or the concept of
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy, but, to be blunt, you've had 6 years now without much to show
</I>&gt;<i> for it and so it's time to &quot;defecate or abdicate&quot; (i.e., if even having
</I>&gt;<i> this debate makes you uncomfortable maybe you're part of the problem rather
</I>&gt;<i> than part of the solution).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here are the problems I see.  If you're inspired to respond to any of
</I>&gt;<i> these items, please put it in a message by itself and change the subject
</I>&gt;<i> line.  Please nobody take this any of this as personal criticism or
</I>&gt;<i> criticism of Ed as Fearless Leader: I believe all of your hearts are in the
</I>&gt;<i> right place, now we just need to get your heads over there as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't explain your idea in 30 seconds (the elevator speech),
</I>&gt;<i> nobody's going to trust (or use) your system.  Reviewing all the projects
</I>&gt;<i> I've seen lots of exquisitely baroque architectures that are simply
</I>&gt;<i> nonviable because it takes too long to understand how they work.  This also
</I>&gt;<i> means that in general they'll also take far to much time and effort (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> transactional costs) during operation.  So even if one of them somehow
</I>&gt;<i> miraculously got fully implemented and then adopted by some organization,
</I>&gt;<i> the participation rates would be so low as guarantee failure and possibly
</I>&gt;<i> set back e-democracy projects by years or decades.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) DSTSS: Authentication isn't an issue
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People move billions of dollars around every day with a simple login and
</I>&gt;<i> password, and are perfectly comfortable with systems that you don't even
</I>&gt;<i> have to log into but once.  By the time one of these e-democracy systems is
</I>&gt;<i> ready to actually take over operation of a government, people's attitudes
</I>&gt;<i> will be even more relaxed and the technology for authentication even
</I>&gt;<i> better. The ho-hum reaction to the recent Bleeding Heart exploit means that
</I>&gt;<i> it's probably not even worth obsessively worrying about back-end hacks as
</I>&gt;<i> long as data integrity can be maintained (or even reconstructed).  Compared
</I>&gt;<i> with the risks we all face due to the delays this question is causing in
</I>&gt;<i> implementing a system, authentication is so small an issue that even
</I>&gt;<i> bringing it up almost looks to me like a ploy by people working to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy (blasphemers!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Openness is a sufficient solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The verdict is already in: Given the choice between freedom and
</I>&gt;<i> privacy/anonymity, freedom wins every time.  Full access to the raw data
</I>&gt;<i> solves not only the security issues but is a useful social engineering tool
</I>&gt;<i> to boot: If people are reluctant to use The System to *publicly* express
</I>&gt;<i> their opinions, and/or are overly concerned with the security issues, we
</I>&gt;<i> don't want them participating anyway (again, see my book for more on this).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) You're working on the wrong problem
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob
</I>&gt;<i> Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly
</I>&gt;<i> zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems
</I>&gt;<i> with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of
</I>&gt;<i> representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer
</I>&gt;<i> to serve in representative governments.  And those exact same people will
</I>&gt;<i> screw up the operation of any e-democracy or &quot;collaborative government&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> system too unless we design in ways to systematically constrain their
</I>&gt;<i> ability to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) You're trying to solve it using inappropriate methods
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, everybody likes consensus.  It has that warm fuzzy feeling like
</I>&gt;<i> clothes just out of the dryer!  But let's not kid ourselves: This issue has
</I>&gt;<i> been researched to death and it simply is a non-starter for a functional
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy system.  I.e., if you haven't read &quot;Public Choice III&quot;, it is
</I>&gt;<i> the 800 page &quot;bible&quot; of this field and while it is dryer than that laundry
</I>&gt;<i> it leaves no room for doubt that simple majority rule is both necessary and
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient as a general purpose decision-making system[*].  And that
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't even account for the Social Dominator/Authoritarian/sociopath
</I>&gt;<i> issues in my #4 (and which are the main theme of my book).  Our best hope
</I>&gt;<i> here is to use social engineering techniques during the proposal-shaping
</I>&gt;<i> phase to ensure that as many objections are addressed as possible because
</I>&gt;<i> it is simply not practical to even *try* to eliminate all of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) You've thwarted competition, our most powerful tool
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Partly because of the consensus-based philosophy (see #5) there is a lot
</I>&gt;<i> of time and mindshare being wasted on things like building connections to
</I>&gt;<i> vaporware from other sources into your own vaporware.  Although I enjoy the
</I>&gt;<i> irony of this being reminiscent of the design of &quot;soviets&quot; by the
</I>&gt;<i> Bolsheviks, we out here in the real world are starving because of your lack
</I>&gt;<i> of production!  Although a few testy words have been shared on the list
</I>&gt;<i> from time to time, it seems to me almost pathological in its rejection of
</I>&gt;<i> competition as a means of selecting the best solution to any given problem.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not how good software is made and is not how good government will
</I>&gt;<i> be made.  The best ideas need to be allowed to rise to the top (i.e., it's
</I>&gt;<i> time for this collectivist approach, which didn't work for the communists
</I>&gt;<i> either, to be replaced by a competitive environment where a single project
</I>&gt;<i> will integrate the best ideas from all the others).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) You're taking up mindshare and resources
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't be doing this if e-democracy projects had plenty of resources
</I>&gt;<i> and mind-share.  But they don't, which means any of those things
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org is not using efficiently are being withheld from
</I>&gt;<i> projects that would make better use of them (i.e., lead, follow, or get out
</I>&gt;<i> of the way!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you read my book you'll come to see that I'm a zealot about capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> too, but I am extremely disturbed by any of these projects that have even a
</I>&gt;<i> *hint* that there is any goal of commercial exploitation of the technology
</I>&gt;<i> being developed.  I nearly became apoplectic as I traced the
</I>&gt;<i> whitehouse2/NationBuilder development.  Heresy!  We must cast out the False
</I>&gt;<i> Prophet! (or is that False Profit?!?) NationBuilder is now not only not an
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy platform, it is actually designed to work *against* the whole
</I>&gt;<i> concept by shoring up leadership-based government!  While it may be
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to form a non-profit to enable crowdfunding to secure the
</I>&gt;<i> resources we need to complete a functional tool, NationBuilder (and indeed
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio) is a clear example of why any sort of commercial side-bet like this
</I>&gt;<i> is a Really Bad Idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're really serious about this, we are all plotting to overthrow not
</I>&gt;<i> only our own governments, but that of every other nation as well.  The more
</I>&gt;<i> successful any of these projects are, the more clear this distinction is
</I>&gt;<i> going to be.  If this isn't what you signed up for, maybe being a
</I>&gt;<i> revolutionary is just not in your blood and you should instead cheer from
</I>&gt;<i> the sidelines rather than mucking about out on the field of battle.  None
</I>&gt;<i> of the people running our current representative government are even
</I>&gt;<i> legally (constitutionally) *allowed* to support our efforts, and a
</I>&gt;<i> significant percentage of them are genetically programmed to actively and
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps even violently resist any type of government that does fit with
</I>&gt;<i> their authoritarian world view.  This means that our best short-term *and*
</I>&gt;<i> long-term strategy is to provide a competitive alternative to the
</I>&gt;<i> traditional governments that people can turn to when their current
</I>&gt;<i> governments aren't working.  Rather than whining to get people to support
</I>&gt;<i> your petition drive or standing around in a park somewhere, we can provide
</I>&gt;<i> a way for people to propose and refine budgets and new laws that they will
</I>&gt;<i> install (perhaps via referendum at first, but by revolution eventually) to
</I>&gt;<i> *override* their unresponsive representative government or replace it
</I>&gt;<i> entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You must believe religiously that e-democracy is inevitable and decide
</I>&gt;<i> that you'd rather have it in 10 years than in 50 or you are simply denying
</I>&gt;<i> yourself and everyone else the benefits that will accrue from getting it
</I>&gt;<i> implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can start right now: Prove me wrong on any of the above (or indeed, in
</I>&gt;<i> any of the points in my book) and you will actually be helping to clarify
</I>&gt;<i> our goals and move the process along.  Oh, and another irony for you to
</I>&gt;<i> contemplate: Six years later, and we still don't even have a prototype of a
</I>&gt;<i> system where each of my points could be loaded into it and each of you
</I>&gt;<i> given a chance to express your opinion, refine the position, or vote on
</I>&gt;<i> them! Although that Loomio demo is extremely limited in functionality, it
</I>&gt;<i> might be up to this task if anyone wants to get their hands dirty.
