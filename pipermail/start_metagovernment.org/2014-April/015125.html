<PRE>To get back to the filtering issue, I'd appreciate some clarity on the
issue Scott

Do you intend to have filters on particular language like any post that
included the word &quot;homosexual&quot; an individual could omit those results from
their feed? I think you can see that this would both confuse the
conversations to have randomly missing posts as well as deprive the
individual of a different opinion and a chance to expand their mind. This
way they could just vote against any gay rights without even hearing what
the other side had to hear. This is problematic would you not agree?


The other option which you seem to be hinting at is that users would be
able to flag other users into categories like, flammer, troll etc. and then
set filters to hide those individuals. My concern with this is people being
flagged as a troll will be stuck in that. What happens if someone comes to
their senses and decides to try and change, their already stuck as a troll
and mostly everyone has filtered them out already, they'll be invisible for
life. Seems like it would be very hard to correct their state once their
put in a box.


My recommendation is to instead have guidelines established, rules of what
kind of behavior is acceptable on the system. Break a rule and enough
people report/flag you, your post is locked and you are served a time
penalty where you are not allowed to post. Once the time period is up
you're free to post again but the next time you're caught breaking a rule
the time penalty increases. This enables and encourages individuals to
clean up their act but punishes continual offenders and rids the site of
problem people without having to sensor or omit any information, we should
all be on the same page and see what the community is talking about.


I do think we should allow filtering but they should be inclusive instead.
Keywords - so you can search &quot;homosexual&quot; if that's your area of expertise
and have a list populated with all topics including that word.


I agree with a lot of what you're saying but this area is still unclear to
me.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> @max platform as a service is awesome which is why I mentioned GAE, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are many others, like heroku. But, you have to build something to go

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yeah, those little buttons are a pain ;-)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Your technological ignorance is showing a little in your last post. Is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I ment to say.  You really wish we would have stayed with software
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; applications instead of moving to the serverside applications?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Definitely.  Going a little off topic here, but the browser-based
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> architecture is incredibly limited, complicated, and brittle (meaning
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it breaks with every little change, like version upgrades).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> iPhone/Android is a little better because most things are apps and so
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the developer has more control, but *ideally* versioning and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> extensions would have been built into the OSs a long time ago so, for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> example, instead of JavaScript which is a complete POS (and everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> knows it which is why there are so many extensions and workarounds for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it), apps could have been built in any scripting language and the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> necessary engines and libraries downloaded on the fly.  This problem
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could have been solved at several different junctures (e.g., when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Microsoft added automatically downloaded OS updates for Windows 95,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when HTML was originally defined to purposely exclude interactive
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elements, or when Netscape chose to build in a weekend-hack scripting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> language instead of defining an open architecture, etc.) but due to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shortsightedness and proprietary-think never has been.  Like I said,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if it the web had been *designed* instead of evolving with the bizarre
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> set of constraints it has, I'd have a working voting system up and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> running in days or weeks whereas now it's going to take me months.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As for &quot;ignorance&quot;, I'll cop to that as, like I think I said, I burned
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> out and retired from software development about 10 years ago and so am
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having to learn a lot about the current environment (and not liking it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> much at all).  But I've been developing software from microcode and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> assembly languages through 3GLs and 4GLs up to AI languages since I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> was a kid (40 years ago) so I think I have a pretty good awareness of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what works and what doesn't.  And as for django/pyramid/flask or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anything based on Tcl or Python, talk about &quot;old school&quot;!  I wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> touch either of those languages with a 10 foot pole.  Of course, it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> doesn't help that the product I burned out developing was a major
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> competitor of those languages and yet still exists as a commercial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> product (after enabling me to retire, unlike the the developers of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those other languages, who got the fame instead ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now that I've finished the main Rails tutorial I'm considerably less
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enamored of it.  The main concept that comes to my mind is &quot;bag on the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> side&quot;.  The whole development environment is really just a collection
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of hacks, kluges, preprocessors, and workarounds instead of a unified
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> architecture (which is why I had to spend the first few hours in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tutorial *fixing* version incompatibilities in it!).  It's really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> designed for professional full-time developers who must deal with a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lot of different projects for different clients and where a project
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> may get passed around among several developers not all of whom will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> familiar with the overall design.  Which unfortunately doesn't really
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> describe this project.   I've written to my old crew to see if maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it might be faster and easier to customize the old product (which is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now open source) than punish myself by doing it the Rails way, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> using Rails is still the backup plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I have a hard time believing this would eclipse Facebook
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> someday. In
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the US you vote 1 time ever 4 years and how much time do they actually
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; research and post opinions about it? Not very much.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe my FB &quot;friends&quot; are different, but although I'd agree that stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> like cat videos and pictures of food are still the main fare, bitching
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about governments, corporations, etc. make up a significant percentage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of the posts.  Imagine what it would be like if they actually believed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that posting would *change* things...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  How much do they hang
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; out and talk with their friends? A lot lot more. They even watch cat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> videos
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; more. I think a good measure of this is day to day how much does the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> average
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; person talk politics? If you can answer that, I think you would get a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
