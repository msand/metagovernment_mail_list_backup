</I>&gt;<i> Do you intend to have filters on particular language like any post that
</I>&gt;<i> included the word &quot;homosexual&quot; an individual could omit those results from
</I>&gt;<i> their feed? I think you can see that this would both confuse the
</I>&gt;<i> conversations to have randomly missing posts as well as deprive the
</I>&gt;<i> individual of a different opinion and a chance to expand their mind. This
</I>&gt;<i> way they could just vote against any gay rights without even hearing what
</I>&gt;<i> the other side had to hear. This is problematic would you not agree?
</I>
I wasn't proposing filtering on words, but instead on flags.  There
would be obviously be some interaction between the two, so for example
if some individual repeatedly use racial or sexual orientation *slurs*
instead of whatever the PC term-du-jour is that their posts would
likely get flagged and as a result filtered by some/many people.

Missing posts in a feed are not that big of a deal and you see this
all the time on newspaper sites (someone will respond to a post prior
to a moderator getting around to deleting it).  Whether or not some
clue that there was a filtered post is shown in the feed I think is a
UI issue we'll have to decide once we see how it works.

&gt;<i> The other option which you seem to be hinting at is that users would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to flag other users into categories like, flammer, troll etc. and then set
</I>&gt;<i> filters to hide those individuals. My concern with this is people being
</I>&gt;<i> flagged as a troll will be stuck in that. What happens if someone comes to
</I>&gt;<i> their senses and decides to try and change, their already stuck as a troll
</I>&gt;<i> and mostly everyone has filtered them out already, they'll be invisible for
</I>&gt;<i> life. Seems like it would be very hard to correct their state once their put
</I>&gt;<i> in a box.
</I>
Good point, and one I've been struggling with myself.  I've come up
with three solutions to this problem:
1) Flag expiration.  Maybe they only stick around for a month or two,
so the affected user's posts will gradually start appearing in
people's feeds again, in proportion to how tight that individual's
filters are set.

2) On-line training: An individual could take a course on on-line
forum etiquette and have their flags cleared.  Kind of like traffic
court, where taking a class reduces the points on against your
license.

3) &quot;Forum Court&quot;, where an individual could appeal the flags to a jury
of their peers (self selected, or maybe chosen at random like regular
juries are) where the offending posts would be discussed and a vote
taken to reverse the user flags if warranted.  I think we need this
option anyway because it would also be used to appeal moderator
decisions: Although user flagging should make up the bulk of the
moderation process (specifically there must not be any post removal by
moderators based on profanity or personal attacks) we're still going
to need moderators and we need a way for The People to review and
override those moderators both to help weed out the bad ones and to
prevent the moderators themselves from becoming a too-powerful
influence in the process.

&gt;<i> My recommendation is to instead have guidelines established, rules of what
</I>&gt;<i> kind of behavior is acceptable on the system. Break a rule and enough people
</I>&gt;<i> report/flag you, your post is locked and you are served a time penalty where
</I>&gt;<i> you are not allowed to post. Once the time period is up you're free to post
</I>&gt;<i> again but the next time you're caught breaking a rule the time penalty
</I>&gt;<i> increases. This enables and encourages individuals to clean up their act but
</I>&gt;<i> punishes continual offenders and rids the site of problem people without
</I>&gt;<i> having to sensor or omit any information, we should all be on the same page
</I>&gt;<i> and see what the community is talking about.
</I>
As I expressed in my other posts I'm opposed to these types of
&quot;punishments&quot; because they're a relatively poor way to achieve the
desired outcome (as punishment for antisocial behavior is in general
according to just about all the psychological research (e.g., see the
section in the book on crime and punishment)).  It *is* censorship and
also turns the whole process upside down: It should never be perceived
that The System that is punishing a user, it should always be known
that it is only the other users who are individually making the
decision to banish or ostracize a problem individual.  This is the
technique that we *evolved* to use and be responsive to, and resorting
to authoritarian techniques is not only less effective, but has a
bunch of negative side effects that come along with it (i.e., this
huge problem we have of people hating on the government when in fact
*we are* the government).

&gt;<i> I do think we should allow filtering but they should be inclusive instead.
</I>&gt;<i> Keywords - so you can search &quot;homosexual&quot; if that's your area of expertise
</I>&gt;<i> and have a list populated with all topics including that word.
</I>
We definitely need global search features and saved searches to
facilitate this.  In the book I also propose ways to specify these
kinds of things in an individual's &quot;Goals&quot; settings area such that
like-minded individuals could find each other to work on a proposal if
no one of them has the time or skill to take on creating a proposal by
themselves.

&gt;<i> I agree with a lot of what you're saying but this area is still unclear to
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
As it is to me.  This back-and-forth is how this thing *should* be
designed and I appreciate all the questions/comments as it really
helps me clarify my own understanding of the issues.
  Regards,
    Scott
