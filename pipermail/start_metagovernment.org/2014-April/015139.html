Agreed.  *But* in my proposal the person getting *filtered* would be
notified about it (though of course not told specifically who was
filtering them, just the raw numbers).  This is part of the required
social engineering to keep the authoritarians, trolls, and other
problematic participants in line.

Argh!  Looks to me like they've got *everything* wrong!

1) Authentication isn't the issue (unless maybe you're an authoritarian!)

2) Secret voting isn't the issue (again, unless you're an
authoritarian: Humans didn't have secret voting for millions of years
and yet they did a far better job of governing themselves than we
&quot;modern&quot; people do).

3) 6000 votes times 35 million people?  Are they nuts?  Unless they
can reduce the number of votes required by at least two orders of
magnitude they'll end up with few dozen Social Dominators and
Authoritarians running their country because no one else will want to.

4) A party who promises to just be proxies for internet?  Treason!
This has already been tried and in most cases is a direct violation of
their oaths of office.  If it isn't already it certainly will be made
to be as soon as the movement gains any traction.

Again, Argh!
  Regards,
    Scott
