Looks good to me!  A few small comments:

(snip)

&gt;<i> - This creates small groups of advocates that could craft crazy proposals
</I>&gt;<i> and gain some interest for their cause. Whatever interest they generate
</I>&gt;<i> works against them though as their proposal becomes more popular, good
</I>&gt;<i> citizens of the world will begin to notice more and start to investigate
</I>&gt;<i> their potential weaknesses. This exposes any hidden agenda or truths as the
</I>&gt;<i> debate carries on.
</I>
Exactly!

 - I surmise that a proposal should only go forward to a voting stage with at
&gt;<i> least a 51% participation rate of all active members on the site. This
</I>&gt;<i> should be a difficult thing to do and will require sustained interest in the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal guaranteeing it remains near the top of the site to ensure it gets
</I>&gt;<i> seen.
</I>
This seems a bit high to me, but again this is an empirical question
and I think we'll have to wait to see how small these &quot;working groups&quot;
end up being.  I'm also inclined try to tie in some sort of rating
threshold (twice as many pros as cons, ratings on pro statements
averaging a full point higher than cons, etc.) and a greenlight from
the proposer(s) who may feel like they need time for additional tweaks
to ensure the proposal will pass the general vote rather than just
taking it out of their hands when it reaches some threshold.

&gt;<i> - Participation does not necessary include making a post, as many users can
</I>&gt;<i> not be bothered to research a strong counter argument. Participation can
</I>&gt;<i> simply be reading the proposal a bit finding an opinion that reflects their
</I>&gt;<i> view on the issue and up voting that post. This up vote increases the weight
</I>&gt;<i> of that post in the discussion and makes their opinion a larger part of the
</I>&gt;<i> decision, exposing it as well to possible weaknesses.
</I>
Exactly: Merely giving a pro or con statement a rating should be
sufficient to count toward moving the proposal to a vote.

&gt;<i> - This process creates our pros and cons list that can be drafted and
</I>&gt;<i> presented in a simplified way to then move on to the voting stage where
</I>&gt;<i> still more of the public will be involved. A majority of 2/3 of the votes
</I>&gt;<i> take it. Everything is open and transparent the entire time.
</I>
Again, the majority necessary to approve may need to be tweaked, but I
would at least *hope* that 2/3 will be achievable and so it seems
reasonable to start with that goal.  This will put the fire to the
feet of the proposers to do their best work.  One alternative we might
consider is to vary the supermajority required as a function of the
percentage of registered voters who cast a vote.  My big concern is
that if only 1/3 of the people vote even a 2/3 or 3/4 majority won't
be enough to ensure that the Neurotypicals will keep the SDAs (who
tend to vote in larger numbers, especially for those relatively few
issues they really care about) in check.  If the SDAs make up 30% of
the population (probably a high estimate, and not all of them would
vote) we'd need 2/3 of registered voters to actually vote (possibly by
proxy) with a simple majority rule for the Neurotypicals to play their
proper role in the process.  The lower the percentage of registered
voters who vote, the larger the supermajority would have to be such
that if you get down into the 30% range the vote to approve would have
to be unanimous or nearly so.

&gt;<i> - Participation is voluntary but there can be penalties for incorrectly
</I>&gt;<i> participating in the discussion. You can never be penalized for up voting or
</I>&gt;<i> voting. This limits input without limiting quality.
</I>
I'm opposed to &quot;penalties&quot; per se, but being flagged and filtered by
people (which an individual would be notified of) should be sufficient
incentive for the potentially troublesome individuals to alter their
behavior to confirm to societal norms.  Again, this is the way we
humans did it for millions of years and we ignore that fact at our
peril.

&gt;<i> Any reason why this wouldn't work?
</I>
Probably a thousand that we haven't thought of ;-)  What we need now
is a working prototype so that we can start shaping the UI and those
thresholds.  I'm working on it but am taking my time selecting a
platform (I'm doing the Django tutorial right now) to avoid having to
start over if I pick the wrong one to start out with.
  Regards,
    Scott
