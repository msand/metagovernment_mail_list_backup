<PRE>*Executive summary*

What your suggesting as impossible has already been done. I Googled
&quot;google&quot; and it gave me exactly the information I wanted out of
2,820,000,000 possible results in .44 seconds. We just need an
implementation specific to &quot;governing&quot;. I am not saying Google is perfect
at it, but I am saying your idea that it is impossible is flawed.

I don't like filtering because it segregates groups that have the same
opinion filtering the same thing. This happens on both sides of an issue
until neither side even sees each other, or one is completely muzzled. We
want understanding and some measure of consensus. Not a system that tells
you exactly what you want while allowing you to ignore what you don't
personally believe.

Also, it could be really cool what you could do already by farming public
twitter posts.

I then go on to try to preempt his next post, &quot;But Google does filter&quot; by
explaining a few cases where filtering does make sense. The filter should
strive to have no bias not represent the bias of a group of people.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What your suggesting is not possible actually already exists in a different
form.
Google seems to be able to do it. When I Googled &quot;Google&quot; it gave me.
2,820,000,000 results (0.44 seconds)
It took them a lot of time and money but they have figured out a way to
help you wade through the internet and find what you are really looking
for. We just need a &quot;search engine&quot; and UI that bring you the relevant
information.

Here are just a few ideas for what it could do.

   - Combine comments that are essentially the same and have the reader
   read it once. Instead of reading the same thing 10,000 times your can read
   it one time with the appendage that 10,000 support this.
   - Give users a variable rank like Google page rank that assigns weight
   to peoples comments based on how many people source that person.
   Essentially, the more people that back you the more weight your comments
   have.
   - I am sure there are a lot more and invite anyone else to add these are
   just two I thought up off of the top of my head.


It isn't a perfect system. You can still game Google with shady SEO but
Google is getting better at giving you relevant information and is working
on their system all the time. We would need to do the same.

I just don't like the idea of filtering because it promotes segregation
instead of consensus. Groups of people will consistently filter the same
thing and then only get information that they want to see fueling their
current opinions which then filter more things and so on. It will happen on
both sides of an argument further separating them from each other. The goal
should be to educate and bring consensus about a proposal. Not just to tell
you want and ignore what you don't.

You could actually do an experiment by farming twitter posts and creating a
report on an issue. If only I had the money to build it. It would be a cool
experiment.

I can see your argument brewing already and will try to answer it. &quot;But,
Google does filter!&quot;. They do their best to be an impartial deliverer of
information without judgement. Your idea of filtering has the judgement of
those who created the filter deciding what information to deliver. I think
that is the difference. I never said there couldn't be auto--aggregation
and weighting of arguments based on people influence. But, I don't think we
should auto ignore based on judgement. The technology should be as unbiased
as possible. Giving you the in information to to make your own decision.

That being said I do believe there is a place for filtering. Just not in
the way you would implement it. Non-sensical posts for example (should be
throughly tested to keep from judgement). But if you are talking about
expanding a new road in your city and someone writes, &quot;But the sky is
Blue!&quot; is an example of non-sensical. Or, spam filtering people who are
just advertising something.

Also, in creating systems that keep you from being able to game the system
could use filtering. Like if 1000 people said the same thing, but all their
accounts are new within a short time and that is their only post. You can
probably assume it is someone trying to game the system. That being said,
there should be a system set up where you can plead your case if you are
filtered. That way if you really were a person that happened to signup
during that 1000 post time and said what you did as your first post you
could refute it and then be recognized by the system. Notice all of my
examples keep from the filter having judgement on any issue.

Cheers,
James
