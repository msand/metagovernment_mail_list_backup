<PRE>I agree with both of these comments. I have no delusions that this
group will produce a working system.  I'm merely here because I
believe this group is currently an *impediment* to the production of
such a system because it is occupying mindshare and resources that
other groups or individuals might more efficiently use.  Furthermore,
because it has demonstrably failed to produce even a usable prototype
or even a &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule, it is *discouraging* work
by independent groups by making the problem seem harder than it really
is.

Back to the &quot;shit or get of the pot&quot; requirement, I'd recommend we now
entertain proposals for how to restructure.  Seems to me there are two
general paths forward:
1) Get our act together and vote (everyone!) on the design parameters
(decision rule, social engineering targets, that &quot;standardization&quot;
stuff. etc.)
2) Go &quot;anarchy&quot; and state that metagovernment is exclusively an
&quot;incubator&quot; for idea sharing, testing of prototypes, etc.  This will
require removing any indications that there is a common philosophy.
Indeed we might even create separate areas for competing philosophies
that people will be encouraged to &quot;vote with their feet&quot; on.  This
will require removing all the &quot;standardization&quot; stuff which is a
hindrance to any project by diverting resources from more useful
activities.

Regardless of which path we choose the &quot;projects&quot; page needs to be
restructured to differentiate projects (like NationBuilder) that are
antithetical to direct democracy or have other commercial ties from
those that are truly open and part of the &quot;incubation&quot; system.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: Apologies for the delay in posting my &quot;System&quot; design document:
Bits of it are scattered throughout my book and it'll take me a few
more days to organize those for presentation here.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The only way such a problem gets fixed is massive authoritarian intervention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it massive public groundswell. There are good reasons to beleive that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neither will ever happen in this case. Hard problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> B) if you build it they dont come. The population of people who desire
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advanced democracy is about 3% of the population. The other 97% is i have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say, just dumb about this issue. As a species we tend to be authoritarian
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> boneheads. Also hard problem.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> System wide change is then so unlikely no one seriously attempts it. Thus

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The hobbists could achive something meaningful if they boned up on the
