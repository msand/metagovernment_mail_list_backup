<PRE>Incase you don't want to read the long post above.

In summary from Valve's implementation I think we should create a list of
requirements/expectations about the users and the admins of the system we
promote. Just to create a level of expectations that we can all have
together. And, we should list out the inherent weaknesses out front so we
can 1) See them and 2) Create systems to mitigate them.

Also, if there is anyway we could have someone contact Valve and interview
them about their governance model that would be very helpful. Talking to a
real person who has been through the process would tell us a lot about it.

Ideally we could interview 3 types of people.

   - One of the originals that have seen it develop overtime
   - Someone who has been their long enough to be comfortable with the
   system so we can learn how he got to that point.
   - Lastly, a new person that is just starting and getting their view at
   first glance


Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that is why hiring is so important to them. I don't know if there
</I>&gt;<i> is a way to help people become more autonomous unless they want to be that
</I>&gt;<i> way. It just shows that getting the right people involved in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place is important. Otherwise the system wouldn't work as intended. It has
</I>&gt;<i> some &quot;system requirements&quot; that must be met in order to function properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you need to have both independently in a governance system. A
</I>&gt;<i> system that helps people become more autonomous and a system that requires
</I>&gt;<i> a level of autonomy to work within it. To be honest some people are just
</I>&gt;<i> not made to work in that type of environment(I am not a gifted
</I>&gt;<i> administrator. I will openly admit that), but that is okay. It is important
</I>&gt;<i> to help people find their strengths and put them in a position that both
</I>&gt;<i> uses and develops them. You need all types of people for all types of
</I>&gt;<i> problems. They could very well get to the level of autonomy required but it
</I>&gt;<i> really is up to them. There is no forcing them to increase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do wonder what they do other than have this pamphlet and say, &quot;And here,
</I>&gt;<i> we, Go!&quot;. That is sort of what they imply because they say that direct
</I>&gt;<i> assigned mentorship is not helpful to the system in their experience.
</I>&gt;<i> People get mentored I am sure, but that is because they find something they
</I>&gt;<i> can contribute to and somebody helps them out. I wish we could interview an
</I>&gt;<i> employee to get first hand experience. Maybe we could have someone
</I>&gt;<i> officially reach out to them? I bet they would be interested in a project
</I>&gt;<i> like Metagovernment and they are passionate about their system so they
</I>&gt;<i> might like the chance to show how it works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Going back to your question of &quot;Do they have any concrete practices?&quot;. I
</I>&gt;<i> think that is more of an education(or maybe even culture) problem then it
</I>&gt;<i> is a problem with the governance model. I think it proves that making sure
</I>&gt;<i> people fit the requirements of the system is integral to it's working. It
</I>&gt;<i> probably sounds obvious, but it is easy to get into the &quot;we need to include
</I>&gt;<i> everybody&quot; mode and keep the system from working as intended and tie up
</I>&gt;<i> resources. It is very hard to hire people but it is even harder to fire
</I>&gt;<i> them. There is a spot for everyone in the culture/country/town and everyone
</I>&gt;<i> has room to develop and we should encourage that, but it doesn't mean
</I>&gt;<i> everyone was made to do every kind of task. I do want to mention I mean at
</I>&gt;<i> the leadership cogs and wheels level of administering the system. Not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily that we should set up a system that we just do what the system
</I>&gt;<i> decides for us (ummmm.... i've been lurking on the MG mailing list for
</I>&gt;<i> years for a reason). I do think everyone needs to be able to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> the governance in anyway they can/want/are comfortable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, when we do set up a governance of some sort I think it will be
</I>&gt;<i> critical to list system requirements of the people involved explicitly,
</I>&gt;<i> just like in their manual, so there is equal expectation from all sides.
</I>&gt;<i> When both people outside and inside have similar expectations it is my
</I>&gt;<i> experience they get a long a lot better. Miss-matched expectations lead to
</I>&gt;<i> disappointment, disappointments can lead to distrust, and so on... Until in
</I>&gt;<i> the extreme case there is a revolution of one party over the other where
</I>&gt;<i> expectations are readjusted, and the cycle continues. We can minimize the
</I>&gt;<i> cycle by starting off clear and creating a system to change those
</I>&gt;<i> expectations in a transparent way that has both sides involved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might seem trivial, but do we have a list somewhere of what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> people we need to run the systems we would like to implement?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as including more passive people. That just depends on how we
</I>&gt;<i> define the system. We don't need it to be like Valve. We just need to learn
</I>&gt;<i> from their successful implementation of a system when defining our own.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open to question and criticism though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> James
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I also like how they openly acknowledged the weaknesses in their
</I>&gt;<i> system. Instead of empirically stating that it is superior in all ways. It
</I>&gt;<i> is sort of ironic that acknowledging weaknesses and possible exploitation
</I>&gt;<i> is actually a way to mitigate it. From that definition you can actually
</I>&gt;<i> create systems within the system that do mitigate it, but if you don't
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge it, you don't even know where to start. Faults is another point
</I>&gt;<i> that should be well defined about the system. We all know every system has
</I>&gt;<i> it's faults. We just need to own them and move forward anyway with an eye
</I>&gt;<i> on our backs.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting, do you have any relation to Valve or a broader
