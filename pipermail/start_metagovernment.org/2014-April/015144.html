I assume the accounts in the fully operational system will be bound to
some verifiable information (SS#, drivers license, cell phone number,
credit card/paypal/ebay/bank/etc account, IRS mailing address, etc.)
which instantly solves the fake voter issue.  The bigger risk is
people hacking the system and changing votes.  This is why the votes
must be public (just as they have been during millions of years of our
evolution, and are today for our representatives) so that any
widespread tampering will be easily detectable by just asking people
to periodically review their own records.  Which they'll probably want
to do anyway if they've assigned proxies because they'll want to also
check that their proxy is voting the way they assumed they would.

As I've said before, people move billions of dollars around every day
with a username/password and we don't need to obsess over the security
of the system or get all bent out of shape if occasional
non-systematic tampering is discovered because that will almost never
affect the final outcome of a vote.  A good rule of thumb is that
everyone's vote counts, but not very much ;-)

    Scott
