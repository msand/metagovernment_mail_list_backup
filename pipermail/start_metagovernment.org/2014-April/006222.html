If we do manage to break into the mainstream, we're going to have enemies (read: authoritarians) characterizing us as all kinds of negative things. We don't need to give them fuel in advance. I don't see us as revolutionaries simply because I don't see any overthrow of the current system. Instead, I'd like to see the current systems simply wither and die as people eventually ignore them in favor of the much better, stronger solutions that have grown around them. There is no treason in dispensing with a representative-democracy government if everyone is onboard with it.

Of course you're right: The mere act of the majority adopting the new
system simultaneously invalidates the old one.  At least you'll
understand this if you're a rational person.  Unfortunately there is a
significant percentage of the population (those Authoritarians) who
won't and will fight, sometimes to the death, to resist the change.
But my position is that &quot;the best defense is a strong offense &quot; and so
we need to own this issue and define it in our terms (as you have
above).  By not hiding from this characterization we can actually use
it against the authoritarians who will seek to dominate us, much like
the way blacks have commandeered the N-word to the point where they
can now use it with abandon but it is absolutely taboo for a white
person to use it, or the Pirate Party have taken over that
once-negative term.  By extension that makes us the &quot;Treason Party&quot;
;-)

There is also social/psychological/organizational reasons for using
this term: By adopting it we indicate that this project is not just a
hobby or an experiment, we're deadly serious about it.  And although
it may cause some loss in membership, it will improve cohesiveness and
commitment among those who remain. Which is important because it seems
to me that these are things the project is lacking at this point.

    Scott
