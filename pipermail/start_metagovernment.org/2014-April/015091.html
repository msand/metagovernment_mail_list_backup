Right on!  I've been lurking through this discussion and am feeling both frustrated and inspired.  I'm frustrated because I don't understand why we aren&#8217;t using some of the tools that are already out there, like Loomio and Incoma (or whatever) to begin developing something more comprehensive, together. 

I'm not a developer so please forgive my ignorance, but would it be possible to begin by combining some of the bits and pieces that already exist?  However simple and rudimentary it might be at first, at least then we would have a project we could focus on together.  I imagine the synergy that would come from that would be quite productive and empowering.

The authoritarian/dominator system is about to cook us all&#8230;.and here we sit dithering via e-mail.   Hmmmm.  I wonder, what would it take to begin developing a single project, or platform together?    Isn't that what the spirit of this group is all about?
