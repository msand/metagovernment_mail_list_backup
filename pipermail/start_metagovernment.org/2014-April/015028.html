<PRE>Thanks again for the spirited debate, Scott. I disagree with you a lot. :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't have time to read any books at the moment, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground. The word &quot;consensus&quot; is a bit vague. When I say it, I do not mean unanimity but rather very large supermajority.

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks, Ed, for volunteering to be the one with the giant target on
</I>&gt;<i> your back ;-)  Your post is about the best evidence I could ask for as
</I>&gt;<i> to why majority rule is a requirement.  Please allow me to start by
</I>&gt;<i> translating your first sentence: &quot;I don't have time to educate myself,
</I>&gt;<i> so I'll just go with my existing prejudice&quot;.  This is part of the
</I>&gt;<i> problem, not part of the solution.
</I>
Your first criticism of this group was that we need to KISS: that things should be able to be presented in 30 seconds. Now you're saying I need to read a book to be able to refute you? 

Further, the conclusion is specious. How does my sentence support majority rule? Are you claiming that the majority in fact do read volumes before voting? I propose the opposite conclusion: a well-crafted consensus system corrects for the ignorance of the majority by empowering the minority to provide sane input into decisions that could otherwise be overwhelmed by the ignorance of &quot;the masses.&quot;

&gt;&gt;<i> First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And in the mean time?  No government at all?
</I>
No hasty decisions, yes! What good is a decision that sucks for half the people? Why should we rush to the wrong decision? Unless there is an army about to invade or a giant meteor about to strike, do we really need to rush governance? We are no where near the level of invading armies or world-saving governance, so I don't see any need for hasty decision-making here. Especially if it leads to awful results.

&gt;<i>  Your argument, and this
</I>&gt;<i> group's failure to produce a &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule (let
</I>&gt;<i> alone even a usable prototype) in 6 years is the proof we've been
</I>&gt;<i> looking for *in itself* that a consensus-based decision rule is
</I>&gt;<i> non-viable.  Don't you just love the irony of it all?
</I>
We do have a decision rule, which was developed quickly using Votorola as the mechanism to reach consensus on it. It is at:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

Recently, I got into a debate with one other person who disputed that decision rule. He hasn't defended his position recently, so it looks like the above stands for now. That decision rule was made about two years ago. See
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html</A>
for part of the development.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for the practicality of consensus governance, I don't think it is worth compromising over. Sure, a majority-rule system can get results faster. But they will inherently be bad results. 49% of the people will always feel shorted. Plus, most importantly, people get funneled into an artificial 2-sided system. You are either for or against abortion, death penalty, etc., and there can be no building toward synthesis. And those issues themselves are products of the 2-sided system. Trying to boil the world down into being for or against abortion is silly. The issue is much more nuanced than that, and a majority-rule system kills that nuance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, majority voting doesn't mean half+1 although it seems that we
</I>&gt;<i> disagree that that outcome is better than *no* decision.  The design
</I>&gt;<i> of proposals *should* be iterative with as much social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> technology as we can bring to bear on the problem of increasing the
</I>&gt;<i> size of the majority.
</I>
So where are we disagreeing? I already said I'm defining consensus not as unanimity, but rather large supermajority. Again, refer to the decision rule page above.

&gt;<i>  But again *requiring* this is an argument for
</I>&gt;<i> the status quo which I'm sure we all agree is not acceptable.
</I>
I don't understand this statement.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Who cares if consensus takes longer, is harder, costs more? If it builds real solutions that everyone can get onboard with, isn't it the only possible way to advance beyond the massive failings of current majority-rule systems?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two logical flaws in this one:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What if consensus, even by your relaxed (and unfortunately unusably
</I>&gt;<i> vague) definition is impossible, which is what the research shows is
</I>&gt;<i> often the case?
</I>
Reference my last post and the decision rule cited above for a working (but not set-in-stone) definition of consensus used here.

&gt;<i> 2) The problems with our current system aren't in any way traceable to
</I>&gt;<i> the decision rule.
</I>
Yes they are. See my entire previous post, especially the parts about abortion and such.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If there is some issue that 49% of people are opposed to, should we really force it on them? That doesn't even sound like democracy to me.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, thanks for the target: IMHO this brings into question your
</I>&gt;<i> qualifications to &quot;lead&quot; this project.
</I>
I have no power, so I only lead as much as people care to &quot;follow.&quot; It's more that I try to cheer-lead. You're welcome to as well.

&gt;<i>  Democracy, by definition, is
</I>&gt;<i> merely *participatory* and does not require consensus, or any
</I>&gt;<i> particular decision rule for that matter.  
</I>
I know that. I said &quot;to me.&quot; Democracy *to me* is about more than just participation. It is about government of, by, and (most importantly) for all people.

&gt;<i> By insisting on a provably
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable philosophy what you're proposing is &quot;no effective
</I>&gt;<i> government&quot; which unfortunately is also what you have provided this
</I>&gt;<i> group.  I'd call it anarchy, but it's *worse* than anarchy because it
</I>&gt;<i> preserves the status quo and so doesn't even come with the freedom
</I>&gt;<i> that true anarchy affords.
</I>
Early in the development of this group, it was the consensus (in this case unanimous) that we not have formal governance and rather work as adhocracy. Later on, through consensus (again unanimous), we adopted the decision rule above. How does consensus not work, and how is it not working here?

When I look up consensus decision-making on Wikipedia, I see a lot of description of different models, how they operate, and how they have been used through history.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
I don't see much about how it is provably unworkable. I think the Quakers would disagree.

What is your elevator pitch, Scott?
