<PRE>It might be pessimistic but I think a lot more people are prone to
corruption and everyone has prejudice somehow. I am not judging you for it
but clearly you are prejudice towards religious people. I don't know many
people who would turn down a million dollars. You're there, working hard to
support your family and a very big org says, &quot;If you just say this. You'll
never need to work again.&quot; Boom! system broken. You could even excuse it
saying you will use the money for good purposes, even better than if the
company still had it. It's only this one time... etc. Even better it is
something you believe already, so it is a win win. Justification is easy.

You're sort of saying two incompatible things.
&quot;There is no &quot;decider&quot;, the final approval is by public vote&quot; &lt;-You think
they are deciding.
&quot;a small group of people makes decisions about projects&quot; &lt;- They are the
people that really decide what happens. The final vote just says yes or no.
Very little actual participation from the masses.

Even if the general public majority is not corruptible you still haven't
addressed how people will be among the chosen to decide the details? and
how to prevent corruption or prejudice among that small group?

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> How?  I don't see any method of dragging the majority of the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But in your system it could. Who decides who gets to decide? Once there
</I>&gt;<i> is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; small group, who says they won't be influenced by power or money from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone else. There is a lot of money floating around these days to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; influence politics. I don't think we should count on people being 100%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; honest. That is why they tried to put checks and balances. Your assuming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your morals and choices are right. Which I admit, everyone thinks that,
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it isn't surprising. Your wouldn't believe something if you didn't
</I>&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe it. The system its' self needs to be belief agnostic however. Not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serve to perpetuate your beliefs. Even if they end up being right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, what I believe is that the Neurotypicals, who make up the majority
</I>&gt;<i> (albeit maybe only a slight majority) of the population are moral and
</I>&gt;<i> will make the right decisions when they vote.  If we all don't believe
</I>&gt;<i> *that*, well, we better start working on our &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> system because that's the only viable alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You may argue your system wouldn't allow this, so I ask what is your
</I>&gt;<i> system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for deciding who can make decisions and who can't? How are you going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fight corruption of that system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Read the book ;-)  But to summarize, everyone (at least everyone with
</I>&gt;<i> the system credential, which means they've done some sort of training
</I>&gt;<i> to know at a minimum how to log in, review the info, and cast their
</I>&gt;<i> vote) gets to participate any level and to any degree they wish.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no &quot;decider&quot;, the final approval is by public vote which
</I>&gt;<i> social pressure should be applied to everyone to make sure at least
</I>&gt;<i> the majority participate.  Otherwise we end up with the same system we
</I>&gt;<i> have now with the SDAs making the decision for everyone.  Again, if
</I>&gt;<i> you don't understand the SDA issue, IMHO you're bound to be trying to
</I>&gt;<i> solve the wrong problem.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
