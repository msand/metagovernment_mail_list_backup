<PRE>Dear Steve
you are kindly invited to the Development Group of Airesis, I extend the
invitation to everyone else already twice and I don't want to be considered
a spammer , let me share with you some of our ambition we aim in a EU call
but let me remind is  a
TL;DR
Kind regards
Jacopo

The Airesis.EU project will deliver an E-democracy platform beyond state of
the art that will set the beginning of a new era in government approach.

The final ambition of Airesis.EU is to serve as the open source global
standard of deliberative social networks.

We have the strongest motivation and the highest ethical reasons, we are
the answer to this call in a broader sense rather that to the specific
requests. As a matter of fact, most of the core actions are answered by the
values we share, more than by the functions of the platform.

The vision and the mission of Airesis.EU is to have an open government, the
work put by the association Tecnologie Democratiche in to the Airesis
platform focus on participation as the only way to realize an open
government. To delegate unconditionally a group of people to take all
decision is not anymore a viable option because we cannot accept the risk
of their mistakes.

Our leader is the search for consensus, his force, collective intelligence.
We share the same values with the partners of our consortium which ultimate
aim is not only to provide evidences of affordable participatory budget
proposals but for the practical use of such tools and suggestions on how to
implement them. Our French partner Citoyen du Monde will manage  France&#8217;s
administrations that have signed up for the pilot as commitment to the
scope of the call, but as global organization in accordance with the
Charter Globalization (1949, Ed.1984-Updated 2004)&#185;  they will validate
Airesis.EU as a legal process in Recim&#178; / People congress and Assembly and
legitimate Open Government with UN organisations - People Congress&#179; and UN
Geneva&#8308;.

We came across a number of software platform that are planning to do
exactly what Airesis is

doing&#8309;. Most of them are at the drawing board, some are at the programming
stage, some are online but are not curated and look abandoned, and we see a
number that are addressing single specific issues&#8310;,  these plaforms are
limited in that they don't allow users to create groups and develop
organically around issues of concern and interest. There are participatory
budgeting software that are developed to be offered to municipalities for a
fees but are used for collecting ideas and give general indications, not
real decision taking&#8311;.

The most successful examples of real participation is achieved by
participatory budgeting projects carried at the local level by ONG  with
rare use of web based platform.

Our project is unique because start from the well established deliberative
model that implement Schulze&#8312; algoritm this will be used by the
participative budgeting  module, the whole system will interact with a full
set of open API with any other platform willing to integrate with the
system. We open Airesis.EU to be use by other platform to work in a synergy
by consolidating the citizen effort under a single integrated platform.

The Airesis.EU project will therefore constitute a harmonic and
complementary  investigation into the technical and operative aspects  of
ICT tools, from the most advanced collective intelligence theories  as well
as  the political, legal and sociological theories and implications  that
derive from them, all of which impact  markedly upon  e-democracy and
e-government.  The Airesis.EU project aims at  providing a comprehensive
 exploration of legal, social and technical factors and, by critically
examining  the legal and ethical pros and cons of certain tools and/or
technologies, at  assessing the full picture of  their significance and
impact.

We believe that if is used and promoted as a means of seeking consensus in
areas of the world that are under political tensions or as transformative
scenario planning tool where major and important decision need to be taken
Airesis.EU could give the best results.
