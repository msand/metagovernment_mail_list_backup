<PRE>Hi Ed and all,

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>
</I>
I'm afraid that document isn't accurate (and I'm currently unable to
correct it).  But Crossforum Theatre is just one of Votorola's user
interfaces (embeddable web).  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/t">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/t</A>

Maybe you're thinking of the toolset switch?  Or the vote mirroring
inter-network?  In any case, the page above links to information on
all the facilities I work with.

Unfortunately, owing to time constraints, I generally can't follow
the list discussions.  Please CC me if you have questions etc.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The authoritarian/dominator system is about to cook us all&#8230;.and here we sit dithering via e-mail.   Hmmmm.  I wonder, what would it take to begin developing a single project, or platform together?    Isn&#8217;t that what the spirit of this group is all about? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the thought-process behind the crossforum theater is that different people want to participate differently. So the crossforum lets people propose and vote where they want and then it aggregates that participation. It also has the side benefit of letting people test out various systems and pick what works for them. Does that sound like something you could work on?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here&#8217;s an initial writeup, though it is more descriptive than promotional. Michael has a much deeper understanding of it, so hopefully he can follow-up if you or others have questions.
