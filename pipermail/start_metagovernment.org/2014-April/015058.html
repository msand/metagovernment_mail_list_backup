TL;DR: The inverse of that!

&gt;<i> There are several other methods being worked on to discourage trolls.

Unfortunately I think not directly relevant because they have the
option (frequently exercised) of simply deleting even the *question*
that would result in the opportunity for a debate.  This is also why I
don't take Wikipedia as a useful model: In both of those cases there
*is* one theoretical &quot;right answer&quot; and it's just a matter of tweaking
the wording to get as close as possible to that ideal.  For making
government (at least a government that doesn't rely on consensus, ha!)
there is no one right answer and there will always be a significant
pile of partially unresolved issues raised in the debate left over.
That is troll heaven!

&gt;<i> The National Communication Association has been researching this

</I>
Very good, and with actual empirical data!  But pretty simplistic (so
far) and again I question the applicability to the domain of
legislation:

1) We're not here to generate traffic, and don't care if people like us on FB.

2) We can't just ban people the way commercial enterprises can (and
frequently do).

3) The news content is by its very nature ephemeral and of no value
after a few days.  Our stuff needs to endure, potentially forever, so
the need for quality comments and quality presentation (i.e.,
filtering) are vastly higher.  This is one of the biggest drawbacks of
FB, slashdot, reddit, etc. because not only is all of the stuff
generated essentially disposable, they usually don't even provide any
reasonable way to *search* the old content (which in itself is an
admission that after a week nobody will ever want to see it again).
This not the way legislation (or the law itself) works.

&gt;<i> Many people are
</I>&gt;<i> working on it from several different angles. The SettleIt.org design reduces
</I>&gt;<i> the cognitive load of any single interaction by isolating it so you only
</I>&gt;<i> need to consider a single statement at a time which also allows us to divide
</I>&gt;<i> up the work among multiple people. This allows for the time and effort you
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in other options of reducing trolls.
</I>
We at least agree that crowdsourcing is the way to manage the vast
amounts of data that the crowds themselves will generate.  I think
what remains is how to leverage that to make it easy for someone to
jump into the middle of the process and quickly grok what's been
happening and make a useful contribution (or maybe just a rational
vote).

(snip)

&gt;<i> Although that statement is true, in many debates you can not reach even a
</I>&gt;<i> simple majority because many people are dismissing concerns of the others
</I>&gt;<i> and refusing to debate the topics. I don't see why you would discourage
</I>&gt;<i> efforts to increase the level of agreement.
</I>
I'm not,  I'm just acknowledging the fact that:

a) Most people's contributions are not worth reading.

b) A significant fraction of the contributions are *intended* to be
disruptive and so definitely should *not* be read.

Filtering doesn't necessarily reduce the level of agreement because it
has nothing to do with the actual decision process (at least in my
proposed system) but only in the proposal refinement process.  For
example, in our &quot;abortion in SettleIt&quot; example, I'd want to filter out
all religion-based statements, but would retain statements of the form
&quot;30% of the people are going to be opposed because they believe their
religion tells them to do this&quot;.  That is exactly the kind of
statement that facilitates understanding and compromise and I would
hope would be selected to be one of the dozen statements people would
read before making a suggestion to revise a proposal or when making
their final vote.

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flags it that way.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A simple flag is also another vector for the trolls. I see many situations
</I>&gt;<i> where this is used to remove unpopular ideas that otherwise could provide
</I>&gt;<i> value. I believe it would be better in the long run to encourage debating
</I>&gt;<i> each idea once rather than ignore it many times.
</I>
There would have to be some social engineering applied to the problem.
 For example, downvoting something could cost the voter points as it
does on Stack Exchange. But more importantly, and as for the &quot;many
times issue&quot;, I'm thinking that people *themselves* would be subject
to the filtering.  We know how to identify trolls, they just behave
differently than normal people do.  For example, I know who the trolls
are on my local paper's site and have attempted (fruitlessly) to have
rational discussions with them about their behavior (and have had
conversations with the paper's editorial staff who are as frustrated
by the situation as I am and who are consequently considering
abandoning the the entire system as many other papers have).  If I,
and those who have come to recognize these people, were able to filter
them and they *knew* that this was happening (or worse, knew that even
the noobs could look up who the respected people were filtering), my
prediction is that the quantity of their posts would significantly
decrease and the quality increase.

But these are empirical questions and ones I'm assuming we're have to
do the research and answer ourselves because this domain is just
different from those others and so they aren't likely to do it for us.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;length issue&quot;. Are you concerned about the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the troll's comments or the fact that SettleIt.org has a limited
</I>&gt;<i> statement length.
</I>
Neither: It's the *number* of statements that could become
overwhelming with trolls posting a zillion slightly altered versions
of a statement in an attempt to overwhelm any statement they disagree
with.
  Regards,
    Scott
