<PRE>*I would like to make a suggestion.*
If this suggestion is agreed it should take place immediately, it should
also be written in the wiki.
&gt;<i>From now on EVERY person that writes to this mailing list, should add to
</I>his message a
TL;DR section (also known as Too Long Don't Read). Where he summarises in
less than 500 words what he said. *Do we have a consensus on this?*

I start:

*TL;DR:* *from now on we should all add a summary at the end or beginning
of our message of a paragraph. Agreed?*

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;The best we can do is to design a system that supports filtering that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; stuff out of the feed&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wouldn't limit us to that one solution. Your statements read like you
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not open to other options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open, sure, but I haven't seen or thought of any reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.  Unless the system has a way to filter the information
</I>&gt;<i> presented to each user, I claim that it is unworkable because it will
</I>&gt;<i> simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  Anyone disagree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;my second issue, which is the use of the term &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; settleit.org and other debate systems.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To my knowledge you won't find the words 'fact' or 'truth' on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; SettleIt.org website. Everything is a statement which can be debated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Truth is on there as is &quot;knowledge&quot; which I equate to &quot;facts&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;In the abortion debate, one of the &quot;facts&quot; is that the Bible says it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; wrong.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In your example of the abortion debate, one of the statements is that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Bible says it's wrong. In SettleIt.org under that statement people would
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debating that the Bible does not say that abortion is wrong and others
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debate the weight of the bible on the abortion debate which includes if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone should believe in the Bible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so every SettleIt debate has the option of including a branch
</I>&gt;<i> which will settle the issue of whether the Bible is true ;-)  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> now you can see why filtering is a good strategy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe one of the major reasons for constant disagreement and
</I>&gt;<i> inaction is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the tendency for people to disregard others concerns instead of
</I>&gt;<i> addressing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and resolving those differences. If you just filter out religious
</I>&gt;<i> statements
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then you are not engaging with a large section of the group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But that's my choice.  I'm not denying any of them their right to free
</I>&gt;<i> speech, I'm denying them the right to freely speak *to me*.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to hear it as it is annoying, time-wasting, and of no value to
</I>&gt;<i> me.  When enough other people express the same opinion, instinctive
</I>&gt;<i> social behaviors will kick in and they'll simply stop being annoying
</I>&gt;<i> like that (again, this is covered more completely in my book and
</I>&gt;<i> Altemeyer's).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can't make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a group decision by ignoring the concerns of others in the group. You can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use the religious filter to realize and express the reasons for your
</I>&gt;<i> current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opinion but it does not serve the group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds a little like that &quot;consensus&quot; thing again.  &quot;Serving the
</I>&gt;<i> group&quot; does not require serving every member of that group.  Some
</I>&gt;<i> people are just going to have to go along with what the majority (or
</I>&gt;<i> supermajority) prefer.  In a lot of cases, at least if we do things
</I>&gt;<i> right, it'll be the authoritarians who end up with the short end of
</I>&gt;<i> the stick, and this is as it should be because it has been clearly
</I>&gt;<i> shown that when they get the big end they turn around and beat people
</I>&gt;<i> with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Obvious nonsensical and destructive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; statements should probably be filtered out but it will take time to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determine those standards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and in my proposal there is an option even above flagging, and
</I>&gt;<i> that's moderation (which should be very rare, but is a necessary
</I>&gt;<i> component for dealing with the dangerously antisocial).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;editing other people's stated opinions just feels 'icky'.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will work on making this more clear and answering it here is helping me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work through the text.  SettleIt.org is not a place for personal
</I>&gt;<i> opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Entering a statement is stating that this is a reason to believe or not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe in another statement. It is assume to be reasonably shared by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; multiple people and could be expressed in several ways with some ways
</I>&gt;<i> being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clearer than others. All statements are an attempt to be a fact but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extent to which they are true can always be debated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is certainly more elegant to use the same system for this part of
</I>&gt;<i> the evaluation, but again I'd be concerned about the length issue.
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
</I>&gt;<i> opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
</I>&gt;<i> flags it that way.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
