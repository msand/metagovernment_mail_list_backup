</I>
Thanks!  I can finally return that library book (it's nice to have a
big university nearby (CU Boulder), especially nowadays when nobody
reads books and so they're always available on the shelves instead of
having to wait a week to recall them ;-)

I recommend everyone get that, but you probably don't want to punish
yourself by reading all of it until you get stuck on something.
Arrow is covered in chapter 24,  and you'll probably learn useful
things (like about decision rules) by just reading the last 2 or 3
chapters.

&gt;<i> FWIW, I'm also a UCSC graduate. But I notice we differ on some major points.
</I>
I suppose like any school there is some diversity, but UCSC, at least
back in the day, was more diverse than most because at that time there
were those of us attracted to the place itself along with a motley
assortment of Berkeley redirects (BTW, he knows this because he
downloaded my draft, and read at least the first and last sections).

&gt;<i> A) I'm not at all attracted to the &quot;treason&quot; brand. I realize that
</I>&gt;<i> transgressive-looking moves are particularly fashionable these days, but I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer to couch innovative disruption as that, rather than as a good guys
</I>&gt;<i> vs. bad guys Manichean battle.
</I>
I go back on forth on this myself.  The attraction of new technology
by itself may be enough to get us there, but I'm still inclined to
keep a backup plan in place...

(snip, Thanks for this background information on NationBuilder: I am a
noob, remember ;-)

&gt;<i> C) I think I understand the fine distinction you're making about consensus
</I>&gt;<i> vs. majority rule. At the same time, the technology I've been developing is
</I>&gt;<i> largely focused on ranked choice voting tools. So I presume you'd be eager
</I>&gt;<i> to invoke Arrow to say I'm wasting my time on an unreliable approach. My
</I>&gt;<i> answer is that I'm primarily concerned with how communities of people can
</I>&gt;<i> improve the thinking and talking activities that precede choosing. In order
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve that preliminary goal, I'm highly confident that ranked choice
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces can be leveraged to provide the fairest hearing to the broadest
</I>&gt;<i> diversity of views.
</I>
Again, I agree that this is a good component of the process, but in
the end you've simply *got* to have a majority-rule vote.  If your
process works well that vote will merely be a formality and you'll
have a large supermajority decision.  But if not, contentious
government is better than no government (i.e., this is encoded in
business philosophy as &quot;an imperfect decision is always better than no
decision&quot;.
  Regards,
    Scott
