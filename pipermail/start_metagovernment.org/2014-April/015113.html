<PRE>That isn't to say there are similarities between business and government.
It's a little unfair to assume Ed doesn't believe in any buisness
practices because he doesn't agree with one axiom though.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> You're going to have to figure that out. That is a big part of governance.

</I>&gt;<i> the merits of a system that isn't yet defined.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as buisness vs government. If you search poop you'll get
</I>&gt;<i> 100,000,000s of results so that isn't a good indicator something is
</I>&gt;<i> popular. Government and buisness are different. Or at least I think they
</I>&gt;<i> should be different. For example, you can't &quot;fire&quot; someone who is being a
</I>&gt;<i> bad citizen. Their goals are different so their methods should reflect that.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott, we seem to fundamentally differ here. I've explained my
</I>&gt;<i> rationale, but I don't see yours. So I'll restate mine:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency is my primary concern: You can't expect people who are not
</I>&gt;<i> interested in an issue to participate in the back-and-forth debate
</I>&gt;<i> that the proposal generation/refining process requires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hold that voting and proposal generation/tuning must go hand-in-hand
</I>&gt;<i> and absolutely should not be separate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I totally disagree! ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A root problem with the status quo is that people are presented with a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal and asked to vote it up or down. In the U.S., we call this a
</I>&gt;<i> referendum, and it is horrible. The crafting of the proposal is where all
</I>&gt;<i> the actual decision-making happens (the devil is in the details), and
</I>&gt;<i> almost everyone is disenfranchised from that. And then when people are
</I>&gt;<i> asked to vote, they don't care, since they have so little influence on the
</I>&gt;<i> important parts of the matter: the details. A million vote for, a million
</I>&gt;<i> vote against: what does my input matter?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and I'm not making the argument that the proposals should be
</I>&gt;<i> handed down from on high, but only that they are developed by the
</I>&gt;<i> people who are interested in them and that we don't try to force all
</I>&gt;<i> of those who are not into this &quot;sausage making&quot; process.  Once they've
</I>&gt;<i> refined the proposal to a high degree, achieving the best possible
</I>&gt;<i> version of it, they can take it to the general population.  Who will
</I>&gt;<i> likely vote no on it (even in the best cases less than half of bills
</I>&gt;<i> pass in legislatures, most commonly because of resource allocation
</I>&gt;<i> issues).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm flexible on (and still researching) the proposal refinement
</I>&gt;<i> process, but tend to think that repeated voting is not an efficient
</I>&gt;<i> way to do it.  My current thinking is that people read a proposal then
</I>&gt;<i> post a pro or con statement about it, or maybe ask a question about.
</I>&gt;<i> Those statements themselves, and the answers to the questions, can
</I>&gt;<i> then be rated by people who don't know enough to make their own
</I>&gt;<i> statements.  *This* is where my sorting/filtering process comes in:
</I>&gt;<i> The raters can't be forced to wade through the entire list of
</I>&gt;<i> statements, the useless and offensive ones should either be filtered
</I>&gt;<i> out or sorted down toward the bottom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reviewing these comments the proposer could then modify the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to take this information into account and everyone who
</I>&gt;<i> commented on the previous version will get an invitation to review the
</I>&gt;<i> updated proposal.  If a war breaks out, forking the proposal should
</I>&gt;<i> also be an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Voting *guides* proposal-tuning. It tells you what is getting buy-in and
</I>&gt;<i> what is not consensus-building. While proposals are being crafted, we might
</I>&gt;<i> come to a point where half are for and half are against. You suggest a
</I>&gt;<i> majority-rule forced vote. I say that's a horrible solution. What if
</I>&gt;<i> instead one person said: &quot;Wait a minute, I have a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> idea; hey everyone, see if this solves your issues better.&quot; A lot of those
</I>&gt;<i> alternates might fail, but some genius might come up with something that
</I>&gt;<i> gets almost everyone onboard. I say that is infinitely better than forcing
</I>&gt;<i> a majority rule. And it cannot be done unless the voting and
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making are mixed. You know you have an answer when the votes pile
</I>&gt;<i> up on one proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say that person will have the opportunity to suggest a change a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, or make their own, and the people who are interested in
</I>&gt;<i> knowledgeable in that area will help them refine it (or unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> blow it out of the water as being unworkable in some cases).  But
</I>&gt;<i> again, we can't allow this small group who is interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> subject area to make law unsupervised, nor can we expect the general
</I>&gt;<i> population to participate in every timeconsuming refinement process as
</I>&gt;<i> the alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not exactly clear on how to determine that a proposal is ready for
</I>&gt;<i> a general vote, and tend to think that this is an empirical question.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether it's that a certain time has elapsed, the debate has slowed,
</I>&gt;<i> the proposer thinks it's ready, or a sufficient percentage of the
</I>&gt;<i> affected individuals have weighed in an given it a sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> positive review, or maybe some combination of all of those things, I
</I>&gt;<i> just don't know yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along
</I>&gt;<i>
