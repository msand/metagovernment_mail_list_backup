</I>&gt;<i> Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer to serve in representative governments.  And those exact same people will screw up the operation of any e-democracy or &quot;collaborative government&quot; system too unless we design in ways to systematically constrain their ability to do so.
</I>
Even if it solely the people who are the problem, those people are there because of the system. The current system favors and rewards the most corrupt politicians. If you have a race between a truly upstanding democrat and a self-serving, power-hungry politician -- which one is going to win under the current rules? The democrat is going to have a great message... but the politician is going to make deals with powerful interests with lots of money and influence, and will be able to shape the election to make his opponent out to be horribly wrong/undesirable/weak in some way. It happens all the time.

Then once those power-hungry politicians get into power (which they did a long, long time ago), they do everything in their power (which is vast) to maintain their control. So they re-shape the system further and further to entrench themselves and those who will play ball with them. Look at gerrymandering and the two-party system in the United States.

Given that, the question is always, what can we do to fix the system? That's a great one, because everyone has an answer for that. Term limits. No term limits. Contribution caps. No contribution caps. And so on. Not only does every solution sound minor and ineffectual... but every solution is always required to be passed by the very people in power. And every now and then those people do pass a law... and for some reason it doesn't fix anything. Because those people make sure it won't ruin their chokehold on power. Of course.

So I don't see the problem with the people but with the vicious circle the system enables when those people get into it. I see no such problems in a well-designed collaborative governance system. There will of course still be people exercising influence and power, but there won't be that vicious cycle of entrenchment.
