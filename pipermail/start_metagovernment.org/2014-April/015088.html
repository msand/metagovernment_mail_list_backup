</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Executive summary*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What your suggesting as impossible has already been done. I Googled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;google&quot; and it gave me exactly the information I wanted out of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2,820,000,000 possible results in .44 seconds. We just need an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementation specific to &quot;governing&quot;. I am not saying Google is perfect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at it, but I am saying your idea that it is impossible is flawed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't like filtering because it segregates groups that have the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion filtering the same thing. This happens on both sides of an issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until neither side even sees each other, or one is completely muzzled. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want understanding and some measure of consensus. Not a system that tells
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you exactly what you want while allowing you to ignore what you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personally believe.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, it could be really cool what you could do already by farming public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> twitter posts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I then go on to try to preempt his next post, &quot;But Google does filter&quot; by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> explaining a few cases where filtering does make sense. The filter should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strive to have no bias not represent the bias of a group of people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What your suggesting is not possible actually already exists in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different form.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Google seems to be able to do it. When I Googled &quot;Google&quot; it gave me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2,820,000,000 results (0.44 seconds)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It took them a lot of time and money but they have figured out a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help you wade through the internet and find what you are really looking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for. We just need a &quot;search engine&quot; and UI that bring you the relevant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are just a few ideas for what it could do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Combine comments that are essentially the same and have the reader
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    read it once. Instead of reading the same thing 10,000 times your can read
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    it one time with the appendage that 10,000 support this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - Give users a variable rank like Google page rank that assigns
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    weight to peoples comments based on how many people source that person.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Essentially, the more people that back you the more weight your comments
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - I am sure there are a lot more and invite anyone else to add these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    are just two I thought up off of the top of my head.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It isn't a perfect system. You can still game Google with shady SEO but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Google is getting better at giving you relevant information and is working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on their system all the time. We would need to do the same.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I just don't like the idea of filtering because it promotes segregation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead of consensus. Groups of people will consistently filter the same
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing and then only get information that they want to see fueling their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current opinions which then filter more things and so on. It will happen on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both sides of an argument further separating them from each other. The goal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be to educate and bring consensus about a proposal. Not just to tell
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want and ignore what you don't.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You could actually do an experiment by farming twitter posts and creating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a report on an issue. If only I had the money to build it. It would be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cool experiment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can see your argument brewing already and will try to answer it. &quot;But,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Google does filter!&quot;. They do their best to be an impartial deliverer of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information without judgement. Your idea of filtering has the judgement of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who created the filter deciding what information to deliver. I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is the difference. I never said there couldn't be auto--aggregation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and weighting of arguments based on people influence. But, I don't think we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should auto ignore based on judgement. The technology should be as unbiased
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as possible. Giving you the in information to to make your own decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That being said I do believe there is a place for filtering. Just not in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the way you would implement it. Non-sensical posts for example (should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> throughly tested to keep from judgement). But if you are talking about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expanding a new road in your city and someone writes, &quot;But the sky is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Blue!&quot; is an example of non-sensical. Or, spam filtering people who are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just advertising something.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, in creating systems that keep you from being able to game the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system could use filtering. Like if 1000 people said the same thing, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all their accounts are new within a short time and that is their only post.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You can probably assume it is someone trying to game the system. That being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> said, there should be a system set up where you can plead your case if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are filtered. That way if you really were a person that happened to signup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> during that 1000 post time and said what you did as your first post you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could refute it and then be recognized by the system. Notice all of my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples keep from the filter having judgement on any issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; years ago. To create a system where you can easily sift through large
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; amounts of data is a UI issue. Those just take someone creative enough
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the right amount of resources to implement it and the right access to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; data.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The limiting factor here is reading comprehension speed.  So, unless
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you're proposing an AI digest/rewrite the comments to increase
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> information density or some technology that beams the concepts
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> directly into people's heads telepathically there *must* be some sort
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of filtering.  Sure, much of it will be simply prioritizing (which is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just one easy method of filtering), but we're talking about a system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that may need to eventually filter *millions* of comments to pick out
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the dozen or so gems that a decisionmaker actually needs to see to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> enable them to make an informed choice.  The only way to do that is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a flagging/rating system, using the users themselves as the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> filter.
