Seems there's room for balance here.  While it's not helpful to
criticize a prototype for being incomplete, I for one would hate to
invest a huge amount of time working on a project based on a design
that another set of eyes could have told me was doomed before I
started.  Better to share early and often so that *we* can find any
flaws rather than some demagogue doing it just before you're ready to
publicly release...

&gt;<i> I do feel it is necessary to address any misperceptions about SettleIt.org
</I>&gt;<i> so I'll just add my comments to your statements.
</I>
Very good, that's what I'm here for!

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The can of worms it opens instead is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the issue of unequal votes: As there is no restriction on the number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of posts, any troll (read authoritarian) can game the system by&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I claim that this issue already exists in a direct democracy but is not
</I>&gt;<i> addressed. There is no limit to the resources a group can use to manipulate
</I>&gt;<i> the citizens through media and spamming the internet with false facts. If
</I>&gt;<i> that issue is external to the system then it is difficult for the system to
</I>&gt;<i> mitigate it.
</I>
True, and there will never be a way to prevent that.  The best we can
do is to design a system that supports filtering that stuff out of the
feed that most people see while working on a proposal or when
researching the background of a proposal before casting their vote on
it.  My proposal is to support tagging/flagging and providing a tool
that can be used to filter or at least prioritize the feed using those
tags.

But this also brings up my second issue, which is the use of the term
&quot;facts&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; in settleit.org and other debate systems.  In the
abortion debate, one of the &quot;facts&quot; is that the Bible says it's wrong.
 That may be technically true (although the Bible itself is internally
inconsistent on the subject), but as an atheist I'd like a button to
just filter out any religion-based &quot;facts&quot; as I consider them all to
be based on an invalid authority.  Same with a wide range of
ideological &quot;facts&quot;, such as &quot;We already have too many laws, we just
need to enforce the ones already on the books&quot;.  With flag and filter
this is easy (although actually defining the set of flags is going to
take some work).  With Settleit?

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;editing the troll posts (and what's up with that, anyway?)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A post in this system is similar to sentence in Wikipedia. It is not a self
</I>&gt;<i> expression but a piece of information which is not owned by anyone and is
</I>&gt;<i> the responsibility of everyone. You are not editing someone post, you are
</I>&gt;<i> clarifying a piece of information. There would be similar abuse prevention
</I>&gt;<i> controls as in Wikipedia but one again since it is specific and structured
</I>&gt;<i> the controls would be more effective.
</I>
I think I have a problem with this.  Maybe it's just me, but although
I have no trouble expressing an opinion or even jumping into wikipedia
to correct factual errors, editing other people's stated opinions just
feels &quot;icky&quot;.  Which is one big reason why I've been reluctant to just
jump into the metagovernment web site to make the changes I've
proposed.  I just feel that although I have a right (even an
obligation) to criticize, it's just not my place to mess with the
non-factual content directly.

Is it just me or does this maybe explain why so few others have done
edits on the metagovernment site?

&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The problem with our current system is that they (and their partners in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> crime the Social Dominators) gravitate toward positions of power and so muck
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up the operation of representative governments by distorting the numbers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are two of the many problems
</I>&gt;<i> facing people making a group decision. My gut reaction is that the issues
</I>&gt;<i> caused by the Authoritarians and the Social Dominators are smaller than the
</I>&gt;<i> problem of bias and misinformation when assessing proposals.
</I>
This could actually be the same problem: Who do you think is most
likely to be putting that stuff out?
  Regards,
     Scott

&gt;<i> Respectfully,
</I>&gt;<i> Bentley
