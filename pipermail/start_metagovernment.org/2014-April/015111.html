<PRE>Scott,

&quot;I'm not exactly clear on how to determine that a proposal is ready for
a general vote,&quot;

You're going to have to figure that out. That is a big part of governance.
You're right most people may not want to participate in everything, but you
should let them participate as much as they want to. Not just to a few
&quot;experts&quot; or the people who are very passionate in the area. Who defines
who as an expert? That seems ripe for abuse, but it is hard to argue about
the merits of a system that isn't yet defined.

As far as buisness vs government. If you search poop you'll get
100,000,000s of results so that isn't a good indicator something is
popular. Government and buisness are different. Or at least I think they
should be different. For example, you can't &quot;fire&quot; someone who is being a
bad citizen. Their goals are different so their methods should reflect that.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott, we seem to fundamentally differ here. I've explained my
</I>&gt;<i> rationale, but I don't see yours. So I'll restate mine:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency is my primary concern: You can't expect people who are not
</I>&gt;<i> interested in an issue to participate in the back-and-forth debate
</I>&gt;<i> that the proposal generation/refining process requires.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hold that voting and proposal generation/tuning must go hand-in-hand
</I>&gt;<i> and absolutely should not be separate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I totally disagree! ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A root problem with the status quo is that people are presented with a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal and asked to vote it up or down. In the U.S., we call this a
</I>&gt;<i> referendum, and it is horrible. The crafting of the proposal is where all
</I>&gt;<i> the actual decision-making happens (the devil is in the details), and
</I>&gt;<i> almost everyone is disenfranchised from that. And then when people are
</I>&gt;<i> asked to vote, they don't care, since they have so little influence on the
</I>&gt;<i> important parts of the matter: the details. A million vote for, a million
</I>&gt;<i> vote against: what does my input matter?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and I'm not making the argument that the proposals should be
</I>&gt;<i> handed down from on high, but only that they are developed by the
</I>&gt;<i> people who are interested in them and that we don't try to force all
</I>&gt;<i> of those who are not into this &quot;sausage making&quot; process.  Once they've
</I>&gt;<i> refined the proposal to a high degree, achieving the best possible
</I>&gt;<i> version of it, they can take it to the general population.  Who will
</I>&gt;<i> likely vote no on it (even in the best cases less than half of bills
</I>&gt;<i> pass in legislatures, most commonly because of resource allocation
</I>&gt;<i> issues).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm flexible on (and still researching) the proposal refinement
</I>&gt;<i> process, but tend to think that repeated voting is not an efficient
</I>&gt;<i> way to do it.  My current thinking is that people read a proposal then
</I>&gt;<i> post a pro or con statement about it, or maybe ask a question about.
</I>&gt;<i> Those statements themselves, and the answers to the questions, can
</I>&gt;<i> then be rated by people who don't know enough to make their own
</I>&gt;<i> statements.  *This* is where my sorting/filtering process comes in:
</I>&gt;<i> The raters can't be forced to wade through the entire list of
</I>&gt;<i> statements, the useless and offensive ones should either be filtered
</I>&gt;<i> out or sorted down toward the bottom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reviewing these comments the proposer could then modify the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to take this information into account and everyone who
</I>&gt;<i> commented on the previous version will get an invitation to review the
</I>&gt;<i> updated proposal.  If a war breaks out, forking the proposal should
</I>&gt;<i> also be an option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Voting *guides* proposal-tuning. It tells you what is getting buy-in and
</I>&gt;<i> what is not consensus-building. While proposals are being crafted, we might
</I>&gt;<i> come to a point where half are for and half are against. You suggest a
</I>&gt;<i> majority-rule forced vote. I say that's a horrible solution. What if
</I>&gt;<i> instead one person said: &quot;Wait a minute, I have a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> idea; hey everyone, see if this solves your issues better.&quot; A lot of those
</I>&gt;<i> alternates might fail, but some genius might come up with something that
</I>&gt;<i> gets almost everyone onboard. I say that is infinitely better than forcing
</I>&gt;<i> a majority rule. And it cannot be done unless the voting and
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making are mixed. You know you have an answer when the votes pile
</I>&gt;<i> up on one proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say that person will have the opportunity to suggest a change a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, or make their own, and the people who are interested in
</I>&gt;<i> knowledgeable in that area will help them refine it (or unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> blow it out of the water as being unworkable in some cases).  But
</I>&gt;<i> again, we can't allow this small group who is interested in the
</I>&gt;<i> subject area to make law unsupervised, nor can we expect the general
</I>&gt;<i> population to participate in every timeconsuming refinement process as
</I>&gt;<i> the alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not exactly clear on how to determine that a proposal is ready for
</I>&gt;<i> a general vote, and tend to think that this is an empirical question.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether it's that a certain time has elapsed, the debate has slowed,
</I>&gt;<i> the proposer thinks it's ready, or a sufficient percentage of the
</I>&gt;<i> affected individuals have weighed in an given it a sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> positive review, or maybe some combination of all of those things, I
</I>&gt;<i> just don't know yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the
</I>&gt;<i> lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to
</I>&gt;<i> force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not
</I>&gt;<i> for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the
</I>&gt;<i> people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, you disagree with the business rule that &quot;any decision is better
</I>&gt;<i> than no decision&quot;?  This has been proven 8 ways to Sunday in the
</I>&gt;<i> literature, and I get over 200K hits on Google for &quot;better than no
</I>&gt;<i> decision&quot; as it is an extremely popular article/blog topic.  Seems to
</I>&gt;<i> me you've got two choices here: Argue that business rules flat don't
</I>&gt;<i> apply to government or that the status quo is better than a narrow
</I>&gt;<i> majority which will at least guaranty change, change that will either
</I>&gt;<i> result in *some* progress or at least a change in perspective such
</I>&gt;<i> that the way forward may become apparent.  I'll take the contrary
</I>&gt;<i> position on either of these, and I like my odds  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
