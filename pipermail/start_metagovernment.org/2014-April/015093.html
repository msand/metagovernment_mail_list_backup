Time (and resources) we don't have unfortunately.  In defense of
filtering again (once more unto the breach!):

1) AI for analysis/sorting/filtering is not an option.  Even if we had
the resources to develop such a system it would almost certainly fail
to work properly (as all other public trials of these things have,
although I have to admit that Amazon's review system works pretty well
in the limited domain it has to function, although of course we don't
really know how much of that is some sort of &quot;Mechanical Turk&quot; kind of
trick). Even if we did build a system that worked, few people would
trust it (would *you* trust a machine to filter your feed for you?
People trust FB to do this, but IMHO that's only because it really
doesn't matter if it filters out something important because the
assumption is that there is very little in that category on FB ;-)

2) We will have moderators to handle technical problems and the worst
offenders (criminal acts), but don't have enough resources (especially
starting up) to rely on them to do any actual content filtering.

3) People are very good at identifying trolls and other problem users,
and they'll do it for free if we provide them the tools to do so.
Seems to me this is a tremendous opportunity to not only solve the
filtering problem itself, but also the resource limitations we face in
building a filtering system.

4) Banning problem users is not an option: This is their government
too and they have to be allowed to participate.  We just need a way to
apply social pressure to them to improve their behavior (pressures
that are constantly in place out in the real world but are lacking in
cyberspace), or, if that fails, a way to minimize their disruption
(i.e., making it so that people don't have to see or deal with their
posts unless they really want to).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Facebook for breaking news.
</I>
Yeah, FB may one day be useful and relevant.  I'm not holding my
breath (and I'm also not shorting their stock although I'm quite sure
that someone who knew what they were doing could make hundreds of
millions of dollars doing exactly that ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> And Facebook has to deal with 684,000 pieces of content posted every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minute to come up with legitimate news stories. That is much much more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complex then the problem you are dealing with.
</I>
Umm, there are billions of people on this earth who should be
participating in their government, and far more of them will log in
regularly to this system than FB (half of their members log in less
than once a week, and that's assuming you trust FB's self reports (and
I don't)).  Sure, there's a lot more useless stuff that FB has to
manage (more pictures of someone's food, yay!) but if we do this right
the scalability issues we will face will be even larger than what FB
is currently dealing with.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: As for building the system, I've been doing Rails tutorials for
the past few days and believe it is the best option for a development
environment at this point.  It is unfortunately an incredibly brittle
and baroque platform and it still boggles my mind that this is really
the best we CS types have come up with after all this time.  I still
lament that we live in a browser-based world because if I could just
build this as an app I'd have a working prototype available already.
Ah, to be able to go back to the late 70s and be in a position to
guide development to prevent this abomination from evolving the way it
has...
