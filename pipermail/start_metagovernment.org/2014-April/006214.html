<PRE>Hello!
     So I'm working with a number of my peers here at Evergreen College to
develop a web-resource that will enable anyone anywhere to begin
democratizing any space in physical or conceptual human reality. It's
actually a lot easier to show than it is to describe so we have a mock up
version of the site to make a lot of the details easier to see and
understand. We would love to show this to more people because any number of
these designs could help another really cool project succeed and we want to
gather more input from people in all kinds of positions, our only fear is
that someone might try copyrighting some of the content to eventually
prevent us from being able to use it.We would really like to know if anyone
can tell us if there's a safe way to share design concepts without them
being potentially legally usurped? None of us can tell if they're too
simple to officially patent, making the concern nul, or if we need to be
doing something to protect the communities right to use these designs. We
just want them to stay free to use for everyone you know?

Anywhoo, this project has a layout that's very reminiscent of how Votorola
laid out problems and solutions, but we've done some really nifty stuff in
terms of enabling users, and organizers, so we want to build this up and
move forward with getting it crowdfunded, programmed, and operational
online.

Does anyone want to see the walk through file? or have advice on sharing
content like this?

Thank you very much,
      Anthony B
