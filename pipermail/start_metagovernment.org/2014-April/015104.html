This is definitely an issue, but as it turns out not as big of one as
you'd think.

Research (Duckitt, 2009) shows, when an individual is faced with the
question of whether to obey a law, their weighting is as follows:
1 point for the risk of getting caught
5 points for the legitimacy of the authority who defined or is enforcing the law
15 points for whether they believe the law is moral

Your proposal is therefore operating in that 5 point range.  The 15
points is why drug and other prohibition laws are such dismal
failures, much to the chagrin of the authoritarians.  Which, again, is
the real problem we've got, not that people aren't participating
(although of course if *all* the Neurotypicals (i.e., the non-Social
Dominators and Authoritarians) participate, the resulting proposals
are far more likely to *also* be moral, but the key need is to reduce
the influence of the SDAs, not just increase that of the
Neurotypicals).

    Scott
