<PRE>I don't have any connection to valve other then liking them, and I think it
is a good real use case of an open like government that in practice is
working really really well. Millions of dollars well.  Something we can't
afford not to learn from.

I think that is why hiring is so important to them. I don't know if there
is a way to help people become more autonomous unless they want to be that
way. It just shows that getting the right people involved in the first
place is important. Otherwise the system wouldn't work as intended. It has
some &quot;system requirements&quot; that must be met in order to function properly.

I think you need to have both independently in a governance system. A
system that helps people become more autonomous and a system that requires
a level of autonomy to work within it. To be honest some people are just
not made to work in that type of environment(I am not a gifted
administrator. I will openly admit that), but that is okay. It is important
to help people find their strengths and put them in a position that both
uses and develops them. You need all types of people for all types of
problems. They could very well get to the level of autonomy required but it
really is up to them. There is no forcing them to increase.

I do wonder what they do other than have this pamphlet and say, &quot;And here,
we, Go!&quot;. That is sort of what they imply because they say that direct
assigned mentorship is not helpful to the system in their experience.
People get mentored I am sure, but that is because they find something they
can contribute to and somebody helps them out. I wish we could interview an
employee to get first hand experience. Maybe we could have someone
officially reach out to them? I bet they would be interested in a project
like Metagovernment and they are passionate about their system so they
might like the chance to show how it works.

Going back to your question of &quot;Do they have any concrete practices?&quot;. I
think that is more of an education(or maybe even culture) problem then it
is a problem with the governance model. I think it proves that making sure
people fit the requirements of the system is integral to it's working. It
probably sounds obvious, but it is easy to get into the &quot;we need to include
everybody&quot; mode and keep the system from working as intended and tie up
resources. It is very hard to hire people but it is even harder to fire
them. There is a spot for everyone in the culture/country/town and everyone
has room to develop and we should encourage that, but it doesn't mean
everyone was made to do every kind of task. I do want to mention I mean at
the leadership cogs and wheels level of administering the system. Not
necessarily that we should set up a system that we just do what the system
decides for us (ummmm.... i've been lurking on the MG mailing list for
years for a reason). I do think everyone needs to be able to participate in
the governance in anyway they can/want/are comfortable.

Anyway, when we do set up a governance of some sort I think it will be
critical to list system requirements of the people involved explicitly,
just like in their manual, so there is equal expectation from all sides.
When both people outside and inside have similar expectations it is my
experience they get a long a lot better. Miss-matched expectations lead to
disappointment, disappointments can lead to distrust, and so on... Until in
the extreme case there is a revolution of one party over the other where
expectations are readjusted, and the cycle continues. We can minimize the
cycle by starting off clear and creating a system to change those
expectations in a transparent way that has both sides involved.

It might seem trivial, but do we have a list somewhere of what kind of
people we need to run the systems we would like to implement?

As far as including more passive people. That just depends on how we define
the system. We don't need it to be like Valve. We just need to learn from
their successful implementation of a system when defining our own.

Open to question and criticism though.

Cheers,
James

P.S. I also like how they openly acknowledged the weaknesses in their
system. Instead of empirically stating that it is superior in all ways. It
is sort of ironic that acknowledging weaknesses and possible exploitation
is actually a way to mitigate it. From that definition you can actually
create systems within the system that do mitigate it, but if you don't
acknowledge it, you don't even know where to start. Faults is another point
that should be well defined about the system. We all know every system has
it's faults. We just need to own them and move forward anyway with an eye
on our backs.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I know just a bit about Enron.  I got sort of pitched for a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I suppose we all have at least a vague idea of how Enron turned
