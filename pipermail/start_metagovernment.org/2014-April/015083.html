If you filter based on political position *in general*.  But that
would make you prejudiced and so likely to be an authoritarian.  And
if you read my and Altemeyer's book you would know that allowing that
group to remove themselves from the process is a feature, not a bug:
they are irrational (or more accurately &quot;significantly more irrational
than Neurotypicals&quot;, since we all have this problem to one degree or
another) and generally contribute nothing to the debate unless maybe
the debate concerns why and how to commit genocide or other acts of
extreme prejudice, since they're the experts in that domain.

But Neurotypicals are *not* likely to do this, preferring instead to
use the system to filter out other types of problem posts.  And there
is lots of research to back up this claim.

&gt;<i> People would make decisions on the filtering level before they actually had

</I>&gt;<i> furthering ignorance on the topic
</I>
All of the above is a pretty good description of authoritarian
behavior.  Good Job!  Maybe we can use people's using the filtering
system that way as a filter!

&gt;<i> Finally, it sounds like you would want to filter out people entirely based
</I>&gt;<i> on one held opinion essentially saying, &quot;Because you believe this one thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Everything else you believe is invalid&quot;. That in psychology is called &quot;Black
</I>&gt;<i> and White Thinking&quot; and is labeled in the category of Thinking Errors.
</I>
Unfortunately filtering on political position, especially on a single
issue, is not what the system would do (or even allow, although now
that you bring it up I guess I could see how a third-party could use
the open data model to build a tool like that).  Again, maybe you
haven't spent time on these forums, but it is incredibly easy to spot
trolls and other problem participants, not by their political
persuasion (although there does seem to me a pretty high correlation
with authoritarianism) but by their tactics.  A good example is one of
the trolls my local paper's site that one of the editorial board
members asked me if my proposal would filter posts like his.  One of
the things he does is have &quot;canned screed&quot; that he posts whenever
certain issues come up (taxes, government regulation,
environmentalism, etc., you know the drill).  He even bragged to me
that the fact that he'd posted over 20,000 times to that forum doesn't
mean he wastes his whole life on it, instead had a &quot;system&quot; for
locating and copy/pasting his screed that made him very efficient!

Maybe it would help if I suggest some flags that maybe you might find
more acceptable to filter on.  Note that you'd probably not want to
set the threshold too low, but if maybe 1% of people had flagged
someone as having multiple posts with one or more of these traits you
might consider adding them to the filter, and certainly if 50% of
people had you would want to:

1) Flamer (particularly ad hominem attacks)

2) Contrarian (gives downvotes/1 star ratings more than twice as often
as upvotes/5 star ratings)

3) Polyanna (the inverse of 2)

4) Troll (screed designed to inflame or annoy rather than enlighten)

5) Mobster (lots of &quot;yeah, what he said&quot; posts).

6) Profane (every thread ends in an explosion of swearing)

7) Loose screw (posts that don't make sense or are internally inconsistent)

Any others?

I might want to keep 6 and 7 in my feed because they can be
entertaining, but have a very low tolerance for 1 and 4.  Others might
be the opposite.

I think I'd also like the option to easily turn filters on and off and
filter individuals.  Maybe a proposal is written such that half the
comments are from people who are one or more of the above, in which
case I'd know not to even bother analyzing it since it was obviously
written by a troll.  Or maybe one individual gets a little excited and
posts something snide after *every* other comment (I've seen it
happen) and I'd like to see what the conversation looks like without
that distraction.  I'd like option of keeping that person filtered if
I see this problem a lot, but maybe by default that filter would go
away at the end of the session if I didn't explicitly save it.  Or
again, if I want to filter out specific &quot;but the bible says&quot; people in
an abortion or separation of church and state proposal, I need to be
able to do that, at least temporarily.

Note that flags might also be used to *boost* the odds that you see a
post based on your preferences by putting them at the top or calling
them out in some fashion.  For that there might be *positive* flags
such as:

1) Linker (provides useful links to external sites)

2) Scientist (provides links to academic research)

3) Wordsmith (expresses a thought very efficiently and/or elegantly)

4) Shaper (makes good suggestions about how to improve a proposal)

5) Inquisitor (asks key questions that must be answered before a
proposal could be approved)

These are kind of derivative of the badges Stack Exchange uses, but
the tools are maybe a little sharper since the world we're working in
is a lot rougher than one where everybody is just trying to be helpful
as is (at least ostensibly) the motivation there.  I'd mostly be
interested in 2 and 5 in that second list and would want to see those
comments first.
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: &quot;Jake&quot; sounds like an interesting character: I'll bet if he set
his filters the way you describe he'd be *very happy* if he discovered
he wasn't the only person who felt that way ;-)
