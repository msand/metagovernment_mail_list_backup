As stated (repeatedly) in The Plan, competition is key to improvement.
 Standards are necessary in mature markets.  This isn't one of them.

&gt;<i> And as far as the plan goes. It would be very hard to iterate quick cycles
</I>&gt;<i> and build the thing with public/crowd source funding alone.
</I>
Oh ye of little faith!  One person can really do tremendous things,
let alone small groups.  Besides, once we get a little traction there
are huge resources out there to bring to bear on the issue, not just
FLOSS developers, but huge numbers of people playing around on Reddit
and Slashdot would love to participate in a forum where they were
actually involved in *deciding* things rather than just spouting off
in places where it really doesn't matter...

&gt;<i> In the end you
</I>&gt;<i> talk about how you could accelerate features faster and innovate at a
</I>&gt;<i> quicker pace than existing social networks because you would not be as tied
</I>&gt;<i> to the secrecy that those social networks require. They spend billions of
</I>&gt;<i> dollars on those things for a reason, It's not easy to innovate. It takes
</I>&gt;<i> smart people. and smart people are expensive.  And, yes they have to make
</I>&gt;<i> money on them because sustainability is impossible without income(time +
</I>&gt;<i> money). Who is going to host the servers? Process the Data? Pay the janitors
</I>&gt;<i> of the data centers?
</I>
These resources are actually much less expensive than you'd think.  By
the time server time and disk space become serious financial issues
the project will have &quot;crossed the chasm&quot; and funding will be much
less of an issue (think about how much slashdot gets from the ads it
shows just to you: Would you be willing to donate a few pennies to
replace that funding for a system you actually found to be useful in
replacing broken government?)

&gt;<i> Let's operate on the assumption that your idea is great and survives it's
</I>&gt;<i> kick-starter campaign to fruition and people start using it. What is the
</I>&gt;<i> plan for sustainability? I agree with the &quot;If you build it. They won't come&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> idea mentioned before. It will be a hard grind to get something working that
</I>&gt;<i> as you mention will have a lot of kickback from the authority/power at hand.
</I>
Yup, which is why generating a little &quot;siege mentality&quot; may be
necessary to carry the project forward from time to time.

&gt;<i> I also agree we should focus on finding people who want to use it. In small
</I>&gt;<i> communities or organization for example.
</I>
Agreed, particularly for the less controversial aspects of the problem
(taking on resource allocation/budgeting first rather than
redistribution issues).

&gt;<i> I think that a kickstarter to get money to have dedicated resources to find
</I>&gt;<i> and help the adoption of current systems in order to find out what works and
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't would be really effective. Although since it is not a product
</I>&gt;<i> kickstarter might not be the right platform. You get the idea though.
</I>
I've checked and it would qualify.  Again, I'm not proposing this for
right now and wouldn't expect anyone to fund something they can't
actually try out a fairly complete prototype of first (although
inexplicably to me they often do!)

(big snip about the war stuff, let's stick to the voting stuff on this
forum, and so please address comments about the rest of The Plan to
me).

&gt;<i> With the previous examples I don't mean to discourage your idea or your
</I>&gt;<i> passion. We need more of that. I just wanted to highlight the incredible
</I>&gt;<i> cost (time and money) your system would take. Something that doesn't show up
</I>&gt;<i> out of nowhere.
</I>
Right, but I think I have a handle on that.  This is not my first rodeo.

&gt;<i> Ed Pastore made a good point when he said he didn't have time to read a
</I>&gt;<i> whole book right now. Everyone has their own real lives they have to worry
</I>&gt;<i> about. We need the right people and the money to buy their time for this to
</I>&gt;<i> really work. Not to mention, someone who really wants to use it.
</I>
Again, I'm a zealot (worse, a retired software engineer zealot) so the
resource issues don't seem an obstacle to me.  And I still have faith
in the &quot;if you build it, they will come&quot; plan.  You all maybe just
haven't seen that because as yet nobody's built anything even
reasonably close to what is required.
  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> James
