<PRE>Nothing on Loomio?  Really?  Seems like this group is hibernating which 
means it's obviously time to shake things up a little.  Rather than put my 
bio here as promised, I'll instead refer you to my book (working title &quot;The 
Plan: A Design for an Engineered Civilization&quot;) which has that info (and 
much more) in it.  Get the current draft from my web site (and please mind 
the copyright notice: Until I get to beta-test please direct any comments to 
me rather this or any other forum.  I'll provide a summary to this list once 
input trails off):
<A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>

Tomorrow I'll also post the guts of the section on the voting and budgeting 
system to this list so that you all can review that without having to read 
the rest of the book.

I've read the archives (every post for the first year, sampled every thread 
since then and read every post in any thread related to my project) and 
believe I have some useful insights to share. Although this post is going to 
strike some of you as that of a troll, it's probably more useful to think of 
it as that of a zealot: &quot;I Have Seen the Light And Am Here To Share The Good 
News&quot; (and if you read the book you'll maybe come to appreciate my obsession 
with irony and how this is just one more example of it).

My goal here is not to drive people from this forum or the concept of 
e-democracy, but, to be blunt, you've had 6 years now without much to show 
for it and so it's time to &quot;defecate or abdicate&quot; (i.e., if even having this 
debate makes you uncomfortable maybe you're part of the problem rather than 
part of the solution).

So here are the problems I see.  If you're inspired to respond to any of 
these items, please put it in a message by itself and change the subject 
line.  Please nobody take this any of this as personal criticism or 
criticism of Ed as Fearless Leader: I believe all of your hearts are in the 
right place, now we just need to get your heads over there as well.

1) Ignoring the KISS rule

If you can't explain your idea in 30 seconds (the elevator speech), nobody's 
going to trust (or use) your system.  Reviewing all the projects I've seen 
lots of exquisitely baroque architectures that are simply nonviable because 
it takes too long to understand how they work.  This also means that in 
general they'll also take far to much time and effort (i.e., transactional 
costs) during operation.  So even if one of them somehow miraculously got 
fully implemented and then adopted by some organization, the participation 
rates would be so low as guarantee failure and possibly set back e-democracy 
projects by years or decades.

2) DSTSS: Authentication isn't an issue

People move billions of dollars around every day with a simple login and 
password, and are perfectly comfortable with systems that you don't even 
have to log into but once.  By the time one of these e-democracy systems is 
ready to actually take over operation of a government, people's attitudes 
will be even more relaxed and the technology for authentication even better. 
The ho-hum reaction to the recent Bleeding Heart exploit means that it's 
probably not even worth obsessively worrying about back-end hacks as long as 
data integrity can be maintained (or even reconstructed).  Compared with the 
risks we all face due to the delays this question is causing in implementing 
a system, authentication is so small an issue that even bringing it up 
almost looks to me like a ploy by people working to prevent e-democracy 
(blasphemers!)

3) Openness is a sufficient solution.

The verdict is already in: Given the choice between freedom and 
privacy/anonymity, freedom wins every time.  Full access to the raw data 
solves not only the security issues but is a useful social engineering tool 
to boot: If people are reluctant to use The System to *publicly* express 
their opinions, and/or are overly concerned with the security issues, we 
don't want them participating anyway (again, see my book for more on this).

4) You're working on the wrong problem

Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our 
representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob 
Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly 
zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems 
with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of 
representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer to 
serve in representative governments.  And those exact same people will screw 
up the operation of any e-democracy or &quot;collaborative government&quot; system too 
unless we design in ways to systematically constrain their ability to do so.

5) You're trying to solve it using inappropriate methods

Hey, everybody likes consensus.  It has that warm fuzzy feeling like clothes 
just out of the dryer!  But let's not kid ourselves: This issue has been 
researched to death and it simply is a non-starter for a functional 
e-democracy system.  I.e., if you haven't read &quot;Public Choice III&quot;, it is 
the 800 page &quot;bible&quot; of this field and while it is dryer than that laundry 
it leaves no room for doubt that simple majority rule is both necessary and 
sufficient as a general purpose decision-making system[*].  And that doesn't 
even account for the Social Dominator/Authoritarian/sociopath issues in my 
#4 (and which are the main theme of my book).  Our best hope here is to use 
social engineering techniques during the proposal-shaping phase to ensure 
that as many objections are addressed as possible because it is simply not 
practical to even *try* to eliminate all of them.

6) You've thwarted competition, our most powerful tool

Partly because of the consensus-based philosophy (see #5) there is a lot of 
time and mindshare being wasted on things like building connections to 
vaporware from other sources into your own vaporware.  Although I enjoy the 
irony of this being reminiscent of the design of &quot;soviets&quot; by the 
Bolsheviks, we out here in the real world are starving because of your lack 
of production!  Although a few testy words have been shared on the list from 
time to time, it seems to me almost pathological in its rejection of 
competition as a means of selecting the best solution to any given problem. 
This is not how good software is made and is not how good government will be 
made.  The best ideas need to be allowed to rise to the top (i.e., it's time 
for this collectivist approach, which didn't work for the communists either, 
to be replaced by a competitive environment where a single project will 
integrate the best ideas from all the others).

7) You're taking up mindshare and resources

I wouldn't be doing this if e-democracy projects had plenty of resources and 
mind-share.  But they don't, which means any of those things 
metagovernment.org is not using efficiently are being withheld from projects 
that would make better use of them (i.e., lead, follow, or get out of the 
way!)

8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation

If you read my book you'll come to see that I'm a zealot about capitalism 
too, but I am extremely disturbed by any of these projects that have even a 
*hint* that there is any goal of commercial exploitation of the technology 
being developed.  I nearly became apoplectic as I traced the 
whitehouse2/NationBuilder development.  Heresy!  We must cast out the False 
Prophet! (or is that False Profit?!?) NationBuilder is now not only not an 
e-democracy platform, it is actually designed to work *against* the whole 
concept by shoring up leadership-based government!  While it may be 
necessary to form a non-profit to enable crowdfunding to secure the 
resources we need to complete a functional tool, NationBuilder (and indeed 
Loomio) is a clear example of why any sort of commercial side-bet like this 
is a Really Bad Idea.

9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason

If we're really serious about this, we are all plotting to overthrow not 
only our own governments, but that of every other nation as well.  The more 
successful any of these projects are, the more clear this distinction is 
going to be.  If this isn't what you signed up for, maybe being a 
revolutionary is just not in your blood and you should instead cheer from 
the sidelines rather than mucking about out on the field of battle.  None of 
the people running our current representative government are even legally 
(constitutionally) *allowed* to support our efforts, and a significant 
percentage of them are genetically programmed to actively and perhaps even 
violently resist any type of government that does fit with their 
authoritarian world view.  This means that our best short-term *and* 
long-term strategy is to provide a competitive alternative to the 
traditional governments that people can turn to when their current 
governments aren't working.  Rather than whining to get people to support 
your petition drive or standing around in a park somewhere, we can provide a 
way for people to propose and refine budgets and new laws that they will 
install (perhaps via referendum at first, but by revolution eventually) to 
*override* their unresponsive representative government or replace it 
entirely.

You must believe religiously that e-democracy is inevitable and decide that 
you'd rather have it in 10 years than in 50 or you are simply denying 
yourself and everyone else the benefits that will accrue from getting it 
implemented.

You can start right now: Prove me wrong on any of the above (or indeed, in 
any of the points in my book) and you will actually be helping to clarify 
our goals and move the process along.  Oh, and another irony for you to 
contemplate: Six years later, and we still don't even have a prototype of a 
system where each of my points could be loaded into it and each of you given 
a chance to express your opinion, refine the position, or vote on them! 
Although that Loomio demo is extremely limited in functionality, it might be 
up to this task if anyone wants to get their hands dirty.
  Regards,
   Scott
