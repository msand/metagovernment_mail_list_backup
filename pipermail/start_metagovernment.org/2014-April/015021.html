<PRE>Their authoritative thought patterns could do nothing if they had no power
or money. The power and money allow their authoritative thoughts to come to
fruition. What we would need is someone who has power to give up that
power. Self preservation is in our nature. This isn't in just governance
but translates to any organization. That is why disruptive innovation is so
hard. Because the existing system fights for survival and puts into
practice things that cement their existence into the future. Not always a
bad thing either. If you don't have a plan for sustaining your idea/group
then it wouldn't be effective in change. It is just that not all of the
plans that exist end up being for the better of the people or for good in
general.

What we need is a George Washington. I don't mean that as pro american
plug, but at the end of the war the country asked him to be King. They
wanted the existing system, but he said no, so they had to figure out
something. That spawned the US in its strengths and faults. Then he
willfully left office and passed it on. We need people like that. Then we
need the money to hire the right people to create the system. Then we need
the people who actually want to use the system.

The problem is that a &quot;George Washington&quot; would find it very hard to get
into a position to where he could transfer his power. Since he wouldn't
play by the rules at large he probably wouldn't get elected, and even if he
was. Everyone else is there to see the existing system flourish. Disruption
is difficult.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> No term limits. Contribution caps. No contribution caps. And so on. Not

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which gets us back to the &quot;treason&quot; issue ;-)  Furthermore it's
</I>&gt;<i> another nail in the &quot;consensus&quot; coffin: If you can't even use the new
</I>&gt;<i> system to make the decision to overthrow the old one, what use is it,
</I>&gt;<i> really?  And that's only the first hurdle: If you don't
</I>&gt;<i> *systematically* constrain the behavior of this group (and you've
</I>&gt;<i> characterized them as &quot;the powerful&quot;, but IMHO the problem isn't their
</I>&gt;<i> power or their money, it's their authoritarian thought patterns) your
</I>&gt;<i> new system will break down just as our current one has.  And I note
</I>&gt;<i> that your post, and all of the others I've read, never really
</I>&gt;<i> addresses this problem.  Worse, there are a lot of inconsistencies in
</I>&gt;<i> the platform.  For example the &quot;elevator pitch&quot; contains both the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote&quot; and the word &quot;consensus&quot; whereas IMHO those are incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> processes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To some extent the question of whether a consensus decision rule will
</I>&gt;<i> work is an empirical one, all we have to do is implement one and then
</I>&gt;<i> turn the people lose on it to see if they can establish policy on
</I>&gt;<i> abortion, immigration, income redistribution, etc.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> researchers in this field have reached &quot;consensus&quot; that it won't work,
</I>&gt;<i> and I think you'll agree if you're honest with yourselves that you
</I>&gt;<i> already *know* it won't.  Which means the word &quot;consensus&quot; needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the Metagovernment platform to be replaced by something
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;egalitarian&quot; or &quot;participatory&quot; or some other term that
</I>&gt;<i> indicates that everyone's preferences and objections will be heard but
</I>&gt;<i> that some sort of majority-rule will be used to make the final
</I>&gt;<i> decision.  And as I said before (and go into some detail in my book),
</I>&gt;<i> I've no problem with using social engineering to support tweaking the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal with the goal of achieving large supermajorities in these
</I>&gt;<i> votes, but that must be a separate process and system from the actual
</I>&gt;<i> voting.
