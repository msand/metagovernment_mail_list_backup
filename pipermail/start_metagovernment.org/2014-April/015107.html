&gt;<i> Scott, we seem to fundamentally differ here. I've explained my rationale, but I don't see yours. So I'll restate mine:
</I>
Efficiency is my primary concern: You can't expect people who are not
interested in an issue to participate in the back-and-forth debate
that the proposal generation/refining process requires.

&gt;<i> I hold that voting and proposal generation/tuning must go hand-in-hand and absolutely should not be separate.
</I>
And I totally disagree! ;-)

&gt;<i> A root problem with the status quo is that people are presented with a proposal and asked to vote it up or down. In the U.S., we call this a referendum, and it is horrible. The crafting of the proposal is where all the actual decision-making happens (the devil is in the details), and almost everyone is disenfranchised from that. And then when people are asked to vote, they don't care, since they have so little influence on the important parts of the matter: the details. A million vote for, a million vote against: what does my input matter?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Right, and I'm not making the argument that the proposals should be
handed down from on high, but only that they are developed by the
people who are interested in them and that we don't try to force all
of those who are not into this &quot;sausage making&quot; process.  Once they've
refined the proposal to a high degree, achieving the best possible
version of it, they can take it to the general population.  Who will
likely vote no on it (even in the best cases less than half of bills
pass in legislatures, most commonly because of resource allocation
issues).

I'm flexible on (and still researching) the proposal refinement
process, but tend to think that repeated voting is not an efficient
way to do it.  My current thinking is that people read a proposal then
post a pro or con statement about it, or maybe ask a question about.
Those statements themselves, and the answers to the questions, can
then be rated by people who don't know enough to make their own
statements.  *This* is where my sorting/filtering process comes in:
The raters can't be forced to wade through the entire list of
statements, the useless and offensive ones should either be filtered
out or sorted down toward the bottom.

After reviewing these comments the proposer could then modify the
proposal to take this information into account and everyone who
commented on the previous version will get an invitation to review the
updated proposal.  If a war breaks out, forking the proposal should
also be an option.

&gt;<i> Voting *guides* proposal-tuning. It tells you what is getting buy-in and what is not consensus-building. While proposals are being crafted, we might come to a point where half are for and half are against. You suggest a majority-rule forced vote. I say that's a horrible solution. What if instead one person said: &quot;Wait a minute, I have a completely different idea; hey everyone, see if this solves your issues better.&quot; A lot of those alternates might fail, but some genius might come up with something that gets almost everyone onboard. I say that is infinitely better than forcing a majority rule. And it cannot be done unless the voting and decision-making are mixed. You know you have an answer when the votes pile up on one proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I say that person will have the opportunity to suggest a change a
proposal, or make their own, and the people who are interested in
knowledgeable in that area will help them refine it (or unfortunately
blow it out of the water as being unworkable in some cases).  But
again, we can't allow this small group who is interested in the
subject area to make law unsupervised, nor can we expect the general
population to participate in every timeconsuming refinement process as
the alternative.

I'm not exactly clear on how to determine that a proposal is ready for
a general vote, and tend to think that this is an empirical question.
Whether it's that a certain time has elapsed, the debate has slowed,
the proposer thinks it's ready, or a sufficient percentage of the
affected individuals have weighed in an given it a sufficiently
positive review, or maybe some combination of all of those things, I
just don't know yet.

&gt;<i> And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.
</I>
So, you disagree with the business rule that &quot;any decision is better
than no decision&quot;?  This has been proven 8 ways to Sunday in the
literature, and I get over 200K hits on Google for &quot;better than no
decision&quot; as it is an extremely popular article/blog topic.  Seems to
me you've got two choices here: Argue that business rules flat don't
apply to government or that the status quo is better than a narrow
majority which will at least guaranty change, change that will either
result in *some* progress or at least a change in perspective such
that the way forward may become apparent.  I'll take the contrary
position on either of these, and I like my odds  ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
