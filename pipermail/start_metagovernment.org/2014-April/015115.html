<PRE>I think Ed's version explicitly wouldn't allow this to happen.

&quot;
Worse, you'll
get groups of authoritarians banding together to install prohibitions
on everything from gay marriage to alcohol consumption to immigration
of the minority-du-jour by passing laws when people aren't paying
attention.  And then you suggest that that is still a morally-binding
decision because I had the chance to get up at 4am and register my
disapproval during one of their all-night-Puritan sessions where they
even achieved that mystical magical &quot;consensus&quot; among themselves.  No
thanks.
&quot;

But in your system it could. Who decides who gets to decide? Once there is
a small group, who says they won't be influenced by power or money from
someone else. There is a lot of money floating around these days to
influence politics. I don't think we should count on people being 100%
honest. That is why they tried to put checks and balances. Your assuming
your morals and choices are right. Which I admit, everyone thinks that, so
it isn't surprising. Your wouldn't believe something if you didn't actually
believe it. The system its' self needs to be belief agnostic however. Not
serve to perpetuate your beliefs. Even if they end up being right.

You may argue your system wouldn't allow this, so I ask what is your system
for deciding who can make decisions and who can't? How are you going to
fight corruption of that system?

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But there are billions and billions of decisions to be made throughout
</I>&gt;<i> the fullness of society at every level of organization. So we can:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. vastly limit the number of people who are allowed to make any
</I>&gt;<i> decisions (representative democracy; republics; monarchies; etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. pick a few major issues and ask everybody in a jurisdiction to vote
</I>&gt;<i> on them (referenda)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. open up every single decision and let every single person participate
</I>&gt;<i> (collaborative governance)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In #3, the result will probably look quite similar to #1: only a few
</I>&gt;<i> people will actually be involved in any decision or in the development of
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal to be decided on. But it's completely different in that the
</I>&gt;<i> group of deciders is self-defined and that anyone who wants to can jump in
</I>&gt;<i> at any time and affect the proposal and the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we agree on everything up to this point.  I'm perfectly happy
</I>&gt;<i> with an oligarchy and yet am not proposing that there be any
</I>&gt;<i> *external* constraints on anyone participating.  But some will
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the proposal generation phase more than others due to
</I>&gt;<i> *internal* constraints (lack of time, lack of knowledge about a
</I>&gt;<i> particular domain, lack of facility with writing or debating, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I put forth (with admittedly no evidence at hand) that this radically
</I>&gt;<i> changes the decision-calculus you describe below. Because the authority of
</I>&gt;<i> the decider is highly valid and the morality of the decision is
</I>&gt;<i> significantly elevated... for every single one of those billions of
</I>&gt;<i> decisions. Simply because the process by which the decisions were reached
</I>&gt;<i> is completely different. It is a process that is inherently authoritative
</I>&gt;<i> and moral, because nobody was excluded in the development of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's where we part paths: It looks to me that you're fine that in
</I>&gt;<i> some cases 10% of the population will be able to make a decision
</I>&gt;<i> binding the rest of the population unless that 90% actually gets their
</I>&gt;<i> hands dirty early on in each proposal process.  I don't agree, and I
</I>&gt;<i> *especially* don't agree when resource allocation is part of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal (and it almost always is).  If you don't &quot;call them up for a
</I>&gt;<i> vote&quot;, at least to address the resource issues, you're going to end up
</I>&gt;<i> with every piddling proposal spending 20% of the overall budget
</I>&gt;<i> because nobody has time to keep track of of them all.  Worse, you'll
</I>&gt;<i> get groups of authoritarians banding together to install prohibitions
</I>&gt;<i> on everything from gay marriage to alcohol consumption to immigration
</I>&gt;<i> of the minority-du-jour by passing laws when people aren't paying
</I>&gt;<i> attention.  And then you suggest that that is still a morally-binding
</I>&gt;<i> decision because I had the chance to get up at 4am and register my
</I>&gt;<i> disapproval during one of their all-night-Puritan sessions where they
</I>&gt;<i> even achieved that mystical magical &quot;consensus&quot; among themselves.  No
</I>&gt;<i> thanks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you actually look at the data, the number of legislative decisions
</I>&gt;<i> that actually need to be made is pretty manageable.  For example, the
</I>&gt;<i> US congress only passed about 30 bills last year, and a good chunk of
</I>&gt;<i> them were non-controversial things like renaming buildings or
</I>&gt;<i> proclaiming &quot;national unicycle day&quot;.  Similar numbers of bills are
</I>&gt;<i> passed at the state and local levels (at least here in Colorado: I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't looked elsewhere).  This works out to 2 or 3 decisions (on the
</I>&gt;<i> order of referenda, but hopefully smaller and more concisely written)
</I>&gt;<i> a week.  I think we can count on people to do that if it only takes
</I>&gt;<i> them half an hour because the information is presented to them with
</I>&gt;<i> extremely high efficiency (which is possible only due to the
</I>&gt;<i> crowd-sourced winnowing).  But there were 7000 bills introduced in the
</I>&gt;<i> Colorado legislature last year, most of which were proposed by one
</I>&gt;<i> small special interest group or another.  Who has time to even read
</I>&gt;<i> that many proposals let alone come up with an informed opinion on
</I>&gt;<i> every one of them?  Apparently not even the Colorado state legislature
</I>&gt;<i> because some them got passed apparently without *anyone* having read
</I>&gt;<i> every word in them and screening out the pork and nonsensical
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, again, I say refining the proposal and voting to approve must be
</I>&gt;<i> separate processes for (at least) 3 reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) It's the most efficient use of everyone's time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's the only way to ensure the Neurotypicals will override the
</I>&gt;<i> SDAs (10-30% of the population, depending on where you draw the line).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) it is necessary to ensure the votes are morally binding because a
</I>&gt;<i> majority *of the population* actually voted to approve.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I prefer doing this by email where everybody has equal access and
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity.  I've used &quot;collaborative&quot; environments like Google Docs
</I>&gt;<i> and don't agree that they're a better method of debate.  In my
</I>&gt;<i> experience you end up with SDAs, who by their nature have no
</I>&gt;<i> compunction about jumping in and rewriting other people's stuff,
</I>&gt;<i> making all of the decisions because the Neurotypicals are afraid to
</I>&gt;<i> stand up to them in these contexts.  That may look like &quot;consensus&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's not (again, back to that &quot;solving the wrong problem&quot; thing).
