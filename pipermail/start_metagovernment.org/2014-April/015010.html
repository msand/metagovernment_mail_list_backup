&gt;<i> Given that, the question is always, what can we do to fix the system? That's a great one, because everyone has an answer for that. Term limits. No term limits. Contribution caps. No contribution caps. And so on. Not only does every solution sound minor and ineffectual... but every solution is always required to be passed by the very people in power. And every now and then those people do pass a law... and for some reason it doesn't fix anything. Because those people make sure it won't ruin their chokehold on power. Of course.

Which gets us back to the &quot;treason&quot; issue ;-)  Furthermore it's
another nail in the &quot;consensus&quot; coffin: If you can't even use the new
system to make the decision to overthrow the old one, what use is it,
really?  And that's only the first hurdle: If you don't
*systematically* constrain the behavior of this group (and you've
characterized them as &quot;the powerful&quot;, but IMHO the problem isn't their
power or their money, it's their authoritarian thought patterns) your
new system will break down just as our current one has.  And I note
that your post, and all of the others I've read, never really
addresses this problem.  Worse, there are a lot of inconsistencies in
the platform.  For example the &quot;elevator pitch&quot; contains both the word
&quot;vote&quot; and the word &quot;consensus&quot; whereas IMHO those are incompatible
processes.

To some extent the question of whether a consensus decision rule will
work is an empirical one, all we have to do is implement one and then
turn the people lose on it to see if they can establish policy on
abortion, immigration, income redistribution, etc.  But the
researchers in this field have reached &quot;consensus&quot; that it won't work,
and I think you'll agree if you're honest with yourselves that you
already *know* it won't.  Which means the word &quot;consensus&quot; needs to be
removed from the Metagovernment platform to be replaced by something
like &quot;egalitarian&quot; or &quot;participatory&quot; or some other term that
indicates that everyone's preferences and objections will be heard but
that some sort of majority-rule will be used to make the final
decision.  And as I said before (and go into some detail in my book),
I've no problem with using social engineering to support tweaking the
proposal with the goal of achieving large supermajorities in these
votes, but that must be a separate process and system from the actual
voting.
  Regards,
    Scott
