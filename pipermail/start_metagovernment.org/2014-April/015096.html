I like this idea because it will keep the community at a higher standard
(like valve does. It has system requirements) while curbing bad behavior (
notice: not beliefs ) clear expectations lead to greater understanding

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> *Summary*
</I>&gt;<i> Your first statement is actually conflicting with your later statement
</I>&gt;<i> because you admit it would allow you to filter based on beliefs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Temporarily filtering to see one side of an issue is actually a UI feature
</I>&gt;<i> as long as the user explicitly does it and the system does not. When the
</I>&gt;<i> system is doing things automatically is where you run into the problems I
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned. But there are better ways you could do that for example having
</I>&gt;<i> each side of the argument side by side. I think you should think bigger
</I>&gt;<i> than it just being a forum/comment like user interface. There is so much
</I>&gt;<i> more room to innovate. As you said we have bigger fish to fry and to fry
</I>&gt;<i> bigger fish your going to need a bigger fire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, I think you missed the point about Jake. I could have split each
</I>&gt;<i> belief in to just one person and negative effects would still have applied
</I>&gt;<i> to each person.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I guess we can agree that filtering should be about behavior and not
</I>&gt;<i> beliefs. But, then you go on to say that you would filter based on a
</I>&gt;<i> belief... which means the system would allow that? But you said it wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> right in the beginning? How would you differentiate your filtering of a
</I>&gt;<i> belief from someone else's filtering of beliefs in the system? Would you
</I>&gt;<i> filter the belief based on the users beliefs? It gets hairy very quickly.
</I>&gt;<i> All of my examples would then apply to said system. I would keep shy from
</I>&gt;<i> filtering beliefs at all to keep from the negative consequences that it
</I>&gt;<i> would allow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I like the more details on the proposal. Your example of temporary
</I>&gt;<i> filtering is in fact a UI feature compared to a system feature, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't hit save and effect other parts of the system. I am fine with
</I>&gt;<i> that because it would be in fact useful to view the posts based on topics
</I>&gt;<i> so you could be further informed on each side. But there is a different
</I>&gt;<i> between you explicitly doing it your self compared to the system
</I>&gt;<i> automatically doing it for you. The later is when you run into trouble.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now we just need to find a way to test that your filtering
</I>&gt;<i>
