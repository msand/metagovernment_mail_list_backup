I'll go along with that, and it's not really even a &quot;euphemism&quot; (i.e.,
this is a feature, not a bug).  So along with &quot;treason&quot;, we've got to
become comfortable with the concept that social controls on behavior
are a necessary component of The System, just as they are out here in
the real world (i.e., there are &quot;idiots&quot; who try to cut in lines, talk
on their phones in theaters (or yelling &quot;Fire&quot;, ha!), and a wide
variety of other things we've collectively decided are not acceptable,
and it is not &quot;removing free speech&quot; to use whatever social-conformity
tools we have available to restrict them from doing these things).
  Regards,
    Scott
