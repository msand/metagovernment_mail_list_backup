<PRE>I've talked with Youtube about how they manage their flag system and this
is one example of flag gone wrong. (warning it might not be a popular
example due to it pertaining to relgion but I think it illustrates the
point)

The Mormon church produced a video about the Book of Mormon. Anti-mormon
users of Youtube mass down-thumbed it and labeled it as inappropriate.
Youtube then auto flagged it as being over 18 required material so you had
to sign in and have a birthday above a certain point to view the video.
Even if you aren't religious you can see the problem. Imagine what would
have happened to Martin Luther King's Speech if it was uploaded to Youtube
at the time he gave it. &quot;click, unsupported&quot; &quot;click, unsupported&quot; &quot;click,
unsupported&quot;

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> ___________
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott Raney,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I haven't seen or thought of any reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative.  Unless the system has a way to filter the information
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presented to each user, I claim that it is unworkable because it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem.  Anyone disagree?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several other methods being worked on to discourage trolls.
</I>&gt;<i> Stackexchange has made some progress by creating clear and specific
</I>&gt;<i> community. The National Communication Association has been researching this
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.">http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.</A> Many people are
</I>&gt;<i> working on it from several different angles. The SettleIt.org design
</I>&gt;<i> reduces the cognitive load of any single interaction by isolating it so you
</I>&gt;<i> only need to consider a single statement at a time which also allows us to
</I>&gt;<i> divide up the work among multiple people. This allows for the time and
</I>&gt;<i> effort you mentioned in other options of reducing trolls.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;OK, so every SettleIt debate has the option of including a branch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which will settle the issue of whether the Bible is true ;-)  Maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now you can see why filtering is a good strategy?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, many of the statements will include a debate on the Bible. I don't
</I>&gt;<i> see how that justifies filtering it out. In SettleIt.org you would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to have the same branch in multiple areas so as that debate is worked out
</I>&gt;<i> it will automatically be updated in all the other affected areas. To
</I>&gt;<i> dismiss someone's concern is to exclude them (and yourself) from the debate
</I>&gt;<i> which defeats the purpose of the system which is to build agreement. To
</I>&gt;<i> allow an individual to filter what they see builds bias into the system
</I>&gt;<i> further separating people into polar groups which again defeats the main
</I>&gt;<i> purpose. Since SettleIt.org is a tree structure you just need to see the
</I>&gt;<i> statement once in each affected context and you can decide to expand that
</I>&gt;<i> statement to see the debate. Otherwise it is very small a distraction which
</I>&gt;<i> provides value in understanding the concerns of the group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I'm not denying any of them their right to free speech,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It's not a free speech issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Some people are just going to have to go along with what the majority
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or supermajority) prefer.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although that statement is true, in many debates you can not reach even a
</I>&gt;<i> simple majority because many people are dismissing concerns of the others
</I>&gt;<i> and refusing to debate the topics. I don't see why you would discourage
</I>&gt;<i> efforts to increase the level of agreement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flags it that way.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A simple flag is also another vector for the trolls. I see many situations
</I>&gt;<i> where this is used to remove unpopular ideas that otherwise could provide
</I>&gt;<i> value. I believe it would be better in the long run to encourage debating
</I>&gt;<i> each idea once rather than ignore it many times.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;length issue&quot;. Are you concerned about the
</I>&gt;<i> length of the troll's comments or the fact that SettleIt.org has a limited
</I>&gt;<i> statement length.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
