<PRE>Scott Raney,

The point of the examples were to show that others are working the issue
that you were not aware of. To say you know for a fact that there are no
other options is arrogant and distracts others from innovating in that area.

&quot;the *number* of statements that could become overwhelming with trolls
&gt;<i> posting a zillion slightly altered versions of a statement in an attempt
</I>&gt;<i> to overwhelm any statement they disagree with&quot;
</I>

With the limited length of a statement in SettleIt.org it's quite easy for
the system to identify that behavior and mitigate against it. Also, due to
it's design a standard user would not need to enter a lot of statements at
one time so there can be a low cap on the frequency that one person could
enter statements.

It my efforts I have been able to work with many people that appear to be
trolls at the start. There are exceptions but by in large communication
skills can overcome most trollish behavior. You appear to use several
communication styles that would encourage trollish behavior that may be
reducing your effectiveness.

&quot;But these are empirical questions and ones I'm assuming we're have to do
&gt;<i> the research and answer ourselves&quot;
</I>
I'm glad to hear you are open to testing. Let us know how you would like to
proceed and people from this list may participate.

Regards,
Bentley
