<PRE>&quot;Concerning the failure of this group to adequately facilitate
participation... I and many others agree. It is a criticism that has been
raised here many times. And many have proposed various solutions. But
nobody has implemented one. In the spirit of adhocracy... you are welcome
to do so. Anyone is! Please do. Or try to get others to. I will help as I
can, but my time is unbearably limited right now.&quot;

I actually could help out. I am not exactly sure what I can do, but one
thing I do have right now is time.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to reiterate my request for an elevator pitch. Your approach in
</I>&gt;<i> your first message was, effectively, to list a bunch of criticisms of this
</I>&gt;<i> group, and then direct us to all read your book. That's not fair, as it
</I>&gt;<i> places a heavy burden on the audience. You should be able to summarize your
</I>&gt;<i> book in a minute. It won't get across many of the deeper explanations or
</I>&gt;<i> even major parts, but you can certainly get across the main message. And I
</I>&gt;<i> am under no illusion that that is easy. It took me a long time to write the
</I>&gt;<i> short little elevator pitch for Metagov. The shorter something is, the
</I>&gt;<i> harder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (There's a deeper lesson there, too... there is something to be said for
</I>&gt;<i> text limits, as anything that can be said with a ton of text can often be
</I>&gt;<i> said with very little text and very much thought.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the failure of this group to adequately facilitate
</I>&gt;<i> participation... I and many others agree. It is a criticism that has been
</I>&gt;<i> raised here many times. And many have proposed various solutions. But
</I>&gt;<i> nobody has implemented one. In the spirit of adhocracy... you are welcome

</I>&gt;<i> can, but my time is unbearably limited right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the definition of consensus; you're right that that should
</I>&gt;<i> likely be changed. The wiki is a wiki. It can be changed by whomever is
</I>&gt;<i> willing to do so. The only hard rules we have are that the home page and
</I>&gt;<i> the Basic Principles pages need buy-in from the group before they are
</I>&gt;<i> changed. There is also debate here about consensus, which is why I chose
</I>&gt;<i> the subject line here. Blinap is a pure consensus model, as I understand
</I>&gt;<i> it. Votorola promotes consensus by not having a set decision-rule. All
</I>&gt;<i> projects are aimed at building consensus... even if some don't expect to
</I>&gt;<i> reach unanimity. There's nothing wrong with striving toward perfection. So
</I>&gt;<i> consensus is the most accurate word to describe what most of us are
</I>&gt;<i> striving for. &quot;Supermajority&quot; does not have nearly as much buy-in among the
</I>&gt;<i> projects. So if you want to replace &quot;consensus,&quot; I would ask that you
</I>&gt;<i> propose another word. And perhaps propose a system to use for deciding the
</I>&gt;<i> word. Vilfredo works well for this sort of process of... building
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. ;) Perhaps post it here?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for confounding proposal crafting with voting, I think they can and
</I>&gt;<i> should be mixed. Look deeper at Votorola... it takes a long time to
</I>&gt;<i> understand it fully, but once you do, you may see how effective it is at
</I>&gt;<i> blending these two. Actually, Vilfredo does as well though by entirely
</I>&gt;<i> different means. Both use voting as the means of proposal-tuning. It is
</I>&gt;<i> really quite effective. You know when voting is done when everyone has
</I>&gt;<i> voted for the same thing. If they haven't, then you can compare disparate
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, see who voted for what, discuss, and propose something new to
</I>&gt;<i> try to capture all the votes.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thanks again for the spirited debate, Scott. I disagree with you a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you don't mind, I believe it helps us all find the weak points
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in our positions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Your first criticism of this group was that we need to KISS: that
</I>&gt;<i> things should be able to be presented in 30 seconds. Now you're saying I
</I>&gt;<i> need to read a book to be able to refute you?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Umm, different rules for different audiences.  You need to follow the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; KISS rule when explaining a system to somebody unfamiliar with this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; domain, but you'd better come fully armed if you're going to try to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change the opinion of any of us who happen to know a little about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Further, the conclusion is specious. How does my sentence support
</I>&gt;<i> majority rule? Are you claiming that the majority in fact do read volumes
</I>&gt;<i> before voting? I propose the opposite conclusion: a well-crafted consensus
</I>&gt;<i> system corrects for the ignorance of the majority by empowering the
</I>&gt;<i> minority to provide sane input into decisions that could otherwise be
</I>&gt;<i> overwhelmed by the ignorance of &quot;the masses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nope, the way to do that is to prevent the &quot;ignorant masses&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disrupting the crafting of the proposal that will be voted on.  This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is a different process from the one where they get to vote on it, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as described in my book the actual voting process should include the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; text of the proposal as well as the best crafted pro and con arguments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (just like the most helpful positive and negative reviews as shown on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Amazon, and what comes in the Blue Book (voter's guide) in many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; counties (and that few people read because it's not nearly as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; convenient as it will be in an e-democracy system)).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting
</I>&gt;<i> until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; And in the mean time?  No government at all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; No hasty decisions, yes! What good is a decision that sucks for half
</I>&gt;<i> the people? Why should we rush to the wrong decision? Unless there is an
</I>&gt;<i> army about to invade or a giant meteor about to strike, do we really need
</I>&gt;<i> to rush governance? We are no where near the level of invading armies or
</I>&gt;<i> world-saving governance, so I don't see any need for hasty decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> here. Especially if it leads to awful results.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Again, you're confounding the proposal generation/tuning phase with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the actual vote.  They must be two separate steps in the process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Your argument, and this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; group's failure to produce a &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule (let
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; alone even a usable prototype) in 6 years is the proof we've been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; looking for *in itself* that a consensus-based decision rule is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; non-viable.  Don't you just love the irony of it all?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We do have a decision rule, which was developed quickly using Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> as the mechanism to reach consensus on it. It is at:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Recently, I got into a debate with one other person who disputed that
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule. He hasn't defended his position recently, so it looks like
</I>&gt;<i> the above stands for now. That decision rule was made about two years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> See
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-May/003898.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for part of the development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ah, I hadn't seen those, and thanks for pointing it out. Seems the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem here is that we disagree about the definition of the word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;consensus&quot;.  Webster.com says: &quot;general agreement :  unanimity&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is what I take it to mean.  My dad (a social psychologist) had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same reaction after he asked me last week what I was working on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I sent him a link to the metagovernment site.  He asked me if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; were serious about &quot;consensus&quot; as he considered that an impossible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; goal. To be blunt, I thought sounded kind of flaky the first time I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; saw it too.  And it's clearly not even what you mean: In your example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; above the &quot;consensus&quot; of 6 people (out of 150 or so on this list)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defined &quot;consensus&quot; to mean a two-thirds majority.  Which is actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a pretty low standard for a small and relatively homogeneous group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like this one.  It might even work for the general population,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; although I consider this to be an empirical question that we won't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to answer until we get a good proposal-generation system working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and see how much that increases supermajorities (I'm predicting it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will have quite a large effect because in my experience referendums
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are pretty poorly written and many of them pass by supermajorities
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyway).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So where are we disagreeing? I already said I'm defining consensus not
</I>&gt;<i> as unanimity, but rather large supermajority. Again, refer to the decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule page above.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As above, we're disagreeing on the definition of &quot;consensus&quot; and I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; propose that we remove that term from the metagovernment site and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replace it with &quot;supermajority&quot; or something that doesn't set off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people's BS detectors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; But again *requiring* this is an argument for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; the status quo which I'm sure we all agree is not acceptable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't understand this statement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Requiring &quot;consensus&quot; (at least the common usage of the term) is a way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to ensure the status quo will never be overturned.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (snip)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Early in the development of this group, it was the consensus (in this
</I>&gt;<i> case unanimous) that we not have formal governance and rather work as
</I>&gt;<i> adhocracy. Later on, through consensus (again unanimous), we adopted the
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule above. How does consensus not work, and how is it not working
</I>&gt;<i> here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mostly I'd say it's not working because you've got 150 people on this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; list, only a handful of whom have expressed an opinion.   Now if you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had a voting system that people could just pop into, make a vote, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then go back to lurking I think you'd see much higher levels of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participation.  Even better, getting their hands dirty with an actual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working system would help the lurkers get a handle on what it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they'd like and not like to see in a functioning e-democracy as it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; probably all just a bunch of handwaving to most of them at this point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They want to understand and many of them probably want to help, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there's just not enough infrastructure in their minds at this point to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When I look up consensus decision-making on Wikipedia, I see a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> description of different models, how they operate, and how they have been
</I>&gt;<i> used through history.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I don't see much about how it is provably unworkable. I think the
</I>&gt;<i> Quakers would disagree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Quakers aren't a good example, both because it is a much more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; homogeneous group than the general population and because of the huge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; amount of effort they are willing to expend to achieve their goals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that wikipedia page includes simple majority as one of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision rules, in which case the US is a consensus-based government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (ha!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As I said, pending some experimentation, I'm probably fine with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; two-thirds decision rule, and although he doesn't come out and say it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere that I recall, Mueller and the other public choice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; researchers I think would also be on board with it as well because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's a high enough standard that it dampens out almost all cyclic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior (which is his big concern with the simple majority rule).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; What is your elevator pitch, Scott?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, I'm going to need several of those since the book (and The Plan)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; isn't just about one or two things.  But I'm actually more a &quot;working
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prototype&quot; kind of guy anyway: I'd rather show somebody how something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; works than tell them because I find that to be a much more effective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; educational tool.  I've started looking around at development
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environments and am not really liking anything I've seen so far: I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; burned out and retired about 10 years ago and haven't written a line
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of code since then, but I'm finding my mojo has recovered a bit and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think I'm probably up for another project if I can find (or make) a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development environment that won't frustrate me...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Scott
