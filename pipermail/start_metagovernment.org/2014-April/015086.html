<PRE>I founded an updated source on the content Facebook has to deal with.
<A HREF="http://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-2">http://www.domo.com/learn/data-never-sleeps-2</A>

Apparently it is now 2,460,000 pieces of content a minute it has to wade
through.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *Summary*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your first statement is actually conflicting with your later statement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because you admit it would allow you to filter based on beliefs.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Temporarily filtering to see one side of an issue is actually a UI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feature as long as the user explicitly does it and the system does not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> When the system is doing things automatically is where you run into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems I mentioned. But there are better ways you could do that for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example having each side of the argument side by side. I think you should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think bigger than it just being a forum/comment like user interface. There
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is so much more room to innovate. As you said we have bigger fish to fry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and to fry bigger fish your going to need a bigger fire.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And, I think you missed the point about Jake. I could have split each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> belief in to just one person and negative effects would still have applied
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to each person.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, I guess we can agree that filtering should be about behavior and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beliefs. But, then you go on to say that you would filter based on a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> belief... which means the system would allow that? But you said it wouldn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right in the beginning? How would you differentiate your filtering of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> belief from someone else's filtering of beliefs in the system? Would you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filter the belief based on the users beliefs? It gets hairy very quickly.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of my examples would then apply to said system. I would keep shy from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtering beliefs at all to keep from the negative consequences that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would allow.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I like the more details on the proposal. Your example of temporary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtering is in fact a UI feature compared to a system feature, as long as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it doesn't hit save and effect other parts of the system. I am fine with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that because it would be in fact useful to view the posts based on topics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so you could be further informed on each side. But there is a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between you explicitly doing it your self compared to the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> automatically doing it for you. The later is when you run into trouble.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now we just need to find a way to test that your filtering does as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended without the negative possibilities that can come from abuse of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filtering system that I highlighted. But before that you need to decide on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your mission statement. Which then allows you to define a feature set to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> carry it out. You seem to be very back and forth about what it would do and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not do. Maybe the negative consequences would be negligible and work fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also I think you should think bigger than it just being a forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interface. You could actually put both arguments visually side by side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effectively doing what you want while minimizing the negative impacts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> James.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. I think you missed the point about Jake. He was not meant to be an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actual representation but and example of how different ways filtering could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> go wrong within the system. You could have made one person have just one of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each of those opinions and the flaws would still be there in each example.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Executive Summary
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; You saying, &quot;*me* choosing to do this based on information provided by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; users&quot; = euphemism for furthering your own bias justified that a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; people agree with you.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If you filter based on political position *in general*.  But that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would make you prejudiced and so likely to be an authoritarian.  And
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> if you read my and Altemeyer's book you would know that allowing that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> group to remove themselves from the process is a feature, not a bug:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they are irrational (or more accurately &quot;significantly more irrational
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> than Neurotypicals&quot;, since we all have this problem to one degree or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> another) and generally contribute nothing to the debate unless maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the debate concerns why and how to commit genocide or other acts of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> extreme prejudice, since they're the experts in that domain.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But Neurotypicals are *not* likely to do this, preferring instead to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> use the system to filter out other types of problem posts.  And there
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is lots of research to back up this claim.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; People would make decisions on the filtering level before they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actually had
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; an educated opinion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; This system leads to a false sense of reality because you are only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seeing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; part of the population or argument
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't help people see the nuances of the counter argument or the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> deeper
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; levels that need to be discussed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It actually encourages and rewards closed mindedness
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; You keep people from arguments that might actually change their opinion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; furthering ignorance on the topic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> All of the above is a pretty good description of authoritarian
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> behavior.  Good Job!  Maybe we can use people's using the filtering
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system that way as a filter!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, it sounds like you would want to filter out people entirely
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> based
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; on one held opinion essentially saying, &quot;Because you believe this one
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thing.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Everything else you believe is invalid&quot;. That in psychology is called
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Black
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and White Thinking&quot; and is labeled in the category of Thinking Errors.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Unfortunately filtering on political position, especially on a single
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> issue, is not what the system would do (or even allow, although now
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that you bring it up I guess I could see how a third-party could use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the open data model to build a tool like that).  Again, maybe you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> haven't spent time on these forums, but it is incredibly easy to spot
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> trolls and other problem participants, not by their political
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> persuasion (although there does seem to me a pretty high correlation
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with authoritarianism) but by their tactics.  A good example is one of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the trolls my local paper's site that one of the editorial board
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> members asked me if my proposal would filter posts like his.  One of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the things he does is have &quot;canned screed&quot; that he posts whenever
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> certain issues come up (taxes, government regulation,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> environmentalism, etc., you know the drill).  He even bragged to me
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that the fact that he'd posted over 20,000 times to that forum doesn't
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mean he wastes his whole life on it, instead had a &quot;system&quot; for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> locating and copy/pasting his screed that made him very efficient!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe it would help if I suggest some flags that maybe you might find
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more acceptable to filter on.  Note that you'd probably not want to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> set the threshold too low, but if maybe 1% of people had flagged
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> someone as having multiple posts with one or more of these traits you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> might consider adding them to the filter, and certainly if 50% of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people had you would want to:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Flamer (particularly ad hominem attacks)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Contrarian (gives downvotes/1 star ratings more than twice as often
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as upvotes/5 star ratings)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Polyanna (the inverse of 2)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Troll (screed designed to inflame or annoy rather than enlighten)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Mobster (lots of &quot;yeah, what he said&quot; posts).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 6) Profane (every thread ends in an explosion of swearing)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 7) Loose screw (posts that don't make sense or are internally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> inconsistent)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Any others?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I might want to keep 6 and 7 in my feed because they can be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entertaining, but have a very low tolerance for 1 and 4.  Others might
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be the opposite.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think I'd also like the option to easily turn filters on and off and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> filter individuals.  Maybe a proposal is written such that half the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comments are from people who are one or more of the above, in which
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> case I'd know not to even bother analyzing it since it was obviously
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> written by a troll.  Or maybe one individual gets a little excited and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> posts something snide after *every* other comment (I've seen it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> happen) and I'd like to see what the conversation looks like without
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that distraction.  I'd like option of keeping that person filtered if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I see this problem a lot, but maybe by default that filter would go
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> away at the end of the session if I didn't explicitly save it.  Or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> again, if I want to filter out specific &quot;but the bible says&quot; people in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an abortion or separation of church and state proposal, I need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> able to do that, at least temporarily.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Note that flags might also be used to *boost* the odds that you see a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> post based on your preferences by putting them at the top or calling
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them out in some fashion.  For that there might be *positive* flags
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Linker (provides useful links to external sites)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Scientist (provides links to academic research)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Wordsmith (expresses a thought very efficiently and/or elegantly)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Shaper (makes good suggestions about how to improve a proposal)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5) Inquisitor (asks key questions that must be answered before a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal could be approved)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> These are kind of derivative of the badges Stack Exchange uses, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the tools are maybe a little sharper since the world we're working in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is a lot rougher than one where everybody is just trying to be helpful
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> as is (at least ostensibly) the motivation there.  I'd mostly be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> interested in 2 and 5 in that second list and would want to see those
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comments first.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> PS: &quot;Jake&quot; sounds like an interesting character: I'll bet if he set
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> his filters the way you describe he'd be *very happy* if he discovered
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> he wasn't the only person who felt that way ;-)
