<PRE>I'll also respond to this. Which you might bring up again.

&quot;pick out the dozen or so gems that a decision maker actually needs to see
to enable them to make an informed choice.&quot;

I don't believe they need the exact post, they just need the information
and how many/who people support it in order to make an informed decision.
If he wants to go through and read the posts sure, but the actual text
isn't the information he needs.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> 2,820,000,000 possible results in .44 seconds. We just need an
</I>&gt;<i> implementation specific to &quot;governing&quot;. I am not saying Google is perfect
</I>&gt;<i> at it, but I am saying your idea that it is impossible is flawed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like filtering because it segregates groups that have the same
</I>&gt;<i> opinion filtering the same thing. This happens on both sides of an issue
</I>&gt;<i> until neither side even sees each other, or one is completely muzzled. We
</I>&gt;<i> want understanding and some measure of consensus. Not a system that tells
</I>&gt;<i> you exactly what you want while allowing you to ignore what you don't
</I>&gt;<i> personally believe.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it could be really cool what you could do already by farming public
</I>&gt;<i> twitter posts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I then go on to try to preempt his next post, &quot;But Google does filter&quot; by
</I>&gt;<i> explaining a few cases where filtering does make sense. The filter should
</I>&gt;<i> strive to have no bias not represent the bias of a group of people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What your suggesting is not possible actually already exists in a
</I>&gt;<i> different form.
</I>&gt;<i> Google seems to be able to do it. When I Googled &quot;Google&quot; it gave me.
</I>&gt;<i> 2,820,000,000 results (0.44 seconds)
</I>&gt;<i> It took them a lot of time and money but they have figured out a way to
</I>&gt;<i> help you wade through the internet and find what you are really looking
</I>&gt;<i> for. We just need a &quot;search engine&quot; and UI that bring you the relevant
</I>&gt;<i> information.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are just a few ideas for what it could do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - Combine comments that are essentially the same and have the reader
</I>&gt;<i>    read it once. Instead of reading the same thing 10,000 times your can read
</I>&gt;<i>    it one time with the appendage that 10,000 support this.
</I>&gt;<i>    - Give users a variable rank like Google page rank that assigns weight
</I>&gt;<i>    to peoples comments based on how many people source that person.
</I>&gt;<i>    Essentially, the more people that back you the more weight your comments
</I>&gt;<i>    have.
</I>&gt;<i>    - I am sure there are a lot more and invite anyone else to add these
</I>&gt;<i>    are just two I thought up off of the top of my head.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It isn't a perfect system. You can still game Google with shady SEO but
</I>&gt;<i> Google is getting better at giving you relevant information and is working
</I>&gt;<i> on their system all the time. We would need to do the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just don't like the idea of filtering because it promotes segregation
</I>&gt;<i> instead of consensus. Groups of people will consistently filter the same
</I>&gt;<i> thing and then only get information that they want to see fueling their
</I>&gt;<i> current opinions which then filter more things and so on. It will happen on
</I>&gt;<i> both sides of an argument further separating them from each other. The goal
</I>&gt;<i> should be to educate and bring consensus about a proposal. Not just to tell
</I>&gt;<i> you want and ignore what you don't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could actually do an experiment by farming twitter posts and creating
</I>&gt;<i> a report on an issue. If only I had the money to build it. It would be a
</I>&gt;<i> cool experiment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can see your argument brewing already and will try to answer it. &quot;But,
</I>&gt;<i> Google does filter!&quot;. They do their best to be an impartial deliverer of
</I>&gt;<i> information without judgement. Your idea of filtering has the judgement of
</I>&gt;<i> those who created the filter deciding what information to deliver. I think
</I>&gt;<i> that is the difference. I never said there couldn't be auto--aggregation
</I>&gt;<i> and weighting of arguments based on people influence. But, I don't think we
</I>&gt;<i> should auto ignore based on judgement. The technology should be as unbiased
</I>&gt;<i> as possible. Giving you the in information to to make your own decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said I do believe there is a place for filtering. Just not in
</I>&gt;<i> the way you would implement it. Non-sensical posts for example (should be
</I>&gt;<i> throughly tested to keep from judgement). But if you are talking about
</I>&gt;<i> expanding a new road in your city and someone writes, &quot;But the sky is
</I>&gt;<i> Blue!&quot; is an example of non-sensical. Or, spam filtering people who are
</I>&gt;<i> just advertising something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, in creating systems that keep you from being able to game the system
</I>&gt;<i> could use filtering. Like if 1000 people said the same thing, but all their
</I>&gt;<i> accounts are new within a short time and that is their only post. You can
</I>&gt;<i> probably assume it is someone trying to game the system. That being said,
</I>&gt;<i> there should be a system set up where you can plead your case if you are
</I>&gt;<i> filtered. That way if you really were a person that happened to signup
</I>&gt;<i> during that 1000 post time and said what you did as your first post you
</I>&gt;<i> could refute it and then be recognized by the system. Notice all of my
</I>&gt;<i> examples keep from the filter having judgement on any issue.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the right amount of resources to implement it and the right access to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; data.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The limiting factor here is reading comprehension speed.  So, unless

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information density or some technology that beams the concepts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directly into people's heads telepathically there *must* be some sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of filtering.  Sure, much of it will be simply prioritizing (which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just one easy method of filtering), but we're talking about a system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that may need to eventually filter *millions* of comments to pick out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the dozen or so gems that a decisionmaker actually needs to see to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enable them to make an informed choice.  The only way to do that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with a flagging/rating system, using the users themselves as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> filter.
