<PRE>Scott, we seem to fundamentally differ here. I've explained my rationale, but I don't see yours. So I'll restate mine:

I hold that voting and proposal generation/tuning must go hand-in-hand and absolutely should not be separate.

A root problem with the status quo is that people are presented with a proposal and asked to vote it up or down. In the U.S., we call this a referendum, and it is horrible. The crafting of the proposal is where all the actual decision-making happens (the devil is in the details), and almost everyone is disenfranchised from that. And then when people are asked to vote, they don't care, since they have so little influence on the important parts of the matter: the details. A million vote for, a million vote against: what does my input matter?

Voting *guides* proposal-tuning. It tells you what is getting buy-in and what is not consensus-building. While proposals are being crafted, we might come to a point where half are for and half are against. You suggest a majority-rule forced vote. I say that's a horrible solution. What if instead one person said: &quot;Wait a minute, I have a completely different idea; hey everyone, see if this solves your issues better.&quot; A lot of those alternates might fail, but some genius might come up with something that gets almost everyone onboard. I say that is infinitely better than forcing a majority rule. And it cannot be done unless the voting and decision-making are mixed. You know you have an answer when the votes pile up on one proposal.

And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.

&gt;&gt;<i> Further, the conclusion is specious. How does my sentence support majority rule? Are you claiming that the majority in fact do read volumes before voting? I propose the opposite conclusion: a well-crafted consensus system corrects for the ignorance of the majority by empowering the minority to provide sane input into decisions that could otherwise be overwhelmed by the ignorance of &quot;the masses.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nope, the way to do that is to prevent the &quot;ignorant masses&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> disrupting the crafting of the proposal that will be voted on.  This
</I>&gt;<i> is a different process from the one where they get to vote on it, and
</I>&gt;<i> as described in my book the actual voting process should include the
</I>&gt;<i> text of the proposal as well as the best crafted pro and con arguments
</I>&gt;<i> (just like the most helpful positive and negative reviews as shown on
</I>&gt;<i> Amazon, and what comes in the Blue Book (voter's guide) in many
</I>&gt;<i> counties (and that few people read because it's not nearly as
</I>&gt;<i> convenient as it will be in an e-democracy system)).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And in the mean time?  No government at all?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No hasty decisions, yes! What good is a decision that sucks for half the people? Why should we rush to the wrong decision? Unless there is an army about to invade or a giant meteor about to strike, do we really need to rush governance? We are no where near the level of invading armies or world-saving governance, so I don't see any need for hasty decision-making here. Especially if it leads to awful results.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, you're confounding the proposal generation/tuning phase with
</I>&gt;<i> the actual vote.  They must be two separate steps in the process.
