<PRE>I would go as far as to say that any auto filtering is inherently biased to
the person or group it was created from. Even, if the group is a large mass
of people, or even the majority.

I think the task is to allow the user to more quickly sift through the
information efficiently. Then he can take his own side on the issue on a
more educated level. I think Settleit is tackling that issue pretty well
actually. Now we just need to observe how it works out and learn from it.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TL;DR: There are several other troll mitigation strategies other than

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ___________
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Scott Raney,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I haven't seen or thought of any reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alternative.  Unless the system has a way to filter the information
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> presented to each user, I claim that it is unworkable because it will
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem.  Anyone disagree?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are several other methods being worked on to discourage trolls.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Stackexchange has made some progress by creating clear and specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community. The National Communication Association has been researching this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.">http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.</A> Many people are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working on it from several different angles. The SettleIt.org design
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reduces the cognitive load of any single interaction by isolating it so you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only need to consider a single statement at a time which also allows us to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divide up the work among multiple people. This allows for the time and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effort you mentioned in other options of reducing trolls.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;OK, so every SettleIt debate has the option of including a branch
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which will settle the issue of whether the Bible is true ;-)  Maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> now you can see why filtering is a good strategy?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, many of the statements will include a debate on the Bible. I don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see how that justifies filtering it out. In SettleIt.org you would be able
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have the same branch in multiple areas so as that debate is worked out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will automatically be updated in all the other affected areas. To
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dismiss someone's concern is to exclude them (and yourself) from the debate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which defeats the purpose of the system which is to build agreement. To
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow an individual to filter what they see builds bias into the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> further separating people into polar groups which again defeats the main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> purpose. Since SettleIt.org is a tree structure you just need to see the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement once in each affected context and you can decide to expand that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement to see the debate. Otherwise it is very small a distraction which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provides value in understanding the concerns of the group.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I'm not denying any of them their right to free speech,&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  It's not a free speech issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Some people are just going to have to go along with what the majority
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (or supermajority) prefer.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although that statement is true, in many debates you can not reach even a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simple majority because many people are dismissing concerns of the others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and refusing to debate the topics. I don't see why you would discourage
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> efforts to increase the level of agreement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> flags it that way.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A simple flag is also another vector for the trolls. I see many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> situations where this is used to remove unpopular ideas that otherwise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could provide value. I believe it would be better in the long run to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> encourage debating each idea once rather than ignore it many times.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;length issue&quot;. Are you concerned about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the length of the troll's comments or the fact that SettleIt.org has a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limited statement length.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
