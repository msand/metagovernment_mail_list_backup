<PRE>I don't have time to read any books at the moment, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground. The word &quot;consensus&quot; is a bit vague. When I say it, I do not mean unanimity but rather very large supermajority.

First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.

As for the practicality of consensus governance, I don't think it is worth compromising over. Sure, a majority-rule system can get results faster. But they will inherently be bad results. 49% of the people will always feel shorted. Plus, most importantly, people get funneled into an artificial 2-sided system. You are either for or against abortion, death penalty, etc., and there can be no building toward synthesis. And those issues themselves are products of the 2-sided system. Trying to boil the world down into being for or against abortion is silly. The issue is much more nuanced than that, and a majority-rule system kills that nuance.

Who cares if consensus takes longer, is harder, costs more? If it builds real solutions that everyone can get onboard with, isn't it the only possible way to advance beyond the massive failings of current majority-rule systems?

If there is some issue that 49% of people are opposed to, should we really force it on them? That doesn't even sound like democracy to me.

P.S. In my previous post, I misspoke. I meant to say that settleit.org has a nice &quot;elevator video.&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given that, the question is always, what can we do to fix the system? That's a great one, because everyone has an answer for that. Term limits. No term limits. Contribution caps. No contribution caps. And so on. Not only does every solution sound minor and ineffectual... but every solution is always required to be passed by the very people in power. And every now and then those people do pass a law... and for some reason it doesn't fix anything. Because those people make sure it won't ruin their chokehold on power. Of course.

</I>&gt;<i> Which gets us back to the &quot;treason&quot; issue ;-)  Furthermore it's
</I>&gt;<i> another nail in the &quot;consensus&quot; coffin: If you can't even use the new
</I>&gt;<i> system to make the decision to overthrow the old one, what use is it,
</I>&gt;<i> really?  And that's only the first hurdle: If you don't
</I>&gt;<i> *systematically* constrain the behavior of this group (and you've
</I>&gt;<i> characterized them as &quot;the powerful&quot;, but IMHO the problem isn't their
</I>&gt;<i> power or their money, it's their authoritarian thought patterns) your
</I>&gt;<i> new system will break down just as our current one has.  And I note
</I>&gt;<i> that your post, and all of the others I've read, never really
</I>&gt;<i> addresses this problem.  Worse, there are a lot of inconsistencies in
</I>&gt;<i> the platform.  For example the &quot;elevator pitch&quot; contains both the word
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote&quot; and the word &quot;consensus&quot; whereas IMHO those are incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> processes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To some extent the question of whether a consensus decision rule will
</I>&gt;<i> work is an empirical one, all we have to do is implement one and then
</I>&gt;<i> turn the people lose on it to see if they can establish policy on
</I>&gt;<i> abortion, immigration, income redistribution, etc.  But the
</I>&gt;<i> researchers in this field have reached &quot;consensus&quot; that it won't work,
</I>&gt;<i> and I think you'll agree if you're honest with yourselves that you
</I>&gt;<i> already *know* it won't.  Which means the word &quot;consensus&quot; needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the Metagovernment platform to be replaced by something
</I>&gt;<i> like &quot;egalitarian&quot; or &quot;participatory&quot; or some other term that
</I>&gt;<i> indicates that everyone's preferences and objections will be heard but
</I>&gt;<i> that some sort of majority-rule will be used to make the final
</I>&gt;<i> decision.  And as I said before (and go into some detail in my book),
</I>&gt;<i> I've no problem with using social engineering to support tweaking the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal with the goal of achieving large supermajorities in these
</I>&gt;<i> votes, but that must be a separate process and system from the actual
</I>&gt;<i> voting.
