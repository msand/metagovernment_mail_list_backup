&gt;<i> I don't have time to read any books at the moment, so forgive me if I'm going over old ground. The word &quot;consensus&quot; is a bit vague. When I say it, I do not mean unanimity but rather very large supermajority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks, Ed, for volunteering to be the one with the giant target on
your back ;-)  Your post is about the best evidence I could ask for as
to why majority rule is a requirement.  Please allow me to start by
translating your first sentence: &quot;I don't have time to educate myself,
so I'll just go with my existing prejudice&quot;.  This is part of the
problem, not part of the solution.

&gt;<i> First procedurally, the word &quot;consensus&quot; doesn't contradict with &quot;vote&quot; in many systems, because voting can be iterative. People keep voting until consensus is reached. In that sense, voting is more of a barometer of whether or not a proposal needs more work in order to garner consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And in the mean time?  No government at all?  Your argument, and this
group's failure to produce a &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule (let
alone even a usable prototype) in 6 years is the proof we've been
looking for *in itself* that a consensus-based decision rule is
non-viable.  Don't you just love the irony of it all?

&gt;<i> As for the practicality of consensus governance, I don't think it is worth compromising over. Sure, a majority-rule system can get results faster. But they will inherently be bad results. 49% of the people will always feel shorted. Plus, most importantly, people get funneled into an artificial 2-sided system. You are either for or against abortion, death penalty, etc., and there can be no building toward synthesis. And those issues themselves are products of the 2-sided system. Trying to boil the world down into being for or against abortion is silly. The issue is much more nuanced than that, and a majority-rule system kills that nuance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, majority voting doesn't mean half+1 although it seems that we
disagree that that outcome is better than *no* decision.  The design
of proposals *should* be iterative with as much social engineering
technology as we can bring to bear on the problem of increasing the
size of the majority.  But again *requiring* this is an argument for
the status quo which I'm sure we all agree is not acceptable.

&gt;<i> Who cares if consensus takes longer, is harder, costs more? If it builds real solutions that everyone can get onboard with, isn't it the only possible way to advance beyond the massive failings of current majority-rule systems?
</I>
Two logical flaws in this one:
1) What if consensus, even by your relaxed (and unfortunately unusably
vague) definition is impossible, which is what the research shows is
often the case?
2) The problems with our current system aren't in any way traceable to
the decision rule.

&gt;<i> If there is some issue that 49% of people are opposed to, should we really force it on them? That doesn't even sound like democracy to me.
</I>
Again, thanks for the target: IMHO this brings into question your
qualifications to &quot;lead&quot; this project.  Democracy, by definition, is
merely *participatory* and does not require consensus, or any
particular decision rule for that matter.  By insisting on a provably
unworkable philosophy what you're proposing is &quot;no effective
government&quot; which unfortunately is also what you have provided this
group.  I'd call it anarchy, but it's *worse* than anarchy because it
preserves the status quo and so doesn't even come with the freedom
that true anarchy affords.

&gt;<i> P.S. In my previous post, I misspoke. I meant to say that settleit.org has a nice &quot;elevator video.&quot;
</I>
It does, as does Loomio and indeed NationBuilder.  But again I must
point out that they're not even trying to solve the right problem,
which is that there is a (fortunately small) segment of the population
which is *genetically programmed* to make their decisions based on
their prejudices and the direction given to them by their a priori
authorities.  Although we can allow these people to *participate* in
the process by casting their votes, we must design the system such
that the decision rule does not give them the power to preserve the
status quo whenever they prefer that.

Again, if you don't believe me or don't have time to read my book,
*please* at least try to make it through Bob Altemeyer's book &quot;The
Authoritarians&quot;:
