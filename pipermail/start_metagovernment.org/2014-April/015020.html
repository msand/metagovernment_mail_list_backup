</I>
Certainly SettleIt.org is less susceptible to this problem than
consensus-based decision rules.  The can of worms it opens instead is
the issue of unequal votes: As there is no restriction on the number
of posts, any troll (read authoritarian) can game the system by
unethically flooding it with an endless onslaught of &quot;facts&quot; to raise
the confidence of posts they agree with or lower the confidence of
those they want to disappear.  True the Neurotypicals can fight back
on a post-by-post basis by removing or even editing the troll posts
(and what's up with that, anyway?) but this I think places an
unnecessary burden on them.  Much better is to *systematically*
marginalize trolls by identifying them (via aggregate ratings and
flagging) and use this information to filter their disruptive input
out of the information stream the majority of participants have to
deal with.

&gt;<i> Voting encourages authoritarians as they do not need to directly justify
</I>&gt;<i> their decision.
</I>
Ah, but you're ignoring the key fact here which is that authoritarians
are a relatively small minority of the population.  The problem with
our current system is that they (and their partners in crime the
Social Dominators) gravitate toward positions of power and so muck up
the operation of representative governments by distorting the numbers.
 Once we bring the Neurotypicals up to their evolutionarily-specified
numbers in the system, this effects of this problem just goes away
even though the flaw in individual decision making philosophy itself
remains.

&gt;<i> I read quite a bit of <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A> . I was not able
</I>&gt;<i> to find what was new or unique about the decision making process in The Plan
</I>&gt;<i> that would discourage decisions based on prejudices and the direction given
</I>&gt;<i> by priori authorities.
</I>
Correct.  Direct democracy and the fact that they are a relative
minority solves the problem directly *PROVIDED* that the decision rule
is majority based and one-vote per individual.

&gt;<i> The most specific description of the process I can find is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Basic components of The System will include forums where topics to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debated are introduced and discussed, with the best ideas determined by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popular vote to be formulated into laws and promoted to a voting forum where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The People will vote to adopt or reject them (a meritocracy, or more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> properly mericracy, of ideas). &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to be the same as many direct democracy systems. Is there a new
</I>&gt;<i> concept or angle I am missing?
</I>
No, I think you've understand it perfectly.  I'm not claiming all (or
even any) of the ideas in The Plan are new or unique, but merely that
it is a way to *choose* which new or unique ideas should be
implemented (like direct democracy) and which need to be left out
(like consensus-based or veto-enabled decision rules).
  Regards,
    Scott
