Yeah, those little buttons are a pain ;-)

&gt;<i> Your technological ignorance is showing a little in your last post. Is what
</I>&gt;<i> I ment to say.  You really wish we would have stayed with software
</I>&gt;<i> applications instead of moving to the serverside applications?
</I>
Definitely.  Going a little off topic here, but the browser-based
architecture is incredibly limited, complicated, and brittle (meaning
it breaks with every little change, like version upgrades).
iPhone/Android is a little better because most things are apps and so
the developer has more control, but *ideally* versioning and
extensions would have been built into the OSs a long time ago so, for
example, instead of JavaScript which is a complete POS (and everyone
knows it which is why there are so many extensions and workarounds for
it), apps could have been built in any scripting language and the
necessary engines and libraries downloaded on the fly.  This problem
could have been solved at several different junctures (e.g., when
Microsoft added automatically downloaded OS updates for Windows 95,
when HTML was originally defined to purposely exclude interactive
elements, or when Netscape chose to build in a weekend-hack scripting
language instead of defining an open architecture, etc.) but due to
shortsightedness and proprietary-think never has been.  Like I said,
if it the web had been *designed* instead of evolving with the bizarre
set of constraints it has, I'd have a working voting system up and
running in days or weeks whereas now it's going to take me months.

As for &quot;ignorance&quot;, I'll cop to that as, like I think I said, I burned
out and retired from software development about 10 years ago and so am
having to learn a lot about the current environment (and not liking it
much at all).  But I've been developing software from microcode and
assembly languages through 3GLs and 4GLs up to AI languages since I
was a kid (40 years ago) so I think I have a pretty good awareness of
what works and what doesn't.  And as for django/pyramid/flask or
anything based on Tcl or Python, talk about &quot;old school&quot;!  I wouldn't
touch either of those languages with a 10 foot pole.  Of course, it
doesn't help that the product I burned out developing was a major
competitor of those languages and yet still exists as a commercial
product (after enabling me to retire, unlike the the developers of
those other languages, who got the fame instead ;-)

Now that I've finished the main Rails tutorial I'm considerably less
enamored of it.  The main concept that comes to my mind is &quot;bag on the
side&quot;.  The whole development environment is really just a collection
of hacks, kluges, preprocessors, and workarounds instead of a unified
architecture (which is why I had to spend the first few hours in the
tutorial *fixing* version incompatibilities in it!).  It's really
designed for professional full-time developers who must deal with a
lot of different projects for different clients and where a project
may get passed around among several developers not all of whom will be
familiar with the overall design.  Which unfortunately doesn't really
describe this project.   I've written to my old crew to see if maybe
it might be faster and easier to customize the old product (which is
now open source) than punish myself by doing it the Rails way, but
using Rails is still the backup plan.

&gt;<i> Also, I have a hard time believing this would eclipse Facebook someday. In
</I>&gt;<i> the US you vote 1 time ever 4 years and how much time do they actually
</I>&gt;<i> research and post opinions about it? Not very much.
</I>
Maybe my FB &quot;friends&quot; are different, but although I'd agree that stuff
like cat videos and pictures of food are still the main fare, bitching
about governments, corporations, etc. make up a significant percentage
of the posts.  Imagine what it would be like if they actually believed
that posting would *change* things...

&gt;<i>  How much do they hang
</I>&gt;<i> out and talk with their friends? A lot lot more. They even watch cat videos
</I>&gt;<i> more. I think a good measure of this is day to day how much does the average
</I>&gt;<i> person talk politics? If you can answer that, I think you would get a good
</I>&gt;<i> idea of how often people would use the system.
</I>
Again, *everyone* is interested in this, many of them *intensely*
interested.  It's just that they feel powerless and don't want to
waste their time, offend anyone, or end up looking foolish.  We're
going to change all that.  And even with filtering it'll still be a
lot less risky than talking politics with their family members,
friends, or neighbors ;-)

&gt;<i> And even if it did explode in usage it's scope is so much more focused the
</I>&gt;<i> data won't be the issue. Getting participation would be.
</I>
There's definitely a huge &quot;crossing the chasm&quot; issue here, which we'll
see when a few small organizations (HOAs, small towns, etc.) start
using the new system as their primary decisionmaking process.  The
pressure on higher levels (county/state/federal/global) will build
very gradually, but eventually I believe will become irresistible and
we have to have a plan in place to specify how the transition will
occur.  Which is why I wrote that book (learning from the mistakes of
the design of the WWW, and all our current types of government, as it
were).
  Regards,
    Scott
