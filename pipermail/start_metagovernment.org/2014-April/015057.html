Well, I disagree that you actually disagree ;-)

 Technology has solved much more complex problems than

The limiting factor here is reading comprehension speed.  So, unless
you're proposing an AI digest/rewrite the comments to increase
information density or some technology that beams the concepts
directly into people's heads telepathically there *must* be some sort
of filtering.  Sure, much of it will be simply prioritizing (which is
just one easy method of filtering), but we're talking about a system
that may need to eventually filter *millions* of comments to pick out
the dozen or so gems that a decisionmaker actually needs to see to
enable them to make an informed choice.  The only way to do that is
with a flagging/rating system, using the users themselves as the
filter.

    Scott
