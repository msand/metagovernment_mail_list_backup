<PRE>So, now everyone takes part in the proposal/refinement phase? But then they
send it to the voters for approval which is also everybody? I thought you
said small groups define the proposals which then get sent out for mass
voting? Now you are just confusing me. And, you still haven't defined how
those small groups get chosen.

Also,
&quot;
Well, if they provide that perq to *every* voter, that's not a broken
system, that's a benevolent dictator ;-)
&quot;
Doesn't actually address the issue. It is just redirection. How will you
keep those small groups from being corrupted?


Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I'm going to have to disagree with that characterization.  An

</I>&gt;<i> would refuse to allow them to drive cars.  When a position is based on
</I>&gt;<i> scientific *facts* about inherent limitations it's not really accurate
</I>&gt;<i> to call it prejudice, it's merely social engineering (again, a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more on this in my book).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people who would turn down a million dollars. You're there, working hard
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support your family and a very big org says, &quot;If you just say this.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never need to work again.&quot; Boom! system broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, if they provide that perq to *every* voter, that's not a broken

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You could even excuse it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; saying you will use the money for good purposes, even better than if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; company still had it. It's only this one time... etc. Even better it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something you believe already, so it is a win win. Justification is easy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like you're thinking of representative government.  I aim to
</I>&gt;<i> replace that entirely as *that's* the architecture that's inherently
</I>&gt;<i> broken because of how people are selected to serve in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You're sort of saying two incompatible things.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;There is no &quot;decider&quot;, the final approval is by public vote&quot; &lt;-You think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they are deciding.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;a small group of people makes decisions about projects&quot; &lt;- They are the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people that really decide what happens. The final vote just says yes or
</I>&gt;<i> no.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Very little actual participation from the masses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Relatively, yes.  Spending a half hour a week reading proposals and
</I>&gt;<i> voting on them is not an insignificant contribution, however, and is
</I>&gt;<i> more than enough to override the SDAs who are running (and ruining)
</I>&gt;<i> our current governments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even if the general public majority is not corruptible you still haven't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addressed how people will be among the chosen to decide the details? and
</I>&gt;<i> how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to prevent corruption or prejudice among that small group?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That will all be handled in the proposal generation/refinement phase,
</I>&gt;<i> which again everyone is free to participate in to the best of their
</I>&gt;<i> abilities (subject to sorting and filtering, of course).  If they
</I>&gt;<i> finish and forward an inherently corrupt proposal to the voters for
</I>&gt;<i> approval I have faith that the Neurotypicals (at least) will be able
</I>&gt;<i> to spot this and will vote to reject it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're talking about the possibility of corruption in the executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch, I solved that problem in my book The Plan too: They're
</I>&gt;<i> Managers who are *hired* rather than elected, and can easily be
</I>&gt;<i> replaced whenever a problem occurs (a simple majority vote and the
</I>&gt;<i> Manager is out!)
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
