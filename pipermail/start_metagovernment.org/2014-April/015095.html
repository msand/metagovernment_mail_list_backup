<PRE>Steve,

Technology is sort of our problem here. We can't take parts of code and
just slab them togethe(without a ridiculous amount of work)r. They may not
even be in the same language.

The other problem is IP, they may be under a liscence where we couldn't use
their code even if it is compatiple. It would need to be open source and
have no proprietary parts.

The last is I am a horrible coder, and so far I haven't heard any of us who
are. So we either need engineers or money to get engineers. Definetly money
is needed anyway. It is also a little bit chicken and egg problem.

For me. I have been lurking, listening, and trying to learn while working
to get the resources so I can contribute finincially. Right now I am just
not there yet.

Cheers,
James
