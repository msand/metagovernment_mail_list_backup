<PRE>Thanks for the thoughtful post, Scott.

Many of your criticisms go to me (I'm not complaining), so I'll reply to that sort in this thread. I have been doing a horrible job of being a thought-leader, cheer-leader, etc. to keep this group going. I have plenty of great personal reasons for that, but in the ned it's still a failure of leadership which I'm not proud of. I am always more than happy to have others step in as much as they are willing. And I also continue to try to reorganize my life such that I would have more time to contribute (preferably full time).

That said, this list isn't hibernating as much as it appears to be cyclical. We have times of great participation and times of none. I have no idea why that is, but again it's something I could work through if I were pouring more in. As could others, hint, hint.

I'm not a developer, so I won't speak to the development of software projects, but I'll reply to one or two points separately and a couple briefly right here.

&gt;<i> 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>Metagov does now have an elevator pitch:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch</A>
I have been planning on proposing making that (or something very similar to it) our home page and/or making a 30-second video containing that text and putting that on the home page. Again, it's been a matter of time-constraints for me, though others are welcome to step in. (Regarding videos, I was also going to propose that everyone/anyone make videos about the project... it's not like we need to have only one.) Also, at least blinap appears to have a nicely-done elevator-video.

&gt;<i> 8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation
</I>I think most of us here are onboard with that. Reference:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>

&gt;<i> 9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason
</I>I guess you can put it that way, but I sure don't like to. If we do manage to break into the mainstream, we're going to have enemies (read: authoritarians) characterizing us as all kinds of negative things. We don't need to give them fuel in advance. I don't see us as revolutionaries simply because I don't see any overthrow of the current system. Instead, I'd like to see the current systems simply wither and die as people eventually ignore them in favor of the much better, stronger solutions that have grown around them. There is no treason in dispensing with a representative-democracy government if everyone is onboard with it.

&gt;<i> Nothing on Loomio?  Really?  Seems like this group is hibernating which means it's obviously time to shake things up a little.  Rather than put my bio here as promised, I'll instead refer you to my book (working title &quot;The Plan: A Design for an Engineered Civilization&quot;) which has that info (and much more) in it.  Get the current draft from my web site (and please mind the copyright notice: Until I get to beta-test please direct any comments to me rather this or any other forum.  I'll provide a summary to this list once input trails off):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tomorrow I'll also post the guts of the section on the voting and budgeting system to this list so that you all can review that without having to read the rest of the book.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've read the archives (every post for the first year, sampled every thread since then and read every post in any thread related to my project) and believe I have some useful insights to share. Although this post is going to strike some of you as that of a troll, it's probably more useful to think of it as that of a zealot: &quot;I Have Seen the Light And Am Here To Share The Good News&quot; (and if you read the book you'll maybe come to appreciate my obsession with irony and how this is just one more example of it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My goal here is not to drive people from this forum or the concept of e-democracy, but, to be blunt, you've had 6 years now without much to show for it and so it's time to &quot;defecate or abdicate&quot; (i.e., if even having this debate makes you uncomfortable maybe you're part of the problem rather than part of the solution).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So here are the problems I see.  If you're inspired to respond to any of these items, please put it in a message by itself and change the subject line.  Please nobody take this any of this as personal criticism or criticism of Ed as Fearless Leader: I believe all of your hearts are in the right place, now we just need to get your heads over there as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Ignoring the KISS rule
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you can't explain your idea in 30 seconds (the elevator speech), nobody's going to trust (or use) your system.  Reviewing all the projects I've seen lots of exquisitely baroque architectures that are simply nonviable because it takes too long to understand how they work.  This also means that in general they'll also take far to much time and effort (i.e., transactional costs) during operation.  So even if one of them somehow miraculously got fully implemented and then adopted by some organization, the participation rates would be so low as guarantee failure and possibly set back e-democracy projects by years or decades.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) DSTSS: Authentication isn't an issue
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> People move billions of dollars around every day with a simple login and password, and are perfectly comfortable with systems that you don't even have to log into but once.  By the time one of these e-democracy systems is ready to actually take over operation of a government, people's attitudes will be even more relaxed and the technology for authentication even better. The ho-hum reaction to the recent Bleeding Heart exploit means that it's probably not even worth obsessively worrying about back-end hacks as long as data integrity can be maintained (or even reconstructed).  Compared with the risks we all face due to the delays this question is causing in implementing a system, authentication is so small an issue that even bringing it up almost looks to me like a ploy by people working to prevent e-democracy (blasphemers!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Openness is a sufficient solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The verdict is already in: Given the choice between freedom and privacy/anonymity, freedom wins every time.  Full access to the raw data solves not only the security issues but is a useful social engineering tool to boot: If people are reluctant to use The System to *publicly* express their opinions, and/or are overly concerned with the security issues, we don't want them participating anyway (again, see my book for more on this).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) You're working on the wrong problem
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Although you're all apparently well aware of the problems with our representative democracies, I only found a single reference to Bob Altemeyer's work on Authoritarianism on this list (and that one had exactly zero followups).  As such you seem to be unaware that most of the problems with our representative governments aren't inherent in the design of representative government, they're inherent in the *people* who volunteer to serve in representative governments.  And those exact same people will screw up the operation of any e-democracy or &quot;collaborative government&quot; system too unless we design in ways to systematically constrain their ability to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) You're trying to solve it using inappropriate methods
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, everybody likes consensus.  It has that warm fuzzy feeling like clothes just out of the dryer!  But let's not kid ourselves: This issue has been researched to death and it simply is a non-starter for a functional e-democracy system.  I.e., if you haven't read &quot;Public Choice III&quot;, it is the 800 page &quot;bible&quot; of this field and while it is dryer than that laundry it leaves no room for doubt that simple majority rule is both necessary and sufficient as a general purpose decision-making system[*].  And that doesn't even account for the Social Dominator/Authoritarian/sociopath issues in my #4 (and which are the main theme of my book).  Our best hope here is to use social engineering techniques during the proposal-shaping phase to ensure that as many objections are addressed as possible because it is simply not practical to even *try* to eliminate all of them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6) You've thwarted competition, our most powerful tool
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Partly because of the consensus-based philosophy (see #5) there is a lot of time and mindshare being wasted on things like building connections to vaporware from other sources into your own vaporware.  Although I enjoy the irony of this being reminiscent of the design of &quot;soviets&quot; by the Bolsheviks, we out here in the real world are starving because of your lack of production!  Although a few testy words have been shared on the list from time to time, it seems to me almost pathological in its rejection of competition as a means of selecting the best solution to any given problem. This is not how good software is made and is not how good government will be made.  The best ideas need to be allowed to rise to the top (i.e., it's time for this collectivist approach, which didn't work for the communists either, to be replaced by a competitive environment where a single project will integrate the best ideas from all the others).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 7) You're taking up mindshare and resources
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't be doing this if e-democracy projects had plenty of resources and mind-share.  But they don't, which means any of those things metagovernment.org is not using efficiently are being withheld from projects that would make better use of them (i.e., lead, follow, or get out of the way!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 8) Zero tolerance for commercial exploitation
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you read my book you'll come to see that I'm a zealot about capitalism too, but I am extremely disturbed by any of these projects that have even a *hint* that there is any goal of commercial exploitation of the technology being developed.  I nearly became apoplectic as I traced the whitehouse2/NationBuilder development.  Heresy!  We must cast out the False Prophet! (or is that False Profit?!?) NationBuilder is now not only not an e-democracy platform, it is actually designed to work *against* the whole concept by shoring up leadership-based government!  While it may be necessary to form a non-profit to enable crowdfunding to secure the resources we need to complete a functional tool, NationBuilder (and indeed Loomio) is a clear example of why any sort of commercial side-bet like this is a Really Bad Idea.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 9) Be honest, we're all planning to commit treason
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we're really serious about this, we are all plotting to overthrow not only our own governments, but that of every other nation as well.  The more successful any of these projects are, the more clear this distinction is going to be.  If this isn't what you signed up for, maybe being a revolutionary is just not in your blood and you should instead cheer from the sidelines rather than mucking about out on the field of battle.  None of the people running our current representative government are even legally (constitutionally) *allowed* to support our efforts, and a significant percentage of them are genetically programmed to actively and perhaps even violently resist any type of government that does fit with their authoritarian world view.  This means that our best short-term *and* long-term strategy is to provide a competitive alternative to the traditional governments that people can turn to when their current governments aren't working.  Rather than whining to get people to support your petition drive or standing around in a park somewhere, we can provide a way for people to propose and refine budgets and new laws that they will install (perhaps via referendum at first, but by revolution eventually) to *override* their unresponsive representative government or replace it entirely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You must believe religiously that e-democracy is inevitable and decide that you'd rather have it in 10 years than in 50 or you are simply denying yourself and everyone else the benefits that will accrue from getting it implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can start right now: Prove me wrong on any of the above (or indeed, in any of the points in my book) and you will actually be helping to clarify our goals and move the process along.  Oh, and another irony for you to contemplate: Six years later, and we still don't even have a prototype of a system where each of my points could be loaded into it and each of you given a chance to express your opinion, refine the position, or vote on them! Although that Loomio demo is extremely limited in functionality, it might be up to this task if anyone wants to get their hands dirty.
