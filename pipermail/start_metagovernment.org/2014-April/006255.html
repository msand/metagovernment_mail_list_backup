<PRE>TL;DR: There are several other troll mitigation strategies other than
flagging that deserve investigation. Flagging also has negative impacts
that may outweigh the benefits.
___________

Scott Raney,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I haven't seen or thought of any reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.  Unless the system has a way to filter the information
</I>&gt;<i> presented to each user, I claim that it is unworkable because it will
</I>&gt;<i> simply require too much time and effort to use on any non-trivial
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  Anyone disagree?&quot;
</I>

There are several other methods being worked on to discourage trolls.
Stackexchange has made some progress by creating clear and specific
community. The National Communication Association has been researching this
<A HREF="http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.">http://engagingnewsproject.org/social-media-buttons/.</A> Many people are
working on it from several different angles. The SettleIt.org design
reduces the cognitive load of any single interaction by isolating it so you
only need to consider a single statement at a time which also allows us to
divide up the work among multiple people. This allows for the time and
effort you mentioned in other options of reducing trolls.


&quot;OK, so every SettleIt debate has the option of including a branch
&gt;<i> which will settle the issue of whether the Bible is true ;-)  Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> now you can see why filtering is a good strategy?&quot;
</I>

Yes, many of the statements will include a debate on the Bible. I don't see
how that justifies filtering it out. In SettleIt.org you would be able to
have the same branch in multiple areas so as that debate is worked out it
will automatically be updated in all the other affected areas. To dismiss
someone's concern is to exclude them (and yourself) from the debate which
defeats the purpose of the system which is to build agreement. To allow an
individual to filter what they see builds bias into the system further
separating people into polar groups which again defeats the main purpose.
Since SettleIt.org is a tree structure you just need to see the statement
once in each affected context and you can decide to expand that statement
to see the debate. Otherwise it is very small a distraction which provides
value in understanding the concerns of the group.


&quot;I'm not denying any of them their right to free speech,&quot;

It's not a free speech issue.


&quot;Some people are just going to have to go along with what the majority
(or supermajority)
&gt;<i> prefer.&quot;
</I>
Although that statement is true, in many debates you can not reach even a
simple majority because many people are dismissing concerns of the others
and refusing to debate the topics. I don't see why you would discourage
efforts to increase the level of agreement.


&quot;Seems to me it's just more efficient to flag something as &quot;unsupported
&gt;<i> opinion&quot; and take a few percent off the weight for every person who
</I>&gt;<i> flags it that way.&quot;
</I>
A simple flag is also another vector for the trolls. I see many situations
where this is used to remove unpopular ideas that otherwise could provide
value. I believe it would be better in the long run to encourage debating
each idea once rather than ignore it many times.

I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;length issue&quot;. Are you concerned about the
length of the troll's comments or the fact that SettleIt.org has a limited
statement length.

Regards,
Bentley
