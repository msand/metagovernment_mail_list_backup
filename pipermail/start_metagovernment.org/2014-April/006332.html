Breaking this issue out again, since I think I'm still not
understanding the approach of Ed (et al):

&gt;<i> And to repeat: I see no value in forcing decisions when there is not a consensus. Or high majority. You say in another post something along the lines of: a bad decision is better than no decision. Why? Why do we need to force decisions before their time? Maybe that is true for business, but not for social governance. What is the value of government if it is not of the people? Again, sure, maybe in case on imminent disaster. But otherwise, I cannot see the value of forcing society into bad decisions.
</I>
Let's take climate change as a sample issue: Do you believe that if we
can't get consensus, or at least a 2/3 majority, that the government
should take no action on addressing it?

Or defense spending:  If 1/3 of the population wants a strong national
defense, do they have a right to enforce that status quo on the other
2/3s, even when we now *know* (based on research on SDAs) that that
1/3 is primarily made up of people who have provably irrational
thought processes on the subject?

Also, please address the relationship between &quot;consensus&quot; and the
percentage of the total population who vote.  Is it consensus when 1/3
of the population agrees on something but the other 2/3 don't even
express an opinion?

  Regards,
    Scott
