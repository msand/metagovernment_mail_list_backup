<PRE>*Summary*
Your first statement is actually conflicting with your later statement
because you admit it would allow you to filter based on beliefs.

Temporarily filtering to see one side of an issue is actually a UI feature
as long as the user explicitly does it and the system does not. When the
system is doing things automatically is where you run into the problems I
mentioned. But there are better ways you could do that for example having
each side of the argument side by side. I think you should think bigger
than it just being a forum/comment like user interface. There is so much
more room to innovate. As you said we have bigger fish to fry and to fry
bigger fish your going to need a bigger fire.

And, I think you missed the point about Jake. I could have split each
belief in to just one person and negative effects would still have applied
to each person.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I guess we can agree that filtering should be about behavior and not
beliefs. But, then you go on to say that you would filter based on a
belief... which means the system would allow that? But you said it wouldn't
right in the beginning? How would you differentiate your filtering of a
belief from someone else's filtering of beliefs in the system? Would you
filter the belief based on the users beliefs? It gets hairy very quickly.
All of my examples would then apply to said system. I would keep shy from
filtering beliefs at all to keep from the negative consequences that it
would allow.

But I like the more details on the proposal. Your example of temporary
filtering is in fact a UI feature compared to a system feature, as long as
it doesn't hit save and effect other parts of the system. I am fine with
that because it would be in fact useful to view the posts based on topics
so you could be further informed on each side. But there is a different
between you explicitly doing it your self compared to the system
automatically doing it for you. The later is when you run into trouble.

Now we just need to find a way to test that your filtering does as intended
without the negative possibilities that can come from abuse of a filtering
system that I highlighted. But before that you need to decide on your
mission statement. Which then allows you to define a feature set to carry
it out. You seem to be very back and forth about what it would do and not
do. Maybe the negative consequences would be negligible and work fine.
Maybe not.

Also I think you should think bigger than it just being a forum interface.
You could actually put both arguments visually side by side effectively
doing what you want while minimizing the negative impacts.

Cheers,
James.

P.S. I think you missed the point about Jake. He was not meant to be an
actual representation but and example of how different ways filtering could
go wrong within the system. You could have made one person have just one of
each of those opinions and the flaws would still be there in each example.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Executive Summary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You saying, &quot;*me* choosing to do this based on information provided by
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users&quot; = euphemism for furthering your own bias justified that a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people agree with you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you filter based on political position *in general*.  But that
</I>&gt;<i> would make you prejudiced and so likely to be an authoritarian.  And
</I>&gt;<i> if you read my and Altemeyer's book you would know that allowing that
</I>&gt;<i> group to remove themselves from the process is a feature, not a bug:
</I>&gt;<i> they are irrational (or more accurately &quot;significantly more irrational
</I>&gt;<i> than Neurotypicals&quot;, since we all have this problem to one degree or
</I>&gt;<i> another) and generally contribute nothing to the debate unless maybe
</I>&gt;<i> the debate concerns why and how to commit genocide or other acts of
</I>&gt;<i> extreme prejudice, since they're the experts in that domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But Neurotypicals are *not* likely to do this, preferring instead to
</I>&gt;<i> use the system to filter out other types of problem posts.  And there
</I>&gt;<i> is lots of research to back up this claim.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People would make decisions on the filtering level before they actually
</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an educated opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This system leads to a false sense of reality because you are only seeing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part of the population or argument
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't help people see the nuances of the counter argument or the
</I>&gt;<i> deeper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; levels that need to be discussed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It actually encourages and rewards closed mindedness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You keep people from arguments that might actually change their opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; furthering ignorance on the topic
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of the above is a pretty good description of authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> behavior.  Good Job!  Maybe we can use people's using the filtering
</I>&gt;<i> system that way as a filter!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, it sounds like you would want to filter out people entirely
</I>&gt;<i> based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on one held opinion essentially saying, &quot;Because you believe this one
</I>&gt;<i> thing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Everything else you believe is invalid&quot;. That in psychology is called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Black
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and White Thinking&quot; and is labeled in the category of Thinking Errors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately filtering on political position, especially on a single
</I>&gt;<i> issue, is not what the system would do (or even allow, although now
</I>&gt;<i> that you bring it up I guess I could see how a third-party could use
</I>&gt;<i> the open data model to build a tool like that).  Again, maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> haven't spent time on these forums, but it is incredibly easy to spot
</I>&gt;<i> trolls and other problem participants, not by their political
</I>&gt;<i> persuasion (although there does seem to me a pretty high correlation
</I>&gt;<i> with authoritarianism) but by their tactics.  A good example is one of
</I>&gt;<i> the trolls my local paper's site that one of the editorial board
</I>&gt;<i> members asked me if my proposal would filter posts like his.  One of
</I>&gt;<i> the things he does is have &quot;canned screed&quot; that he posts whenever
</I>&gt;<i> certain issues come up (taxes, government regulation,
</I>&gt;<i> environmentalism, etc., you know the drill).  He even bragged to me
</I>&gt;<i> that the fact that he'd posted over 20,000 times to that forum doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> mean he wastes his whole life on it, instead had a &quot;system&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> locating and copy/pasting his screed that made him very efficient!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it would help if I suggest some flags that maybe you might find
</I>&gt;<i> more acceptable to filter on.  Note that you'd probably not want to
</I>&gt;<i> set the threshold too low, but if maybe 1% of people had flagged
</I>&gt;<i> someone as having multiple posts with one or more of these traits you
</I>&gt;<i> might consider adding them to the filter, and certainly if 50% of
</I>&gt;<i> people had you would want to:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Flamer (particularly ad hominem attacks)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Contrarian (gives downvotes/1 star ratings more than twice as often
</I>&gt;<i> as upvotes/5 star ratings)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Polyanna (the inverse of 2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Troll (screed designed to inflame or annoy rather than enlighten)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Mobster (lots of &quot;yeah, what he said&quot; posts).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) Profane (every thread ends in an explosion of swearing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Loose screw (posts that don't make sense or are internally inconsistent)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might want to keep 6 and 7 in my feed because they can be
</I>&gt;<i> entertaining, but have a very low tolerance for 1 and 4.  Others might
</I>&gt;<i> be the opposite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'd also like the option to easily turn filters on and off and
</I>&gt;<i> filter individuals.  Maybe a proposal is written such that half the
</I>&gt;<i> comments are from people who are one or more of the above, in which
</I>&gt;<i> case I'd know not to even bother analyzing it since it was obviously
</I>&gt;<i> written by a troll.  Or maybe one individual gets a little excited and
</I>&gt;<i> posts something snide after *every* other comment (I've seen it
</I>&gt;<i> happen) and I'd like to see what the conversation looks like without
</I>&gt;<i> that distraction.  I'd like option of keeping that person filtered if
</I>&gt;<i> I see this problem a lot, but maybe by default that filter would go
</I>&gt;<i> away at the end of the session if I didn't explicitly save it.  Or
</I>&gt;<i> again, if I want to filter out specific &quot;but the bible says&quot; people in
</I>&gt;<i> an abortion or separation of church and state proposal, I need to be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do that, at least temporarily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that flags might also be used to *boost* the odds that you see a
</I>&gt;<i> post based on your preferences by putting them at the top or calling
</I>&gt;<i> them out in some fashion.  For that there might be *positive* flags
</I>&gt;<i> such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Linker (provides useful links to external sites)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Scientist (provides links to academic research)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Wordsmith (expresses a thought very efficiently and/or elegantly)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Shaper (makes good suggestions about how to improve a proposal)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Inquisitor (asks key questions that must be answered before a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal could be approved)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are kind of derivative of the badges Stack Exchange uses, but
</I>&gt;<i> the tools are maybe a little sharper since the world we're working in
</I>&gt;<i> is a lot rougher than one where everybody is just trying to be helpful
</I>&gt;<i> as is (at least ostensibly) the motivation there.  I'd mostly be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in 2 and 5 in that second list and would want to see those
</I>&gt;<i> comments first.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: &quot;Jake&quot; sounds like an interesting character: I'll bet if he set
</I>&gt;<i> his filters the way you describe he'd be *very happy* if he discovered
</I>&gt;<i> he wasn't the only person who felt that way ;-)
