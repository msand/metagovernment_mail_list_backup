<PRE>If I may present a potential scenario:


- We all assume there will be an increase in activity from the general
public in politics with this new system in place, as individuals would have
a greater say.


-We also have to assume a drop-off in participation as the proposal goes
down the line. That is to say more people will vote on it at its final
stage then will help craft it.


- This creates small groups of advocates that could craft crazy proposals
and gain some interest for their cause. Whatever interest they generate
works against them though as their proposal becomes more popular, good
citizens of the world will begin to notice more and start to investigate
their potential weaknesses. This exposes any hidden agenda or truths as the
debate carries on.


- I surmise that a proposal should only go forward to a voting stage with
at least a 51% participation rate of all active members on the site. This
should be a difficult thing to do and will require sustained interest in
the proposal guaranteeing it remains near the top of the site to ensure it
gets seen.


- Participation does not necessary include making a post, as many users can
not be bothered to research a strong counter argument. Participation can
simply be reading the proposal a bit finding an opinion that reflects their
view on the issue and up voting that post. This up vote increases the
weight of that post in the discussion and makes their opinion a larger part
of the decision, exposing it as well to possible weaknesses.


- This process creates our pros and cons list that can be drafted and
presented in a simplified way to then move on to the voting stage where
still more of the public will be involved. A majority of 2/3 of the votes
take it. Everything is open and transparent the entire time.


- Participation is voluntary but there can be penalties for incorrectly
participating in the discussion. You can never be penalized for up voting
or voting. This limits input without limiting quality.


Any reason why this wouldn't work?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that doesn't seem like a problem to you? What if those people are

</I>&gt;<i> The first part is guaranteed, at least for a significant portion of
</I>&gt;<i> the proposals.  But the second part is our one great hope: Given
</I>&gt;<i> access to the appropriate information the Neurotypicals will make the
</I>&gt;<i> best decisions for themselves and everyone else.  Research on LPA
</I>&gt;<i> bands (Late Pleistocene Appropriate, aboriginal peoples (now almost
</I>&gt;<i> gone) living in the kind of social organization we had a for a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of million years and consequently evolved to function best in) shows
</I>&gt;<i> that that system *does* work, we just need to recreate it using
</I>&gt;<i> technology since there are there are just too many of us now (and we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have the option to do what the LPAs do when they run into
</I>&gt;<i> incorrigibly problematic individuals who don't respond to social
</I>&gt;<i> controls: banish them or sometimes just kill them ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One thing you didn't bring up that is potentially a bigger problem
</I>&gt;<i> than direct corruption is advertising of the kind we are seeing with
</I>&gt;<i> the Koch brothers vs. solar energy.  I don't see any way to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> that without unacceptable limitations on *all* speech.  But if we
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals do a good enough job preparing the &quot;con&quot; argument that
</I>&gt;<i> every individual should read prior to casting their vote, I believe we
</I>&gt;<i> can rely on the rationality of the rest of the Nuerotypicals to screen
</I>&gt;<i> out biased advertising and use only those pro/con statements when
</I>&gt;<i> making their decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course The Plan also includes a more effective way to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> problems like the Koch brothers: They inherited that money and I think
</I>&gt;<i> I make a pretty convincing case in the book that not only is that
</I>&gt;<i> inherently immoral, but it is simply not in the interest of the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the population to continue to allow that archaic custom to
</I>&gt;<i> continue.  That address again is:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't even think we disagree so much as differ in outlook: I'm
</I>&gt;<i> optimistic that with the right *system* we can workaround these human
</I>&gt;<i> maladaptations.  You seem a bit more pessimistic...
