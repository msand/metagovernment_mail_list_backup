<PRE>Tony,  Evergreen, near Olympia?

On the IP problem, figure it is difficult.  The reason it is difficult is
that we all want to make sure there is nothing what so ever  unowned
anywhere and that is a law  of the universe etc.  So what you have to do is
first establish ownership and have men with guns guarding the boundaries.
After that you can use an OSI license on the software copyrights.  I will
not touch that chosing.  I do note there is no OSI approved public domain
license as of a few weeks ago.  I might think the design elements could go
under a Creative Commons license.  There are also some  operations with
real patent attorneys that might help you out.  The structure there seems
to be an OSI patent pool and a way to officially publish to make your stuff
prior art.

As indicated above the first step is to establish ownership.  So you need a
way to pool your IP so that it can be defended.  It is hard for you to
defend it as separate individuals.

Assign a person to go visit a legal reference librarian and read everything
offered. Someone get access to Lexis and use it.  Have  another person
research online.   You should have a communications secretary to handle
correspondence, as for example, with the Apache foundation.  Find a
facilitator to help you ALL think together about this.  Notice none of this
is fun for people like you I expect.  TS.  On the other hand, you often do
not need any of these silly shoulds.  This is especially true if you do not
have the should that we should not all get ripped off.

Oh.  Since you are a student it is quite possible the college thinks they
can  own everything you are doing anyway.
