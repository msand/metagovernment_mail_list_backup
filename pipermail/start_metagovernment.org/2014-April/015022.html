<PRE>&quot;Much better is to *systematically*
marginalize trolls by identifying them (via aggregate ratings and
flagging) and use this information to filter their disruptive input
out of the information stream the majority of participants have to
deal with.&quot;
This sounds like a euphemism for removing free speech from those who make
to much trouble. Or, people as the group defines as idiots who have no idea
what they are talking about.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To discuss further about the following statement you made:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;..they're not even trying to solve the right problem,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which is that there is a (fortunately small) segment of the population
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which is *genetically programmed* to make their decisions based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; their prejudices and the direction given to them by their a priori
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; authorities. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the contrary, SettleIt.org was specifically designed to encourage
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to state and defend their prejudices and authorities. If it is used
</I>&gt;<i> instead
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of voting then you can only rely on an authority or prejudice when it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agreed to by all the other participants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly SettleIt.org is less susceptible to this problem than
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-based decision rules.  The can of worms it opens instead is
</I>&gt;<i> the issue of unequal votes: As there is no restriction on the number
</I>&gt;<i> of posts, any troll (read authoritarian) can game the system by
</I>&gt;<i> unethically flooding it with an endless onslaught of &quot;facts&quot; to raise
</I>&gt;<i> the confidence of posts they agree with or lower the confidence of
</I>&gt;<i> those they want to disappear.  True the Neurotypicals can fight back
</I>&gt;<i> on a post-by-post basis by removing or even editing the troll posts
</I>&gt;<i> (and what's up with that, anyway?) but this I think places an
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary burden on them.  Much better is to *systematically*
</I>&gt;<i> marginalize trolls by identifying them (via aggregate ratings and
</I>&gt;<i> flagging) and use this information to filter their disruptive input
</I>&gt;<i> out of the information stream the majority of participants have to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Voting encourages authoritarians as they do not need to directly justify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, but you're ignoring the key fact here which is that authoritarians
</I>&gt;<i> are a relatively small minority of the population.  The problem with
</I>&gt;<i> our current system is that they (and their partners in crime the
</I>&gt;<i> Social Dominators) gravitate toward positions of power and so muck up
</I>&gt;<i> the operation of representative governments by distorting the numbers.
</I>&gt;<i>  Once we bring the Neurotypicals up to their evolutionarily-specified
</I>&gt;<i> numbers in the system, this effects of this problem just goes away
</I>&gt;<i> even though the flaw in individual decision making philosophy itself
</I>&gt;<i> remains.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I read quite a bit of <A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf">http://www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf</A> . I was not
</I>&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to find what was new or unique about the decision making process in The
</I>&gt;<i> Plan
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that would discourage decisions based on prejudices and the direction
</I>&gt;<i> given
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by priori authorities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct.  Direct democracy and the fact that they are a relative
</I>&gt;<i> minority solves the problem directly *PROVIDED* that the decision rule
</I>&gt;<i> is majority based and one-vote per individual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The most specific description of the process I can find is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;Basic components of The System will include forums where topics to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; debated are introduced and discussed, with the best ideas determined by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; popular vote to be formulated into laws and promoted to a voting forum
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The People will vote to adopt or reject them (a meritocracy, or more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; properly mericracy, of ideas). &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This seems to be the same as many direct democracy systems. Is there a
</I>&gt;<i> new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept or angle I am missing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I think you've understand it perfectly.  I'm not claiming all (or
</I>&gt;<i> even any) of the ideas in The Plan are new or unique, but merely that
</I>&gt;<i> it is a way to *choose* which new or unique ideas should be
</I>&gt;<i> implemented (like direct democracy) and which need to be left out
</I>&gt;<i> (like consensus-based or veto-enabled decision rules).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks you,
