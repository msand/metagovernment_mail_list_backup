<PRE>The reason you use python is because the development cycle can be so much
faster. Not because it doesn't have it's weaknesses. Where with rails, you
sort of have to do it their way or it becomes very painful.

Normally the logic part of web apps is pretty straightforward the hard part
is making everything talk together over the web that is difficult(database,
templating, user authentication, etc), and then there is JavaScript(which I
agree is horrible) if you want to do anything client side. Django makes
that part very easy, and flask would be more bare bones if you wanted to do
it more hands on. I would say at least read the django tutorial before you
write it off. It sounds like you understand code pretty well so I think you
could build what you are saying pretty quick there.

Then there is deploying it on some envoirnment to use it. Webfaction is
good for this or you good go platform as a service. But you should decide
where you are going to deploy before you build it so you can make sure of
their constraints or best practices they provide.

@max platform as a service is awesome which is why I mentioned GAE, but
there are many others, like heroku. But, you have to build something to go
on the platform first.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Your technological ignorance is showing a little in your last post. Is
</I>&gt;<i> what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ment to say.  You really wish we would have stayed with software
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applications instead of moving to the serverside applications?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely.  Going a little off topic here, but the browser-based
</I>&gt;<i> architecture is incredibly limited, complicated, and brittle (meaning
</I>&gt;<i> it breaks with every little change, like version upgrades).
</I>&gt;<i> iPhone/Android is a little better because most things are apps and so
</I>&gt;<i> the developer has more control, but *ideally* versioning and
</I>&gt;<i> extensions would have been built into the OSs a long time ago so, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, instead of JavaScript which is a complete POS (and everyone
</I>&gt;<i> knows it which is why there are so many extensions and workarounds for
</I>&gt;<i> it), apps could have been built in any scripting language and the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary engines and libraries downloaded on the fly.  This problem
</I>&gt;<i> could have been solved at several different junctures (e.g., when
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft added automatically downloaded OS updates for Windows 95,
</I>&gt;<i> when HTML was originally defined to purposely exclude interactive
</I>&gt;<i> elements, or when Netscape chose to build in a weekend-hack scripting
</I>&gt;<i> language instead of defining an open architecture, etc.) but due to
</I>&gt;<i> shortsightedness and proprietary-think never has been.  Like I said,
</I>&gt;<i> if it the web had been *designed* instead of evolving with the bizarre
</I>&gt;<i> set of constraints it has, I'd have a working voting system up and
</I>&gt;<i> running in days or weeks whereas now it's going to take me months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for &quot;ignorance&quot;, I'll cop to that as, like I think I said, I burned
</I>&gt;<i> out and retired from software development about 10 years ago and so am
</I>&gt;<i> having to learn a lot about the current environment (and not liking it
</I>&gt;<i> much at all).  But I've been developing software from microcode and
</I>&gt;<i> assembly languages through 3GLs and 4GLs up to AI languages since I
</I>&gt;<i> was a kid (40 years ago) so I think I have a pretty good awareness of
</I>&gt;<i> what works and what doesn't.  And as for django/pyramid/flask or
</I>&gt;<i> anything based on Tcl or Python, talk about &quot;old school&quot;!  I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> touch either of those languages with a 10 foot pole.  Of course, it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't help that the product I burned out developing was a major
</I>&gt;<i> competitor of those languages and yet still exists as a commercial
</I>&gt;<i> product (after enabling me to retire, unlike the the developers of
</I>&gt;<i> those other languages, who got the fame instead ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I've finished the main Rails tutorial I'm considerably less
</I>&gt;<i> enamored of it.  The main concept that comes to my mind is &quot;bag on the
</I>&gt;<i> side&quot;.  The whole development environment is really just a collection
</I>&gt;<i> of hacks, kluges, preprocessors, and workarounds instead of a unified
</I>&gt;<i> architecture (which is why I had to spend the first few hours in the
</I>&gt;<i> tutorial *fixing* version incompatibilities in it!).  It's really
</I>&gt;<i> designed for professional full-time developers who must deal with a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of different projects for different clients and where a project
</I>&gt;<i> may get passed around among several developers not all of whom will be
</I>&gt;<i> familiar with the overall design.  Which unfortunately doesn't really
</I>&gt;<i> describe this project.   I've written to my old crew to see if maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it might be faster and easier to customize the old product (which is
</I>&gt;<i> now open source) than punish myself by doing it the Rails way, but
</I>&gt;<i> using Rails is still the backup plan.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I have a hard time believing this would eclipse Facebook someday.
</I>&gt;<i> In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the US you vote 1 time ever 4 years and how much time do they actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research and post opinions about it? Not very much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe my FB &quot;friends&quot; are different, but although I'd agree that stuff
</I>&gt;<i> like cat videos and pictures of food are still the main fare, bitching
</I>&gt;<i> about governments, corporations, etc. make up a significant percentage
</I>&gt;<i> of the posts.  Imagine what it would be like if they actually believed
</I>&gt;<i> that posting would *change* things...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  How much do they hang
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; out and talk with their friends? A lot lot more. They even watch cat
</I>&gt;<i> videos
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more. I think a good measure of this is day to day how much does the
</I>&gt;<i> average
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person talk politics? If you can answer that, I think you would get a
</I>&gt;<i> good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
