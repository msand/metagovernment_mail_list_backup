<PRE>&quot;
but I think we have to assume
and adapt to the fact that the better funded/more motivated special
interests *will* have a much higher generation and approval rate for
their proposals.
&quot;
that doesn't seem like a problem to you? What if those people are
authoritarian as you describe and the people believe them?

I guess we are going to have to agree to disagree.

Cheers,
James

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Self chosen (volunteer).  This is just the way things naturally work,
</I>&gt;<i> and work in our current systems: People interested in particular
</I>&gt;<i> issues (those pesky &quot;special interests&quot;) are the ones who will be
</I>&gt;<i> willing to get their hands dirty generating and refining proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> It is simply not reasonable to expect *everyone* to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> this part of the process because they don't have the time or the
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge or even the interest in doing so.  This is the fatal flaw in
</I>&gt;<i> most of the other systems I see on Metagovernment which seem to assume
</I>&gt;<i> unlimited participation rates.  The notable exception being Blinap
</I>&gt;<i> which solves this problem via sampling (which, although it would work,
</I>&gt;<i> has other shortcomings that I've addressed previously).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, if they provide that perq to *every* voter, that's not a broken
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system, that's a benevolent dictator ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doesn't actually address the issue. It is just redirection. How will you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keep those small groups from being corrupted?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesn't matter: If they get corrupted, at least to the extent that
</I>&gt;<i> the resulting proposal conflicts with the needs of the many, the
</I>&gt;<i> majority-rule vote at the end will simply reject that proposal.  This
</I>&gt;<i> matter is discussed further in my book, but I think we have to assume
</I>&gt;<i> and adapt to the fact that the better funded/more motivated special
</I>&gt;<i> interests *will* have a much higher generation and approval rate for
</I>&gt;<i> their proposals.  But this is not necessarily a bad thing because it
</I>&gt;<i> is a counterbalance to the &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; problem.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> mainly a problem in our current representative governments because of
</I>&gt;<i> practices like logrolling (vote swapping) where the corruption bubbles
</I>&gt;<i> up from the committee level to the floor vote level.  That can't
</I>&gt;<i> happen in a direct democracy because organizing it would be akin to
</I>&gt;<i> herding cats.
