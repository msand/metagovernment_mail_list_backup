We could try to pull Vilfredo into the theatre app without Pietro's
help, but it might be taken as an attack rather than a demonstration.
Pietro is not alone in his opposition to the idea of cross-project
facilities; opposition and incomprehension are nigh universal.  At the
same time, I'm mindful that he's a longstanding participant here -
even something of a host - where I still feel like a guest.

&gt;<i> I thought about replying to Michael's comment on the wiki, but I

</I>&gt;<i> there may indeed be a wealth of information in the months of
</I>&gt;<i> list-based discussion, not everyone has time or ability to read
</I>&gt;<i> through that much intense technical discussion and comprehend it
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly. I would very much like to hear more than a few minutes
</I>&gt;<i> about the nature of pollwiki and crossforum. In that discussion, it
</I>&gt;<i> would also be appropriate to cover the nature of these projects in
</I>&gt;<i> the wider ecosystem of projects, and how they can be developed
</I>&gt;<i> without undermining Metagov's umbrella status.
</I>
To save time, here is the summary presentation I will read aloud at
the meeting:

  * Crossforum Theatre - Crossforum Theatre sits at the front end of
    the Outcast voting network. It is a free floating, user interface
    (UI) layer onto the network. The network may have many such UI
    layers, each independent of the other. Each serves to glue the
    disparate components of the network together in terms of user
    operability, giving the whole the look and feel of a single
    &quot;application&quot;.

  * Pollwikis - Pollwikis sit at the back end of the Outcast voting
    network. Pollwikis are shared databases. The network may have many
    such shared databases, but the pollwikis are the most
    indispensible. Together they serve to glue the disparate
    components of the network together in terms of data operability,
    giving the whole the functionality of a single &quot;application&quot;.

  * Outcast - Outcast is a communication network for public voting. It
    enables people to vote together on common issues while remaining
    free as individuals to choose their own facilities and methods of
    voting. Some methods of voting depend on external facilities such
    as drafting or discussion, and Outcast extends freedom of choice
    to those as well.

&gt;<i> I'm altering the wiki to reflect the above, including rearranging the  
</I>&gt;<i> items on the agenda for better flow. I put &quot;presentation of active  
</I>&gt;<i> projects&quot; before solicitations for help, so that attendees can have a  
</I>&gt;<i> broader view of what projects are up to and make a more informed  
</I>&gt;<i> decision about where their help could be best applied.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still have the question: can Skype handle a voice meeting format?  
</I>&gt;<i> And if so, how?
</I>
I added instructions here:

Who can do the invites at the start of the meeting?  I'd do them
myself, but my Skype box is rather slow (in case that's a factor).
