</I>
Both are interrelated, are they not? We reach out in order to come 
together. In the end we want 6 billion people to come together. (Come 
together in the public spere as a whole. If this happens to be in a 
single forum or platform ... fine, but it probably will exceed even the 
internet as a whole.) To all come together we have to reach out to each 
other. So I agree, that (ii) is very important to achieve (i).

And these are the most efficient means I see atm (so imo not a separate 
topic):

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about tagging:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Individuals expressing on their pages, what topics they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in, what communities they are in, what polls they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active in. And the same for each of the four aspects. Now this seems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very helpfull for iii.  and iv. (and much more) because its kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard to get this info out of plain textual positions. A fifth
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> category comes to my mind: Personal values ... very expressive and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit different than topics, are they not? I remember DemocracyLab had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this integrated.
