<PRE>I have been looking into the requirements for migrating the current  
site to the TuxFamily host, and to do so, I have to resolve where the  
wiki should reside. It comes to a question of the below:

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metagov content then would be stored as subpages of the area page.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> See for example how Toronto's pages are named:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:PrefixIndex/Tor">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:PrefixIndex/Tor</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The only pages sitting at top level in a multi-area wiki are the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pages themselves: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Area">http://u.zelea.com/w/Category:Area</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But there also needs to be &quot;meta&quot;content which is outside the scope  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the issue-related content: something that helps orient people to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> site when they first visit it. Could you flip the idea, and have all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the area pages inside a directory and all related content in sub-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directories of that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately no.  A multi-area pollwiki is a logical stand-in for
</I>&gt;<i> multiple wikis.  If we allowed meta-content, then it would seem to
</I>&gt;<i> take priority over area content.  If an area admin disagreed with the
</I>&gt;<i> meta-content, then he'd be tempted to decamp and set up a pollwiki of
</I>&gt;<i> his own.  We can't support that yet and don't want to spend time on it
</I>&gt;<i> till it's crucial, so we came up with the idea of a strictly neutral,
</I>&gt;<i> multi-area pollwiki, just as a stopgap.  More here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht</A>
</I>
After reading this a through several times and thinking on it, I begin  
to see the wisdom in it. Metagov is just another project, which itself  
is in need of governance, so it makes sense for it to be an &quot;area.&quot;

But, Michael, Thomas, and Conseo, I have to admit, I have lost  
perspective of the difference between Metagov, Votorola, and  
Crossforum as they exist in your mind. Is a pollwiki strictly a  
function of Votorola or of the crossforum? Or do you see it as simply  
a discussion tool that can be annexed into any voting system (i.e.,  
free-range drafting)?

(Please note, I'm not trying to draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot; here. I just  
can't tell what is what, and I think it is useful for developers to  
occasionally step back and give a little documentation of what they're  
thinking of. I am having a tough time following a lot of the recent  
threads because I'm not sure what object they are really about, and  
how that object fits in with the others being discussed. I have to  
imagine that a lot of other list members feel the same. You could have  
more participation in this process if you can help clarify these ideas  
in non-developer-speak, and let people know precisely where help is  
needed. Please feel free to spin off a different thread called  
&quot;status&quot; or something, if appropriate.)

Separately, if Metagov were to be an Area within a pollwiki, would you  
see it as still appropriate to at least have a shell of meta content,  
such as the simplistic draft discussed in the thread I just posted on?
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>
Something to act as a gateway for people who don't know what they are  
looking at.


&gt;&gt;<i> Neither that nor your solution sounds very elegant. Are you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> envisioning merging the two wikis? Couldn't they exist side-by-side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely.  A pollwiki is a user-editable database of polling data
</I>&gt;<i> and related content.  It may contain non-polling content too, but only
</I>&gt;<i> if that makes sense and is convenient.  The best arrangement for
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov is probably:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a) Ordinary content in ordinary wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  b) Polling related data/content in an area of the common pollwiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later Metagov can go independent if necessary by upgrading the
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary wiki into a pollwiki proper (semantic extensions etc.) and
</I>&gt;<i> migrating the polling data/content across.  You'd have to deploy your
</I>&gt;<i> own cluster of vote-servers too, so this is no small operation.  See:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul</A>
</I>
If instead we go the parallel route, then would it make logistical  
sense to have each be a subdomain of the (Tux-hosted) Metagov site?  
That would mean something like:
polls.metagovernment.org - pollwiki (a concept I am still unclear on,  
as noted above)
project.metagovernment.org - the current metagov wiki
www.metagovernment.org - a small shell, with a simplistic home page,  
and links to the other two.
...perhaps. Does that seem right?

In detailing all of the above, I'm wondering if a live meeting  
wouldn't be a better venue for working some of this out. We haven't  
had one of those in a while anyway...
