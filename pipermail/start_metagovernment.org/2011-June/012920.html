<PRE>Thank you Matteo and Ed for your efforts! In German we have a saying: 
What takes long becomes eventually good in the end! I know, thats not 
much of consolation though, but I thought I write it anyway ...

</I>&gt;<i> I am trying to find the time to migrate the existing Metagovernment

</I>&gt;<i> that, then I'll know what is needed in terms of coding to get it up 
</I>&gt;<i> and running.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But all of those projects combined are a lot of man-hours (and a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of little technical details to work through), and it will probably be 
</I>&gt;<i> a while before I can get to them all. I'd be happy to have help with 
</I>&gt;<i> any of those tasks, but I do think they should happen in that order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently, I have databases created (but empty) for the wiki, list, 
</I>&gt;<i> and forum.
</I>&gt;<i> Next I have to finalize with Michael that I can migrate the wiki as I 
</I>&gt;<i> intend.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I need to move the wiki, list, and domain name in one big gulp. 
</I>&gt;<i> That's tough.
</I>&gt;<i> Then I can set up phpBB 3 and then M2F.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first option would have been to integrate the forum with the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have quite some experience in dealing with hiring programmers by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the internet and this has always been problematic at times.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All the four programmers I already know have declined the job.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I currently do not see how I can help further on this integration 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between forum and mailing list and I apologize for not having been 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> able to help further.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think at the moment there are three options available:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) leave the mailing list as such and leave the forum idea completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) wait for new technology that may help integrate the forum with the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list in a more easy way in the near future
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) proceed with setting up a discussion forum in parallel of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mailing list for a fixed trial time of (say) one month and hire two 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programmers to move the messages back and forth from the mailing list 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the forum and the other way around in (more or less) real time. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After the trial time is over, we can vote which solution is better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Solution number three would need some further discussion before being 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am in favour of any solution Ed, Thomas, Mike, Conseo and everybody 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agrees on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe it would be nice to have a discussion upon this.
