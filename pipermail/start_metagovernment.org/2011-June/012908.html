If alpha users gave us the thumbs up in regard to a beta promotion,
then I'd say &quot;Go for it!&quot;  But we had 4 alpha users and none of them
advised us that we're ready for beta.  We only just completed the
design of the alpha prototype this month.  We can do about 3-4 months
of coding without any users at all.  It's actually faster that way and
will bring us a step closer to beta.  The main drawback is that
development will no longer be open to non-techs - Thomas excepted,
since he already owns pieces of the design - which exposes us to
design flaws on our blind side.

Experience teaches me (though I sometimes forget the lesson) that any
attempt to communicate technology via ideas, designs or other
generalities is a waste of time.  You said as much in one of your
earlier posts Alex, and I thought, &quot;Wow!  This guy understands
engineering.&quot;  The only way to connect with non-technologists is via
hands on practice.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while I was reading the reply about alpha users in this mailing list, I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thinking that maybe we should think about reaching for a larger community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the community already exist, but involves mainly technical people,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not the usual people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it is good to have a inner community of people working on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project, but it would be even better to have a larger community of people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; supporting (even if not directly involved  in) Votorola and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment project as externals as this would help making more people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; knowing about the project (people speaking to other people by word of mouth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; / Facebook)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I propose the following: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1)    build a Twitter account to Twitter the last updates about the Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2)    build a Facebook page for Votorola and/or for the whole Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3)    Make a Flash site for Votorola with a graphic presentation, to attract
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-technical guys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4)    The whole Votorola site can be embedded in/be part of the new flash
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; site 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5)    Have a banner exchange for Votorola with other sites, so that people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can know about Votorola from other sites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition of course of having a forum site (in discussion in a separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thread).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a Twitter and Facebook page can be opened quite easily, I can also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help in case we may want to build a good presentation site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only thing is that maybe it can be too early for this effort in reach a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; larger community, as we may want to have a beta version or a final version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Votorola available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So we may decide to postpone this effort somewhere in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, shall the above be done for Votorola only or for the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment project?
</I>
