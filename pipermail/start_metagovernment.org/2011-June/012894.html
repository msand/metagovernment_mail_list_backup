<PRE>Hi Ned,
Thanks for your quick and positive response.
Do you know Latour's work?
One place that might be of interest to start is <A HREF="http://www.macospol.com/">http://www.macospol.com/</A>
also:<A HREF="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography.html">http://www.bruno-latour.fr/biography.html</A>
ANT or actor network theory argues that actants may be nonhuman as well as
human so things do &quot;speak&quot;.
I did read the appraisal vs. voting document,superficially I'm afraid but I
don't yet have a sense of how this would work in practice.  I was suggesting
that networks are linked in alliances and are opposed in controversies.
actions.  States of affairs are the outcomes of controversies. For real
shifts to take place  a reassembly of networks, human/nonhuman must take
place , This is occurring for example as we move toward the Singularity, as
the exponential acceleration of technological evolution leads toward
convergence and the development of hybrid  intelligence. Decision time will
vastly decrease and decision constituency will vastly increase. There still
will remain I fear the issue of rogue tribes aligned for seeking their own
interests who will oppose  enlightened tribes dedicated to global justice.
Not sure how appraisal will help if it is not universally adopted? Sorry for
this shorthand for what deserves a longer discussion.
All the best,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> Steve, Greetings!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I read with interest your paper *Rethinking Things*. Great stuff!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the paper you said:
</I>&gt;<i> Until such time we must learn to attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;<i> and one another in order to let things speak so we can return to honoring
</I>&gt;<i> one another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your email you said:
</I>&gt;<i> So given your appraisal idea it would be necessary to give non humans
</I>&gt;<i> representation and a voice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Am I correct that the mechanism you have in mind &quot;to give non humans
</I>&gt;<i> representation and a voice&quot; is to &quot;attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;<i> and one another&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, it appears to me that the appraisal system is indeed just what would
</I>&gt;<i> be needed to enable that voice (speaking through attuned humans) to manifest
</I>&gt;<i> reliably in the realm of social decision making. To me our work seems highly
</I>&gt;<i> complementary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (From what you wrote in the email, I couldn't quite tell whether you were
</I>&gt;<i> making a suggestion having read the summary, or making a suggestion having
</I>&gt;<i> read the work itself. If the latter, please let me know. I had thought that,
</I>&gt;<i> in the work itself, it was pretty clear that giving non humans a voice was
</I>&gt;<i> one of my main concerns, and one of the major design aims of the system. If
</I>&gt;<i> that wasn't clear, I will need to do some more rewriting, and I could use
</I>&gt;<i> your help in guiding me regarding what to write.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding &quot;decisions come from alliances,&quot; certainly in public voting
</I>&gt;<i> systems, legislatures, bureaucracies, and corporations many decisions do
</I>&gt;<i> involve alliances, and tribes. However, the same history that supports that
</I>&gt;<i> view also supports the view that non humans and future generations and other
</I>&gt;<i> entities that cannot directly join the alliances generally suffer when
</I>&gt;<i> decisions come from alliances of tribes. Alliances of tribes tend to put
</I>&gt;<i> their own interests ahead of the interests of those outside of the
</I>&gt;<i> alliances. A &quot;nobody objects&quot; consensus system (such as the appraisal
</I>&gt;<i> system) can much more reliably support the interests of non humans (through
</I>&gt;<i> even only a few attuned humans). In such a system, decisions do not come
</I>&gt;<i> from alliances, and protection of non humans does not depend in each
</I>&gt;<i> particular decision on &quot;the generosity of strangers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding building tribes who share the value of a more harmonious and just
</I>&gt;<i> relationship between humans and non-humans, yes! And also, I would hope and
</I>&gt;<i> expect that such tribes will see the wisdom of having a social decision
</I>&gt;<i> making system that can be trusted to uphold that value in every decision.
