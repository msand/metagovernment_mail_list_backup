<PRE>Hi all,
I got a reply from Sandesh about the payment.
He is asking me for USD500 or higher amount for the work as it is 
complicated.
I guess there are five options available:
&#160;
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; keep the mailing list as it is and forget about the forum


2)&#160;&#160;&#160; keep looking for a programmer that can do the job for a lower amount 
(but I have already searched a lot) 
3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; pay USD500-USD1000 for the forum integration with Sandesh

4)&#160;&#160;&#160; set up a new forum totally independent from the mailing list (no open 
ID integration, no messages automatically going from one way&#160;to the other) but 
inside the metagovernment site.
Copy all the messages and all the accounts in the forum and allow the 
people to use both the forum and the mailing list to post messages.
I can pay&#160;one or two&#160;programmers that&#160;copy messages from the mailing 
list&#160;to the forum manually.
This way, whenever a person posts in the mailing list, the programmer will 
copy manually the message to the forum and whenever a person posts in the forum, 
from the forum to the mailing list in almost real time
We will have a parallel management of mailing list and forum, and people 
can use indifferently both.
After one month of parallel management, we will look if people like to use 
the forum or the mailing list.
Please understand that there will be no change to the mailing list 
whatsoever! 
The mailing list will keep working as usual while only new posts from the 
forum will be added in the mailing list in a transparent way.
In this way, we can see if the forum idea is good and if people like it, if 
nobody uses the forum after one month we will silently close the forum and 
nothing will change.

In this case, I believe I can help paying for the setup 100%.
5)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; go directly for a new forum as above but without parallel management period
In this case too, I believe I can help paying for the setup 100%.


Please, let me know if you have any other idea or how we should 
proceed.

Maybe, we can have a two-step vote when we can vote among the five options and second step vote between the two options which got more votes in the first step.
