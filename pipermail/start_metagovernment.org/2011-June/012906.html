<PRE>As few of you may know, in the last few weeks I have worked quite hard to 
help this community grow larger with one of what I believe may become a &quot;killer 
tool&quot; (hopefully.. maybe just my imagination) for the whole Votorola project: a 
discussion forum that may help other people to more easily get involved in the 
discussion.
The first option would have been to integrate the forum with the mailing 
list but all the attempts I have made to find people to do the job have so far 
failed.
I have quite some experience in dealing with hiring programmers by 
the internet and this has always been problematic at times.
All the four programmers I already know have declined the job.
I currently do not see how I can help further on this integration between 
forum and mailing list and I apologize for not having been able to help further. 

&#160;
I think at the moment there are three options available:
1) leave the mailing list as such and leave the forum idea 
completely
2) wait for new technology that may help integrate the forum with the 
mailing list in a more easy way in the near future
3) proceed with setting up a discussion forum in parallel of the mailing 
list for a fixed trial time of (say) one month and hire two programmers to 
move the messages back and forth from the mailing list to the forum and the 
other way around in (more or less) real time. After the trial time is over, we 
can vote which solution is better.
&#160;
Solution number three would need some further discussion before being 
implemented.
I am in&#160;favour of any solution Ed, Thomas, Mike, Conseo and everybody 
agrees on.
Maybe it would be nice to have a discussion upon this.


Regards,
Matteo Martini
