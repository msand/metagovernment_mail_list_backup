<PRE>Hi Armando,

I guess the participants would:

 1. Talk, draft and vote till they have a consensus of 5,000, or so
 2. Sign the consensus draft as a petition
 3. Submit the petition

Is that correct?
 
&gt;<i> However, I think the platform (apart from the necessary translation to

Currently we have only an alpha prototype.  To develop it into a beta
for this application, we'd need to work closely with a small number of
alpha users.  We'd need at least 2 more than we have now.  They'd be
surfacing problems and participating in the design of solutions.

 * Skills - tolerance, imagination, communication
 * Workload - maybe 1-2 hours a day on average

&gt;<i> ... Translating and Install it on a new domain and removing some
</I>&gt;<i> features?
</I>
Hosting of the beta deployment shouldn't be a problem.  The admins
would have time to decide on that.  Do you have deadlines?  Or what
are your expectations timewise?
