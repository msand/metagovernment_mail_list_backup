<PRE>Dear Michael, Ed, Thomas,
thanks for the sharing.

Michael, I was not aware that you were feeling as a guest, please
understand it was not my intention.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to change this. (BTW, I do
also feel a bit as a guest respect to Ed...)

My doubts respect to Crossforum are on a theoretical basis. I feel
that different voting systems are so intrinsically diverse (even in
the kind of information they gather from people) that trying to make a
system that modulates between them is not always possible. And if it
is not always possible, it would not be universal, thus loosing the
primary relevance of the work. Take, for example, the difference
between system where people vote multiple times (in France, when they
chose their president) , or vote by indicating just one name, or
multiple names in order, or all the names acceptable, and so on. I
tried to convince people in this forum about this at the beginning, I
seemed to be unable to do this, so (since you cannot prove a negative)
I just waited for you to try it, and reach the same conclusion by
yourself. Or prove me wrong with an example.

Since I don't think the project will be universal, I do not see much
the point in participating. But, maybe my intuition is wrong. So
limited by not believing in it, but not being able to prove my point I
decided to step out from this project, wait and see. And somehow
concentrate on Vilfredo &amp; C.

Vilfredo releases XML of the state of the questions in a room. We can
also develop the XML for the state of the proposals in a question. Of
course we can only release the information that is also available
through html. But that information we have no problem in releasing it
fully.

This is in case true for most rooms, and all the common ones. A
different discourse could happen for private rooms. We are considering
to &quot;sell&quot; for companies, and private groups that wants to have their
own special room that is only available to them, and secure. This
would permit to Vilfredo to start earning some money, so we can focus
on the project fully. Derek has been working on Vilfredo as a non paid
volunteer for close to one year now, and he is not, as me, working for
the university...

But the common rooms informations are available. So there is no need
to pull the information from Vilfredo without my help
 If I can help I will be happy to help and it will not be seen as an
attack.  But Vilfredo has also its special quirks. It has generations,
it has proposals that pass the filter (the proposals in the Pareto
Front). How are you going to do this in a system that generally only
takes normal voting systems? One thing that I wil not do, is saying
that Crossforum has captured the gist of Vilfredo, if I feel something
fundamental is missing.

In any case, I doubt Crossforum can be as Meta as some people here
believe it will be. But I am absolutely happy to collaborate to make
sure that the public informations are released in an xml format that
can be used by the rest of you. Would this help?

My skype name is &quot;pietrosperoni&quot;. Since we are using skype maybe it
would be good if we could all write our skype name in the wiki page.

I also don't have a lot of bandwidth, so I cannot host the
conversation, but I am very happy to participate in it.

I have read the presentation you wrote here, I have many questions
that I would like to ask, but I will wait for the conversation. Also I
think it would be good if someone could record the whole meeting, so
we can keep it for &quot;posterity&quot; ;-).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thoroughly. I would very much like to hear more than a few minutes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the nature of pollwiki and crossforum. In that discussion, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would also be appropriate to cover the nature of these projects in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the wider ecosystem of projects, and how they can be developed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without undermining Metagov's umbrella status.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To save time, here is the summary presentation I will read aloud at
</I>&gt;<i> the meeting:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Crossforum Theatre - Crossforum Theatre sits at the front end of
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;the Outcast voting network. It is a free floating, user interface
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;(UI) layer onto the network. The network may have many such UI
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;layers, each independent of the other. Each serves to glue the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;disparate components of the network together in terms of user
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;operability, giving the whole the look and feel of a single
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;&quot;application&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Pollwikis - Pollwikis sit at the back end of the Outcast voting
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;network. Pollwikis are shared databases. The network may have many
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;such shared databases, but the pollwikis are the most
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;indispensible. Together they serve to glue the disparate
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;components of the network together in terms of data operability,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;giving the whole the functionality of a single &quot;application&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;* Outcast - Outcast is a communication network for public voting. It
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;enables people to vote together on common issues while remaining
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;free as individuals to choose their own facilities and methods of
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;voting. Some methods of voting depend on external facilities such
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;as drafting or discussion, and Outcast extends freedom of choice
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;to those as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm altering the wiki to reflect the above, including rearranging the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> items on the agenda for better flow. I put &quot;presentation of active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> projects&quot; before solicitations for help, so that attendees can have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broader view of what projects are up to and make a more informed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision about where their help could be best applied.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I still have the question: can Skype handle a voice meeting format?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And if so, how?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I added instructions here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Attendees">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Attendees</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Who can do the invites at the start of the meeting? &#160;I'd do them
</I>&gt;<i> myself, but my Skype box is rather slow (in case that's a factor).
