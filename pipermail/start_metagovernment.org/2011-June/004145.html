You're both admins of the Metagov wiki. Pietro, you're the longest- 
standing active member of the project after me, and Michael, you have  
destroy-level admin privileges on the host where the project is  
moving. And you're each working on two of the most active projects in  
the group. I'd say you're both very much core members of Metagov.

I've never wanted this to be &quot;my&quot; project and am always looking for  
ways to hand off or at least share any administrative powers I may  
have in order to make it more open. Please let me know what I can do  
to make this your project more than mine. That's a question to  
everyone, not just Michael and Pietro.
