<PRE>Hi Michael

Please see my response inline:

</I>
Very interesting. It has obviously evolved a lot respect to how it was
when we first spoke about it.

I would suggest that you try to pull the information from one page
from Vilfredo. We now have generational page, so that each generation
has all the information about that generation (proposal from before,
new proposals, by whom, who voted what, resulting pareto front, graph
of the voting structure, key people, and so on) all in one single
page. You can access it from the history page of a question. We still
lack a sensible way to move between the pages. It's on the todo list.

so that one page should be the right page for you to get all the info.
Or the history page. I think the history page of each question should
have its own rss, so the information can be read in machine readable
format.

Regarding Pareto Efficiency in theory and in practice, I don't know. I
would have to study that in the details. Beside we are moving on from
that too, defining another different form of Pareto Optimality ...

&gt;<i>Can your users draft their
</I>&gt;<i> answers in wiki pages?
</I>
Of course people are free to do what they want, but so far it is not
implemented inside VgtA in any way shape or form. People would have to
write in a wiki page that they want the proposal and try to invite the
people there. We have an example of this happening in a recent
question:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=113">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=113</A>

We have thought about, when you have two key people of the same
proposal, to invite them to write collaboratively the answer. We
haven't implemented yet, but is in the &quot;to think over&quot; list.

But all this has to do with people working on editing an existing
proposal. Not so much in writing a proposal from scratch. Maybe we
could have a place where all the people that have been invited to a
question are listed, and then you can invite some to write a
collaborative text. The problem in all this is that it undermines the
whole structure of Vilfredo. No big deal with that, IF that works, but
our experience is that wiki by themselves lead to wikiwar, so vilfredo
was trying to generate an alternative.

An idea I had from a long time is to set up a Vilfredo system inside a
wiki. And this maybe could be an integration of Votorola with
Vilfredo. The idea is that when there is a wikiwar, then (and only
then) Vilfredo would be used. And only for the paragraphs that people
disagree with. Each party writing alternative versions, each person
voting all the versions that support, and then the Pareto Front would
all be represented in the wiki, side by side. So that no one solution
is above the other.

I think this could be used, for example, in the IPCC (in
<A HREF="http://IPCC.ch">http://IPCC.ch</A>) to write their report, and would generate a better
result. You know that for something to appear in the IPCC report it
has to be supported by a certain percentage of scientist. This makes
the report ALWAYS err on the safe side (which is dangerous). Always
claiming that the clime will be less bad as it turns out to be. Giving
the possibility to have the various possibilities on the side would
prevent that.



&gt;<i> &#160;If so, then this opens up possibilities:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(a) Free-range drafting. &#160;The users may choose which wiki to draft
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;in, and the choice may vary from question to question.
</I>


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(b) Difference bridging. &#160;Wherever two draft answers are
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;sufficiently similar, the users may easily view the differences.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;They may eliminate them by erasure, if they wish, and bring the
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;overall &quot;population&quot; one step closer to consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(c) Facilitate discussion. &#160;Wherever the difference bridge is
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;employed in this manner (b), it serves to formally interconnect
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;drafting, voting and discussion media in a way that supports
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;focused discussion in a single forum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(d) Facilitate growth. &#160;Any such discussion in a single forum is
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;automatically exposed in Crossforum Theatre, where it is mapped
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;in geospace, votespace, forum space, topic space, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;If a &quot;question&quot; can possibly grow in terms of its participation,
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;then the physical and logical dimensions of that growth are
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;clearly shown.
</I>

I would like to know what is votespace, forum space, and topic space
but I am scared that the resulting answer will be long, detailed, and
technical...


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(e) Lights, camera, action. &#160;If any of the questions is potentially
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;actionable, then the theatre's resource tracks will reveal how
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;close it is to any given action, and what amount of any given
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;resource a user would have to contribute to move it one step
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;closer.
</I>
Hmmmmm ( I am thinking of a system where people do not always say
their vote but also on another axis how much effort are they willing
to commit to that (or against that). A project leaves only if it has a
net result in time-people that is high enough for it to make sure it
will be accomplished. Think like <A HREF="http://www.kickstarter.com/">http://www.kickstarter.com/</A> but with
money and hour people. The problem is that hour people are not
standard. An hour of a good programmer is more efficient than an hour
of a bad one.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None of this contradicts the logic of Vilfredo's peculiar votespace,
</I>&gt;<i> any more than it contradicts Votorola's. &#160;Voting is easy to factor out
</I>&gt;<i> as a separate space, a separate medium, one among many.
</I>
I can see how Crossforum is more complex than I thought. I still will
like to see it working thou. (On a real example)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, I doubt Crossforum can be as Meta as some people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here believe it will be. But I am absolutely happy to collaborate to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make sure that the public informations are released in an xml format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can be used by the rest of you. Would this help?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be sufficient to stage a demonstration. &#160;Any site that is not
</I>&gt;<i> totally opaque can serve as a target for that. &#160;I say &quot;target&quot; because
</I>&gt;<i> the primary purpose of would be to free the site's users from
</I>&gt;<i> constraints that were imposed by authority, or, failing that, to
</I>&gt;<i> expose those constraints in an unfavourable light. &#160;Even if you invite
</I>&gt;<i> this as a challenge to us - to prove that we have this capability -
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo is unusual in its design and would pose difficulties for us.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should save our powder for easier targets. &#160;Less friendly
</I>&gt;<i> ones, too. :-)
</I>
Well, a hard friendly target is pareto optimal with an easy unfriendly one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My skype name is &quot;pietrosperoni&quot;. Since we are using skype maybe it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be good if we could all write our skype name in the wiki page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I sent you a contact request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also don't have a lot of bandwidth, so I cannot host the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversation, but I am very happy to participate in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If none of us has sufficient horsepower to host a big meeting, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> we could host two small ones? &#160;Individuals might wander from one to
</I>&gt;<i> the other if they chose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have read the presentation you wrote here, I have many questions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I would like to ask, but I will wait for the conversation. Also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think it would be good if someone could record the whole meeting,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we can keep it for &quot;posterity&quot; ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that in mind, ;-) I have improved my summary presentation:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Discussion">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Discussion</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For recording purposes we might use the pad to take minutes. &#160;Now if
</I>&gt;<i> we host cell meetings (per above), then the meeting minutes would
</I>&gt;<i> serve to interconnect the cells. &#160;This is pretty much what the &quot;rule
</I>&gt;<i> of crossforum extension&quot; would ask us to do regardless: separate into
</I>&gt;<i> multiple forums and then bridge the resulting gap with a public
</I>&gt;<i> interconnection. &#160;The pad is not ideal for this, however, and IRC
</I>&gt;<i> would be an improvement.
</I>
We have been thinking along similar lines with a Russian mathematician
with which we have recently submitted a EU grant proposal.

The problem is, how do you integrate different groups.

How do you solve it?

We gave a talk about our way at FET11 (<A HREF="http://fet11.eu">http://fet11.eu</A>). Unfortubately
the talk is not available, but I might be able to find you the slides,
at least.


If skype does not work we might consider going back to chat plus
piratepad. That worked well.

Cheers,
Pietro
