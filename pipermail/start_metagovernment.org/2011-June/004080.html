<PRE>Hi Ed, all,
just to clarify, I do not know Sandesh personally, he has just replied to one of the ads I have posted in the Internet.
Here is some work he told me he has done:


&#160;<A HREF="http://www.lutelagi.com/forum/">http://www.lutelagi.com/forum/</A>

&#160;<A HREF="http://wadanitv.net/forums.htmlAs">http://wadanitv.net/forums.htmlAs</A> I said before, I at first tried to talk with other people I know, but apparently the job is not so easy.
Therefore, for any kind of automatical integration, there is the possibility of future issues/problems.

Looking at your reply, I can now understand that there are 4 possibilities left:
1)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; keep going as it is now (no integration)
2)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ask Sandesh or another programmer to get M2F version 2 to work on phpBB 3. I will ask Sandesh and other people if they can help on this
3)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; start a new forum from scratch and integrate it with the mailing list manually. That is, duplicate all the posts from the mailing list to the forum, copy all the accounts and, for a period of one month (to be defined), copy manually all the messages posted on the forum back to the mailing list and the other way around. This way we would have two systems working in parallel. After one month of test, people can understand which forum or mailing list is better.
4)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Hold on until later this year (projected Sept 21 launch, but anyway this
year) when InterMix &lt;<A HREF="http://intermix.org">http://intermix.org</A>&gt; will be available as an open
source RoR alternative with a forum accessible by email and other good
features such as open-id login. (proposed by Roger Eaton)

In the next few days, I will try to go ahead with option number 2 above, but I can not guarantee that I will be able to find people good enough to do the job. 
Option number 3 sounds easier to me, the only problem is to find two people that can work in copying back an forth all the messages.
We would need to have two people in different&#160; time zones (ex. India and South America) to manually copy all messages, but I think I can help on that.
Option number 4 is not very clear to me, but I think it is clear to most people
Option number 1 is to go ahead as now.

Regards,
Matteo
