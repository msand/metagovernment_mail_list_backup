<PRE>For me the email service is the soul of the internet. I would prefer
voting tools for the mail rather for the web; a mail application
besides a web application.

How voting through a mail could be? If you have a html-enabled mail
client take a look to another mail I sent &quot;About Lists, Forums and
Voting ANNEX&quot;.

It is worth a try, there are a lot of communities out there that are
using mailing lists as the main way of communication. A voting tool,
as an improvement over mailing list software, could be
straight-forward adopted by those communities... by anyone: everybody
uses the mail everyday!

A social website needs to motivate a critical mass of members of a
community to comeback frequently in order to enroot itself as the
prime way of communication. Shortly, in one case the information
reaches you, in the other you have to reach it. The least-effort
principle dictates that humans favor the former.

List or forum? This is a question that a community never ends
addressing. Both! Must be the answer. As far we know,
<A HREF="http://mail2forum.com/">http://mail2forum.com/</A> is the only project that takes this necessity
seriously; although this attempt is a patch-like kind of solution. A
web interface for a mailing list would be an integral solution.

The web offers more capabilities than the mail, no doubt. For the
proposed voting tool, the web application should be built over the
mail application, in that order.

The voting tool needs to treat the mail intelligently. Things to be
coded for the mail side:
  * a mail server, and
  * a mailing list.

For the web side... not a forum certainly; we are now inside the
parading of social networks.

</PRE>
