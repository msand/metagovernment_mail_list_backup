<PRE>Dear all

It was a pity that yesterday I got lost in the time of the meeting, have 
to check the definition of universal time :)

As promissed, here is my contribution concerning the important issue of 
argument visualization.

The first scheme <A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5910388/proposal_argument.png">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5910388/proposal_argument.png</A> 
is composed of a sequence of argumentation points contained in each 
proposal:
P11 is point 1 of proposal 1, p12 point 2 of proposal 1 and so on.
Attached to each point is a field for contra-arguments from other 
proponents (C2, C3, C5, ...) and the respective responses R1, R2,... 
from the proponent.
The arrows indicate connections between arguments (for instance, C2 on 
point 1 of proposal 1 is connected with point 1 of proposal 2). This 
connections are more than hiperlinks; they can also be used as a means 
for comparing arguments.

The second scheme <A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5910388/matrix.png">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5910388/matrix.png</A> is a 
comparison matrix of the arguments being discussed. It is important to 
align a predefined grid so that each point in each proposal address the 
same specific issue. Each point has its own voting poll so that support 
can be splited and points of consensus or disagreement can be spotted. 
The color bars refers to the voting on each point, of the proposal, the 
contra-arguments and the the respective responses. Through this matrix, 
we can see easily what are the hot points and how is opinion being 
formed. It is also a way for proponents to receive feedback and correct 
its own proposal.

These are just schematic ideas, but I think we will need to
1) find ways for users to get a fast and easy visualization of different 
proposals without reading it
2) split a document into clearly defined and standard components or 
argumentation points
3) go beyond document editing and incorporate contra-argumentation into 
the document itself

Have a nice week

Armando
