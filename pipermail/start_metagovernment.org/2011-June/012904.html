<PRE>drum roll
how about testing it on second life?

No good making decisions unless we know who is  making them and in the name
of what.. For the collective to be a good cosmopolitan one it must have a
means to consider all matters of concern to both human and non human actors
 and to decide which scripts are in and which out. When I talk about
constitution I mean the constitution of such a parliament.There is scope to
test how this would work in the virtual reality of Second Life.
Any thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i> (WARNING: This email contains unsolicited advice, with a sprinkling of
</I>&gt;<i> Knute Rockne. Making an appropriate face while reading it is the only
</I>&gt;<i> requisite response ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Constitutions are so Gutenberg. As George Bush famously pointed out, they
</I>&gt;<i> are just pieces of paper. (He also *demonstrated* that they are just
</I>&gt;<i> pieces of paper, in numerous ways. For example, here in the USA the right to
</I>&gt;<i> a writ of habeas corpus is now just a guideline.) Without a trustworthy
</I>&gt;<i> decision making system, constitutions are not worth the  electrons that
</I>&gt;<i> paint them on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have the technology available to create a trustworthy decision making
</I>&gt;<i> system, and to program the constitutional provisions directly into that
</I>&gt;<i> decision making process. That same technology enables us to involve the
</I>&gt;<i> global public in the accumulation and ordering of the constitutional
</I>&gt;<i> provisions, from the beginning (so that the creation as well as the content
</I>&gt;<i> will be cosmopolitan). If we do this, we can involve and inspire the world
</I>&gt;<i> (or at least the humans; the nonhumans will probably just roll their eyes).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are already lots of constitutions out there. Arguably (I would argue)
</I>&gt;<i> that none of the constitutions that have actually been tried have worked
</I>&gt;<i> very well, mainly because they all depend on combinations of voting and
</I>&gt;<i> autocracy to have their effect. Going off in a corner with a little group to
</I>&gt;<i> write yet another constitution will not inspire the world, will waste an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity (to inspire the world), and will face the hurdle of trying to
</I>&gt;<i> drum up interest in it after it is written.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In an earlier email I mentioned setting up an online game. One appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> aim within that game would be to collect, order, and make operational all of
</I>&gt;<i> the necessary constitutional provisions for a new cosmopolitan eco-friendly
</I>&gt;<i> social system. Another (complementary) aim would be to create and
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrate the decision making system itself in the process.  Yet another
</I>&gt;<i> aim would be to familiarize increasing numbers of people with how the
</I>&gt;<i> decision making system worked, and with how all the constitutional
</I>&gt;<i> provisions worked. Another aim would be to create a context within which
</I>&gt;<i> that new Lamborghini could amaze us all.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we say (committing egregious oversimplification in the process) that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appraisal would be by far the best method for testing driving the new

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appraising functions, and indeed could be fully integrated into both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processes, to its full potential effect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here in the Metagovernment community, consensus is highly valued. The main
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem with consensus voting (&quot;everybody agrees&quot;) is that generally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everybody (certainly in parliaments) does not agree. Once the voting becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a contest, with winners and losers, good information such as controversy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mapping becomes just another tactical weapon. The (private) motives of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual legislators carry much more weight in decision making than the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (public) controversy mapping information. Here in the USA, one need only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> watch the travails of Ron Paul (in the US Congress) as he pursues his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Quixotic Quest to bring down the Federal Reserve to see this reality in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> action. A good controversy map of the economic issues would not change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything. Systemically, congresses and parliaments are generally
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unresponsive to the public, and unresponsive to good information, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unresponsive to the interests of nonhumans (such as power grids, or habitats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that are allergic to radioactivity.)

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Steve, Greetings!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I tracked into the links that you provided, including reading the first
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chapter of *Pandora's Hope*. My impression is that Latour's work is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> indeed complementary to the kind of work that is being done in the various
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects, but (very interestingly!) there is very little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overlap. The Metagovernment projects (including mine) are focused on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> precisely those decision making situations in which nonhumans *cannot*directly speak (e.g., any voting situation), whereas Latour is interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> studying situations in which they can (such as electrical grid power outage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> situations). The world contains both, so attention to both is appropriate.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The studying of &quot;wild&quot; situations in which nonhumans can speak leads to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policy proposals (e.g. provide more reactive power in the electrical power
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grids). Those policy proposals then compete for attention in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rough-and-tumble human decision making systems we have now. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects are aimed at creating better human decision making
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, that will more appropriately receive and act upon proposals such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those flowing from Latour's studies. To me, that looks pretty complementary,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and also pretty non-overlapping. (I can empathize that reading my articles
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would have been hard -- not much of interest there from Latour's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perspective.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (An example of this divergence appeared in the macospol material. All the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> brilliant new work of controversy mapping culminates in testing the work in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a &quot;quasi parliament.&quot; For those of us working on replacements for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parliamentary systems, that is rather like building a hot new Lamborghini
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and then testing it by using it as a wheelbarrow in the back yard. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parliaments that we have now, most of the time when a technical vote comes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up, the parliamentarians ask their lobbyist handlers how to vote and then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vote that way. To have the controversy mapping really &quot;show its stuff&quot; it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would need to be tested in decision making systems in which it would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actually be appreciated and used.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You write: *Not sure how appraisal will help if it is not universally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> adopted?*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, indeed, the more widely it were adopted, the more helpful it would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be. And also, the &quot;adoption&quot; takes place one individual at a time, beginning
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the realms of appreciation and intent. To me the most appropriate way to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> create and demonstrate the system would be through introducing it as an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> online game. Unlike new voting systems, the appraisal system will have to go
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> through a development period before it will be ready to make &quot;real&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions that actually affect people's lives. The appropriate impetus for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> incremental adoption would then be that the system demonstrates itself to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better than what we have.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I read with interest your paper *Rethinking Things*. Great stuff!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the paper you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Until such time we must learn to attune to our subliminal bond with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things and one another in order to let things speak so we can return to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> honoring one another.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In your email you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So given your appraisal idea it would be necessary to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct that the mechanism you have in mind &quot;to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice&quot; is to &quot;attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and one another&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If so, it appears to me that the appraisal system is indeed just what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be needed to enable that voice (speaking through attuned humans) to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> manifest reliably in the realm of social decision making. To me our work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems highly complementary.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (From what you wrote in the email, I couldn't quite tell whether you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were making a suggestion having read the summary, or making a suggestion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having read the work itself. If the latter, please let me know. I had
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thought that, in the work itself, it was pretty clear that giving non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a voice was one of my main concerns, and one of the major design aims of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system. If that wasn't clear, I will need to do some more rewriting, and I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could use your help in guiding me regarding what to write.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding &quot;decisions come from alliances,&quot; certainly in public voting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, legislatures, bureaucracies, and corporations many decisions do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> involve alliances, and tribes. However, the same history that supports that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view also supports the view that non humans and future generations and other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entities that cannot directly join the alliances generally suffer when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions come from alliances of tribes. Alliances of tribes tend to put
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their own interests ahead of the interests of those outside of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alliances. A &quot;nobody objects&quot; consensus system (such as the appraisal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system) can much more reliably support the interests of non humans (through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even only a few attuned humans). In such a system, decisions do not come
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from alliances, and protection of non humans does not depend in each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular decision on &quot;the generosity of strangers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding building tribes who share the value of a more harmonious and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just relationship between humans and non-humans, yes! And also, I would hope
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and expect that such tribes will see the wisdom of having a social decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making system that can be trusted to uphold that value in every decision.
