<PRE>Hi Ned,
Yes I do see the potential for complimentary.I am working on the composition
of a human/nonhuman quasi parliament. If you have suggestions on how to test
drive the &quot; hot new Lamborghini&quot; that would be appreciated.
All the best,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I tracked into the links that you provided, including reading the first
</I>&gt;<i> chapter of *Pandora's Hope*. My impression is that Latour's work is indeed
</I>&gt;<i> complementary to the kind of work that is being done in the various
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects, but (very interestingly!) there is very little
</I>&gt;<i> overlap. The Metagovernment projects (including mine) are focused on
</I>&gt;<i> precisely those decision making situations in which nonhumans *cannot*directly speak (e.g., any voting situation), whereas Latour is interested in
</I>&gt;<i> studying situations in which they can (such as electrical grid power outage
</I>&gt;<i> situations). The world contains both, so attention to both is appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The studying of &quot;wild&quot; situations in which nonhumans can speak leads to
</I>&gt;<i> policy proposals (e.g. provide more reactive power in the electrical power
</I>&gt;<i> grids). Those policy proposals then compete for attention in the
</I>&gt;<i> rough-and-tumble human decision making systems we have now. The
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects are aimed at creating better human decision making
</I>&gt;<i> systems, that will more appropriately receive and act upon proposals such as
</I>&gt;<i> those flowing from Latour's studies. To me, that looks pretty complementary,
</I>&gt;<i> and also pretty non-overlapping. (I can empathize that reading my articles
</I>&gt;<i> would have been hard -- not much of interest there from Latour's
</I>&gt;<i> perspective.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (An example of this divergence appeared in the macospol material. All the
</I>&gt;<i> brilliant new work of controversy mapping culminates in testing the work in
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;quasi parliament.&quot; For those of us working on replacements for
</I>&gt;<i> parliamentary systems, that is rather like building a hot new Lamborghini
</I>&gt;<i> and then testing it by using it as a wheelbarrow in the back yard. In the
</I>&gt;<i> parliaments that we have now, most of the time when a technical vote comes
</I>&gt;<i> up, the parliamentarians ask their lobbyist handlers how to vote and then
</I>&gt;<i> vote that way. To have the controversy mapping really &quot;show its stuff&quot; it
</I>&gt;<i> would need to be tested in decision making systems in which it would
</I>&gt;<i> actually be appreciated and used.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You write: *Not sure how appraisal will help if it is not universally
</I>&gt;<i> adopted?*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, indeed, the more widely it were adopted, the more helpful it would
</I>&gt;<i> be. And also, the &quot;adoption&quot; takes place one individual at a time, beginning
</I>&gt;<i> in the realms of appreciation and intent. To me the most appropriate way to
</I>&gt;<i> create and demonstrate the system would be through introducing it as an
</I>&gt;<i> online game. Unlike new voting systems, the appraisal system will have to go
</I>&gt;<i> through a development period before it will be ready to make &quot;real&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> decisions that actually affect people's lives. The appropriate impetus for
</I>&gt;<i> incremental adoption would then be that the system demonstrates itself to be
</I>&gt;<i> better than what we have.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Steve, Greetings!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I read with interest your paper *Rethinking Things*. Great stuff!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the paper you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Until such time we must learn to attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and one another in order to let things speak so we can return to honoring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one another.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In your email you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So given your appraisal idea it would be necessary to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct that the mechanism you have in mind &quot;to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice&quot; is to &quot;attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and one another&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, it appears to me that the appraisal system is indeed just what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be needed to enable that voice (speaking through attuned humans) to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manifest reliably in the realm of social decision making. To me our work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems highly complementary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (From what you wrote in the email, I couldn't quite tell whether you were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making a suggestion having read the summary, or making a suggestion having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> read the work itself. If the latter, please let me know. I had thought that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the work itself, it was pretty clear that giving non humans a voice was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of my main concerns, and one of the major design aims of the system. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that wasn't clear, I will need to do some more rewriting, and I could use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your help in guiding me regarding what to write.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding &quot;decisions come from alliances,&quot; certainly in public voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems, legislatures, bureaucracies, and corporations many decisions do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involve alliances, and tribes. However, the same history that supports that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> view also supports the view that non humans and future generations and other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entities that cannot directly join the alliances generally suffer when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions come from alliances of tribes. Alliances of tribes tend to put
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their own interests ahead of the interests of those outside of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alliances. A &quot;nobody objects&quot; consensus system (such as the appraisal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system) can much more reliably support the interests of non humans (through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even only a few attuned humans). In such a system, decisions do not come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from alliances, and protection of non humans does not depend in each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particular decision on &quot;the generosity of strangers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding building tribes who share the value of a more harmonious and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just relationship between humans and non-humans, yes! And also, I would hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and expect that such tribes will see the wisdom of having a social decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making system that can be trusted to uphold that value in every decision.
