<PRE>Hi all,
while I was reading the reply about alpha users in this mailing list, I was 
thinking that maybe we should think about reaching for a larger community around 
Votorola.
I think the community already exist, but involves mainly technical people, 
not the usual people.
I think it is good to have a inner community of people working on the 
project, but it would be even better to have a larger community of people 
supporting (even if not directly involved &#160;in) Votorola and the Metagovernment 
project as externals as&#160;this would help making more people knowing about the 
project (people speaking to other people&#160;by word of mouth / Facebook)
So, I propose the following: 
1)&#160;&#160;&#160; build a Twitter account to Twitter the last updates about the Votorola project
2)&#160;&#160;&#160; build a Facebook page for Votorola and/or for the whole Metagovernment 
community
3)&#160;&#160;&#160; Make a Flash site for Votorola with a graphic presentation, to 
attract non-technical guys
4)&#160;&#160;&#160; The whole Votorola site can be embedded in/be part of the new flash site 
5)&#160;&#160;&#160; Have a banner exchange for Votorola with other sites, so that people 
can know about Votorola from other sites
&#160;
In addition of course of having a forum site (in discussion in a separate 
thread).
&#160;
I think a Twitter and Facebook page can be opened quite easily, I can also 
help in case we may want to build a good presentation site.
The only thing is that maybe it can be too early for this effort in reach a 
larger community, as we may want to have a beta version or a final version of 
Votorola available.
So we may decide to postpone this effort somewhere in the future.
&#160;
What do you think?Also, shall the above be done for Votorola only or for the whole Metagovernment project?&#160;
Matteo
