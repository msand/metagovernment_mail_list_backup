<PRE>Hi Pietro,

Michael Allan wrote 4 days ago:

&gt;<i> Sorry for all the noise.  That was a design problem and we solved it
</I>&gt;<i> (Thomas, C and I).  I'm setting up a Mailman list for Votorola so we
</I>&gt;<i> could move the more intense discussions over there, if need be.  (C
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't like Google Groups, and neither do I anymore.)
</I>
So I guess that answers one of your points.

To the other point I'd like to say: Crossforum is *not* like the other 
projects, but it intends to connect the other projects. It was born out 
and represents the spirit of Metagov as a &quot;meta-project list&quot;.

But you are the third person suggesting a separate dev-list for 
crossforum now, so we should probably create it.

Thomas


&gt;<i> Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is Metagovernment now a list that only discusses the development of
</I>&gt;<i> the Crossforum Theater and Pollwiki?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have asked on the agenda for the meeting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that those two projects were presented to the rest of the community,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Detail, explain, discuss pollwikis and Crossforum Theatre. More specifically:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Present it for members who have not been involved with the development.
</I>&gt;<i> that answer was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Out of respect for people's time, this presentation is likely to be extremely short (a few words at most). The list archive has several months of discussion that amount to a longer presentation, which attendees can read on their own time. ~Michael Allan
</I>&gt;<i> There is a difference between developmental discussion and non
</I>&gt;<i> developmental discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the major developer (with Chris Anderson and Derek Peterson, also
</I>&gt;<i> on the list, although silent) of another project, Vilfredo goes to
</I>&gt;<i> Athens, I have tried to keep the list both informed about what was
</I>&gt;<i> going on, and not flood it with the minutes of the development. And we
</I>&gt;<i> did many development and others are on the production line. There were
</I>&gt;<i> times were on the list most of the thread were concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, and I sensed this was not ok so I lowered the volume, to let
</I>&gt;<i> the general discussion in metagovernment raise again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment community members are working on several projects:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> some of them are only nominally members of metagovernment (&quot;yes,
</I>&gt;<i> please add me&quot;), but others were born, and raised inside the
</I>&gt;<i> community. Sometimes a discussion in the list have given the intuition
</I>&gt;<i> to a member to start writing something. Other times a person come to
</I>&gt;<i> the list with their own project, and has an interaction with the list
</I>&gt;<i> that changes and modifies their own project. All this points to the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the metagovernment list is wider than any single project.
</I>&gt;<i> This year, as Matias has pointed out, the number of mails from the
</I>&gt;<i> list have absolutely exploded, but they all have focused on those two
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me clarify, I think it is great that so many members are doing
</I>&gt;<i> those two great projects. I think, for what I could gather, that they
</I>&gt;<i> are interesting. But I also think that the metagovernment community
</I>&gt;<i> cannot, and should not, only limit itself to those two projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So let me rephrase my question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can we keep on the community of people interested in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment, produce more projects, keep the discussion alive,
</I>&gt;<i> while also keep on bringing forward the development of those two
</I>&gt;<i> projects?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could those projects, like the others in metagovernment, have their
</I>&gt;<i> own developmental list. And then inform us of the new improvement once
</I>&gt;<i> they have already been implemented. It is common for projects to have
</I>&gt;<i> a dev list and a general discussion list. Metagovernment is a
</I>&gt;<i> meta-project list. I would not be surprised if eventually we find out
</I>&gt;<i> we need not two but 5 lists to manage all those projects, two for each
</I>&gt;<i> project and then the metagovernment list, but for now, could we have
</I>&gt;<i> please an extra list that works side by side to metagovernment:
</I>&gt;<i> CrossforumAndPollwiki/dev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, is the meeting of this sunday a development meeting where the
</I>&gt;<i> developers of Crossforum&amp;  Pollwiki meet or is it a general
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment meeting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because ti looks like it cannot be both, as Michael says,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&gt;Out of respect for people's time&quot; .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
