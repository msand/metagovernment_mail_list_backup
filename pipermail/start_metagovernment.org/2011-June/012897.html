<PRE>Thanks Mark,
I agree that a key issue in making decisions is authority. That being said
in the example I use of electricity speaking when we had the New York City
blackout, no one had the authority and no one took responsibility. Things
are vibrant and sometimes show us they have a mind of their own. How to
better let them speak for themselves is a project I am suggesting we
undertake. If we follow Latour's irreductionism and realism (
<A HREF="http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/irreductions/">http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2009/01/13/irreductions/</A>)
the Platonic two house model would  not be the paradigm we would want to
follow.
All the best,
Steve

&gt;<i> Interesting conversation.  My apologies for not having time to follow the
</I>&gt;<i> links you point to, but I'll raise a couple of points I hope are relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The title of this thread is voting vs. appraisal, implying an either/or
</I>&gt;<i> where one method is superior.  I think it would be more accurate to think of
</I>&gt;<i> these as different decision making tools, each of which might be more
</I>&gt;<i> desirable in the context of a specific community decision.  There are widely
</I>&gt;<i> diverse decision contexts, and I sincerely doubt that any decision mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> will be best suited for all contexts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The elephant in the room that only rarely gets discussed on this list is
</I>&gt;<i> authority, as in who has the authority to make this decision?  Neither
</I>&gt;<i> voting nor appraisal be relevant if a binding decision cannot be taken.
</I>&gt;<i> Looking towards existing power structures, advising decision makers is the
</I>&gt;<i> best that can be hoped for in many decision contexts in the short term.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't argue against developing voting and/or appraisal tools, but that a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of tool sets will need to be developed that communities can choose
</I>&gt;<i> from, and that in the short term tools designed to inform existing decision
</I>&gt;<i> makers are likely to be most relevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a side note, nonhuman actors speaking sounds more spiritual than
</I>&gt;<i> practical (though I like the notion).  Without taking the time to read the
</I>&gt;<i> literature, what's the gist of this argument - that things have an ideal
</I>&gt;<i> that they want to manifest, a bit like Plato's forms?  E.g, I'm a river and
</I>&gt;<i> I want to flow to the ocean?  I'm a chair and I want to be sat on?  My guess
</I>&gt;<i> is that nonhuman actors will always need human advocates in any decision
</I>&gt;<i> system, and that designing systems so that the voices of nonhumans are left
</I>&gt;<i> to their human advocates probably makes the most sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Mark

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ned,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did read the appraisal vs. voting document,superficially I'm afraid but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't yet have a sense of how this would work in practice.  I was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggesting that networks are linked in alliances and are opposed in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controversies. actions.  States of affairs are the outcomes of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> controversies. For real shifts to take place  a reassembly of networks,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Steve, Greetings!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I read with interest your paper *Rethinking Things*. Great stuff!
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the paper you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Until such time we must learn to attune to our subliminal bond with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> things and one another in order to let things speak so we can return to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> honoring one another.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In your email you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So given your appraisal idea it would be necessary to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct that the mechanism you have in mind &quot;to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice&quot; is to &quot;attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and one another&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If so, it appears to me that the appraisal system is indeed just what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be needed to enable that voice (speaking through attuned humans) to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> manifest reliably in the realm of social decision making. To me our work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems highly complementary.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (From what you wrote in the email, I couldn't quite tell whether you were
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making a suggestion having read the summary, or making a suggestion having
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> read the work itself. If the latter, please let me know. I had thought that,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the work itself, it was pretty clear that giving non humans a voice was
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one of my main concerns, and one of the major design aims of the system. If
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that wasn't clear, I will need to do some more rewriting, and I could use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your help in guiding me regarding what to write.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding &quot;decisions come from alliances,&quot; certainly in public voting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, legislatures, bureaucracies, and corporations many decisions do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> involve alliances, and tribes. However, the same history that supports that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view also supports the view that non humans and future generations and other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entities that cannot directly join the alliances generally suffer when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions come from alliances of tribes. Alliances of tribes tend to put
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their own interests ahead of the interests of those outside of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alliances. A &quot;nobody objects&quot; consensus system (such as the appraisal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system) can much more reliably support the interests of non humans (through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even only a few attuned humans). In such a system, decisions do not come
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from alliances, and protection of non humans does not depend in each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular decision on &quot;the generosity of strangers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding building tribes who share the value of a more harmonious and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just relationship between humans and non-humans, yes! And also, I would hope
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and expect that such tribes will see the wisdom of having a social decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making system that can be trusted to uphold that value in every decision.
