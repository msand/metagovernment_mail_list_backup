<PRE>Why is it not ready for an open alpha?

I don't know the 4 alpha users that advised us that we're not ready for
beta, but I suspect its mainly for usability issues, that's what I think.

It's already possible to use votorola and we did when we wanted concensus
about the websites redesign, didn't we?
People can create accounts and they could start using it. I admit, at the
current moment it's very hard for people to use it, because it can be very
confusing and they will often wonder where to click or how it is supposed to
work. I think the sooner we get feedback from users, the better it is.

I doubt it will be a good thing if 3 or 4 months of coding will go into the
project without feedback from users.
In the end, a lot of code might end up in the waste bin because there will
always be many ways to put a concept into reality.
The goal is to make users familiar with the concept so that they can grasp
and start using it and I believe this only works when they are part of the
process.
Some Joe Average will give feedback that will influence the coding in a way
that makes it usable for all Joe Average's similar to the one who gave the
feedback.
The more different types of Joe Average we have, the more valuable the
feedback becomes, because it makes the system usable for every group of
users that is similar to one of the Joe Average's that gave us feedback :-)

I think if facebook would have started with all the features it has today it
would have failed. Every feature needed its time and had to be introduced
slowly. One could even say socially engineered into the userbase or
something like that. Features where introduced carefully one at the time
until enough users accepted it. There is still a lot of discussion and
outcry when facebook changes anything. It's the same with &quot;semantic web&quot;.
There are many ivory tower solutions which work great as long as they stay
ivory tower, but as soon as you want it to be adopted by the mainstream it
always fails, because it's too complex to put it into practice, therefore
companies have put a lot of thought into it and a current attempt for a next
step in making semnatic web becoming mainstream reality is &quot;schema.org&quot;.

Like I've mentioned earlier, there are a lot of services like
(uservoice.com) and many others that could be used by us to keep track of
all the features that testers would want. I think there are enough people on
this mailing list who would offer to administrate a service like
uservoice.com. If no one would, I would do it.

I think, like others have said earlier on this list, that I charge open
doors. Sure, I'm not so much into the current state of the tools and
therefore might miss essential points, but I know it's already possible to
create accounts and to use the tools as we did in the past.
So it's mainly about the right way of doing things or the best next steps to
take and I think the earlier we make it possible for anyone who's interested
in the tools to use them and provide a nice &amp; easy way of giving us
feedback, the faster we will succeed.

An important feature of metagovernment tools should be a mechanism to give
feedback on anything, but until then it might be a good idea to use one of
the tools which are out there already.

If alpha users gave us the thumbs up in regard to a beta promotion,
then I'd say &quot;Go for it!&quot;  But we had 4 alpha users and none of them
advised us that we're ready for beta.  We only just completed the
design of the alpha prototype this month.  We can do about 3-4 months
of coding without any users at all.  It's actually faster that way and
will bring us a step closer to beta.  The main drawback is that
development will no longer be open to non-techs - Thomas excepted,
since he already owns pieces of the design - which exposes us to
design flaws on our blind side.

Experience teaches me (though I sometimes forget the lesson) that any
attempt to communicate technology via ideas, designs or other
generalities is a waste of time.  You said as much in one of your
earlier posts Alex, and I thought, &quot;Wow!  This guy understands
engineering.&quot;  The only way to connect with non-technologists is via
hands on practice.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while I was reading the reply about alpha users in this mailing list, I
</I>was
&gt;<i> &gt; thinking that maybe we should think about reaching for a larger
</I>community
&gt;<i> &gt; around Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the community already exist, but involves mainly technical
</I>people,
&gt;<i> &gt; not the usual people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it is good to have a inner community of people working on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project, but it would be even better to have a larger community of
</I>people
&gt;<i> &gt; supporting (even if not directly involved  in) Votorola and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment project as externals as this would help making more
</I>people
&gt;<i> &gt; knowing about the project (people speaking to other people by word of
</I>mouth
&gt;<i> &gt; / Facebook)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, I propose the following: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1)    build a Twitter account to Twitter the last updates about the
</I>Votorola
&gt;<i> &gt; project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2)    build a Facebook page for Votorola and/or for the whole
</I>Metagovernment
&gt;<i> &gt; community
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3)    Make a Flash site for Votorola with a graphic presentation, to
</I>attract
&gt;<i> &gt; non-technical guys
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4)    The whole Votorola site can be embedded in/be part of the new
</I>flash
&gt;<i> &gt; site 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5)    Have a banner exchange for Votorola with other sites, so that
</I>people
&gt;<i> &gt; can know about Votorola from other sites
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In addition of course of having a forum site (in discussion in a
</I>separate
&gt;<i> &gt; thread).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a Twitter and Facebook page can be opened quite easily, I can
</I>also
&gt;<i> &gt; help in case we may want to build a good presentation site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The only thing is that maybe it can be too early for this effort in
</I>reach a
&gt;<i> &gt; larger community, as we may want to have a beta version or a final
</I>version
&gt;<i> &gt; of Votorola available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So we may decide to postpone this effort somewhere in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, shall the above be done for Votorola only or for the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metagovernment project?
</I>
