<PRE>Ok Armando, maybe your graphical sketch will clarify it. Right now I 
would still ask: Why not use the existing argument-mapping tools in many 
small scales, i.e. between a candidate and his voters? And each 
candidate across the whole delegation tree can have its own 
argument-map, or maybe even several maps for several controversial 
points. In my opinion this would beautifully work out.
