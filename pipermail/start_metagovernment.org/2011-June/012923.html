<PRE>I agree with Thomas that the document should open to edition.
As I stated earlier, I think we need a tool to visualized and explore 
the arguments in a tree structure.
There are situations where a consensus will never be achieved and its 
important to unfold the arguments and explore the consequences.
For instance, consider the case for nuclear energy - that Germany 
decided to decommission its power plants by 2023.
Its a bold decision that most people take on an emotional basis.
I think that, by letting both parts (pro and con) to contra-argument the 
positions and explore the consequences will highly enrich the discussion.
Nuclear is  a buzz word that people say instantly no. But they are 
unaware that the 5-generation power plants have nothing to do with old 
ones  - like the Fukushima.
We have to somehow introduce this contra-argumentation structure and not 
only edit and vote proposals

I try to make a graphical sketch of what I'm thinking.
