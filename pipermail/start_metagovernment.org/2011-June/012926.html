<PRE>Hi Thomas,

yes, please do move the discussion of Votorola in the other list.

We spoke about crossforum before. I do not agree that Crossforum has a
special status. There are multiple reason why I don't do.

For once when we spoke about it, it could not handle the generations
system that is in Vilfredo. As such it is not &quot;Meta&quot; to Vilfredo. Has
that changed?

Speaking personally, I have noticed that each person feels a special
connection for their own project or for the project they identify most
or for the solution that envision.I do for Vilfredo, you do for
Crossforum, Manuel did for Candiwi, and Owen for StratML...

Sometimes we feel our project deserves to be the special project of
Metagovernment.
I personally do not feel the same for Crossforum, and I am not even
sure it is a good thing that any project is the &quot;special&quot; project. As
I feel this curbs the creativity of other projects.

If, for example, someone were to come out with a way to link different
projects alternative to Crossforum, what would the list need to do?
If Crossforum is the &quot;special&quot; project we would need to refuse the
other project, take a stance and say this is our way of doing things
because .... If not we can just equally embrace it, and explain that
in some cases is better using one and in others is better using the
other. My attitude is that the world is big, full of opportunities,
and as such we should always embrace.

As such I don't think it would be correct, for example, for crossforum
to be the Metagovernment/dev system, but the crossforum/dev or
Metagovernment/crossforum/dev

In any case, name aside, please do move the crossforum discussion in
another list. However you want to call it.

Also what is this meeting going to be: will it be a development
meeting on crossforum and pollwiki, or will we speak about ALL the
projects that are being involved, and present the projects to people
that have not been involved with them?

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for all the noise.  That was a design problem and we solved it

</I>&gt;<i> could move the more intense discussions over there, if need be.  (C
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't like Google Groups, and neither do I anymore.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess that answers one of your points.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To the other point I'd like to say: Crossforum is not like the other
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but it intends to connect the other projects. It was born out and
</I>&gt;<i> represents the spirit of Metagov as a &quot;meta-project list&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you are the third person suggesting a separate dev-list for crossforum
</I>&gt;<i> now, so we should probably create it.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is Metagovernment now a list that only discusses the development of
</I>&gt;<i> the Crossforum Theater and Pollwiki?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have asked on the agenda for the meeting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that those two projects were presented to the rest of the community,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Detail, explain, discuss pollwikis and Crossforum Theatre. More
</I>&gt;<i> specifically:
</I>&gt;<i> Present it for members who have not been involved with the development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that answer was:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Out of respect for people's time, this presentation is likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> extremely short (a few words at most). The list archive has several months
</I>&gt;<i> of discussion that amount to a longer presentation, which attendees can read
</I>&gt;<i> on their own time. ~Michael Allan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a difference between developmental discussion and non
</I>&gt;<i> developmental discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As the major developer (with Chris Anderson and Derek Peterson, also
</I>&gt;<i> on the list, although silent) of another project, Vilfredo goes to
</I>&gt;<i> Athens, I have tried to keep the list both informed about what was
</I>&gt;<i> going on, and not flood it with the minutes of the development. And we
</I>&gt;<i> did many development and others are on the production line. There were
</I>&gt;<i> times were on the list most of the thread were concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, and I sensed this was not ok so I lowered the volume, to let
</I>&gt;<i> the general discussion in metagovernment raise again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment community members are working on several projects:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> some of them are only nominally members of metagovernment (&quot;yes,
</I>&gt;<i> please add me&quot;), but others were born, and raised inside the
</I>&gt;<i> community. Sometimes a discussion in the list have given the intuition
</I>&gt;<i> to a member to start writing something. Other times a person come to
</I>&gt;<i> the list with their own project, and has an interaction with the list
</I>&gt;<i> that changes and modifies their own project. All this points to the
</I>&gt;<i> fact that the metagovernment list is wider than any single project.
</I>&gt;<i> This year, as Matias has pointed out, the number of mails from the
</I>&gt;<i> list have absolutely exploded, but they all have focused on those two
</I>&gt;<i> projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me clarify, I think it is great that so many members are doing
</I>&gt;<i> those two great projects. I think, for what I could gather, that they
</I>&gt;<i> are interesting. But I also think that the metagovernment community
</I>&gt;<i> cannot, and should not, only limit itself to those two projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So let me rephrase my question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How can we keep on the community of people interested in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment, produce more projects, keep the discussion alive,
</I>&gt;<i> while also keep on bringing forward the development of those two
</I>&gt;<i> projects?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could those projects, like the others in metagovernment, have their
</I>&gt;<i> own developmental list. And then inform us of the new improvement once
</I>&gt;<i> they have already been implemented. It is common for projects to have
</I>&gt;<i> a dev list and a general discussion list. Metagovernment is a
</I>&gt;<i> meta-project list. I would not be surprised if eventually we find out
</I>&gt;<i> we need not two but 5 lists to manage all those projects, two for each
</I>&gt;<i> project and then the metagovernment list, but for now, could we have
</I>&gt;<i> please an extra list that works side by side to metagovernment:
</I>&gt;<i> CrossforumAndPollwiki/dev.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, is the meeting of this sunday a development meeting where the
</I>&gt;<i> developers of Crossforum &amp; Pollwiki meet or is it a general
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment meeting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because ti looks like it cannot be both, as Michael says,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;&gt;Out of respect for people's time&quot; .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
