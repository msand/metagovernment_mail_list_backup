</I>
Pollwikis are databases.  They're the primary structural components in
the voting network: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki</A>
I added a summary of the network here, to clarify *it's* purpose:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/</A>

As you can see from that, pollwikis must remain independent of any
particular technical facility - Crossforum Theatre, Votorola
vote-server, or anything like that.

Further, a *multi-area* pollwiki (like we have) must be independent of
the areas it covers: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#area">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#area</A>
So our pollwiki has no technical or &quot;political&quot; affiliations.

&gt;<i> (Please note, I'm not trying to draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot; here. I just  
</I>&gt;<i> can't tell what is what, and I think it is useful for developers to  
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally step back and give a little documentation of what they're  
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of. I am having a tough time following a lot of the recent  
</I>&gt;<i> threads because I'm not sure what object they are really about, and  
</I>&gt;<i> how that object fits in with the others being discussed. I have to  
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that a lot of other list members feel the same. You could have  
</I>&gt;<i> more participation in this process if you can help clarify these ideas  
</I>&gt;<i> in non-developer-speak, and let people know precisely where help is  
</I>&gt;<i> needed. Please feel free to spin off a different thread called  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;status&quot; or something, if appropriate.)
</I>
Sorry for all the noise.  That was a design problem and we solved it
(Thomas, C and I).  I'm setting up a Mailman list for Votorola so we
could move the more intense discussions over there, if need be.  (C
doesn't like Google Groups, and neither do I anymore.)

The problem we're facing now is getting 2-3 alpha users to guide the
design into beta.  Maybe we can write documentation (as you suggest),
or create presentations (as Matteo suggests), or demonstrate
crossforum extension for activists (as I suggest), or approach the
Open Source Ecology movement (as C suggests), or continue in the
attempt to govern Metagov (as Thomas has advocated in the past).  The
multiplicity of choices is a problem in itself.  I think we must vote
with our feet and see where the feet land:

&gt;<i> Separately, if Metagov were to be an Area within a pollwiki, would you  
</I>&gt;<i> see it as still appropriate to at least have a shell of meta content,  
</I>&gt;<i> such as the simplistic draft discussed in the thread I just posted on?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Something to act as a gateway for people who don't know what they are  
</I>&gt;<i> looking at.
</I>
We have this much so far: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas">http://zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas</A>
That's the &quot;main page&quot;.  A definition of collaborative governance
might not fit there.  The pollwiki can support practices other than
collaborative governance, or equivalent practices under other labels.
Do you see what I mean?  (I wish I could make the main page just
vanish, but it's built in there.)

&gt;<i> If instead we go the parallel route, then would it make logistical
</I>&gt;<i> sense to have each be a subdomain of the (Tux-hosted) Metagov site?
</I>&gt;<i> That would mean something like: polls.metagovernment.org - pollwiki
</I>&gt;<i> (a concept I am still unclear on, as noted above)
</I>&gt;<i> project.metagovernment.org - the current metagov wiki
</I>&gt;<i> www.metagovernment.org - a small shell, with a simplistic home page,
</I>&gt;<i> and links to the other two.  ...perhaps. Does that seem right?
</I>
The only requirement for the domain name is shortness.
&quot;metagovernment&quot; is probably too long.  We do lots of subpaging
(longer URLs) yet we want the URLs to be embeddable in email, Twitter,
etc.

Whatever the domain name, ideally the pollwiki itself remains hosted
on my hardware for now.  I'm constrained for admin time (like you), so
I'd want a good reason to move it.
 
&gt;<i> In detailing all of the above, I'm wondering if a live meeting
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't be a better venue for working some of this out. We haven't
</I>&gt;<i> had one of those in a while anyway...
</I>
Yes definitely.  Skype followed by IRC or Pirate Pad might be the most
productive format, if that's possible.
