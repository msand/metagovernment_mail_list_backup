<PRE>We're talking about the issue here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/votorola/11-06/21">http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/votorola/11-06/21</A>

How many software projects at this stage can attract alpha users from
outside?  It's too much to ask for and it feels wrong to keep asking.
Ed and I, or Thomas and I, or Thomas and C - whichever pair of us 4
happens to be free at the momement - cannot carry the whole of the
usability testing alone.  Besides, this failure has already taught us
what we needed to know.  It has to do with the ways in which resources
and resource fulfillments are generalized, and how they are presented
in the UI.  It was that lesson that we wanted the alpha users for in
the first place.  Thank you therefore to the list for helping, and
especially to Ed. :-) Thank you also to Thomas, who's idea it was to
come here in force.

But now that we've learned the lesson, it's time to go and apply it
and code it up.  (Apologies for being too slow to grasp this and for
making so much noise. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know the 4 alpha users that advised us that we're not ready for
</I>&gt;<i> beta, but I suspect its mainly for usability issues, that's what I think.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's already possible to use votorola and we did when we wanted concensus
</I>&gt;<i> about the websites redesign, didn't we?
</I>&gt;<i> People can create accounts and they could start using it. I admit, at the
</I>&gt;<i> current moment it's very hard for people to use it, because it can be very
</I>&gt;<i> confusing and they will often wonder where to click or how it is supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> work. I think the sooner we get feedback from users, the better it is.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I doubt it will be a good thing if 3 or 4 months of coding will go into the
</I>&gt;<i> project without feedback from users.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end, a lot of code might end up in the waste bin because there will
</I>&gt;<i> always be many ways to put a concept into reality.
</I>&gt;<i> The goal is to make users familiar with the concept so that they can grasp
</I>&gt;<i> and start using it and I believe this only works when they are part of the
</I>&gt;<i> process.
</I>&gt;<i> Some Joe Average will give feedback that will influence the coding in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that makes it usable for all Joe Average's similar to the one who gave the
</I>&gt;<i> feedback.
</I>&gt;<i> The more different types of Joe Average we have, the more valuable the
</I>&gt;<i> feedback becomes, because it makes the system usable for every group of
</I>&gt;<i> users that is similar to one of the Joe Average's that gave us feedback :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think if facebook would have started with all the features it has today it
</I>&gt;<i> would have failed. Every feature needed its time and had to be introduced
</I>&gt;<i> slowly. One could even say socially engineered into the userbase or
</I>&gt;<i> something like that. Features where introduced carefully one at the time
</I>&gt;<i> until enough users accepted it. There is still a lot of discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> outcry when facebook changes anything. It's the same with &quot;semantic web&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> There are many ivory tower solutions which work great as long as they stay
</I>&gt;<i> ivory tower, but as soon as you want it to be adopted by the mainstream it
</I>&gt;<i> always fails, because it's too complex to put it into practice, therefore
</I>&gt;<i> companies have put a lot of thought into it and a current attempt for a next
</I>&gt;<i> step in making semnatic web becoming mainstream reality is &quot;schema.org&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like I've mentioned earlier, there are a lot of services like
</I>&gt;<i> (uservoice.com) and many others that could be used by us to keep track of
</I>&gt;<i> all the features that testers would want. I think there are enough people on
</I>&gt;<i> this mailing list who would offer to administrate a service like
</I>&gt;<i> uservoice.com. If no one would, I would do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think, like others have said earlier on this list, that I charge open
</I>&gt;<i> doors. Sure, I'm not so much into the current state of the tools and
</I>&gt;<i> therefore might miss essential points, but I know it's already possible to
</I>&gt;<i> create accounts and to use the tools as we did in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> So it's mainly about the right way of doing things or the best next steps to
</I>&gt;<i> take and I think the earlier we make it possible for anyone who's interested
</I>&gt;<i> in the tools to use them and provide a nice &amp; easy way of giving us
</I>&gt;<i> feedback, the faster we will succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An important feature of metagovernment tools should be a mechanism to give
</I>&gt;<i> feedback on anything, but until then it might be a good idea to use one of
</I>&gt;<i> the tools which are out there already.

</I>&gt;<i> development will no longer be open to non-techs - Thomas excepted,
