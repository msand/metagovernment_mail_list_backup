<PRE>Hello Sandesh, welcome and thank you for joining us!

And sorry for us being a bit slowly and confusing at times ;-)

Ok, we want to integrate our list with a forum and with openID.

We'd like to have the following possibilities:

1. Any new thread in the list shows up as a new topic in one category of 
the forum.

2. Any reply on the list shows up as a reply to the associated forum post.

3. Any new topic on the forum shows up as a new thread on the list.

4. Any reply on the forum shows up as a reply (ie, with a re:) on the list.

(maybe 5. I can unsubscribe from certain threads.)


Ed and others, is this correct, is something missing?

Now the current status seems to be this:

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Set up phpBB 3 on the Tuxfamily site, in /forum or in

</I>&gt;<i> 2. Install and test OpenID mod:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpbb-openid/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpbb-openid/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Install and test completed version of M2F.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can do steps one and two, but my time is still very limited, and a

</I>&gt;<i> could get to it, but I can open up an account on the tuxfamily site 
</I>&gt;<i> for someone who does want to do it.
</I>
&gt;<i> One thing I haven't figured out about forum/list integration: how does

</I>&gt;<i> someone starts a new topic on the list, where does it get filed in the 
</I>&gt;<i> forum? My guess would be that everything goes into one category (such 
</I>&gt;<i> as General Chat), and then an admin can re-file them as needed.
</I>
Now Sandesh, is this all still to unspecificor do you get the picture? 
What else would you need to know?

Greetings from Germany,
Thomas
