</I>
We share some of your quirks.  Like you, we allow for multiple
generations of draft answers per drafter.  Like you, we facilitiate
the stepwise optimization of those answers along a path that is
&quot;efficient&quot; in terms of its pursuit of consensus.  I don't know how
this relates to Pareto efficiency in *theory*, but the population
structure on which our evolutionary, recombinant approach is based - a
single generational sequence per user - might be flexible enough to
cover Vilfredo's approach in *practice*.  Can your users draft their
answers in wiki pages?  If so, then this opens up possibilities:

  (a) Free-range drafting.  The users may choose which wiki to draft
      in, and the choice may vary from question to question.

  (b) Difference bridging.  Wherever two draft answers are
      sufficiently similar, the users may easily view the differences.
      They may eliminate them by erasure, if they wish, and bring the
      overall &quot;population&quot; one step closer to consensus.

  (c) Facilitate discussion.  Wherever the difference bridge is
      employed in this manner (b), it serves to formally interconnect
      drafting, voting and discussion media in a way that supports
      focused discussion in a single forum.

  (d) Facilitate growth.  Any such discussion in a single forum is
      automatically exposed in Crossforum Theatre, where it is mapped
      in geospace, votespace, forum space, topic space, and so forth.
      If a &quot;question&quot; can possibly grow in terms of its participation,
      then the physical and logical dimensions of that growth are
      clearly shown.

  (e) Lights, camera, action.  If any of the questions is potentially
      actionable, then the theatre's resource tracks will reveal how
      close it is to any given action, and what amount of any given
      resource a user would have to contribute to move it one step
      closer.

None of this contradicts the logic of Vilfredo's peculiar votespace,
any more than it contradicts Votorola's.  Voting is easy to factor out
as a separate space, a separate medium, one among many.

&gt;<i> In any case, I doubt Crossforum can be as Meta as some people
</I>&gt;<i> here believe it will be. But I am absolutely happy to collaborate to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that the public informations are released in an xml format
</I>&gt;<i> that can be used by the rest of you. Would this help?
</I>
It would be sufficient to stage a demonstration.  Any site that is not
totally opaque can serve as a target for that.  I say &quot;target&quot; because
the primary purpose of would be to free the site's users from
constraints that were imposed by authority, or, failing that, to
expose those constraints in an unfavourable light.  Even if you invite
this as a challenge to us - to prove that we have this capability -
Vilfredo is unusual in its design and would pose difficulties for us.
I think we should save our powder for easier targets.  Less friendly
ones, too. :-)

&gt;<i> My skype name is &quot;pietrosperoni&quot;. Since we are using skype maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> would be good if we could all write our skype name in the wiki page.
</I>
I sent you a contact request.

&gt;<i> I also don't have a lot of bandwidth, so I cannot host the
</I>&gt;<i> conversation, but I am very happy to participate in it.
</I>
If none of us has sufficient horsepower to host a big meeting, maybe
we could host two small ones?  Individuals might wander from one to
the other if they chose.

&gt;<i> I have read the presentation you wrote here, I have many questions
</I>&gt;<i> that I would like to ask, but I will wait for the conversation. Also
</I>&gt;<i> I think it would be good if someone could record the whole meeting,
</I>&gt;<i> so we can keep it for &quot;posterity&quot; ;-).
</I>
With that in mind, ;-) I have improved my summary presentation:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Discussion">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9#Discussion</A>

For recording purposes we might use the pad to take minutes.  Now if
we host cell meetings (per above), then the meeting minutes would
serve to interconnect the cells.  This is pretty much what the &quot;rule
of crossforum extension&quot; would ask us to do regardless: separate into
multiple forums and then bridge the resulting gap with a public
interconnection.  The pad is not ideal for this, however, and IRC
would be an improvement.

Here Tim Bonnemann et al. are using IRC in much this fashion (see also
14th and 15th): <A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/edem/11-06/13">http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/edem/11-06/13</A>
By spreading out at the event and making use of #edem to
intercommunicate, they cast a wide &quot;net&quot;.  It's not a deliberate
strategy of theirs, but if they wanted to, they could haul that net in
with a sense of purpose.
