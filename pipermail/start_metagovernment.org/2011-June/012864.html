<PRE>Thanks, Michael. Your description below helps clear it up some. It is  
quite clever, however I can also see it being quite difficult to get  
across to the average person. I'm somewhat close to the issues and I  
am still having a hard time grasping it. I think more examples (use  
cases) may be helpful here.

Which brings me to Thomas' use-case:

&gt;<i> A community has no kindergarden but wants one. They start a poll and  
</I>&gt;<i> many different plans emerge of how it should be like, where exactly  
</I>&gt;<i> it should be located etc. Every plan expresses the amount of the  
</I>&gt;<i> different necessary resources for its realization, i.e. votes,  
</I>&gt;<i> money, land, labour, bricks, wood, ... And now all the people voting  
</I>&gt;<i> for a paricular plan can express what recources they are willing to  
</I>&gt;<i> contribute. And the count-engine counts them all up. So everyone can  
</I>&gt;<i> see, what is still missing and what not. If the count reaches 100%  
</I>&gt;<i> the plan can be executed, all the resources are there. Happy  
</I>&gt;<i> parents, happy children! :-)
</I>
How does this account for the person who doesn't want a kindergarden  
near their house for whatever reason? This model seems to be centered  
around adhocracy-like building of projects by efforts of the willing,  
but I don't see where it allows for people who are actively opposed to  
the project in the first place. A kindergarden is a little hard to  
imagine someone opposing if they don't even have to pay for it, but  
how about building a dam, which will radically alter the flow of water  
downstream?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some documentation (or at least description) as a learning exercise,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I'm not able to do that from posts like the below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are the main ideas as I see them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (a) Expose the resource needs, expectations and fulfilments of each
</I>&gt;<i>     collective effort as a &quot;message&quot; to the larger public sphere.
</I>&gt;<i>     Express that message in terms of the social space of the effort
</I>&gt;<i>     itself (b).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (b) Show the resources flowing together with the votes of the
</I>&gt;<i>     participants in the same way that agreement flows into consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>     Agreement is just a kind of resource.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (c) Consider that extension within the larger public sphere is
</I>&gt;<i>     another kind of resource that an effort needs.  By &quot;extension&quot;, I
</I>&gt;<i>     mean participation that covers many separate communities.  When a
</I>&gt;<i>     collective effort needs, expects and is working toward extension,
</I>&gt;<i>     then let it say so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (d) Let the periphery decide the resource needs.  Trees and branches
</I>&gt;<i>     of the collective forest are free to decide for themselves what
</I>&gt;<i>     resources are required for the overall effort.  (We floated this
</I>&gt;<i>     idea yesterday in offline discussion, C, Thomas and me.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Our example concerns the problem of littering in the streets.
</I>&gt;<i>     The leading candidate defines it as a legislative matter for the
</I>&gt;<i>     city and is gathering votes for a bylaw (resource = agreement)
</I>&gt;<i>     that will impose fines, or something like that.  A delegate in a
</I>&gt;<i>     higher branch disagrees and instead defines it as a local
</I>&gt;<i>     community effort (resource = agreement + labour) with
</I>&gt;<i>     participation restricted to the residents of the local
</I>&gt;<i>     neighbourhood, but simulaneously expanded to include non-citizen
</I>&gt;<i>     residents.  The count engine will take care to ensure that the
</I>&gt;<i>     labour pledges and non-citizen votes do not cascade past the
</I>&gt;<i>     delegate and into the bylaw drafts below, while the local
</I>&gt;<i>     citizens' votes do.  (In practice, this particular delegate would
</I>&gt;<i>     be better off as an end candidate, so this is a contrived
</I>&gt;<i>     example.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     We recognize that this freedom of delegates to redefine the issue
</I>&gt;<i>     means that a single poll may sometimes come to house two issues
</I>&gt;<i>     that really ought to be separate.  The problem then becomes the
</I>&gt;<i>     coordination of the move of one branch or tree to a separate
</I>&gt;<i>     poll.  Moving an individual position is easy, so the only problem
</I>&gt;<i>     is the social coordination of the individuals.  Therefore the
</I>&gt;<i>     delegates will solve this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (e) Let the periphery decide what resource message to expose (a).
</I>&gt;<i>     Clearly this is required when the resources are completely
</I>&gt;<i>     redefined by the periphery, as in the example above.  But here is
</I>&gt;<i>     another example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     One branch of the &quot;street littering&quot; tree is drafting a radically
</I>&gt;<i>     different version of the bylaw.  They only have a few votes but
</I>&gt;<i>     they feel they have the capacity to grow among certain
</I>&gt;<i>     communities in the city.  So they identify inter-community
</I>&gt;<i>     extension as a crucial resource (resources = extension +
</I>&gt;<i>     agreement) and go to work at it.  Naturally they expose this as
</I>&gt;<i>     their public resource message.  They need help in order to extend
</I>&gt;<i>     to other communities, so they ask for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting! Yes I think it will work. But to show the number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active communities in the vote-space is additional to the other 4
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maps, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the other 4 maps (graph/table maps) are now secondary.  They
</I>&gt;<i> are likely still needed, but not front and center.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Now to communities: As we've discovered, the crucial resource in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the beginning is not actually agreement or money, but rather the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> talk itself.  Unless the conversation can extend over a sufficient
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> number of communities - spread its wings and fly - it dies.  So
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the content we need to show is the number of active communities
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> over which each branch or tree of votespace has extended itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We want the first time viewer to realize, &quot;Ah, I see!  These
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people are growing an extended conversation.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But here too: the content of the drafts plus the votes plus the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> number of communities ... all together, right? Or do you picture it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as seperate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;2 second&quot; message is focused on inter-community extension in this
</I>&gt;<i> case.  Votespace is tailored accordingly.  I figure we show only the
</I>&gt;<i> count of active communities (or whatever) and not the count of votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess we'd provide a control for the user to switch resources.  For
</I>&gt;<i> most of the forest in example (4), there would only be the one
</I>&gt;<i> resource, &quot;agreement&quot; as measured by votes.  But some branches would
</I>&gt;<i> also allow &quot;extension&quot; to be selected as a resource, and others would
</I>&gt;<i> allow &quot;labour&quot;.  And so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas has concerns about (c), and I try to factor them out here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (1) That we should pioneer the practice of extension manually, so to
</I>&gt;<i>     speak, without tool supports.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) That tools might not be needed for this practice at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (3) That the practice is only useful during the early adoption phase
</I>&gt;<i>     of the technology.  Once the first poll hits the news, nobody
</I>&gt;<i>     will be worried about extension anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (4) That it's wasteful to develop tools that are likely to be
</I>&gt;<i>     outmoded so soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with (1) and disagree with the others.  But did I state these
</I>&gt;<i> correctly, Thomas?
