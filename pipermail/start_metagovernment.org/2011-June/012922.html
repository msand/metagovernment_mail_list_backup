<PRE>Dear All,

Is Metagovernment now a list that only discusses the development of
the Crossforum Theater and Pollwiki?

I have asked on the agenda for the meeting

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/9</A>

that those two projects were presented to the rest of the community,

&gt;<i>Detail, explain, discuss pollwikis and Crossforum Theatre. More specifically:
</I>&gt;<i>Present it for members who have not been involved with the development.
</I>
that answer was:

&gt;<i>Out of respect for people's time, this presentation is likely to be extremely short (a few words at most). The list archive has several months of discussion that amount to a longer presentation, which attendees can read on their own time. ~Michael Allan
</I>
There is a difference between developmental discussion and non
developmental discussion.

As the major developer (with Chris Anderson and Derek Peterson, also
on the list, although silent) of another project, Vilfredo goes to
Athens, I have tried to keep the list both informed about what was
going on, and not flood it with the minutes of the development. And we
did many development and others are on the production line. There were
times were on the list most of the thread were concerned with
Vilfredo, and I sensed this was not ok so I lowered the volume, to let
the general discussion in metagovernment raise again.

Metagovernment community members are working on several projects:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>

some of them are only nominally members of metagovernment (&quot;yes,
please add me&quot;), but others were born, and raised inside the
community. Sometimes a discussion in the list have given the intuition
to a member to start writing something. Other times a person come to
the list with their own project, and has an interaction with the list
that changes and modifies their own project. All this points to the
fact that the metagovernment list is wider than any single project.
This year, as Matias has pointed out, the number of mails from the
list have absolutely exploded, but they all have focused on those two
projects.

Let me clarify, I think it is great that so many members are doing
those two great projects. I think, for what I could gather, that they
are interesting. But I also think that the metagovernment community
cannot, and should not, only limit itself to those two projects.

So let me rephrase my question:

How can we keep on the community of people interested in
metagovernment, produce more projects, keep the discussion alive,
while also keep on bringing forward the development of those two
projects?

Could those projects, like the others in metagovernment, have their
own developmental list. And then inform us of the new improvement once
they have already been implemented. It is common for projects to have
a dev list and a general discussion list. Metagovernment is a
meta-project list. I would not be surprised if eventually we find out
we need not two but 5 lists to manage all those projects, two for each
project and then the metagovernment list, but for now, could we have
please an extra list that works side by side to metagovernment:
CrossforumAndPollwiki/dev.

Also, is the meeting of this sunday a development meeting where the
developers of Crossforum &amp; Pollwiki meet or is it a general
metagovernment meeting?

Because ti looks like it cannot be both, as Michael says,
&quot;&gt;Out of respect for people's time&quot; .

Thank you,
Pietro
