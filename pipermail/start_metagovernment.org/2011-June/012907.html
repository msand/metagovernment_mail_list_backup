<PRE>I will think about what you are saying
appraisal in some form must come into play I agree

</I>&gt;<i> You say: *No good making decisions unless we know who is  making them and
</I>&gt;<i> in the name of what.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your method of decision making is voting (or autocracy) then that is (I
</I>&gt;<i> guess) true. Although, I am not quite sure what the situation would be in
</I>&gt;<i> which the identities of the voters would not be known, and voters generally
</I>&gt;<i> are free to vote as they see fit, so that &quot;in the name of what&quot; I don't
</I>&gt;<i> quite follow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the appraisal system, the actual decision is made by software, using the
</I>&gt;<i> three independent appraisals as inputs. The appraisals themselves are posted
</I>&gt;<i> publicly at the point the decision has been made, and the code of the
</I>&gt;<i> decision software is open source and publicly available as well. Thus the
</I>&gt;<i> decision making is &quot;radically transparent.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The appraisers are information gatherers, not decision makers. Who they are
</I>&gt;<i> is known (the system selected them in the first place), and their required
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;agenda&quot; is to honestly appraise. If they try to &quot;game the system&quot; by
</I>&gt;<i> answering questions to affect the subsequent software decision, that will be
</I>&gt;<i> detected (the three independent appraisals will have differing answers) and
</I>&gt;<i> investigated, and lead to a nullification of the decision and a lowering of
</I>&gt;<i> their rating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The functionality of the decision software is proposed (each appraisal
</I>&gt;<i> question has associated decision functionality), and has to pass
</I>&gt;<i> successfully through the appraisal process to be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The appraisal system provides more decision transparency than any voting
</I>&gt;<i> system can. The decision making in parliaments is so opaque as to be
</I>&gt;<i> cartoonish.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *For the collective to be a good cosmopolitan one it must have a means to
</I>&gt;<i> consider all matters of concern to both human and non human actors  and to
</I>&gt;<i> decide which scripts are in and which out.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes! The appraisal system accomplishes this. Voting does not. Parliaments
</I>&gt;<i> do not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *When I talk about constitution I mean the constitution of such
</I>&gt;<i> a parliament.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why does it have to be a parliament? Parliaments concentrate power
</I>&gt;<i> enormously, they have been shown historically to be remarkably unresponsive
</I>&gt;<i> and easily corrupted, and on and on. I may be wrong, but from what I have
</I>&gt;<i> seen on the site and on the listserve over the last few months, I doubt that
</I>&gt;<i> there is anyone in the Metagovernment community who thinks that parliaments
</I>&gt;<i> are a good idea. Even with voting as the method, there are much better
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Hi Steve,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (WARNING: This email contains unsolicited advice, with a sprinkling of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Knute Rockne. Making an appropriate face while reading it is the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requisite response ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Constitutions are so Gutenberg. As George Bush famously pointed out, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are just pieces of paper. (He also *demonstrated* that they are just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pieces of paper, in numerous ways. For example, here in the USA the right to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a writ of habeas corpus is now just a guideline.) Without a trustworthy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision making system, constitutions are not worth the  electrons that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paint them on the screen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We have the technology available to create a trustworthy decision making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, and to program the constitutional provisions directly into that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision making process. That same technology enables us to involve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global public in the accumulation and ordering of the constitutional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provisions, from the beginning (so that the creation as well as the content
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be cosmopolitan). If we do this, we can involve and inspire the world
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or at least the humans; the nonhumans will probably just roll their eyes).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There are already lots of constitutions out there. Arguably (I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> argue) that none of the constitutions that have actually been tried have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> worked very well, mainly because they all depend on combinations of voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and autocracy to have their effect. Going off in a corner with a little
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> group to write yet another constitution will not inspire the world, will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> waste an opportunity (to inspire the world), and will face the hurdle of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trying to drum up interest in it after it is written.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In an earlier email I mentioned setting up an online game. One appropriate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aim within that game would be to collect, order, and make operational all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the necessary constitutional provisions for a new cosmopolitan eco-friendly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social system. Another (complementary) aim would be to create and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> demonstrate the decision making system itself in the process.  Yet another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> aim would be to familiarize increasing numbers of people with how the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision making system worked, and with how all the constitutional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> provisions worked. Another aim would be to create a context within which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that new Lamborghini could amaze us all.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> processes, to its full potential effect.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here in the Metagovernment community, consensus is highly valued. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> main problem with consensus voting (&quot;everybody agrees&quot;) is that generally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everybody (certainly in parliaments) does not agree. Once the voting becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a contest, with winners and losers, good information such as controversy
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mapping becomes just another tactical weapon. The (private) motives of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> individual legislators carry much more weight in decision making than the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (public) controversy mapping information. Here in the USA, one need only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> watch the travails of Ron Paul (in the US Congress) as he pursues his
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Quixotic Quest to bring down the Federal Reserve to see this reality in

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anything. Systemically, congresses and parliaments are generally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unresponsive to the public, and unresponsive to good information, and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> unresponsive to the interests of nonhumans (such as power grids, or habitats

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I tracked into the links that you provided, including reading the first
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> chapter of *Pandora's Hope*. My impression is that Latour's work is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> indeed complementary to the kind of work that is being done in the various
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects, but (very interestingly!) there is very little
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> overlap. The Metagovernment projects (including mine) are focused on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> precisely those decision making situations in which nonhumans *cannot*directly speak (e.g., any voting situation), whereas Latour is interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> studying situations in which they can (such as electrical grid power outage
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> situations). The world contains both, so attention to both is appropriate.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The studying of &quot;wild&quot; situations in which nonhumans can speak leads to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> policy proposals (e.g. provide more reactive power in the electrical power
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> grids). Those policy proposals then compete for attention in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rough-and-tumble human decision making systems we have now. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment projects are aimed at creating better human decision making
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, that will more appropriately receive and act upon proposals such as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> those flowing from Latour's studies. To me, that looks pretty complementary,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and also pretty non-overlapping. (I can empathize that reading my articles
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would have been hard -- not much of interest there from Latour's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> perspective.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (An example of this divergence appeared in the macospol material. All
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the brilliant new work of controversy mapping culminates in testing the work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in a &quot;quasi parliament.&quot; For those of us working on replacements for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parliamentary systems, that is rather like building a hot new Lamborghini
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and then testing it by using it as a wheelbarrow in the back yard. In the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> parliaments that we have now, most of the time when a technical vote comes
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> up, the parliamentarians ask their lobbyist handlers how to vote and then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vote that way. To have the controversy mapping really &quot;show its stuff&quot; it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would need to be tested in decision making systems in which it would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actually be appreciated and used.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You write: *Not sure how appraisal will help if it is not universally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> adopted?*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First, indeed, the more widely it were adopted, the more helpful it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be. And also, the &quot;adoption&quot; takes place one individual at a time,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> beginning in the realms of appreciation and intent. To me the most
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate way to create and demonstrate the system would be through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> introducing it as an online game. Unlike new voting systems, the appraisal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system will have to go through a development period before it will be ready
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to make &quot;real&quot; decisions that actually affect people's lives. The
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate impetus for incremental adoption would then be that the system
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> demonstrates itself to be better than what we have.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In your email you said:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So given your appraisal idea it would be necessary to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Am I correct that the mechanism you have in mind &quot;to give non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> representation and a voice&quot; is to &quot;attune to our subliminal bond with things
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and one another&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If so, it appears to me that the appraisal system is indeed just what
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would be needed to enable that voice (speaking through attuned humans) to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> manifest reliably in the realm of social decision making. To me our work
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> seems highly complementary.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (From what you wrote in the email, I couldn't quite tell whether you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> were making a suggestion having read the summary, or making a suggestion
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> having read the work itself. If the latter, please let me know. I had
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thought that, in the work itself, it was pretty clear that giving non humans
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a voice was one of my main concerns, and one of the major design aims of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system. If that wasn't clear, I will need to do some more rewriting, and I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> could use your help in guiding me regarding what to write.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding &quot;decisions come from alliances,&quot; certainly in public voting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems, legislatures, bureaucracies, and corporations many decisions do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> involve alliances, and tribes. However, the same history that supports that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> view also supports the view that non humans and future generations and other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> entities that cannot directly join the alliances generally suffer when
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions come from alliances of tribes. Alliances of tribes tend to put
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their own interests ahead of the interests of those outside of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alliances. A &quot;nobody objects&quot; consensus system (such as the appraisal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system) can much more reliably support the interests of non humans (through
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even only a few attuned humans). In such a system, decisions do not come
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> from alliances, and protection of non humans does not depend in each
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particular decision on &quot;the generosity of strangers.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Regarding building tribes who share the value of a more harmonious and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just relationship between humans and non-humans, yes! And also, I would hope
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and expect that such tribes will see the wisdom of having a social decision
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> making system that can be trusted to uphold that value in every decision.
