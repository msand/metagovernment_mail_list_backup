<PRE>Hello, group.

I have been on hiatus for quite some time while dealing with some complex issues in my personal life. No promises; but hopefully you&#8217;ll see me around more now.

I just want to say how happy and proud I am that this group has continued to thrive without me. It is the mark of a good non-authoritarian system that the founder can fall away and nobody really cares. :) Thank you. And kudos.

(Currently I have only read back a couple months, so I apologize if I am ignorant of some of the content of previous discussions.)

Sorry about that. It was likely more that I had not enough attention to give. In any event, I am not against delegation outright; and really like the way it was implemented in Votorola. And as for me being the &#8220;main guy,&#8221; I have no more say than anyone else here, so my opinion carries no special weight.
