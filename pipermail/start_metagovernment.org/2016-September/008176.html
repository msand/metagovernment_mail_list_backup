Agreed! Although I'd add that, at least as it applies to the subject
line &quot;Direct Democracy&quot; convenience and having it available on all
platforms (especially smart phones) are also essential features.

&gt;<i> Good understanding of deliberative theory. Deliberation is a very complex
</I>&gt;<i> field. Having good understanding in the filed, may help the team understand
</I>&gt;<i> what they should develop.
</I>
For a deliberative system, I agree. Unfortunately my considered
opinion is that deliberative systems and &quot;direct democracy&quot; systems
are almost entirely non-overlapping fields: A direct democracy system
that must support more than a few dozen individuals cannot even have a
significant deliberative component, nor does it need one.

&gt;<i> Money: developing a software is a long run effort. Most of us couldn't run
</I>&gt;<i> so long, without monetary support.
</I>
Agreed, but we need to be extremely careful about what the source of
support is: I for one am sure that no government funding is
acceptable, nor is funding from any organization that receives
government funding. The reason is that those funds will be cut off as
soon as the new (and competing) system gains any traction at all.
Self-funding and then crowdfunding is therefore the only viable path.

&gt;<i> A good way to work together and develop together. Most of the projects I had
</I>&gt;<i> met, where not so cooperative in their developing strategy.
</I>
I'm not so sure about this either: I've been out of the business for
awhile now, but at least up until 2000 or so there was very little
&quot;breakthrough&quot; software that wasn't developed by at most a handful of
people. In most cases in my experience the majority of the
functionality was developed by a single developer. My prediction is
that this is how it will be for the new EDD system too: If there are
10 people who want to develop a system, better 9 of them each devote
10% of their income to fund 90% of the time of best coder among them
than try to help out by each donating 10% of their time. This is
certainly not an optimal situation, but I believe it is an accurate
description of how the world really works.
