<PRE>&gt;<i> Then how do you explain the &quot;success&quot; of projects like Avaaz and MoveOn?
</I>I am only familiar with change.org, but let's assume they are similar. From what I have seen, the most popular petitions are usually driven by emotions. The cases often concern individuals or small groups of people. But not always, and that gives me some hope. On the other hand, the petitions about global issues could be just a byproduct: when millions of people are signing petitions, there will be all kind of petitions getting some support.
I also see plenty of counter examples. Take&#160; Placeavote. It went out of business in August, so you cannot look inside, but can roughly describe it. People were voting on bills dealing with global issues: gun control and gun rights, abortions, etc. Bills your rewritten in simple language condensed in no more than a couple of paragraphs. There was a marketing push, so they got some attention, some several hundreds people registered. About 10^2 bills were voted on, some 10^3 comments made (people could also discuss issues), at most some 10^4 votes were cast. There was no delegation. After 5 months the place was deserted. With 500k funding, why did not it grow big like change, avaaz or moveon?
&gt;<i> So, what is your proposed alternative?
</I>Well, I do not have a good proposal. As a helpful partial goal, I think that a successful demonstration (in any context) that delegation is working and that it is useful would be a significant achievement. Even that has not been done. (I do not consider the pirate party a successful example).

</I>
So, what is your proposed alternative?

To be specific, mine is *not* that the votes be &quot;advisory&quot;, which is
how Avaaz and MoveOn work, and which IMHO actually works *against*
real change because there's an implied deference to the
misrepresentatives (i.e., it is implied that they can just ignore the
advice). Instead, at first in my system the votes would be nonbinding
merely because the &quot;yes&quot; votes would be less than a majority of the
population. Once, that threshold is achieved, however, they would
automatically *become* binding, regardless of what those currently in
power would prefer. How to characterize this future shift is a
marketing issue (i.e., to be decided later, depending on how we see
perception of the tool develop), but it wouldn't have any impact on
the technical specifications of the implementation (i.e., there is no
&quot;make it binding&quot; button, the binding part being an emergent
phenomenon based on the number of people who use it).
