</I>
I think we already have such a system. It's called &quot;capitalism&quot; ;-)
It's amazing because it's &quot;self organizing&quot; which is a feature you
seem to be particularly fond of. A lot of public policy implementation
could take advantage of this that currently don't, most notably our
school and prison systems which IMHO don't work exactly *because* they
don't. But the problem with capitalism, and the main reason we need a
government in the first place, is the need for regulation (ideas, or
more accurately the people who can best exploit them, can become *too*
successful). I can't think of any way for &quot;ideas&quot; regarding regulation
to ever come into effect automagically based on their merit. Can you?

&gt;<i> 2. Such a system avoids all the complexity of developing/choosing the best
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making system, including our perennial arguments about delegation,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>
I think there is no &quot;argument&quot; about the need for proxies/delegation,
at least so far as whether a scalable general-purpose decisionmaking
system needs one or not. Even the vast majority of the human
population agrees with this, though the form they've accepted so far
(elected representatives as the delegates) is perhaps the most
primitive and easily corrupted implementation.  The only credible
alternative is some sort of sampling-based system and, near as I can
tell, no one has seriously promoted one of those (notably absent of
course is Ned, who apparently not only won't argue for it, he won't
even admit that it's a key component of his Blinap proposal).

The debate, then, is just on how to *do* proxies/delegation. I think
we have sufficient evidence from how misrepresentative democracy has
failed to know what some of the features our new systems must include
and exclude:
1) No &quot;parties&quot;, which restrict choice and facilitate corruption.
2) Limits on the number of votes a delegate can carry, excessive
numbers of which also facilitate corruption.
3) Matching proxies based on personality characteristics and possibly
secondarily based on voting records, but definitely not on anything
like expertise or personal relationships (this is IMHO why &quot;Liquid
Democracy&quot;, which assumes proxies are chosen using these methods,
can't work: It is just based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how
the world works. Not all experts agree. On *anything*, let alone
everything).
4) Number 3 also seems to me to rule out redelegation, because after
one or two hops you lose the connection between the voter's
personality and that of the proxies (again, because we need to match
personalities, not expertise/rationality/etc).

&gt;<i> However in crowdsourcing, there is generally some sort of voting: something
</I>&gt;<i> that says this person&#8217;s piece of the idea is better than that person&#8217;s. But
</I>&gt;<i> that voting can be very lightweight and indecisive. I.e., votes can be
</I>&gt;<i> tallied for this or that sentence, but&#8230; nothing more than tallied. (For
</I>&gt;<i> example, think of how Slashdot presents all comments with their scores, and
</I>&gt;<i> leaves it to the reader to decide if they want to filter based on score.)
</I>
This is more accurately called &quot;rating&quot; rather than voting, because it
applies at a meta-level (to the &quot;reviews&quot; of the proposal that's being
voted on, rather than on the proposal itself). I agree that it's an
important feature to have to help those who want to make a direct vote
make their decision. But IMHO it's important to keep in mind that it's
a separate system from the voting system itself.

My current thinking is to tie the two together at the time a vote is
cast. I.e., the early voters (who are making themselves available as
proxies) would cast their vote and *then* be invited to make a short
statement about *why* they voted the way they did, The would also
could then rate a handful of other such statements (i.e., like
&quot;moderation points&quot; in Slashdot). This eliminates many ways of &quot;gaming
the system&quot; people exploit on other forums (overposting, direct
attacks on other users, banning and other forms of censorship,
brigading, wasting time on straw-man arguments, etc.) It also
eliminates the need for threading, which, although that's generally
powerful, it's unfortunately exploited by people who are more
interested in having a debate than in making a decision (those people
can go debate someplace else). For a decision-making system we should
only allow one shot at making your best argument for why a proposal
should pass, and people should only be able to *look* at those
statements prior to casting a vote, not interact with them.

&gt;<i> As I recall, this was the general idea behind Candiwi (an early project to
</I>&gt;<i> come out of Metagov, developed by the Barkhau brothers), but that project
</I>&gt;<i> got dropped.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/fabe/candiwi">https://bitbucket.org/fabe/candiwi</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone aware of other such systems in development/publication? And what
</I>&gt;<i> is your opinion of this approach?
</I>
Again, this looks to me more like a tool for shaping proposals rather
than decisionmaking. But these are two different things, although both
of which are needed to run a government. My focus (and I believe all
of our focuses) should be on the latter. There are lots of ways to do
the former, and IMHO in most cases we don't need to concern ourselves
or The People with exactly how that sausage is made (indeed, once the
system is up and running I expect the vast majority of proposals to
come directly from the executive branch rather than from The People
and so will have to be judged directly on their merits rather than on
any sort of meta-knowledge about how they were created).
