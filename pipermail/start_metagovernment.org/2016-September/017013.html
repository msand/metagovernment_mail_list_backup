</I>&gt;<i> Wow. That's twice in one day that I've been stunned by someone

I don't know why you insist on actively trying to misunderstand.
Here's what you said yourself in the other mail:

&gt;<i> This is exactly the opposite of the way it should work: Votes should
</I>&gt;<i> be delegated (to someone psychologically like you) *by default* and
</I>&gt;<i> only over-ridden if you think you know better than your proxies do
</I>
You just described exactly how liquid democracy works.
So somewhere in your mind the not-invented-here syndrome may be
making you reject something that implements exactly what you want.
So once, more let's try to understand where your misunderstanding
is rooted:

&gt;<i> promoting a system that I had assumed we were all in agreement doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> work (in this case &quot;government by the elite&quot;, AKA &quot;oligarchy&quot;). Well I
</I>&gt;<i> guess I should be thankful at least you only qualify for &quot;elite&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> status based on the time you have to invest rather than something like
</I>&gt;<i> being of superior breeding stock.
</I>
In LD you delegate by default unless you think you know better and
thus vote yourself. Should you have reason to doubt the honesty,
political orientation or competence of your delegatee, you
are invited to change it. As many times as you like. The result is
a leadership which is so incredibly liquid, that it can in no way
on earth be called an oligarchy.

An example of how much this works happened to Martin Haase. He was
the most delegated person in the early period of that LQFB. So
much, the Spiegel even wrote a piece on it:

<A HREF="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html</A>

But the Spiegel was wrong in calling him the most powerful pirate.
One or two weeks after the article, the professor incidentally had
a very controversial opinion on an issue. Word got around and his
delegation support collapsed. You can only be at the top if you are
indeed promoting the most intelligent answers to the political
questions of the collective. Any false move removes you from that
position in a flash. That is so totally different from representative
democracy where all the *real* power comes from the ability to do
the things your supporters would crucify you for, but can't.

You must understand that your established criteria for good and bad
are challenged by this totally different model, and your attempt to
understand it without several years of practice is like trying to
give lessons in disco rollerskating without attempts to either dance
or skate. Excuse me if your attempts to categorize LQFB by your
expertise falls flat on its feet.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately, however, you're also wrong because you apparently
</I>&gt;<i> didn't read that part of the article carefully enough: The votes where
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;supervoter&quot; don't match the regular voters were the ones that
</I>&gt;<i> *weren't* delegated. Unless you're going to make the claim that all or
</I>&gt;<i> at least most individual votes were bogus (in which case you're not
</I>&gt;<i> really a proponent of direct democracy at all), you still have to
</I>&gt;<i> explain this discrepancy, and respond to my objection to any system
</I>&gt;<i> that doesn't match voters to proxies based on personality
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics rather than some sort of &quot;expertise&quot;.
</I>
Yes, I am not a promoter of direct democracy. I see how the AfD
right-wing populist movement in Germany is growing because it uses
direct democracy to re-enforce and legitimize the existing prejudices
of its members and electorate, and I think it is Trumpism in the
digital age. Trumpism legitimized by the ideal of participation.

LQFB does work because it does not work the way you want it to,
because what you want is flawed. There is no discrepancy. One
actual weakness of the early versions of LQFB was that it invited
people to do vote shopping. By that I mean to skip the entire
debating process, glance over the top one or two proposals, then
quickly vote on them. That I think was a weakness that has been
reduced by improved UX that tries to tie interested people into
the debate earlier in the process, so that they actually do get
educated. It was however never a major problem *because* the
superdelegates were able to dig deeper into the subjects and
make a counter-weight to superficial decisions.

Yes, there is room for improvement in LQFB, but the astounding
thing to learn is that according to the data we have now it is
the least bad system of governance/consensus and we should work
from that, not keep making mistakes of excess direct democracy
or corrupt representativity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *for* if not just a way to ensure that the Will of The People is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> properly assessed? Was it *designed* to be just another tool for the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> powerful to use to exploit them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The Will of The People is not direct democracy. If you let everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> click their current opinion they will actually achieve populism, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I think you've misdiagnosed the problem. There problem with
</I>&gt;<i> populism isn't that it isn't democracy or &quot;The Will of The People&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> it's that what most people think of populism is actually people being
</I>&gt;<i> manipulated by demagogues. But you can fix this by limiting the power
</I>&gt;<i> of demagogues (IMHO this means supervoters in LQFB) in ways that don't
</I>&gt;<i> require restricting the ability of regular folk to control their own
</I>&gt;<i> destiny.
</I>
That is a simplification that will not work out as the example of AfD
shows. You are probably thinking of individuals like Trump, Berlusconi
or Erdogan, but AfD is a collective with several heads at the top, and
they all say the same kind of populist homophobic sexistic racist crap
because they re-enforced themselves collectively to think that is okay
by direct democracy voting. They essentially collectively agreed that
being a prejudiced idiot that doesn't look at issues in-depth is an
okay attitude in politics, and they are gaining ground this way, because
idiot electorate finds it easier to relate to their own prejudices than
to real political considerations.

&gt;&gt;<i> If your idea of democracy is the sort where prejudice would win over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason, then I don't want to use your tools..  :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds pretty naive to me: We're *all* prejudiced. Worse, we all have
</I>&gt;<i> different personalities. You seem to think the &quot;elites&quot; have somehow
</I>
No, the only &quot;elites&quot; that can arise out of LQFB are because of their
ability to dissect problems and come up with reasonable proposals.
And their status is tied to that ability to stay.

&gt;<i> freed themselves of these burdens and so can make purely &quot;rational&quot;
</I>
The rational comes from the continuous control by the many. Trumpist
bullshit cannot stand as tall if any party member can post a fact-check
within the weeks of time any proposal needs to stand up against debate.
The reason AfD is populist is because there never was any debate - the
party members were simply given a multiple choice interview on their
prejudiced opinions.

Why are you even in this mailing list if you don't see how technology
and procedures can bring about more or less rationality and sensible
output to digital democracy? Am I falling prey to the old fallacy of
mailing lists that the person that posts the most appears to be
important and representative of the general opinion on the list when
it actually is just the person that posts the most?

It is absurd that we are discussing e-platforms over one of the least
democratic instruments humanity has ever invented: mailing lists.

It's not useful to anyone if you misinterpret my report in ways
that are completely wrong. Everything about the Piraten failed
BUT Liquid Democracy. I'm sad we're not having a rational
discussion on this, but what do I expect from a mailing list.
So just because you are the loudest you think you can propose
a general consensus based on your logical fallacies and
misunderstandings?

&gt;<i> 2) Misidentifying the cause of the problems in existing political
</I>&gt;<i> systems. This can clearly be seen even in their own &quot;marketing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> literature, such as:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note the phrase &quot;domination of the extroverts&quot; in the Description
</I>&gt;<i> section. This discloses a profound ignorance of the work done by Haidt
</I>&gt;<i> and Altemeyer and a great many other researchers that showed that it's
</I>&gt;<i> NOT &quot;extroverts&quot; that are the problem, it's high RWA and SDO behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> I survey this literature on matchism.org, but I think the single
</I>&gt;<i> greatest experiment that demonstrates this was Altemeyer's Global
</I>&gt;<i> Change Game experiment, the paper on that available as:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>
</I>
Luckily the paper was quite an interesting read, but it has not
addressed the issue of extroverts at all and we have had PLENTY of
problems with left-wing extroverts causing havoc, so the idea that
problematic social behavior only comes from the right is utterly false.

&gt;<i> 3) Not providing any delegate-matching tools, which results in very
</I>&gt;<i> low use of delegation. In the LQFB paper carlo provided the link to
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>) I calculate that only about
</I>&gt;<i> 15% of users even *use* the delegation system. Why even claim this as
</I>&gt;<i> such as an important feature when so few people even use it?
</I>
Because, as the paper described, it stabilized the will of the
participants to have the actually expected outcomes, not derive into
the usual useless direct democratic results. Your way of ignoring
the actual findings of the paper isn't useful to our debate here.

&gt;<i> Worse, because there are so many proposals and the median user only
</I>&gt;<i> voted about 8 times in 3 years, the result is that the *effective*
</I>&gt;<i> participation rate, even including delegation, is down around 20%.
</I>
They also included the long periods when the general assemblies weren't
actually respecting the outcome of LQFB. I presume only the first half
year is really representative - the time it took for the participants
to realize their hard work was going to be ignored by the leadership
and the extroverts at the general assemblies.

So the numbers are surprisingly good even if the participants had all
good reasons to continue working after the first half year.

[&#8230;]
&gt;<i> it ignores the fact that these &quot;supervoters&quot; will as a result engage in
</I>&gt;<i> all kinds of corrupt activity (quid-pro-quo favors, log rolling,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.), activity that's can't even be monitored by the public (via the
</I>&gt;<i> press) like it is in misrepresentative democracy.
</I>
Bullshit. This has never worked and never happened in my experience.
You are again talking about disco rollerskating. I explained why this
can't happen and you have your own reasons to teach rollerskating.

&gt;<i> 6) There's something very strange going on with a group of what I
</I>&gt;<i> guess should be called &quot;hypervoters&quot;, 38 individuals with more than
</I>&gt;<i> 100 delegations. In the paper, they say these voters are not
</I>&gt;<i> statistically significant and so they excluded them from the analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to me that these would actually be the most interesting cases,
</I>&gt;<i> since they are even closer to being oligarchs than the run-of-the-mill
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;supervoters&quot;. The paper also notes that consolidation continues to
</I>&gt;<i> increase and because there is no limit on this delegation the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;supervoters&quot; (and &quot;hypervoters&quot;) are continuing to gain power. Oh, to
</I>&gt;<i> have psychological profiles of these people (my money of course would
</I>&gt;<i> be on that they're textbook SDAP).
</I>
That is the first thing I read that *could* be a point. Right now I
can't either confirm or debunk this, but if you want to convince me
of anything it will not be enough to just make up something in a
mailing list. In that case I would expect you to publish a paper
that scientifically challenges the findings of Koblenz/Mainz and then
I'd be open ears what the rest of the scientific community thinks.

Right now I have the impression that your prejudices have been so
blinding on your ability to judge the overall functioning of the
system, that it is not to be expected that you actually have a point
here.

&gt;<i> 7) I previously said that redelegation is a flaw, but now believe that
</I>&gt;<i> in the cast of LQFB it's irrelevant: The fact that there is such a low
</I>&gt;<i> correlation between the voter and delegates means that there is no
</I>&gt;<i> significant loss of correlation with each redelegation (i.e., all the
</I>&gt;<i> good stuff is lost in the first jump). In a system where the proxies
</I>&gt;<i> actually vote like the voter granting the proxy, of course,
</I>&gt;<i> redelegation *would* be a serious flaw.
</I>
In liquid democratic theory the transitivity of proxying is essential
to actually achieve the effect of collective intelligence that we
really experienced. The Bavarian section has later tried a different
method of selecting a choice of possible proxies rather than allowing
transitivity, and that I think has lead to concentration of power in
the most popular figures, but we don't have scientific evidence on that.

In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
individual can't know what is the best choice.

I understand your allergy against that kind of thinking, but there is
a fundamental difference to representative democracy: In the broken
governance models we experience in western democracies we are told
that the experts and oligarchs know better, but thanks to the power
of corruption that isn't true. Whereas in the liquid democratic
model the temporary leadership arises out of actual reason and is
not corruptible, therefore it is not only okay, it is necessary to
model the failure of the individual to assert what's best for him.

This is my personal guess. Can't say if other LD proponents would
agree and I'm not in a position to write papers on this.

&gt;<i> 8) Low quality proposals, and way too many of them: Specific examples
</I>&gt;<i> of actual proposals are hard to come by, but all the examples cited in
</I>&gt;<i> all the papers and web pages I've found show lots of &quot;toy&quot; proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> Being incomplete means that some &quot;elite&quot; will need to come along and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;refine&quot; them before they can be voted on by the &quot;real&quot; government,
</I>&gt;<i> introducing yet another way the system can be gamed. A viable system
</I>&gt;<i> for government will have to present a much smaller set of much higher
</I>&gt;<i> quality proposals to the voters.
</I>
I guess after the first year the quality of the proposals collapsed.
I wasn't there myself because the Italian LQFB was delivering much
better and exciting output at the time. But I know for sure that in
the best deployment I ever experienced, the Berlin deployment of 2010
(which is not considered by any paper unfortunately) those proposals
were so incredibly good that the nation is still discussing them today.

&gt;<i> Just to end on a positive note, the one thing they did get right was
</I>&gt;<i> the need for &quot;open voting&quot; (for verifyability of the final votes).
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad it seems to have been removed now, no doubt at the insistence
</I>&gt;<i> of trolls and other antisocials who fear not that *other* people will
</I>&gt;<i> be discriminated against (although that's of course what they say),
</I>&gt;<i> but rather that *their* antisocial behavior could possibly have
</I>
Yes, the Piraten misunderstood their role of politicians who should be
transparent with their role of citizen that deserve privacy. They
caused major damage to the project by requiring to have some privacy
to themselves that would risk harming the transparency and credibility
of the platform while at the same time being able to influence big
political decisions.

I personally have come to the conclusion that citizen have to decide
whether they want to participate in political decision-making processes
or rather not. Protection against political discrimination is difficult
to enforce, but luckily it only needs ten thousand people in a LQFB to
already produce much much better governance than Capitol Hill. I am
convinced we can save humanity on planet earth even if only about 1%
of people care to do politics.

&gt;<i> real-world repercussions. Curious, though, that the Liquid Democracy
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia page now redirects to &quot;Delegative Democracy&quot;, which of
</I>&gt;<i> course insists that secret votes are necessary (foxes guarding the
</I>&gt;<i> henhouse again, I guess):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy</A>
</I>
I don't think any Wikipedia got much of anything right about anything
in this field. Far too much opinionated editing. Wikipedia is neither
democratic nor sufficiently fact-based.

&gt;<i> [&#8230;] but I'm quite sure you're wrong and that the primary
</I>&gt;<i> difference is only that you more closely resemble those elites and so
</I>&gt;<i> don't see these as problems. If the majority of the population would
</I>&gt;<i> vote to kill all the blacks or the Jews (or the Muslims or the gays or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever), we've got bigger problems than a few million people getting
</I>&gt;<i> murdered (i.e., we're *all* going to die at the hands of some
</I>&gt;<i> vigilante group or SDAP dictator with a nuke that The People would
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;elect&quot;). I'm sure they won't do this, but it seems to me you don't
</I>&gt;<i> trust people enough to allow us to find out. I guess that's why you
</I>&gt;<i> prefer a system where they are &quot;protected&quot; from their own Clinations
</I>&gt;<i> by oligarchs, the system that LQFB would re-create if it were left to
</I>&gt;<i> run long enough.
</I>
Oh right. Logical fallacies and classical troll-style ad hominem
attacks. Looks like you aren't so sure about your argumentations
after all. You should try a Reduction ad Hitlerum next.
