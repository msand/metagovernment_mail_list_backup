<PRE>In the spirit of &quot;learning from other people's mistakes&quot; (and possibly
at risk of beating a dead horse ;-) I submit this list of the mistakes
made by the developers of the LQFB system, and in the design of Liquid
Democracy in general. My main conclusion is that I think we're very
lucky that LiquidFeedback failed early on and primarily for political
reasons: If it (and the people using it) had ever grown powerful
enough to be a major influence in how public policy decisions were
made, the internal flaws in its design would have been exposed, the
system would have collapsed *anyway*, and in doing so would have set
back the adoption of any future Direct Democracy systems by years or
perhaps even decades.

1) The decision to &quot;work within the system&quot; to try to change it,
rather than providing a complete alternative, IMHO dooms any DD
project to failure. Limiting your project to a fringe political party
within that system reduces the odds of success even further. I think
carlo von lynX did a good job of detailing how this political failure
occurred with LQFB in his post:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2016-September/008180.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2016-September/008180.html</A>

To recap the entire thread, go to the summary page for September 2016
and do an in-page search for &quot;Lessons&quot;:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2016-September/subject.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2016-September/subject.html</A>

2) Misidentifying the cause of the problems in existing political
systems. This can clearly be seen even in their own &quot;marketing&quot;
literature, such as:
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback</A>

Note the phrase &quot;domination of the extroverts&quot; in the Description
section. This discloses a profound ignorance of the work done by Haidt
and Altemeyer and a great many other researchers that showed that it's
NOT &quot;extroverts&quot; that are the problem, it's high RWA and SDO behavior.
I survey this literature on matchism.org, but I think the single
greatest experiment that demonstrates this was Altemeyer's Global
Change Game experiment, the paper on that available as:
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>

3) Not providing any delegate-matching tools, which results in very
low use of delegation. In the LQFB paper carlo provided the link to
(<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>) I calculate that only about
15% of users even *use* the delegation system. Why even claim this as
such as an important feature when so few people even use it?

Worse, because there are so many proposals and the median user only
voted about 8 times in 3 years, the result is that the *effective*
participation rate, even including delegation, is down around 20%.
This is exactly the opposite of the way it should work: Votes should
be delegated (to someone psychologically like you) *by default* and
only over-ridden if you think you know better than your proxies do
(i.e., you're confident that you have sufficiently educated yourself
on the issue). That way the best estimate of your opinion is reflected
even if you choose not to vote or lack the time to even to go looking
around for someone to delegate to.

4) As I pointed out previously,the paper also shows very clearly that
there is a very low correlation between individual votes an
&quot;supervoter&quot; votes on the same issues (0.6 correlation, vs 0.5
correlation for randomly chosen voters). This means that the
supervoters are not even acting as &quot;representatives&quot; in name, they're
pure oligarchs who vote however they want, with the delegating voters
merely ceding power to them.

Worse, this is a strong disincentive to even use proxies for proposals
that you don't have time to research yourself because in LQFB because
if you actually looked at the data you'd find that your delegates
don't vote like you do. Why would you trust them with *any* of your
votes if this is the case?

5) Not recognizing that supervoters are subject to the same corrupting
influences as our current misrepresentatives are. The paper (above)
actually seriously proposes that the supervoters act &quot;responsibly&quot; to
help prevent &quot;stagnation&quot; (i.e., they vote *for* proposals that gain
majority support but not the 2/3 supermajority required to pass,
thereby &quot;assisting&quot; these bills to pass.) Not only is this a bad idea
theoretically (why even use a 2/3 supermajority rule if it means you
need these supervoters to game the system to get around it?) it
ignores the fact that these &quot;supervoters&quot; will as a result engage in
all kinds of corrupt activity (quid-pro-quo favors, log rolling,
etc.), activity that's can't even be monitored by the public (via the
press) like it is in misrepresentative democracy.

6) There's something very strange going on with a group of what I
guess should be called &quot;hypervoters&quot;, 38 individuals with more than
100 delegations. In the paper, they say these voters are not
statistically significant and so they excluded them from the analysis.
Seems to me that these would actually be the most interesting cases,
since they are even closer to being oligarchs than the run-of-the-mill
&quot;supervoters&quot;. The paper also notes that consolidation continues to
increase and because there is no limit on this delegation the
&quot;supervoters&quot; (and &quot;hypervoters&quot;) are continuing to gain power. Oh, to
have psychological profiles of these people (my money of course would
be on that they're textbook SDAP).

7) I previously said that redelegation is a flaw, but now believe that
in the cast of LQFB it's irrelevant: The fact that there is such a low
correlation between the voter and delegates means that there is no
significant loss of correlation with each redelegation (i.e., all the
good stuff is lost in the first jump). In a system where the proxies
actually vote like the voter granting the proxy, of course,
redelegation *would* be a serious flaw.

8) Low quality proposals, and way too many of them: Specific examples
of actual proposals are hard to come by, but all the examples cited in
all the papers and web pages I've found show lots of &quot;toy&quot; proposals.
Being incomplete means that some &quot;elite&quot; will need to come along and
&quot;refine&quot; them before they can be voted on by the &quot;real&quot; government,
introducing yet another way the system can be gamed. A viable system
for government will have to present a much smaller set of much higher
quality proposals to the voters.

Just to end on a positive note, the one thing they did get right was
the need for &quot;open voting&quot; (for verifyability of the final votes).
Too bad it seems to have been removed now, no doubt at the insistence
of trolls and other antisocials who fear not that *other* people will
be discriminated against (although that's of course what they say),
but rather that *their* antisocial behavior could possibly have
real-world repercussions. Curious, though, that the Liquid Democracy
Wikipedia page now redirects to &quot;Delegative Democracy&quot;, which of
course insists that secret votes are necessary (foxes guarding the
henhouse again, I guess):
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy</A>

As I posted before, studies have shown that neurotypicals don't have
this reservation about sharing their positions on the issues, and that
it is rational to question the level of knowledge (and motivations) of
anyone who does.

Finally, although LQFB seems to have been a fad, the fact that it
gained significant support even with its many flaws should give us all
hope that when a really good system gets built it should have no
trouble gaining, and then *keeping*, mindshare.

    Scott
