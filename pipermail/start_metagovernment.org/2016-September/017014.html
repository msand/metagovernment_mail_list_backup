And changing the order of the comments. For someone who complains so
much about using email as a forum you seem to go to a lot of trouble
to make it even harder to follow your threads ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> This is exactly the opposite of the way it should work: Votes should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be delegated (to someone psychologically like you) *by default* and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only over-ridden if you think you know better than your proxies do
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You just described exactly how liquid democracy works.
</I>
Well, maybe for the 15% of people who actually use delegation (as was
the case in the German PP dataset used in the Kling paper). My point
is that for it to work as a true democracy, participation has to be
close to 100%. The only way to achieve that is through a robust and
automatic proxy system (neither of which apply to LQFB).

&gt;<i> An example of how much this works happened to Martin Haase. He was
</I>&gt;<i> the most delegated person in the early period of that LQFB. So
</I>&gt;<i> much, the Spiegel even wrote a piece on it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html">http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/liquid-democracy-web-platform-makes-professor-most-powerful-pirate-a-818683.html</A>
</I>
Yeah, I ran across this too, and was surprised by how low his
delegations actually were: 167 was enough to get him excluded from the
Kling data analysis, but not really enough to really be considered an
&quot;oligarch&quot; IMHO. But this whole episode played out only over a few
months. After years of the consolidation shown in the Kling paper my
prediction would be that *true* oligarchs would develop and they would
be SDAPs supported by authoritarians (as is shown in the Altemeyer
paper and in his book &quot;The Authoritarians&quot;,
<A HREF="http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf">http://members.shaw.ca/jeanaltemeyer/drbob/TheAuthoritarians.pdf</A>), and
so would be much more difficult to &quot;remove&quot;. You're assuming that
corrupt or otherwise unsuitable individuals would be outed and then
removed as delegates by everyone. But most people aren't going to be
paying that close of attention to these kinds of things (e.g., see
dead assemblyman wins primary
<A HREF="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/bill-nojay-republican-new-york-state-assembly-win">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/14/bill-nojay-republican-new-york-state-assembly-win</A>)

&gt;<i> You must understand that your established criteria for good and bad
</I>&gt;<i> are challenged by this totally different model, and your attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> understand it without several years of practice is like trying to
</I>&gt;<i> give lessons in disco rollerskating without attempts to either dance
</I>&gt;<i> or skate. Excuse me if your attempts to categorize LQFB by your
</I>&gt;<i> expertise falls flat on its feet.
</I>
Hey, I only know what I read. And what I read, in the Kling paper but
also from many other sources, is that LQFB just doesn't do what it
claims to, which is to improve democracy by reducing the burden on
ordinary voters via a delegation system: Because so few people
actually delegate, and even those that do aren't matched
psychologically (or even ideologically) to their proxies, most
people's opinions are simply not reflected in the final decisions.

&gt;<i> Yes, I am not a promoter of direct democracy. I see how the AfD
</I>&gt;<i> right-wing populist movement in Germany is growing because it uses
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy to re-enforce and legitimize the existing prejudices
</I>&gt;<i> of its members and electorate, and I think it is Trumpism in the
</I>&gt;<i> digital age. Trumpism legitimized by the ideal of participation.
</I>
Too bad about your cynicism. But you should take heart in the
statistics published by Altemeyer and more precisely by Stenner:
Although those people make a lot of noise and *seem* like a formidable
force, they're actually a relatively small proportion of the
population (around 25%, depending on threat level). The trick, in my
considered opinion, is to have the opinions of the 50+ percent of the
population who *don't* actively participate in politics properly
recorded in the voting. Neither LQFB nor misrepresentative democracy
do that, with the completely predictable result that it's the SDAPs
who end up making public policy.

&gt;<i> Yes, there is room for improvement in LQFB, but the astounding
</I>&gt;<i> thing to learn is that according to the data we have now it is
</I>&gt;<i> the least bad system of governance/consensus and we should work
</I>&gt;<i> from that, not keep making mistakes of excess direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> or corrupt representativity.
</I>
It's not that I would claim that LQFB is any worse than our current
misrepresentative democracies, but to my mind it has most of the same
flaws (most seriously that policy ends up being decided by only the
most active participants) and so would not be a significant
improvement if it were implemented widely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If your idea of democracy is the sort where prejudice would win over
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reason, then I don't want to use your tools..  :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds pretty naive to me: We're *all* prejudiced. Worse, we all have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different personalities. You seem to think the &quot;elites&quot; have somehow
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the only &quot;elites&quot; that can arise out of LQFB are because of their
</I>&gt;<i> ability to dissect problems and come up with reasonable proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> And their status is tied to that ability to stay.
</I>
OK, naive *and* delusional: How can you hold these two ideas in your
head at the same time?
1) Voters are too ignorant/irrational/busy/etc. to make decisions for
themselves.
2) Voters search out and recognize &quot;expertise&quot; and incorruptibility
and properly delegate only to proxies who display these things.

&gt;<i> Why are you even in this mailing list if you don't see how technology
</I>&gt;<i> and procedures can bring about more or less rationality and sensible
</I>&gt;<i> output to digital democracy? Am I falling prey to the old fallacy of
</I>&gt;<i> mailing lists that the person that posts the most appears to be
</I>&gt;<i> important and representative of the general opinion on the list when
</I>&gt;<i> it actually is just the person that posts the most?
</I>
I'm not here to win any arguments. I'm here to learn what all the
flaws in previous systems were, and to challenge other people to find
the flaws in my proposals to save me (us) some time and grief when it
comes time to implement them.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Misidentifying the cause of the problems in existing political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems. This can clearly be seen even in their own &quot;marketing&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> literature, such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiquidFeedback</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note the phrase &quot;domination of the extroverts&quot; in the Description
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> section. This discloses a profound ignorance of the work done by Haidt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Altemeyer and a great many other researchers that showed that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> NOT &quot;extroverts&quot; that are the problem, it's high RWA and SDO behavior.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I survey this literature on matchism.org, but I think the single
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greatest experiment that demonstrates this was Altemeyer's Global
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Change Game experiment, the paper on that available as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily the paper was quite an interesting read, but it has not
</I>&gt;<i> addressed the issue of extroverts at all and we have had PLENTY of
</I>&gt;<i> problems with left-wing extroverts causing havoc, so the idea that
</I>&gt;<i> problematic social behavior only comes from the right is utterly false.
</I>
Again with the &quot;extroverts&quot;. Read the paper again: It's not
&quot;extroverts&quot; that are the problem (indeed although high SDO is highly
correlated with extroversion, authoritarianism *isn't*). As for the
left wing &quot;extroverts&quot;, I think you may be confusing extroversion with
left-wing authoritarianism. Although there isn't much research on this
type (which makes up a small minority of authoritarians), IMHO they
frequently appear as SJWs, some of which are extroverts, but most of
which are probably just introverted trolls.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Not providing any delegate-matching tools, which results in very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> low use of delegation. In the LQFB paper carlo provided the link to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>) I calculate that only about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 15% of users even *use* the delegation system. Why even claim this as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such as an important feature when so few people even use it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because, as the paper described, it stabilized the will of the
</I>&gt;<i> participants to have the actually expected outcomes, not derive into
</I>&gt;<i> the usual useless direct democratic results. Your way of ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> the actual findings of the paper isn't useful to our debate here.
</I>
OK, so your point is that delegation *isn't* to make the system more
democratic (i.e., more closely reflecting the Will of The People), but
merely to make it more stable? Again, if this is the case I'd consider
it to be an example of false advertising.

&gt;&gt;<i> it ignores the fact that these &quot;supervoters&quot; will as a result engage in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all kinds of corrupt activity (quid-pro-quo favors, log rolling,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc.), activity that's can't even be monitored by the public (via the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> press) like it is in misrepresentative democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bullshit. This has never worked and never happened in my experience.
</I>&gt;<i> You are again talking about disco rollerskating. I explained why this
</I>&gt;<i> can't happen and you have your own reasons to teach rollerskating.
</I>
Maybe it didn't ever happen with the PP. But then, you'd surely
concede that because it didn't fail when used by a homogenous group of
a few thousand people out of a population of 80 million (i.e., 0.01%
of the population) operating over a couple of years is hardly &quot;proof&quot;
that it wouldn't become a dominate characteristic if *everyone* were
using it for millennia to come...

&gt;<i> In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
</I>&gt;<i> individual can't know what is the best choice.
</I>
Elitism, in its purest form ;-)

&gt;<i> I understand your allergy against that kind of thinking, but there is
</I>&gt;<i> a fundamental difference to representative democracy: In the broken
</I>&gt;<i> governance models we experience in western democracies we are told
</I>&gt;<i> that the experts and oligarchs know better, but thanks to the power
</I>&gt;<i> of corruption that isn't true. Whereas in the liquid democratic
</I>&gt;<i> model the temporary leadership arises out of actual reason and is
</I>&gt;<i> not corruptible, therefore it is not only okay, it is necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> model the failure of the individual to assert what's best for him.
</I>
So your claim would be that LQFB would be immune to demagoguery and
other ways SDAPs game the system? I don't see that at all. In fact, it
seems to me that it would *facilitate* that (at least if delegation
were to become more popular) because the demagogues can gain power
without even having to promise to vote like the people they're acting
as proxies for. My guess is that we didn't see that with the PP only
because it was such a homogeneous and probably very progressive subset
of the population.

&gt;<i> I personally have come to the conclusion that citizen have to decide
</I>&gt;<i> whether they want to participate in political decision-making processes
</I>&gt;<i> or rather not. Protection against political discrimination is difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to enforce, but luckily it only needs ten thousand people in a LQFB to
</I>&gt;<i> already produce much much better governance than Capitol Hill. I am
</I>&gt;<i> convinced we can save humanity on planet earth even if only about 1%
</I>&gt;<i> of people care to do politics.
</I>
Again with the delusional. We've had systems like that for thousands
of years and they don't work precisely because the people who &quot;care to
do politics&quot; are SDAPs. Their beliefs and their priorities are just
totally unlike those of the majority of the population. To deny this
is to be double deluded because you're not taking into account the
fact that people are *not* naturally rational, nor are they
interchangeable.

&gt;&gt;<i> [&#8230;] but I'm quite sure you're wrong and that the primary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference is only that you more closely resemble those elites and so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't see these as problems. If the majority of the population would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote to kill all the blacks or the Jews (or the Muslims or the gays or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever), we've got bigger problems than a few million people getting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> murdered (i.e., we're *all* going to die at the hands of some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vigilante group or SDAP dictator with a nuke that The People would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;elect&quot;). I'm sure they won't do this, but it seems to me you don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trust people enough to allow us to find out. I guess that's why you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prefer a system where they are &quot;protected&quot; from their own Clinations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by oligarchs, the system that LQFB would re-create if it were left to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> run long enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh right. Logical fallacies and classical troll-style ad hominem
</I>&gt;<i> attacks.
</I>
It's only ad hominem if it isn't true. You just stated above that
you're elitist and want the 1% to run the world. To call you out on
that is fair play. And BTW, I bring up Hitler all the time, but it's
not an example of Godwin's law because I take the time to tie my
arguments to the actual behavior of Hitler and Nazis (they're SDAP, of
course ;-)
