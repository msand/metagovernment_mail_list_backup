Sounds reasonable ;-) Unfortunately it's not much of a marketing
message: Although The People are only approximately rational they're
actually pretty insecure about even that rough level of competence. So
your #1 sounds to me like it will sound to them like &quot;tools for
eggheads and other elites&quot;.

&gt;<i> 2. utopistic thinking with focus on society - more focus on system of

A worthy endeavor, but again one that smacks of elitism and oligarchy.

&gt;<i> 3. search for &quot;leverage points&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 4. engineering of desirable &quot;stable intermediate forms&quot;
</I>
Here's the real meat, although at this point it should probably more
accurate to say that at this point we're only &quot;searching for ways to
search for leverage points&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> And I would like to propose these points as an activity for Metagovernment

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you say?

Maybe we should try something simpler: After being on the Aspen
Institute's mailing list for awhile and visiting their center a few
days ago, I'm now fairly confident in identifying them as part of the
problem rather than part of the solution. It is a very impressive
project (and facility), but if you look at who attends the Ideas
Festival (and who can afford the $5K+ entrance fees), it's a virtual
who's who of the oligarchs (e.g., the Koch's even have their own
building there!):
<A HREF="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/">https://www.aspeninstitute.org/</A>

In this case the &quot;leverage point&quot; I think is the definition of
&quot;Leadership&quot;: What does that word really mean, and why is it so hard
to pin down? Seems to me &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;leadership&quot; are used in two
completely incompatible ways:
1) The Wikipedia definition, which applies to someone who facilitates
achieving common goals (e.g.,
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership</A>)
2) The way it mostly works in the &quot;real world&quot;, which applies to
someone who is able to articulate their *own* goals and then
manipulate people into being subservient &quot;followers&quot; to help achieve
them.

I think we need a new word for the second definition. Maybe something
like &quot;exploitership&quot; or maybe &quot;fabulead&quot;: getting people to do what
you want by making shit up that they find convincing...

What do you say?
  Regards,
    Scott
