<PRE>After reading (or at least skimming) everything I could find on LQFB
and a fair bit of stuff on &quot;delegative democracy&quot; in general, it
occurs to me that even the MatchSys proposal could benefit from
&quot;learning from others' mistakes&quot;, specifically in how proxies are
handled. Although the previous proposals for the MatchSys did include
a proxy-matching routine that would help people could find suitable
proxies, it suffered from several problems:

1) At some point the user did have to go in and manually approve one
or more of the suggested matching proxies. If they never did this,
there would be no automatic vote (same problem LQFB has).

2) There was no guarantee that the selected proxies would vote,
potentially leading to a dead end and no vote. This was a serious
problem in the PP run of LQFB, where the median numbers of direct
votes cast was only 8 per user over three years, rendering the
majority of members unsuitable as proxies.

3) Proxies were static: Once you pick some, they continue to be used
until you explicitly went in and redid the process. This means that if
your proxies shifted (by redoing their profile or changing their
voting pattern to update their current thinking), the quality of the
match would degrade. When new and better proxies join the system, they
wouldn't be included in your list.

4) Proxies were only suggested based on psychological matches rather
than voting history (although a separate tool was proposed to do the
latter).

5) Since proxies were to be selected manually, opportunities for
gaming the system (e.g., demagoguery) abounded. Limiting the number of
proxies an individual could carry was proposed as a way to limit this
kind of thing, but that was kind of a hack.

6) People might not grasp that the proxy system is not only useful to
them, but actually essential to the proper operation of the system:
Without it, it's likely that the most active users (largely SDAP)
would be the ones who end up making the policy decisions, which of
course is the same problem we have with misrepresentative democracy.
As we learned, few people used the delegation system in LQFB, which
would lead to the same end result in any general-audience application.
I've read that there were a variety of reasons for people not using
it, including lack of familiarity with it, skepticism about whether it
was useful (let alone necessary), and lack faith in their ability to
choose suitable proxies (obviously not helped by the fact that the
statistics show that when people *did* designate proxies, the proxies
don't even vote like them!) The MatchSys would obviously share most of
these problems, although the suggested matches feature would have
dealt with the worst part of the last one.

So, to deal with all of these things, I propose AutoMatch. Here's how
it would work:

1) New users would still be required to complete the personality
survey (e.g., the 10-question big-5 personality inventory:
<A HREF="http://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/ten-item-personality-inventory-tipi/">http://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/ten-item-personality-inventory-tipi/</A>

2) There would still be two-phase voting:
  a) Direct Voting (DV) on that week's proposal from Monday through Friday
  b) proxy votes calculated Friday night and emailed to all non-voters
  c) Saturday and Sunday would be for endorse/override of the proxy votes
  d) Sunday night, all votes are tabulated and results emailed out
along with the announcement of the next week's proposal(s).

3) The &quot;AutoMatch&quot; part would happen on Friday night: Instead of
keeping a list of each individual's static proxies, they would
*automatically* be recalculated for each user using a Least Squares
match to the voters who *actually cast* votes in the DV phase. There
would be one or two sets of proxies, one based on the Personality
Profile and, if the user had voted on at least 10 previous proposals,
a voting-record match. The MatchVote would then be calculated by
averaging the votes of the 5 best matches in these two categories.
This MatchVote would then be shown to them in the email and they'd be
given the choice to do nothing (in which case their MatchVote would be
automatically recorded for them), or to endorse, override, or abstain,
in which case their actual vote would be recorded. Which of the two
sources would be the default would be a profile setting (and the
number 5 could vary, I suppose, based on the total number of users,
how close the matches are, etc.)

4) The &quot;choose your own proxy&quot; functionality would be retained, but in
a separate category: Follows. You'd be able to add a &quot;Follow&quot; any time
you see a screen name, along with a plus or minus (indicating Friend
or Foe, a la Slashdot). The proxy vote email would *also* contain the
calculated vote based on this set of users, but it could not be set to
be the default proxy vote. I.e., you can follow &quot;experts&quot; or
demagogues if you want, but you have to explicitly override your
calculated proxy vote if you want to give your vote to them.

5) The actual votes, comments, and voting records of the automatically
selected proxies would be available by drilling down, as of course for
the Follows. This would provide at least a rough sanity check that
some voters would probably want, at least at first, to make sure
they're being properly matched.

Advantages of this plan:

1) Near 100% participation, and with a relatively high degree of
fidelity in assessing &quot;The Will of The People&quot;. Not that this will
always be *perceived* as an advantage: Some people seem to want all
decisions at least filtered through elites even if those elites don't
just make the decisions directly as they do now.

2) The AutoMatch system is completely immune to corruption and
demagoguery. This assumes that people won't just manually override
proxies to give their vote to one of their Follows, but this is
probably a safe assumption, at least for neurotypicals. If this kind
of override becomes common, a little social engineering might fix it:
The MatchVote is calculated from the other voters who are most like
you. They are your &quot;peeps&quot;, your gang, your own little political
party. You should have a very good reason for overriding their
preferences...

3) Theoretical simplicity and straightforward implementation that
wouldn't require developer-selected &quot;hacks&quot; that people might
reasonably object to.

4) Eliminates the need for re-delegation, preserving fidelity and
again working against oligarchs/demagogues/etc.

5) The AutoMatch system neatly defuses the strongest arguments against
open voting, coercion and vote buying: Because the vast majority of
voters are not even *expected* to cast direct votes, it becomes really
hard to argue that their voting behavior could have been manipulated
in any way. If a voter felt any pressure at all, they could simply let
the auto system do its work, resulting in a vote would be cast that
reflected their preferences with no direct accountability. Any
proxy-based system, however, is potentially more susceptible to vote
buying because smaller numbers of potential direct voters could be
targeted. But because this would be a web-based system, my prediction
would be that gossip will take care of this potential problem: Any
voter could blow the whistle if approached to sell their vote, and any
report of this would quickly go viral, dooming the attempt and
probably even causing a backlash.

6) Automatically does what neurotypicals really want, which is to have
a representative that is actually *like* them and so is most likely to
actually vote like they would if they had the time to thoroughly
research an issue.

Issues and potential disadvantages (and turning this post into a
quadro-listicle! ;-)

1) The CPU cycles required to do this matching could turn out to be
formidable if it catches on. I can think of several ways to optimize
it, though: Restricting comparison to voters in the same
local/county/state/country would be a big one, but would only work (or
indeed be necessary) when thousands+ of direct votes were cast in each
jurisdiction.

2) It of course doesn't support any sort of &quot;expertise&quot; or &quot;trust&quot;
based proxy selection. This is IMHO only possibly a *perceived*
disadvantage: I've concluded from a broad survey of how government
works that at least &quot;expertise&quot; is at best uncorrelated with the
quality of public policy decisions, and in the most important examples
they're negatively correlated (e.g., The Wars On Communism, Drugs, and
Terror, and how our prison and school systems work (or fail to, as the
case may be)). I've also got a pretty hefty list of the results of
what I call &quot;amateur social engineering&quot; at all levels of government,
which describes the vast majority of what &quot;experts&quot; trained in &quot;Public
Policy&quot; produce (since &quot;Public Policy&quot; as it is taught in schools
doesn't resemble real engineering in any way). Neurotypicals could
hardly do any worse, particularly if the proposals were in fact
developed by qualified social engineers.

3) Proxy selection could be perceived as a &quot;magical&quot; and subject to
someone gaming the system by tampering with the algorithm. But this I
think could be countered by the fact that verifying correct operation
is easy to do and could be done by any outsider.

4) By eliminating the &quot;popularity contest&quot; aspect of proxy selection,
there may be less incentive for certain personality types to cast
direct votes. Fewer voters in this phase means less fidelity in
matching (albeit with some compensation from the fact that the few are
probably those who had taken the most time to prepare before voting).
But this is a general potential issue: Some personality types are just
less common and/or just less inclined to participate than others and
so the matching fidelity will *always* be lower for them than for
other personality types. Still, it's far better than any system where
these types aren't represented in the voting *at all* (which is
basically every other system ;-)

5) Any proxy-based system is going to have trouble matching
idiosyncratic behavior (e.g., you always vote against dam projects,
unfunded mandates, or proposals that come from certain proposers that
you have a grudge against). But I believe a convincing argument could
be made that this is actually a feature, not a bug, because this kind
of behavior is generally based on logical fallacies (good being the
enemy of the great (the nirvana fallacy), slippery slope, etc.)

6) This design relies on the theory that we can use the Big 5
personality profile to predict voting behavior, something that AFAIK
hasn't even been rigorously investigated yet, let alone proven. But it
has been robustly proven for ideological positions (e.g., party
affiliation), and ideological positions are at their core just very
crude measurements of personality. The case for using the voting
record is better (lots of organizations publish data on
misrepresentatives vote correlation with their policies), but AFAIK
even this hasn't been systematically measured in any sort of direct
democracy. If nothing else, we'll learn a *lot* by implementing this
system and letting it run in a general-population sample.

Anything I missed?

    Scott
