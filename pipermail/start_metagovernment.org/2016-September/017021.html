<PRE>Whoops, I found this mail in my spam folder just today. Looks like I'm
not the only one having issues with the super strict TLS configuration
of the SMG mailer&#8230;

</I>&gt;<i> The problem Carl has is that he is in what we should call &quot;the ivory
</I>&gt;<i> tower syndrome&quot;
</I>So far I have been the one citing real world experiences for each of
my analyses and statements, so &quot;ivory tower&quot; is as inapplicable as
possible. Keep that tag for folks who speak theory without having
run anything in practice.

&gt;<i> No offense here Carl, but you seem to blame every and anyone for LQFB
</I>&gt;<i> failures except yourself
</I>Woah woah how can you see &quot;no offense&quot; then go all ad hominem.
And to my awareness I haven't been blaming any *person* at all.
I have been blaming *methods* - errors in the application and use
of things. And I think I mentioned mistakes that *we* made, either
in Germany or in Italy. I say *we* because even the mistakes were
typically decided democratically, so it wouldn't be accurate that *I*
failed at something all by myself.

&gt;<i> This is a dangerous situation as it is self-confirming situation
</I>WTF?

&gt;<i> Here are some excerpts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;/Then the Party had problems: people working against, whatever /&gt;Yes, but unrelated to the liquid democracy technology.
</I>&gt;<i> Here you seem not to be grasping that such problems are directly
</I>&gt;<i> related to liquid democracy technology
</I>No they are not. If LD comes too late when a party already has 4 years
of established structures and people that do not like to give away
power, then the chances that it is already *too late* to introduce
democracy are BIG.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;/And it is not used in any major government I have heard of /&gt;It has been used as a feedback channel to the opposition in the
</I>&gt;<i> Berlin parliament&#8230; but participants got demotivated by the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that opposition is ignored most of the time.
</I>&gt;<i> Here we go again, the problems is that the opposition is ignored
</I>Yes. That is the way it works. You can't force online participation if
the motivation is zapped by the way the government ignores everything
you do.

Maybe you are making this logical fallacy: Just because you think that
some mistakes are being made with the platforms you think it is okay to
ignore problems which exist outside of the platform and call them
&quot;excuses&quot;, but the truth is that all of those problem exist and all need
to be considered.

&gt;<i> And so on..
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, even if LQFB is not been used by any major party in the world and no government in the world is using it to take decisions, it has been successful
</I>Depends on how you define successful. If it is capable of producing a
common will of a large diverse base of participants, that is a success.
If those people then have social problems making any good use of it,
that is a problem, a big problem, a related problem, but still a
different one.

&gt;<i> And if it has not been successful, it has been because of the media, the other parties, assemblies, twitter and everything else, except of course LQFB itself
</I>This is populism. You are refusing to take the issue scientifically and
looking for excuses to dismiss somebody else's findings.
&gt;<i> There is little to talk about until you come out of your ivory tower
</I>Inapplicable statement.
