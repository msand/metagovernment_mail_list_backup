&gt;<i> The idea of

</I>
Exactly what I'd have predicted, and exactly why I'm quite sure that
trying to work within the system is not a viable way to achieve any
significant change. Not only can we not trust anyone in the current
system not to do these kinds of things, but even the &quot;outsiders&quot; who
come into it (like the PP was originally) quickly become corrupted
because they learn that the only way to get anything done is to play
the game the same way the insiders do.

&gt;<i> At the
</I>&gt;<i> following general assembly, a thin majority decided to introduce
</I>&gt;<i> nation-wide LQFB as a timid platform to develop motions for the
</I>&gt;<i> next general assembly. It didn't even have any decisional powers.
</I>&gt;<i> Immediately the Berlin crowd stormed the new instrument, recon-
</I>&gt;<i> structed their delegation trees. By the time the others started
</I>&gt;<i> understanding how to use the instrument, prominent Berliners were
</I>&gt;<i> already at the top of the delegation charts, giving the impression
</I>&gt;<i> that they were steering all the important decision-making.
</I>
Again, this is the fatal flaw I see in how LQFB manages delegation:
There doesn't even seem to be any concern that the votes cast by the
proxies don't correlate with those of the people they end up casting
votes for (as clearly shown in that paper you referenced:
<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>). It still baffles me as to why
no one seems to think this is a problem. Any idea why such a blatant
defect can seemingly go unnoticed? What do they think delegates are
*for* if not just a way to ensure that the Will of The People is
properly assessed? Was it *designed* to be just another tool for the
powerful to use to exploit them?

&gt;<i> In particular the so-called superdelegates were the number one
</I>&gt;<i> point of concern. Exactly the point that the researchers examined
</I>&gt;<i> in 2015 and found to be innocuous. But 2015 was too late.
</I>
I wouldn't go that far. In fact, after re-reading that paper it seems
to me very strange in the way it hints at and then fails to fully
explore the most interesting findings. Besides the voter/delegate
non-correlation (as above), there is this little gem (at the end of
the Discussion section):

&quot;We believe that this is due to a responsible selection of delegates,
the social control in an enforced public voting and the risk of the
immediate loss of voting power by recall of delegations.&quot;

WTF? Are the delegates running for office? Are they somehow being
rewarded for carrying a lot of votes? Isn't this exactly the same
foundation that allows for the kind of corruption we see in our
existing misrepresentative democracies?

&gt;<i> What we know now is that LQFB works, but the Piraten were too
</I>&gt;<i> messed up to make good use of it.
</I>
While I would have liked to see it run a lot further to see how it
actually works on a large scale and over the long term, I have far
less faith than you that LQFB is not just another version of
misrepresentative democracy, where votes are not even intended to
represent the will of the people, but merely a way to provide them
with the illusion that they have control over the government when in
fact all the important decisions are being made by SDAP leadership. A
final quote that I think summarizes this fact that what the authors,
and indeed the PP as a whole, are really secretly searching for is a
way to identify and then promote benevolent dictators:

&quot;Both the analysis of voting behaviour and the empirical measurement
of potential and exercised power exhibit a responsible exercise of
power by super-voters.&quot;

    Scott
