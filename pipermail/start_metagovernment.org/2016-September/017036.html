<PRE>Hi all,

As someone who is not often active on this mailing list, but has followed
the discussions here with interest at various points in the last seven
years, I would just like to echo a couple of points here:

- I've found Carlo's contributions to the discussion very useful,
especially the insights into what problems LQFB faced with its
Piratenpartei implementation in Berlin. It seems to me that your arguments
were misrepresented on more than one occasion, which is regrattable.

- Scott, I'm also yet to be convinced that LQFB is *the* answer, but I
don't agree that it has &quot;failed&quot;. Making this statement repeatedly as if
it's a matter of fact or consensus raises concerns about your motives in
the debate. That's a shame, because you seem to have some interesting ideas
of your own. But, as Pietro's last message indicates, you might find that
people are not very willing to engage deeply with these ideas when your own
criticism is destructive in nature.

- The severe drawbacks of the mailing list as a method of discussion have
been highlighted again. In particular, it's impossible to gauge what all
the currently inactive mailing list subscribers think about the ongoing
debate, or whether they are reading the messages at all. The only
indication you have is the responses of the people you're debating with,
and of course this is unlikely to represent most people's views. This is
one reason I'm adding my own brief response here.

Best
Paul
