<PRE>Sorry Scott, I will start answering you when I see some code being written.
Something we can look at. I simply don't have enough time for you anymore.
Take care, and good luck, Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In fact I would say we should all learn to get over Scott. I am very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grateful to Carlo for pointing out some the numerous inconsistencies
</I>&gt;<i> where
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Scott contradicts himself. For example when he says that when you vote,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people are different and so should not be treated all in the same way
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see the contradiction; People *are* all different, yet all
</I>&gt;<i> should be treated the same way. Bonus points if you design the system
</I>&gt;<i> to make it pleasant enough to use by all different types of people
</I>&gt;<i> that they *will* use it (no other system has received those points
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then in some other emails when he points out how you cannot let the
</I>&gt;<i> expert
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defines the options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I say you can't let the &quot;experts&quot; make the *decisions*, which is
</I>&gt;<i> the way it works now in misrepresentative democracy, and pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> every other proposal that's been discussed on Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> (expanding the definition of &quot;expert&quot; to include people who *think*
</I>&gt;<i> they're experts but actually aren't). Experts have a role to play in
</I>&gt;<i> my system, they're the ones who will define/refine the proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether or not this means they'll purposely restrict the options to
</I>&gt;<i> constrain neurotypicals is an empirical question, for which there are
</I>&gt;<i> numerous potential remedies. We'll cross that bridge if/when we come
</I>&gt;<i> to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And then he keeps speaking about his matchism as the solution. Which
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be fine if he ever actually had coded it, and it could be tested, and
</I>&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thus be open itself to criticism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're incapable of criticizing a theory? Of finding counter-evidence
</I>&gt;<i> to that which I cite (in, as some say, excruciating detail)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I urge you to view the following video:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-ZktmjIfE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-ZktmjIfE</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What the above criticism sounds like to me is &quot;Scott has never
</I>&gt;<i> attached boards to his arms and jumped off a cliff: He doesn't know
</I>&gt;<i> anything about flying at all!&quot;. In my defense I would only say I
</I>&gt;<i> prefer science and real (social) engineering to pulling some ideas out
</I>&gt;<i> of my ass and spending months or years trying to build a following for
</I>&gt;<i> a product that has no real scientific or engineering justification for
</I>&gt;<i> existing. All these claims about needing consensus or deliberation or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever sound to me just like &quot;If we attach these flapping wings
</I>&gt;<i> directly to the pedals, we'll greatly increase the power we have
</I>&gt;<i> available&quot;. But just as flying is not about flapping, true democracy
</I>&gt;<i> (or even &quot;good government&quot;) is not about any of the things anyone else
</I>&gt;<i> associated with Metagovernment is proposing. My considered opinion is
</I>&gt;<i> that just as flying is about &quot;lift&quot; and the wing shapes that generate
</I>&gt;<i> it (and not anything to do with flapping), democracy in general and
</I>&gt;<i> matchism in particular is a *scientific* theory about how different
</I>&gt;<i> personalities operate in current systems and an engineering theory
</I>&gt;<i> about how to design systems that fix the problems that are the direct
</I>&gt;<i> result of unequal participation rates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Honestly if only I were to believe in trolling, I would say Scott is a
</I>&gt;<i> troll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that have hunted this mailing list for several years so far. Mostly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; silencing its voices with his critics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And yet, I've seen so very little in the way of defense from these
</I>&gt;<i> other proposers. Why is that? Perhaps the criticism is on point and
</I>&gt;<i> irrefutable?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And it's always surprised me that I've received also very little
</I>&gt;<i> constructive criticism in return. The only two people on this list who
</I>&gt;<i> have made any claims at all that there are flaws in my proposals have
</I>&gt;<i> refused to provide any details, from which I can only conclude that
</I>&gt;<i> their criticism is in fact vaporware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  An old saying goes that those that do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not believe something can be done, should not stop people trying to do
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Several years ago out of frustration I decided not to interact with him
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; longer as I did not see this going anywhere. But being a mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has actually pushed myself out of the mailing list. If one thing I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learned from those exchanges, is that a completely unmoderated discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only goes in circles. Something I unfortunately new before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's truly unfortunate that you've failed to learn anything at all
</I>&gt;<i> about the *causes* of the failures of all of these other systems.
</I>&gt;<i> Ignoring my criticisms is one thing, refusing to even admit that these
</I>&gt;<i> failures could easily have been predicted if one had adequate
</I>&gt;<i> scientific knowledge about the environment they were supposed to
</I>&gt;<i> operate in is quite another. I'm not trying to be mean or unpleasant
</I>&gt;<i> when I tell you that &quot;no, the answer is not finding a higher cliff to
</I>&gt;<i> jump off of, you need to focus on your wing shape instead&quot;, although I
</I>&gt;<i> can certainly understand how someone who rejects the very concept that
</I>&gt;<i> there might be a field called &quot;aerodynamics&quot; would think I'm being a
</I>&gt;<i> troll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I don't see us as going in circles at all, and in fact as I've
</I>&gt;<i> said before I found Carlo's link to that article on LQFB
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>) very enlightening. Real
</I>&gt;<i> science! Why does it appear that I'm the only one who actually read
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, well come Carlo. You know I do not agree with your enthusiasm for
</I>&gt;<i> liquid
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feedback (although I am still observing it with moderate interest). But I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree with you on the importance of a scientific approach to this topic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here, here. Now lets get down to brass tacks: Where is the science
</I>&gt;<i> that shows that the problem with democracy is caused by mathematically
</I>&gt;<i> impure decision criteria? Or that it's caused by the lack of
</I>&gt;<i> availability of tools that the &quot;Activerts&quot; can use to refine their
</I>&gt;<i> proposals? Even better: I struggle with the (potential) issue of
</I>&gt;<i> coercion in any system that requires open voting records. How do
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo and LQFB deal with this issue when the participants are not
</I>&gt;<i> only expected to reveal their positions, but to actively engage to get
</I>&gt;<i> them accounted for in the final decision?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the whining about the mailing list, I sense an intense irony,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps rising to the level of hypocrisy, in the positions of you two,
</I>&gt;<i> and indeed that of all of the deliberation/consensus promoters. My
</I>&gt;<i> claim has long been that these systems cannot work for defining public
</I>&gt;<i> policy because of the &quot;last man standing&quot; problem, and that it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> matter whether the debate is held in person, via email, or in some
</I>&gt;<i> fancy deliberation software system: Anyone willing to continue
</I>&gt;<i> espousing their positions long enough eventually gets to define the
</I>&gt;<i> policy, or at least water down the proposal sufficiently that it
</I>&gt;<i> becomes totally ineffective in achieving the original goal. Don't you
</I>&gt;<i> see that by even threatening to leave or withdraw participation that
</I>&gt;<i> you are actually proving my point?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I have any problem with Disputation Arenas like this list for
</I>&gt;<i> scientific or religious inquiry. The last man standing problem isn't
</I>&gt;<i> fatal there because the goal is to discover the &quot;truth&quot;, not come to
</I>&gt;<i> any sort of general agreement. But everyone has their own &quot;truth&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> largely based on their genes, when it comes to public policy. This is
</I>&gt;<i> why deliberation is not a viable means of decisionmaking in that
</I>&gt;<i> domain.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So welcome Carlo, let not your voice be missing here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro
