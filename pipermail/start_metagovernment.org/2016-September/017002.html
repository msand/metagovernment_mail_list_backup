My apologies for missing this post and so my late reply. Must have
gotten spam filtered, but also missed again by me when I scanned my
spam folder for metagovernment messages. Even though it's 3 weeks
late, there's still so much good stuff in here that others haven't
commented on that it's worth taking another run at it...

BTW, a reminder that you can find all of the old posts here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/</A>

For extra credit, please download all the archives: if this list for
some reason dies (as the wiki has), at least there will be copies
archived in several places so that all of our contributions won't die
with it and we can maybe resurrect it someplace else.

&gt;<i> The greatest threat to electronic democracy is social and political,
</I>&gt;<i> not technical.
</I>
Agreed, and the threats come not just from the oligarchs and
extremists who currently run the show, but also from a vast
cross-section of Luddites and other conservatives. Fortunately the
latter groups will eventually follow the herd and adopt a new
technology once it starts catching on. The former, though, will
probably fight until their dying breaths...

&gt;<i> The reason why the original LQFB of 2010 worked like a charm was
</I>&gt;<i> social: there was hardly any participant with mean intentions. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course this is not a long-term solution, so e-democracy platforms
</I>&gt;<i> have to learn to deal with dominant people - they may not even
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally be evil.
</I>
Exactly why I believe that any consensus-based system (even consensus
through failure to object) is doomed to failure. They only (even
potentially) work with homogeneous group, and The People are anything
but one of those...

&gt;<i> The Berlin Pirates are attempting a new run at the elections this
</I>&gt;<i> year, bare of liquid democracy because of legal threats. No surprise
</I>&gt;<i> the election program looks quite boring compared to 2011. They
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to follow the lead of Italian Pirates in instituting a
</I>&gt;<i> permanent assembly rather than just a survey tool,
</I>
My take on all these &quot;parties&quot; is that they're doomed to failure
*regardless* of the quality of any tools they develop. Besides the
obvious problem that the system is so hopelessly broken and corrupt
that there is no way to effect real change from within, you have the
additional problem that the very people who choose to participate in
these projects are mostly SDAP, just like the people they're trying to
replace. How is that any improvement?

&gt;<i> Also, certifying the authenticity of 1% of the world population would
</I>&gt;<i> be a terrific endeavour. Without certification it's just a big falsifiable
</I>&gt;<i> play tool, like holding elections on Facebook.
</I>
I actually don't worry about this much because I believe &quot;open voting&quot;
will take care of it. The voter rolls are public information, so the
problem isn't that you have to certify a log-in is who they say they
are, all you have to do is ensure that only one vote is cast per
person. If a person tries to vote but is rejected as already having
voted they'll *know* that somebody is impersonating them. They can
also just go and check any past vote to verify that their vote was
properly recorded.

Now this does still allow for fraud: People could just create accounts
and vote for people who haven't bothered to sign up yet. But this
comes with pretty serious risks: At least in the US this would be
identity theft and the federal government would likely actually
prosecute it as such if such a person or group were committing this
kind of fraud in significant numbers. Now if the fraud was coming via
the governments of Russia or China (and the way they've been acting
lately I would be surprised if they *didn't* try something like this
at some point), there'd be no government action, but imagine what a PR
coup it would be: The new movement being perceived as a threat to
other governments would legitimize it in a way that would be hard to
match by just adding some numbers of participants.

Finally, there is also a significant marketing advantage if
system-gamers were able to have a small but still significant effect
on the operation of the system: People would have a strong incentive
to actually sign up to *prevent* themselves from becoming victims of
this kind of voter fraud.

&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were
</I>&gt;<i> kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political
</I>&gt;<i> outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being
</I>&gt;<i> distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching
</I>&gt;<i> soccer on TV.
</I>
True, but with some pretty huge caveats: In the relatively small and
short-term dataset they used, the majority of the voters never even
used delegates, although they also said that the frequency was
increasing over time. These votes being merely advisory and corruption
taking time to develop, it's *way* too early to make any claims about
whether or not LQFB will be susceptible to this problem.

But what really jumped out at me from the article is the statement at
the bottom of the section on &quot;Voting Behavior&quot;, where they state that
inter-voter correlation was 0.51 (i.e., no correlation), but that
correlation between voters and their delegates was only 0.61 (which is
very little correlation). This seems to me a fatal flaw: If the
delegates you chose are not voting how you would vote, why choose them
as delegates at all? Seems to me the system would work about as well
if the system chose delegates for you at random!

(snip)

&gt;<i> Italian populists had a strong interest in making the Pirates look
</I>&gt;<i> like they failed on liquid democracy, but the truth is the Pirates
</I>&gt;<i> failed on setting up a solid legal architecture that would punish
</I>&gt;<i> people's wrongdoing, so whoever publicly attacked other people
</I>&gt;<i> would frequently have a strategic advantage in the inner party
</I>&gt;<i> career.
</I>
Twas ever thus: The people who choose to participate in politics do so
not to make a better world for The People, they do it merely because
they crave power.

&gt;<i> Many Pirates had an interest in tearing down the electronic
</I>&gt;<i> democracy platform and they successfully did so, but I wrote up a
</I>&gt;<i> document (in German, unfortunately) which dissects and dismantles
</I>&gt;<i> all the incorrect criticism that was thrown at liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.">http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.</A> There are things worth improving
</I>&gt;<i> about those technologies, but interestingly the attackers always went
</I>&gt;<i> for fundamentally incorrect criticism.
</I>
Google translate kind of butchered it, but I could at least get the
gist. Just a couple of comments on it:

1) Management at Wikipedia is IMHO deeply dysfunctional. There are
countless cases of articles there where the foxes are &quot;documenting&quot;
the hen-house, and pointing problem this out (as I have, on numerous
occasions) results in exactly no effort being expended to correct the
problematic article or remove the foxes. Which is why I no longer
contribute there...

2) I disagree with the claim that Aristotle was somehow in the
minority among philosophers by proposing an oligarchy as the ideal
form of government. It's actually the *standard* proposal, from Plato
to Skinner (in Walden Two). And claiming that Lenin ever had any
intention to have democratic principles operate in any significant way
in any organization he was a part of is to fall for one of his tricks.
Trotsky, maybe, but Lenin was SDAP through and through and IMHO never
had any intention of sharing power with The People.

     Scott
