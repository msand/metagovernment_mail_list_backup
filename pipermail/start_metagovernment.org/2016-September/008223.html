The plot thickens: I didn't even get this message *at all*, not even
in my Spam folder. I've just resubscribed to this list from my gmail
address and will use that from now on just in case it's the
metacard.com server that's blacklisting metagovernment.org (this has
been a problem for my outgoing mail in the past due to spammers using
a virtual domain on the same machine that hosts metacard.com, thereby
causing that IP to get blacklisted).

Wow. That's twice in one day that I've been stunned by someone
promoting a system that I had assumed we were all in agreement doesn't
work (in this case &quot;government by the elite&quot;, AKA &quot;oligarchy&quot;). Well I
guess I should be thankful at least you only qualify for &quot;elite&quot;
status based on the time you have to invest rather than something like
being of superior breeding stock.

Unfortunately, however, you're also wrong because you apparently
didn't read that part of the article carefully enough: The votes where
the &quot;supervoter&quot; don't match the regular voters were the ones that
*weren't* delegated. Unless you're going to make the claim that all or
at least most individual votes were bogus (in which case you're not
really a proponent of direct democracy at all), you still have to
explain this discrepancy, and respond to my objection to any system
that doesn't match voters to proxies based on personality
characteristics rather than some sort of &quot;expertise&quot;.

&gt;<i> &gt; *for* if not just a way to ensure that the Will of The People is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly assessed? Was it *designed* to be just another tool for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; powerful to use to exploit them?
</I>
&gt;<i> The Will of The People is not direct democracy. If you let everyone
</I>&gt;<i> click their current opinion they will actually achieve populism, not
</I>&gt;<i> democracy.
</I>
Again, I think you've misdiagnosed the problem. There problem with
populism isn't that it isn't democracy or &quot;The Will of The People&quot;,
it's that what most people think of populism is actually people being
manipulated by demagogues. But you can fix this by limiting the power
of demagogues (IMHO this means supervoters in LQFB) in ways that don't
require restricting the ability of regular folk to control their own
destiny.

&gt;<i> If your idea of democracy is the sort where prejudice would win over
</I>&gt;<i> reason, then I don't want to use your tools..  :)
</I>
Sounds pretty naive to me: We're *all* prejudiced. Worse, we all have
different personalities. You seem to think the &quot;elites&quot; have somehow
freed themselves of these burdens and so can make purely &quot;rational&quot;
choices, but I'm quite sure you're wrong and that the primary
difference is only that you more closely resemble those elites and so
don't see these as problems. If the majority of the population would
vote to kill all the blacks or the Jews (or the Muslims or the gays or
whatever), we've got bigger problems than a few million people getting
murdered (i.e., we're *all* going to die at the hands of some
vigilante group or SDAP dictator with a nuke that The People would
&quot;elect&quot;). I'm sure they won't do this, but it seems to me you don't
trust people enough to allow us to find out. I guess that's why you
prefer a system where they are &quot;protected&quot; from their own Clinations
by oligarchs, the system that LQFB would re-create if it were left to
run long enough.

    Scott
