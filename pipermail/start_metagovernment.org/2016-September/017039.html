And a big helping of &quot;naive&quot; in the response. Of course elected
politicians are &quot;trying to do the right thing&quot;. The question is &quot;The
right thing for who?&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Facebook did not need any government help to succeed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But neither of those have any business interest in genuine democracy.

</I>
And a system that requires open voting doesn't do this? These and
other social media don't &quot;abuse&quot; these things, they merely exploit
people by using the information those people have already agreed to
provide.

As for the claim that the general dynamics of success and popularity
that apply to business don't apply to government, I call BS: They're
all just social constructs and although their goals are sometimes
supposedly different, the methods available to them and the dynamics
of how they use them are exactly the same. The exploitation of the
American people by the MIC and resource extraction industries,
facilitated by our misrepresentatives, are a good example of that:
Merely by paying taxes IMHO you are participating in the exploitation
of The People by these agents. I say it's time we use the same model
(product, engineering, marketing, PR, etc.) to change government, not
refuse to use these tools by making some claim that we're above all
that.

    Scott
