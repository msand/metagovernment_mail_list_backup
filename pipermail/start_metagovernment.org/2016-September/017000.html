Right: So people *are* willing to devote time to reading these things
and pushing a button to endorse them. Why is it such a stretch to
assume that they'll do even less (although more often) with a system
that sends them an email once a week telling them what the proposal
is, how their proxies voted and so what their vote will be if they
don't do *anything*?

&gt;<i> I also see plenty of counter examples. Take  Placeavote. It went out of
</I>&gt;<i> business in August, so you cannot look inside, but can roughly describe it.
</I>&gt;<i> People were voting on bills dealing with global issues: gun control and gun
</I>&gt;<i> rights, abortions, etc.
</I>
But did you actually *look* at the bills? I did (a long time ago) and
found only boring gibberish. Not the more refined pap that slacktivism
sites provide. I plan to combine the two: A *real* government that's
also interesting.

&gt;<i> Bills your rewritten in simple language condensed in
</I>&gt;<i> no more than a couple of paragraphs. There was a marketing push, so they got
</I>&gt;<i> some attention, some several hundreds people registered. About 10^2 bills
</I>&gt;<i> were voted on, some 10^3 comments made (people could also discuss issues),
</I>&gt;<i> at most some 10^4 votes were cast. There was no delegation. After 5 months
</I>&gt;<i> the place was deserted. With 500k funding, why did not it grow big like
</I>&gt;<i> change, avaaz or moveon?
</I>
My recollection of how it worked is a little fuzzy, but in addition to
having only very weak content there were lots of other fatal design
flaws in PlaceAVote, including their obsession with security (instead
just using open voting), their deference to an existing broken system
(The People's votes would get filtered through misrepresentatives),
and my recollection of the discussion system is that it was a ghost
town and not anywhere near what people would need to cast an informed
vote if they chose to override their proxies.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, what is your proposed alternative?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I do not have a good proposal. As a helpful partial goal, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> a successful demonstration (in any context) that delegation is working and
</I>&gt;<i> that it is useful would be a significant achievement. Even that has not been
</I>&gt;<i> done. (I do not consider the pirate party a successful example).
</I>
I count our current misrepresentative governments as examples of
success of a delegation model (albeit a very limited success ;-) We're
alive and having this discussion, aren't we? That must count for
something...
