</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Results can be overturned by the general public after the proposal has
</I>&gt;<i> gone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through the committee but would need a sizeable opposition to change the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outcome of the vote.
</I>
Like a 2/3 or 3/4 supermajority? Sounds like extremist (e.g. SDAP)
&gt;<i> heaven to me.
</I>

I'm thinking it would not be a voting process, but a vetoing process. These
proposals are assumed to be created by the experts, only significant
opposition should prevent it from passing. As an example, a proposal would
need to double the number of vetoes acquired from the general public than
it initially got votes for in the committee stage. The proposal has the
ability to be reintroduced if the vetos for the veto doubled the number
again in the general public. This, in my view, removes SDAP's ability, they
aren't able to push things through easily. Education would play a bigger
role.


&gt;<i> Here's my prediction on how a system like this will
</I>&gt;<i> work. Take an issue like immigration or approval of a new weapon system:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The committees will consist primarily of extremists because these
</I>&gt;<i> are just the kind of people who are willing to put in the significant
</I>&gt;<i> effort that even keeping up with the proposals requires, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> being an active participant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Would there not be extremists on both sides of these committees? E.g.
Citizens who have relatives in another country who want nothing more than
to get them here so would vote for more immigration. Or hippies who take it
upon themselves to protect the world from all arms, and so would oppose any
new weapon system.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) For the areas above, it's authoritarian extremists who will
</I>&gt;<i> participate, but you're going to find similar kinds of extremists in
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much every other important area (education, gun rights, drug
</I>&gt;<i> laws, abortion, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Studies show that fully a quarter of the population will vote
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian even *without* any threat. That means your authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> committee, even though they may be less than 1% of the population, can
</I>&gt;<i> pass a &quot;ban the Mexicans&quot; or &quot;lets have a cool new nuclear bomb
</I>&gt;<i> program&quot; proposal over the objections of The People if a 75%
</I>&gt;<i> supermajority is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) About another quarter of the population are &quot;latent&quot; authoritarian.
</I>&gt;<i> It's fairly easy to get the authoritarian vote up to 33% with a
</I>&gt;<i> moderate amount of fear-mongering. In the experiments they usually use
</I>&gt;<i> a threat to an individual's job as the activator (perhaps not
</I>&gt;<i> coincidentally, this is exactly the method Trump uses (&quot;The Mexicans
</I>&gt;<i> are taking your jobs!&quot;) because although he probably hasn't read the
</I>&gt;<i> literature he still managed to figure out what the biggest knob on
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians is). So, there goes your 66% supermajority override.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Even a simple majority override seems to me risky in this scenario,
</I>&gt;<i> at least if you don't have a very robust delegation system: Just as
</I>&gt;<i> extremists will be the committee members, they're also the ones most
</I>&gt;<i> likely to vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This method limits the power of an individual to influence too much, it
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avoids the need of individuals to choose a specific representative in
</I>&gt;<i> each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; area of government. A simpler method in my view. Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say you're still working the wrong end of the problem:
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking, not proposal generation/refining, is where our current
</I>&gt;<i> systems are most broken. And decisionmaking, if we are to have any
</I>&gt;<i> hope of curbing the SDAPs who are the ones making the decisions now,
</I>&gt;<i> *requires* a simple majority rule because you're not going to get much
</I>&gt;<i> more than that when the population is under any kind of threat (real
</I>&gt;<i> or perceived). Again, I'm not opposed to a system like this for
</I>&gt;<i> proposal generation, but am skeptical that a bunch of yahoos like us
</I>&gt;<i> can generate better proposals than people who do it as their *jobs*.
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that authoritarians make up a higher percentage of
</I>&gt;<i> government employees than the population in general, but about the
</I>&gt;<i> only real downside of that is a loss of efficiency (more proposals
</I>&gt;<i> that those employees generate will have to be voted down than if the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals were generated by a representative sampling of the
</I>&gt;<i> population). This seems to me to be a big risk to gain the only
</I>&gt;<i> advantage I see which is that it'd be less expensive because the
</I>&gt;<i> executive branch could be smaller because The People would be doing
</I>&gt;<i> more of the work.
