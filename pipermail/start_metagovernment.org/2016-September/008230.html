<PRE>When you search for &quot;delegative democracy&quot; on Google, 5 out of the
first 10 hits refer to the 1994 definition coined by Guillermo
O'Donnell which to my mind is actually a misnomer because it refers to
what to me looks like a recallable dictator, e.g.:
<A HREF="http://www.coha.org/delegative-democracy-the-case-of-colombia/">http://www.coha.org/delegative-democracy-the-case-of-colombia/</A>

This pattern continues on subsequent pages, which means to me that
using that term as a category that would include Liquid Democracy
isn't viable (i.e Wikipedia, once again, has it wrong). &quot;Proxy
Democracy&quot; I think could work, although that term has some currency in
the corporate governance world (where &quot;proxy&quot; is limited to voting as
a shareholder). Anyone know of a term that describes the kind of
system where you give your vote to another person, with or without the
expectation that that person will vote as you would if you had
time/interest/experience that you would use to evaluate a proposal
before voting on it?
  Regards,
    Scott
