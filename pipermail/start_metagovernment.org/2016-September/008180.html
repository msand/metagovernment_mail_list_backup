<PRE>Ciao Matteo.

</I>
I was part of the initial installation of Liquid Feedback in Berlin
2010 that pulled several political topics out of a magician's hat 
that are still being talked about everywhere in the world, at a time
when the Piratenpartei was only aware of itself as a digital civil
rights platform. The Piraten who won the 2011 elections agreed that
the principle of Liquid Democracy was the key ingredient to their
success. I documented this in Italian at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/laricetta.">http://my.pages.de/laricetta.</A>
The original voting result at <A HREF="https://lqpp.de/be/issue/show/635.html">https://lqpp.de/be/issue/show/635.html</A>
is in German, but apparently the server is down, possibly following
legal action by party dissidents and opponents. The greatest threat
to electronic democracy is social and political, not technical. The
reason why the original LQFB of 2010 worked like a charm was social:
there was hardly any participant with mean intentions. Of course
this is not a long-term solution, so e-democracy platforms have to
learn to deal with dominant people - they may not even intentionally
be evil.

The Berlin Pirates are attempting a new run at the elections this
year, bare of liquid democracy because of legal threats. No surprise
the election program looks quite boring compared to 2011. They
attempted to follow the lead of Italian Pirates in instituting a
permanent assembly rather than just a survey tool, but they still
haven't solved the in-fighting issues - so the LQFB assembly has
been impeded by people that do not want the Pirates to succeed.
Luckily it worked in other German bundeslands, so by now several
Pirate Parties exist that not only have LQFB running - they use it
as an official form of permanent assembly, empowered to take real
decisions.

&gt;<i> As all direct democracy projects developed so far have failed.
</I>
That is an assertion which I can effortlessly reject knowing several
counter-proofs.

&gt;<i> No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent
</I>&gt;<i> of the global populations
</I>
That's because there are other powers at play, discrediting legitimate
successes. Who knows why. Also, certifying the authenticity of 1% of
the world population would be a terrific endeavour. Without certification
it's just a big falsifiable play tool, like holding elections on Facebook.

&gt;<i> LQFB has failed
</I>
That is plain incorrect. Too late to save the Pirate movement, only
in 2015 scientists made a profound analysis of the effects of liquid
delegation on the democratic intentions. The paper that you should
absolutely be aware of resides at <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.</A>
What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were
kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate
percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy
actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political
outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being 
distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching 
soccer on TV.

What we know now is that the liquid modeling of a representative
approach actually works and actually reduces the risks of demagogy
that come with direct democracy. Still, there are reasonable and
unreasonable ways of setting up a liquid democratic platform.
Depending on the legal architecture around it you can either reap
the best of both direct and representative democracy or earn the
worst of both worlds.

Italian populists had a strong interest in making the Pirates look
like they failed on liquid democracy, but the truth is the Pirates
failed on setting up a solid legal architecture that would punish
people's wrongdoing, so whoever publicly attacked other people
would frequently have a strategic advantage in the inner party
career. Many Pirates had an interest in tearing down the electronic
democracy platform and they successfully did so, but I wrote up a
document (in German, unfortunately) which dissects and dismantles
all the incorrect criticism that was thrown at liquid democracy
at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.">http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.</A> There are things worth improving
about those technologies, but interestingly the attackers always went
for fundamentally incorrect criticism.

Let's understand: electronic democracy has many enemies - anyone who
would prefer to have things done their way rather than having to
listen to some thousand strangers clicking their vote from their sofas.
And being against something is usually much easier than being for it.
Demagogy and populism does the rest. As frequently in politics, if 
we're not going to be scientific about this, we will succumb.

&gt;<i> Here are the five steps of the typical direct democracy project
</I>
Please let's be more scientific on this mailing list. If this is
your theory, please mark it as such. If you are presenting facts,
please provide links to the empiric research or evidence. The
irrationality of the debate around electronic democracy is what
harms it the most, quite ironically. E-democracy, a victim of
political manipulation.

&gt;<i> 4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>    The _decline phase_: the group accuses the public at large of being
</I>&gt;<i>    lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the
</I>&gt;<i>    governments of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is
</I>&gt;<i>    little or no self-criticism about why the project is not going as
</I>&gt;<i>    planned. People start to leave the project.
</I>
I don't find that very accurate. The things I experienced were
quite totally different.

&gt;<i> 5.
</I>
Neither.

&gt;<i> At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern,
</I>&gt;<i> no one excluded.
</I>
Incorrect assertion.

&gt;<i> Why new developers do not listen to old developers who failed?
</I>
Why do people form new political organizations without learning
from the mistakes of previous ones? Why do people still develop
federated chat systems when federation doesn't solve the privacy
problem? Why do people think that all anonymity problems can be 
addressed with a bit of Tor, all data structures can be rendered 
into XML and the semantic loss of using JSON instead is suddenly
no problem at all.

Those are just some examples of how rationality is no longer
ruling the Internet (I think it was up to 1995, when Java came
out). Maybe it happens because the Internet is really good at 
giving the illusion you learned all you need to know in a day 
or two of surfing websites? What you actually did was absorb
superficial hypes.

&gt;<i> Why they do not study why other system failed and instead build a
</I>&gt;<i> new system also doomed
</I>
I know some people who did.
