<PRE>Hi, all.

I have been increasingly interested in the concept of crowdsourcing idea development (any kind of ideas, including ones related to public policy) without being constrained by the necessity of picking one &#8220;winning&#8221; idea that gets implemented.

There are two motivations for this:

1. I suspect that a really fantastic idea can find its own way to implementation without requiring the force of a mandate that it be implemented. (I.e., if everyone thinks it&#8217;s a great idea, people will make it happen.)

2. Such a system avoids all the complexity of developing/choosing the best decision-making system, including our perennial arguments about delegation, etc.

However in crowdsourcing, there is generally some sort of voting: something that says this person&#8217;s piece of the idea is better than that person&#8217;s. But that voting can be very lightweight and indecisive. I.e., votes can be tallied for this or that sentence, but&#8230; nothing more than tallied. (For example, think of how Slashdot presents all comments with their scores, and leaves it to the reader to decide if they want to filter based on score.)

As I recall, this was the general idea behind Candiwi (an early project to come out of Metagov, developed by the Barkhau brothers), but that project got dropped.

Is anyone aware of other such systems in development/publication? And what is your opinion of this approach?
