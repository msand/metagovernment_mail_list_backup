&gt;<i> The Piraten Partei won a 7,4% of the votes using LQFB in 2011

8,9% to be exact.

</I>
Yes, but unrelated to the liquid democracy technology.

Social issues are probably the greatest threat to all Internet-based
democracy, so it's never completely unrelated, but in fact LQFB has
never been a social battleground for the Piraten. It happened outside
in the forums, mailing lists, Twitter and ultimately in assemblies
and RL in general.

&gt;<i> But the final result is that now LQFB will not be used in the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> Berlin Elections
</I>
Which is a shame that social issues have been underestimated to the
point of inhibiting the use of proper inner party democracy.

&gt;<i> And it is not used in any major government I have heard of
</I>
It has been used as a feedback channel to the opposition in the
Berlin parliament&#8230; but participants got demotivated by the fact
that opposition is ignored most of the time. So the problem again
wasn't the instrument but the way the established structures of
our majority rule systems work.

&gt;<i> In other words, LQFB is now back to irrelevancy
</I>
If you want to put it in superficial terms and define your
criteria for irrelevancy&#8230; I'm not sure whether it isn't
being used for something important somewhere. What happened
to one of its spin-offs, &quot;Democracy OS&quot; ?

&gt;&gt;<i> No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the global populations
</I>
Why are you changing the indentation of your statement, making it look
like *I* said that when in fact it was *you* saying it? Here's my reply
to that:

&gt;&gt;<i>That's because there are other powers at play, discrediting legitimate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>successes. Who knows why. Also, certifying the authenticity of 1% of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the world population would be a terrific endeavour. Without certification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it's just a big falsifiable play tool, like holding elections on Facebook.
</I>
&gt;<i> If you can show me one Government or major party run by using LQFB you
</I>&gt;<i> are right and I am wrong
</I>&gt;<i> If you can not show me even one Government or major party run by using
</I>&gt;<i> LQFB then I am right and you are wrong
</I>
I didn't say you're wrong, only that your expectation is not being
realistic. Also it's an interesting rethoric trick that you add a
second aspect (&quot;major party&quot;) as if you had said that all along.

Scientific proof that the approach works is only one year old. The time
to start doing this is now. I'm very sorry for all major parties that
have been using less democratic technologies, in particular those who
employ direct democracy like Germany's &quot;Alternative f&#252;r Deutschland&quot;,
then find their electoral programme filled with the very best of
popular prejudice &#8211; but close to zero science and rationality.
No surprise media calls them right-wing populists. It's a result of
their superficial decision making method. So if you want an example on
how e-democracy can totally backfire if not equipped with delegations,
go study the case of the AfD.

&gt;<i> It is sad, albeit very common, that people start to blame other people
</I>&gt;<i> for their insuccesses
</I>
Eh? What are you talking about. I was simply informing that we have
a useful scientific paper to consider.

&gt;&gt;<i>That is plain incorrect. Too late to save the Pirate movement, only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>in 2015 scientists made a profound analysis of the effects of liquid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>delegation on the democratic intentions. The paper that you should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>absolutely be aware of resides at <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>soccer on TV.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ..
</I>
Silence. Point.

&gt;&gt;<i>And being against something is usually much easier than being for it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Demagogy and populism does the rest. As frequently in politics, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>we're not going to be scientific about this, we will succumb.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a long and off-the mark explanation of why LQFB has failed
</I>
LQFB has not failed. I just delivered evidence that it works.

&gt;<i> This is not evern wrong
</I>&gt;<i> It just does not address the point I was making
</I>
You were claiming that LD doesn't work, and you are wrong.

&gt;<i> First you tell me that I am wrong in consiering LQFB as a failed project
</I>&gt;<i> Then you extensively list all the causes of this failure
</I>
The causes are social. Just get the social right, then you can
happily use the technology which is proven to work.

&gt;<i> Then where am I wrong?
</I>
That you are confusing the potential of a democratic mechanism
with its naive deployments. Just because people have been using
it wrong in the first attempts doesn't mean it isn't overdue to
start using it right.

I documented most of the social failures regarding electronic
democracy in a document at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/convivenza.">http://my.pages.de/convivenza.</A> The
result has been that the Italian Pirates have rewritten their
statutes in order to have the necessary social framework for
*more* successful use of liquid feedback. I say more, because
even under the strain of missing social regulations LQFB has
achieved several major goals:

	1. It impeded anyone from ever taking control of
	   the political party, albeit there have been
	   several attempts.
	2. It impeded anyone from corrupting party finances
	   because no individual was ever allowed to spend
	   money by themselves.
	3. It has produced an excellent party programme
	   even though the participants were in-fighting.

With the new statutes of 2015 the Italian Pirates feel more
equal than ever before. There are individuals with ideas, but
it is their ideas leading the way, not the individuals. More
than ever before the party feels like equally &quot;owned&quot; by each
participating member.

So, all I can say is, it works. We are experiencing it day
to day. The problem is that figuring out how to do it right
lost us a lot of participants, so now that we finally resolved
the problem of the in-fighting we have to reboot and regain
the political momentum we had in 2012.

In all of our experience, liquid democracy was one of the few
things that never failed us. It was the social failing us, and
that has to be resolved by legal frameworks, not technology.

&gt;<i> Politics is different than science
</I>&gt;<i> You can prove or disprove whatever you like
</I>&gt;<i> In politics
</I>
You sound like a victim of 20 years of Berlusconi.
I profoundly disagree with your assertion.

&gt;<i> I look at results
</I>
You can look at results in-depth, or remain superficial.
If you stay superficial, you haven't really understood what happened.
If you stay superficial, you shouldn't promote your &quot;opinions&quot;,
because you are distracting well-intended people from doing their work.

&gt;<i> LQFB has been around for ten years now and not been used by any gvt
</I>
Oh, so you have a general tendency towards imprecision? You just
claim LQFB has been around for ten years when it was actually first
deployed in 2010? 2016 - 2010 = 6, not 10.

But apart from that, what a shame that governments prefer to keep
their power to themselves. But scientific results are only one year
old, so there is still hope. I can understand that it isn't easy for
a government to deploy LQFB if even its promoters are only starting
to understand which social-legal preconditions are necessary to use
it successfully.

The implications of change are so immense, it is normal that it takes
maybe about a decade to ripen.

In 1990 I asked myself why all the companies were using fax machines
instead of e-mail. Now I know I was ahead of time. So would you in 1990
have said that the Internet is crap because in 22 years it had not been
deployed to the general public yet? This is the superficiality level
you are argumenting on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    The _decline phase_: the group accuses the public at large of being
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    governments of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    little or no self-criticism about why the project is not going as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>    planned. People start to leave the project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't find that very accurate. The things I experienced were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>quite totally different.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is your opinion
</I>&gt;<i> I accept it as such
</I>
No, it is not an opinion. In the case of the Piraten, they pointed the
fingers at each other, even in the media, and destroyed their popularity
by miserable social behaviours. I agree that they failed to understand
that the problems weren't about certain individuals, but they were
structural in the way they didn't foresee certain social behaviours.
By that time, LQFB wasn't even in use anymore, because the power people
had taken the power back. So it has all to do with the legal framework
of the Piratenpartei, and nothing with the technology.

In the case of the Partito Pirata the situation is totally different.
We understood the social problems to be systemic and debated long enough
on how to solve them until we got successful. The solutions are legal
and have little to do with the technology.

When I have an opinion, I usually say something like IMHO. But I don't
believe in opinions. I believe in facts. I am here to relay facts.
You can start a philosophical discussion on how much facts are facts,
but at least I am trying to stay fact-based which is better than
just opinionating which to me means to not make much progress at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> no one excluded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Incorrect assertion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your opinion
</I>
No, I provided the counter-proof to your assertion.
Stop declaring facts as opinions. That is a rhethoric technique
used in the 1930s by the fascists. You don't want to use such
techniques. It leads to populism and superficiality.

And don't say I called you a fascist. I didn't. I just warned you
not to fall for the populist idea that everyone is free to lie and
call it an opinion, and that every truth is reduced to an opinion.
Some things are false and some are true. It may at times be difficult
to find out what is false and what is true, but it is no solution to
not even try. In fact it is manipulatory to reduce facts to &quot;opinions&quot;.

We have a scientific method. A paper has been published. It seems
to make sense. If you have solid facts against that paper, publish
a counter-paper, then we'll see how it evolves from there. If you
aren't writing a counter-paper, then I don't believe you have facts
to show.

Wow, &quot;words&quot; are not &quot;results&quot;. Words are just opinions?
And the scientific paper I cited is just an opinion, too?
Did you even click on it? I haven't seen you citing a
single line from it.

Yes, you should start looking at the results I delivered
rather than calling them &quot;words&quot;.

Which pirate party? There are over 60 of them.
Are you alluding to the Mainz paper? If so what
is your scientific analysis to disprove their findings?

Interesting studies. Kind of makes sense, but which studies?

Sorry if I'm trying to bring a bit of objectivity to this mailing list.
