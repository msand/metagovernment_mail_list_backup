Like a 2/3 or 3/4 supermajority? Sounds like extremist (e.g. SDAP)
heaven to me. Here's my prediction on how a system like this will
work. Take an issue like immigration or approval of a new weapon
system:

1) The committees will consist primarily of extremists because these
are just the kind of people who are willing to put in the significant
effort that even keeping up with the proposals requires, let alone
being an active participant.

2) For the areas above, it's authoritarian extremists who will
participate, but you're going to find similar kinds of extremists in
pretty much every other important area (education, gun rights, drug
laws, abortion, etc.)

3) Studies show that fully a quarter of the population will vote
authoritarian even *without* any threat. That means your authoritarian
committee, even though they may be less than 1% of the population, can
pass a &quot;ban the Mexicans&quot; or &quot;lets have a cool new nuclear bomb
program&quot; proposal over the objections of The People if a 75%
supermajority is required.

4) About another quarter of the population are &quot;latent&quot; authoritarian.
It's fairly easy to get the authoritarian vote up to 33% with a
moderate amount of fear-mongering. In the experiments they usually use
a threat to an individual's job as the activator (perhaps not
coincidentally, this is exactly the method Trump uses (&quot;The Mexicans
are taking your jobs!&quot;) because although he probably hasn't read the
literature he still managed to figure out what the biggest knob on
authoritarians is). So, there goes your 66% supermajority override.

5) Even a simple majority override seems to me risky in this scenario,
at least if you don't have a very robust delegation system: Just as
extremists will be the committee members, they're also the ones most
likely to vote.

&gt;<i> This method limits the power of an individual to influence too much, it also
</I>&gt;<i> avoids the need of individuals to choose a specific representative in each
</I>&gt;<i> area of government. A simpler method in my view. Thoughts?
</I>
I say you're still working the wrong end of the problem:
decisionmaking, not proposal generation/refining, is where our current
systems are most broken. And decisionmaking, if we are to have any
hope of curbing the SDAPs who are the ones making the decisions now,
*requires* a simple majority rule because you're not going to get much
more than that when the population is under any kind of threat (real
or perceived). Again, I'm not opposed to a system like this for
proposal generation, but am skeptical that a bunch of yahoos like us
can generate better proposals than people who do it as their *jobs*.
It may be that authoritarians make up a higher percentage of
government employees than the population in general, but about the
only real downside of that is a loss of efficiency (more proposals
that those employees generate will have to be voted down than if the
proposals were generated by a representative sampling of the
population). This seems to me to be a big risk to gain the only
advantage I see which is that it'd be less expensive because the
executive branch could be smaller because The People would be doing
more of the work.
