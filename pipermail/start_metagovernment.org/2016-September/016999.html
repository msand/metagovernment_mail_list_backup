Agreed, although it's not really very helpful as a design criteria...

Good call: That's where it was. Curious that messages only
occasionally end up in there. Stupid Gmail: At least you could expect
it to be consistent...

As for change.org, it is indeed the same type of petition system as
the others, all of which fall in the category of &quot;slacktivism&quot;, which
as I've argued previously IMHO is actually *inhibiting* real change by
providing people with an outlet that lets them scratch their itch for
social justice without actually having any significant impact on the
SDAP leaders who are obstructing it.

&gt;<i> I also
</I>&gt;<i> considered placeavote as a counterexample. I would say that Placeavote is
</I>&gt;<i> closer in spirit to what you envision, so you should try to explain why it
</I>&gt;<i> failed, despite your experience that people are eager to share their
</I>&gt;<i> political opinions on social networks.
</I>
That's an easy one: I have yet to find a single example of an actual
bill at any level of government that was written to be intelligible by
The People in general. Mostly it's just they just very poorly written
and IMHO this is probably intentional (i.e., the writers want to
*appear* profound and skilled, even when proposing something
incredibly mundane, and there's often more than a little bit of
intentional obfuscation to keep The People (and indeed probably even
the other legislators) in the dark about what a bill really will do).
I've read enough legal briefs to know that lawyers seem to learn to do
this as part of their training and there isn't any real effort to
control it. This same problem exists in academia, although most
academic writers at least *try* to keep the urge to pontificate in
check and there is a reward and punishment system (via citations) that
the legal system lacks.

But it doesn't need to be this way: It is certainly possible to write
laws that regular folk can understand. One set of examples I've found
are HOA R&amp;R (rules and regulations) documents, which are just as
legally binding as the City ordinances they're based on, but which
have been refined over the years by management companies and board
members who got tired of having to *explain* the rules to the
residents (few of whom are lawyers ;-)

As I've said, my opinion now is that doing this part right is actually
*more* important than getting the voting system perfect. Once an
initial prototype is up and running this part will actually consume
the vast majority of the development resources. Hopefully some of the
more skilled members of the public will step up to help, but
unfortunately IMHO skilled writers are about as rare as skilled coders
and so the project must have an internal capability to create great
proposals itself.

BTW, if you haven't seen it, I also recommend
<A HREF="https://goodcountry.org/global-vote,">https://goodcountry.org/global-vote,</A> a similar kind of thing, but on a
global scale.

&gt;&gt;<i> Not really &quot;my&quot; vision of the future, which is just enabling the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discovery and implementation of theirs...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I meant that nobody is sure how successful your project will be, so people
</I>&gt;<i> has to trust your vision to some extent (that it is going be a success).
</I>
Agreed, and this is a key point: All of us have to work to keep up a
&quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; that what we're proposing to do is actually
possible. So, please humor me (and each other) and respond *as if*
some of these design ideas could actually work, even if in the back of
your mind you're quite sure that it could never happen. This doesn't
mean that some of them aren't stupid and so should be shot down, but
only that if it doesn't seem totally unworkable you need to try to
keep the faith that just maybe it could work...

    Scott
