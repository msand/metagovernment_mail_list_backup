I've no problem with changing the associations of words (languages,
like cultures, just naturally evolve: It's human nature), and think
that most of your examples actually support my claim: It seems to me
that even &quot;elite&quot; has taken on a bit of tarnish itself.

The communists (were they &quot;the elites&quot;?) did an amazing thing with
&quot;bourgeois&quot;, for example, although they did kind of ruin a perfectly
good word when their philosophy failed (bourgeois culture won,
although we don't use that word to describe it anymore). Any
direct-democracy movement is going to need to do the same thing with
&quot;leadership&quot; if it's to have any hope of succeeding. But it's hard for
a small group to shift (albeit actually clarify) the meaning of a
high-frequency word like that: It'd be much easier to instigate
replacement of it with a catchy alternative. For example, I've read
that the coining of the term &quot;brexit&quot; was a significant contributor to
the success of the movement itself, and certainly &quot;pro-life&quot; has made
taking an anti-abortion position sound much more reasonable.

A few more proposals to maybe prime the pump:
goal-getter (because they're the one's who get their goals achieved)
manipuleader (because they lead by manipulating their followers rather
than merely coordinating their activity)

Any other suggestions, or even any better ways of how to characterize
&quot;leaders&quot; who are oriented toward achieving their own goals rather
than facilitating the crowd finding and then achieving theirs?
  Regards,
    Scot
