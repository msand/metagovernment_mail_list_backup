<PRE>Hi,



this was in &quot;good decision index&quot;



Pietro Speroni di Fenizio &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">metagovernment at pietrosperoni.it</A>&gt; wrote ---- 

Personally I consider a good measure of how good a decision is, the percentage of people who after several years, looking back at that decision think that it was well done, and going back they would take it in the same way.




and it is good. Imho we may use it. Saying that if for some (decision-making) properties the decision is after some years is good, then it may be probable that if we create decision with the same (decision-making) properties again, it will be good again. Just saying that we should predict.



For that purpose, we should collect data (as much as possible) about our decision-making.

Group (size, members..), method (UX, deliberativeness, voting,..., environment (mood,.. ), texts (topic, length), difficulty, perceived participation and other straw polls. More in the systems decision index document
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6LVXpWZaJUZJ0mV8X7oRNkNjn5ieoAou7ZMLMRDYfI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6LVXpWZaJUZJ0mV8X7oRNkNjn5ieoAou7ZMLMRDYfI/edit?usp=sharing</A>







The results of this endeavour (properties for metagovernment
) won't be directly applicable to politics. On the other hand, the (scientific) method may be applicable to political decision-making.


Also, we will hopefully make good decisions.







Actuallythis may be point 5. Metagovernment is obsessive about its own decision-making methods.






I am sorry if this writing is too primitive, but let us say that I am here to say obvious things.




Cheers

m.
