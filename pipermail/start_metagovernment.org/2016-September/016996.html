So, you don't want to vote on billions of policy decisions, but
somehow you're going to be able to follow all of them to know which
ones you're interested in? Or are you only obsessed with dam building
and only want to vote on that? ;-)

My solution to this is that almost all of those billions of decisions
are made by the executive branch, which I believe is necessary to
retain. The main difference in my proposal is that anything they
decide can be reviewed and changed by The People, and that the
executives and indeed all of the employees themselves can be removed
with a simple majority vote if (when) they display a pattern of poor
decisionmaking.

&gt;<i> An alternative to delegation is simply consent-through-non-participation.

I considered this, but didn't actually expect anyone to seriously
propose it, being essentially how our current misrepresentative
democracies work. Hats off to you for not being afraid to promote the
status quo ;-)

&gt;<i>  In

</I>&gt;<i> anything they don&#8217;t vote on is left to those who do care. If we can get

</I>&gt;<i> who gets to participate in which decisions, and that path has an

</I>
You've got it backwards: Voting to decide the things that apply to
other people but not to yourself is a prime example of authoritarian
behavior. I'll admit that I struggle with a Locality's ability to vote
to promote their own interests over the needs of other Localities, but
believe that I have actually solved the most common problem that
arises with that, which is resource extraction (e.g., here in Boulder,
restricting fracking is one of the hot-button issues). The solution I
propose (on matchism.org) is the land-lease cancellation (i.e.,, if
they want to frack or build a dam near my house or town, The People
will have to approve a purchase of that land for 20% more than the
assessed value, which if they haven't significantly damaged it they'll
be able get back after they're done with the resource extraction
process).

But how do *you* propose to deal with brigading and other anti-social
tactics (e.g., we gang up on the people living in Africa to enforce
the rule that all resource extraction takes place there) if you're not
going to restrict voting to only those people who will be directly
affected by a decision (i.e., restricting voting by proximity)?
