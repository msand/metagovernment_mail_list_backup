<PRE>ok, you have more experience with words :).



Philosophically speaking, the difference between those two headmen may be that one approaches people as subjects(i.e. equal entity) and another as objects. 

e.g. livestock is also object, we may call them herders and their discipline herdership.
tamer, tamership


Another idea

lower, lowership (from followership)

I've no problem with changing the associations of words (languages,

like cultures, just naturally evolve: It's human nature), and think

that most of your examples actually support my claim: It seems to me

that even &quot;elite&quot; has taken on a bit of tarnish itself.



The communists (were they &quot;the elites&quot;?) did an amazing thing with

&quot;bourgeois&quot;, for example, although they did kind of ruin a perfectly

good word when their philosophy failed (bourgeois culture won,

although we don't use that word to describe it anymore). Any

direct-democracy movement is going to need to do the same thing with

&quot;leadership&quot; if it's to have any hope of succeeding. But it's hard for

a small group to shift (albeit actually clarify) the meaning of a

high-frequency word like that: It'd be much easier to instigate

replacement of it with a catchy alternative. For example, I've read

that the coining of the term &quot;brexit&quot; was a significant contributor to

the success of the movement itself, and certainly &quot;pro-life&quot; has made

taking an anti-abortion position sound much more reasonable.



A few more proposals to maybe prime the pump:

goal-getter (because they're the one's who get their goals achieved)

manipuleader (because they lead by manipulating their followers rather

than merely coordinating their activity)



Any other suggestions, or even any better ways of how to characterize

&quot;leaders&quot; who are oriented toward achieving their own goals rather

than facilitating the crowd finding and then achieving theirs?

 Regards,

 Scot
