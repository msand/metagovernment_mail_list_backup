<PRE>Hi Scott,
 &gt; In my defense I would only say I prefer science and real (social) engineering
When I brought to your attention a simple theoretical paper justifying use of delegation, you trashed its results on the grounds of some holes in the model. You basically refused to admit that people possess a degree of rationality. I find it ironic that at the same time you insist on having a scientific discussion.

 &gt; matchism in particular is a *scientific* theory about how different personalities operate in current systems
To even start talking about merits of your scientific theory, you need to specify a model that you consider. Please point to where you have done it. The way I understand your model, your proposed engineering design for dealing with &quot;unequal participation rates&quot; is flawed. But it is pointless to seriously discuss it before you define your model.
I am not even sure you are reading my posts.
Regards

I don't see the contradiction; People *are* all different, yet all
should be treated the same way. Bonus points if you design the system
to make it pleasant enough to use by all different types of people
that they *will* use it (no other system has received those points
AFAIK).

&gt;<i>, and
</I>&gt;<i> then in some other emails when he points out how you cannot let the expert
</I>&gt;<i> defines the options.
</I>
No, I say you can't let the &quot;experts&quot; make the *decisions*, which is
the way it works now in misrepresentative democracy, and pretty much
every other proposal that's been discussed on Metagovernment
(expanding the definition of &quot;expert&quot; to include people who *think*
they're experts but actually aren't). Experts have a role to play in
my system, they're the ones who will define/refine the proposals.
Whether or not this means they'll purposely restrict the options to
constrain neurotypicals is an empirical question, for which there are
numerous potential remedies. We'll cross that bridge if/when we come
to it.

&gt;<i> And then he keeps speaking about his matchism as the solution. Which would
</I>&gt;<i> be fine if he ever actually had coded it, and it could be tested, and would
</I>&gt;<i> thus be open itself to criticism.
</I>
You're incapable of criticizing a theory? Of finding counter-evidence
to that which I cite (in, as some say, excruciating detail)?

I urge you to view the following video:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-ZktmjIfE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gN-ZktmjIfE</A>

What the above criticism sounds like to me is &quot;Scott has never
attached boards to his arms and jumped off a cliff: He doesn't know
anything about flying at all!&quot;. In my defense I would only say I
prefer science and real (social) engineering to pulling some ideas out
of my ass and spending months or years trying to build a following for
a product that has no real scientific or engineering justification for
existing. All these claims about needing consensus or deliberation or
whatever sound to me just like &quot;If we attach these flapping wings
directly to the pedals, we'll greatly increase the power we have
available&quot;. But just as flying is not about flapping, true democracy
(or even &quot;good government&quot;) is not about any of the things anyone else
associated with Metagovernment is proposing. My considered opinion is
that just as flying is about &quot;lift&quot; and the wing shapes that generate
it (and not anything to do with flapping), democracy in general and
matchism in particular is a *scientific* theory about how different
personalities operate in current systems and an engineering theory
about how to design systems that fix the problems that are the direct
result of unequal participation rates.

&gt;<i> Honestly if only I were to believe in trolling, I would say Scott is a troll
</I>&gt;<i> that have hunted this mailing list for several years so far. Mostly
</I>&gt;<i> silencing its voices with his critics.
</I>
And yet, I've seen so very little in the way of defense from these
other proposers. Why is that? Perhaps the criticism is on point and
irrefutable?

And it's always surprised me that I've received also very little
constructive criticism in return. The only two people on this list who
have made any claims at all that there are flaws in my proposals have
refused to provide any details, from which I can only conclude that
their criticism is in fact vaporware.

&gt;<i>&#160; An old saying goes that those that do
</I>&gt;<i> not believe something can be done, should not stop people trying to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> Several years ago out of frustration I decided not to interact with him any
</I>&gt;<i> longer as I did not see this going anywhere. But being a mailing list this
</I>&gt;<i> has actually pushed myself out of the mailing list. If one thing I have
</I>&gt;<i> learned from those exchanges, is that a completely unmoderated discussion
</I>&gt;<i> only goes in circles. Something I unfortunately new before.
</I>
What's truly unfortunate that you've failed to learn anything at all
about the *causes* of the failures of all of these other systems.
Ignoring my criticisms is one thing, refusing to even admit that these
failures could easily have been predicted if one had adequate
scientific knowledge about the environment they were supposed to
operate in is quite another. I'm not trying to be mean or unpleasant
when I tell you that &quot;no, the answer is not finding a higher cliff to
jump off of, you need to focus on your wing shape instead&quot;, although I
can certainly understand how someone who rejects the very concept that
there might be a field called &quot;aerodynamics&quot; would think I'm being a
troll.

And I don't see us as going in circles at all, and in fact as I've
said before I found Carlo's link to that article on LQFB
(<A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>) very enlightening. Real
science! Why does it appear that I'm the only one who actually read
it?

&gt;<i> So, well come Carlo. You know I do not agree with your enthusiasm for liquid
</I>&gt;<i> feedback (although I am still observing it with moderate interest). But I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with you on the importance of a scientific approach to this topic.
</I>
Here, here. Now lets get down to brass tacks: Where is the science
that shows that the problem with democracy is caused by mathematically
impure decision criteria? Or that it's caused by the lack of
availability of tools that the &quot;Activerts&quot; can use to refine their
proposals? Even better: I struggle with the (potential) issue of
coercion in any system that requires open voting records. How do
Vilfredo and LQFB deal with this issue when the participants are not
only expected to reveal their positions, but to actively engage to get
them accounted for in the final decision?

As for the whining about the mailing list, I sense an intense irony,
perhaps rising to the level of hypocrisy, in the positions of you two,
and indeed that of all of the deliberation/consensus promoters. My
claim has long been that these systems cannot work for defining public
policy because of the &quot;last man standing&quot; problem, and that it doesn't
matter whether the debate is held in person, via email, or in some
fancy deliberation software system: Anyone willing to continue
espousing their positions long enough eventually gets to define the
policy, or at least water down the proposal sufficiently that it
becomes totally ineffective in achieving the original goal. Don't you
see that by even threatening to leave or withdraw participation that
you are actually proving my point?

Not that I have any problem with Disputation Arenas like this list for
scientific or religious inquiry. The last man standing problem isn't
fatal there because the goal is to discover the &quot;truth&quot;, not come to
any sort of general agreement. But everyone has their own &quot;truth&quot;,
largely based on their genes, when it comes to public policy. This is
why deliberation is not a viable means of decisionmaking in that
domain.

&#160; &#160; Scott
