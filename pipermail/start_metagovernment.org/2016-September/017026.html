I know that I am not participating in any sort of online liquid democracy not because of my concerns about security or other issues, but simply because I am not aware of any such service (or online community), available in English or Russian language.

Okay, the way I mentioned LQFB right next to mailing lists
was confusing from my side&#8230; sorry. Right now LQFB is NOT a
suitable replacement for a discussion tool. At the Italian
pirates we use Discourse for that as it helps structuring
and focusing&#8230; still we miss the ability to &quot;rate&quot; the
contributions using our delegation structures from LQFB, so
an integrated debating platform that works with LQFB would
be an important next step in the evolution of e-dem tools.

Right now we only get to properly model the democratic value
of proposals and amendments once they are introduced into
LQFB which acts like a virtual parliament. The actual discus-
sion among human beings still isn't integrated because of the
immense social challenges in the area of civil interaction.
As you saw this mailing list already suffers from that problem,
too. I guess I will stop playing the game of the activerts.

But even if these weren't problems, this mailing list has
no clear boundaries of who should be considered a participant
with voting rights and who shouldn't. Creating sockpuppets
would be trivial. For any meaningful e-dem action to take
place you need to have a defined meaningful group that uses
the results of the votings in an agreed upon way.

On a different note, I was pointed to this article today:

&#160;&#160;&#160; <A HREF="https://media.consensys.net/2016/08/24/liquid-democracy-and-emerging-governance-models/">https://media.consensys.net/2016/08/24/liquid-democracy-and-emerging-governance-models/</A>

&gt;<i>From the corner of the religious believers in blockchain
</I>technology comes the plan to do liquid democracy over ethereum.
It's kinda cute and probably naive, but it is too early to
dismiss. The big challenge they face is making people accountable
over ethereum rather than allowing sockpuppets to be bought by
money. Other issues are how a powerful player like the USgov
could run so many nodes to reach 51% processing power which
would allow them to censor vote submissions and the fact that
blockchain is an ecological catastrophe.

I would rather base distributed liquid democracy on a distributed
social graph integrated in a distributed social network, then the
participants already know each other. That solves both the trust
and authenticity problems the blockchain article discusses.

Humanity-wide anonymous consensus algorithms can frequently be
overkill while at the same time ineffective.
