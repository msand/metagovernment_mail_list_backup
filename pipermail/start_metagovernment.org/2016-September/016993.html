Makes sense, *but* if your ultimate goal is to replace *all*
government you need to design your system to handle all cases, not
just niches. IMHO that means if your system is not up to handling
regulation or wealth redistribution or immigration or military policy,
you're wasting your time.

&gt;<i> I suspect a well-developed idea-creation system could produce ideas that get implemented by popular demand. It may not be the only solution in the short-term, but it would demonstrate the power of collaboration. I posit that it hasn&#8217;t happened much so far because we haven&#8217;t focused on idea-creation and/or we haven&#8217;t had good enough tools for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I posit instead that it's because most people aren't naturally
collaborators or even participants, they're followers. If that's the
case, about the best we can hope is that we can match them with people
to follow who aren't going to manipulate or otherwise exploit them.

&gt;<i> I am inclined to disagree with your point about voting being separate from idea-creation. I think it is fundamentally a question of what should be voted on in the first place. If a community puts to a vote &#8220;should we build this dam?&#8221; the whole conversation is limited to that black-and-white issue. If instead the community said &#8220;we need more/better/cleaner energy production in this area, what can we do?&#8221; then building a dam could be one idea, but there might be a much, much better idea that could come out of the crowd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The two aren't incompatible: Up/down voting is just the last stage in
the process. But my point is you *must* have that stage, whereas
everything that leads up to it is optional. It's not inherently a
waste of time to work on brainstorming tools for the crowd to use, but
unless you (or at least someone) fixes the broken decisionmaking
system, it will not only be a waste of time to create such a tool, it
will be a waste of everyone's time that uses it.

&gt;<i> My (untested/unproven) hypothesis is that such an idea might be so good that voting on it would be more of a formality than a necessity. Such an idea could have such an overwhelming level of support (because the crowd found a way to satisfy the concerns of everyone involved) that everyone just wants it to happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I of course disagree, and see this as an example of a flawed
understanding of human (and indeed most animal) nature. People are
*not* interchangeable and the decisions that are made depends a lot on
*who* is actually making the decisions. Unanimous decisions almost
never occur in large groups on any issue of importance. In fact, even
supermajority decisions are relatively rare. Surely you don't dispute
that? Do you really believe that this is all the result of a flawed
proposal-generation system, or is it possible that, e.g.,
authoritarians are just never going to want to disarm, regardless of
the reality of the threats they perceive?

&gt;<i> This is why I think it is crucial to focus on policy-shaping over decision-making. If the policy is shaped beautifully, the decision-making is practically irrelevant. Is that not the goal? To have decisions that are not majority-rule, but rather gain a broad/deep consensus?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hey, it's a nice goal. Too bad that it's just impractical because
human beings don't work like that ;-)

    Scott
