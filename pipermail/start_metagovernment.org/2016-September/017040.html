<PRE>Hi Pietro,



thank you and yes, I should have written &quot;average&quot;.



Median is also an option. From my theoretical point of view, average would mean computation with &quot;individual good&quot;, and median would be the best guess of &quot;collective good&quot;



When it comes to strategic voting, I was thinking that it is included in the &quot;good&quot;. That some people consider good, the things that *they* decided or the were decided by their favourite method or by their favourite leader. I believe they &quot;honestly&quot; think so.

Median

may mean that I am cheating the methodology. What do you think?



Also, consider a decision that was slightly positive to larger group and very negative to a small group. Median may entirely mute the small group (The groups would need to be hostile to each other, no inequality aversion, to be muted entirely) in the evaluation.



Cheers

m.

Hi Michal,

regarding your evaluation function, you are now summing the individual valuation. I suppose you intend to also divide by the number of people voting. If you do not do it, your evaluation would raise for every person voting and it would more measure how many people do you receive feedback from, than how good was your evaluation. So you are basically taking the average.



I would suggest that instead you take the median of all the votes. 



Why? Because of the median voter theorem (Aka Black theorem). 

which states that if a group of people are voting on a 1 dimensional ordered set of possibilities such that each person has a maximum, and how much they like the result decreases as we go away from that maximum, then the vote of the median voter will be the Condorcet winner among all the maximum.



In other words if you have 100 people, and each person makes an evaluation from 1 to 10. And then you compare all the evaluations two by two (how many would rather vote 3 over voting 6? What about 4 vs 6? ...) the number expressed by the median voter will win all pairwise comparisons (which means, is a condorcet winner).



This is not true if the votes are not ordered, or not unidimensional. For example if you (or someone) would rather vote 3 than 4, but also 5 than 4, thus you have not one maximum preference but two maximum preferences then it is not true.



Now when you are casting a judgment as a rating this is usually considered true. So much that a whole form of election is based upon this (aka Majority Judgment).



So I would suggest you use the median.



Consider also that using the median is strong against strategic voting. Meaning, if you already know how everybody votes (or you guessed it correctly), and your vote is x, and the result of the vote is y (with y != x) then if you are taking the average you would want to vote for something more extreme to pull the result from y to x stronger. But if the system uses the median, this is impossible.


Cheers,

Pietro

Hi everyone,



here is some an update on what I do, I hope you will like it...



let us ask all shareholders how many percents was the decision good after several years. Sum the percents and that is the result (number) of an evaluation function. Collect explanatory variables for the result. Repeat with more decisions to get more data. Now, we may try to find the evaluation function by general linear model or other methods.



Just repeating for context, the function is part of stable intermediate form matryoshka constructed of decision-making methods. One method = one stable intermediate form. 



More details in the already mentioned document

What do you think?

Personally I consider a good measure of how good a decision is, the percentage of people who after several years, looking back at that decision think that it was well done, and going back they would take it in the same way.

 &gt;&gt; measure of the Will of the People
 &gt;
 &gt; I have to admit that I have an issue with this concept &#8220;The Will of the People&#8221;
 
 I'm sure a lot of people do, as they have probably since hierarchical
political systems developed. I'm also sure they're wrong ;-)


&gt;<i> I mean what do the majority of people want? A better life, better job? Ask them to be more specific and you lost them already. Some they could probably debate in vague lines on certain issues, again with no clear idea or resolution - just that they are not happy with it. Not only they don&#8217;t understand the complex socio-economic environment but most of them they don&#8217;t even want to actively participate &#8211; other than perhaps a lazy vote in most cases based on a superficial expression.
</I> 
 Spoken like a true SDAP: You can't trust the people because they're
poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right

priorities. This attitude is exactly what got us into this mess, and

in the EEA would probably get you killed as being more trouble than

you're worth: My claim in the Matchism manifesto is that people who

think like this (and exhibit other anti-social behavior) are actually

far more common in the general population now than they were in the

Pleistocene because they didn't survive very long back then.



I agree that everyone can't be an expert on everything, but if you

ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are

psychologically different (i.e., they want different things) than the

rest of us, you're not ever going to solve these political problems

before some SDAP pushes the button that will end the species.


&gt;<i> I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we will be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are now. We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were not for these faulty/heretics :)
</I> &gt;
 
 Non-sequitur: The People have nothing against inventors or explorers
or even leaders even though most of them are not those things. They

*do* have a problem with these self-selected elites dictating how

things are going to be with no regard for what The People want. In the

EEA they could just opt out when these conflicts occurred (or, take

action to end the wannabe dictator, solving the problem permanently).

Unfortunately SDAP technology (i.e., armies wielded by kings, lords,

slave owners, misrepresentative government, etc.) makes that much more

difficult to do now. But the SDAP need the control of the

neurotypicals to keep them from recklessly starting wars or

discriminating against some segment of the population just as much as

the neurotypicals need them to explore/engineer/organize/operate the

systems we all rely on now.


&gt;<i> Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be better, not even bother to ask the basic questions.
</I> &gt;
 
 Agreed, it was a bad decision. But not because the decision was left
to The People, but because the people that made the initial proposal

did a half-assed job and the people that explained it to the people

essentially manipulated them into voting against their own interests.

But this is just a design flaw in the system the people were operating

in, and IMHO you therefore can't use it to reject the idea that The

People should get to make the decisions that are required to run a

government. We can use technology to reduce the incidence of bad

decisions like this, but, as with my gay-marriage example, sometimes

The People will lag the moral pioneers more than some of the pioneers

(probably including most of us) would like.


&gt;<i> A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a critical piece of infrastructure?
</I> &gt;
 
 How do you write &quot;you'll have a better life&quot; in a proposal that people
vote on? You can't, so your example is bogus. People will have to vote

on specific things, and again, they don't have to be experts on all

theses things, they just have to find people who would vote the same

way they would if they *were* experts. Misrepresentative government

doesn't work this way. At all.


&gt;<i> I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge, research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.
</I> &gt;
 
 Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system
you prefer...


&gt;<i> So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard if possible, maybe win the lottery, have few cans, watch movie or a match on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and make things better.
</I> &gt;
 
 Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make
the decisions for everyone. Why not wish for a benevolent dictator

while you're at it? That'd be even more efficient. And unfortunately

just as delusional.

Regards,

Scott
