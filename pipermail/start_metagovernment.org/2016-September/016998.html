Basically anything that makes them feel good. This is something we can
supply even before it does anything &quot;useful&quot;.

&gt;<i> I do not expect this to be the case for a decision making system.
</I>
I don't actually know the population statistics on this, but if my FB
&quot;friends&quot; are any indication, people seem to derive great pleasure
from giving other people their opinion on things. This is something
that even beta-test government system can do better than any of those
forums because it at least offers the *potential* that these
expression of opinion will really matter at some point.

Again, to refute this you need to explain away not only FB, but also
organizations like MoveOn and Avaaz, although I suppose you might
appeal to people's delusion that slacktivism actually matters. But
then, we can do that too by simply sending the results of each vote to
the appropriate government official (which they will usually just
ignore, just as they do the petitions they get from everywhere else).
Bam! Instant &quot;utility&quot;.

&gt;<i> You said earlier that it may take years before
</I>&gt;<i> voted decisions become binding (in the sense that someone will be obliged to
</I>&gt;<i> implement them). So you are not giving any real product to people, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather promising them a bright future and asking them to participate to make
</I>&gt;<i> (your vision of) that bright future a reality.
</I>
Not really &quot;my&quot; vision of the future, which is just enabling the
discovery and implementation of theirs...

&gt;<i> I have similar problems with your other statements that follow from the
</I>&gt;<i> consumer product analogy. Such as:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) people will either like it or not, will like it if it is useful
</I>&gt;<i> 2) the timing is very important, the system should not be revealed before it
</I>&gt;<i> is fully ready
</I>
Agreed. Getting the marketing message right (is it a prototype, a
beta-test, or a fully functional system that is just waiting for
critical mass to develop behind it?) will be a critically important
part of the process.
