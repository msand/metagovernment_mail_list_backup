Then how do you explain the &quot;success&quot; of projects like Avaaz and MoveOn?

</I>
So, what is your proposed alternative?

To be specific, mine is *not* that the votes be &quot;advisory&quot;, which is
how Avaaz and MoveOn work, and which IMHO actually works *against*
real change because there's an implied deference to the
misrepresentatives (i.e., it is implied that they can just ignore the
advice). Instead, at first in my system the votes would be nonbinding
merely because the &quot;yes&quot; votes would be less than a majority of the
population. Once, that threshold is achieved, however, they would
automatically *become* binding, regardless of what those currently in
power would prefer. How to characterize this future shift is a
marketing issue (i.e., to be decided later, depending on how we see
perception of the tool develop), but it wouldn't have any impact on
the technical specifications of the implementation (i.e., there is no
&quot;make it binding&quot; button, the binding part being an emergent
phenomenon based on the number of people who use it).
