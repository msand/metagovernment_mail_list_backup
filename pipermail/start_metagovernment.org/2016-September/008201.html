<PRE>Since my previous post highlighting the problems with simple
vote delegation to solve low voter turnout, I shall press on and propose my
method that address's the issue. Hopefully, there'll be more interest in
critiquing that.

Each user has the ability to join one committee of their choosing in the
government i.e. transportation, housing, parks/rec, etc. There are no
requirements for joining, but you can only pick one. This allows for a
variety of concentrated users to gather in the same field to discuss and
vote on committee specific proposals, sparing the general public from a lot
of the mundane decisions that get proposed. It also limits
outside influence from flooding the voting process when it's a proposal
that directly affects them.

Outside users can upvote committee members posts to indicate agreement but
can not affect the outcome of decisions inside the committee.

An outsider can propose a change in the committee and would be granted
temporary access to post on their proposal. Proposals that encompass more
than one committee would be split up to address the specific issue to each
committee, similar access would be granted to the original proposer.

The number of proposals a user is able to submit in a year should be
limited, three a year as a starting point.

Results can be overturned by the general public after the proposal has gone
through the committee but would need a sizeable opposition to change the
outcome of the vote.

Committees can be broad in nature at first and become more specialized as
membership increases.

This method limits the power of an individual to influence too much, it
also avoids the need of individuals to choose a specific representative in
each area of government. A simpler method in my view. Thoughts?
