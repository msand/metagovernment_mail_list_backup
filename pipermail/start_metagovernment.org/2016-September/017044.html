</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my defense I would only say I prefer science and real (social)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I brought to your attention a simple theoretical paper justifying

the model.

True, but isn't that one of the things we're here to do, try to find the
holes before we fall in them?

&gt;<i>You basically refused to admit that people possess a degree of
</I>rationality. I find it ironic that at the same time you insist on having a
scientific discussion.
&gt;<i>
</I>
I might even concede that people are *perfectly* rational, in some
contexts, albeit probably mostly artificial environments. The point is not
to expect perfect rationality and design the system so that it works even
with these departures. Departures on this mailing list I think can be
handled by pointing them out, at least for most people in most case, albeit
probably not on the fundamental religious issues (like, whether consensus
is a realistically achieveable goal in any real-world public policy debate).

&gt;<i> &gt; matchism in particular is a *scientific* theory about how different
</I>personalities operate in current systems
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To even start talking about merits of your scientific theory, you need to
</I>specify a model that you consider. Please point to where you have done it.

I'm assuming this means that the first few thousand words on matchism.org
is not what you're looking for?

&gt;<i> The way I understand your model, your proposed engineering design for
</I>dealing with &quot;unequal participation rates&quot; is flawed. But it is pointless
to seriously discuss it before you define your model.
&gt;<i>
</I>
Not sure why that's the case: All you need to accept is that different
personality types have different voting preferences, saving you a lot of
work understanding the specific behavior exhibited by people with high SDO,
high RWA, and high scores on any of the tests for psychopathy.

&gt;<i> I am not even sure you are reading my posts.
</I>
I'm not either. Gmail itself said that this message would have ended up in
my spam folder except for the existence of that new filter I created that
prevented it.
  Regards,
    Scott
