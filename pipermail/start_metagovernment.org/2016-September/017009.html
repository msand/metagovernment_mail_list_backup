<PRE>&gt;<i> Right: So people *are* willing to devote time to reading these things
</I>&gt;<i> and pushing a button to endorse them. Why is it such a stretch to
</I>&gt;<i> assume that they'll do even less (although more often) with a system
</I>&gt;<i> that sends them an email once a week telling them what the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is, how their proxies voted and so what their vote will be if they
</I>&gt;<i> don't do *anything*?
</I>You may be right. Actually, one could just try it. A petition can easily be used as a voting tool. One creates a pair of (cross-referenced) petitions, with the same proposal, one for it, the other against it. So votes for and against can be counted. At change.org you can subscribe to petitioners (follow them), so one would keep receiving updates from them. This is a form of delegation. Following/un-following is like picking/dropping a delegate. It is not a perfect tool, but it is available for free. Would it be an interesting experiment?

&gt;<i> But did you actually *look* at the bills? I did (a long time ago) and
</I>&gt;<i> found only boring gibberish. Not the more refined pap that slacktivism
</I>&gt;<i> sites provide. I plan to combine the two: A *real* government that's
</I>&gt;<i> also interesting.
</I>They hired a person to write summaries of the bills that were put up for voting. I think it was different in the beginning, but after some time most of the bills were presented in a form of a short digest. Digests were quite readable. Maybe some were a little boring, but such was the nature of those bills. Other bills were less boring.

But I agree that petitions are typically written in a more entertaining fashion.
 &gt; lots of other fatal design
&gt;<i> flaws in PlaceAVote, including their obsession with security (instead
</I>&gt;<i> just using open voting),
</I>I agree, their priorities were misplaced. They were obsessed with using block-chain technology, they had not implemented delegation, they were very secretive about their plans, etc.

&gt;<i> it was a ghost
</I>&gt;<i> town and not anywhere near what people would need to cast an informed
</I>&gt;<i> vote if they chose to override their proxies.
</I>There were no proxies.
&gt;<i> I count our current misrepresentative governments as examples of
</I>&gt;<i> success of a delegation model (albeit a very limited success ;-) We're
</I>&gt;<i> alive and having this discussion, aren't we? That must count for
</I>&gt;<i> something...
</I>Two hundred years ago it was an acceptable delegation model, but in this day and age it is a pale shadow of what it should be.

Right: So people *are* willing to devote time to reading these things
and pushing a button to endorse them. Why is it such a stretch to
assume that they'll do even less (although more often) with a system
that sends them an email once a week telling them what the proposal
is, how their proxies voted and so what their vote will be if they
don't do *anything*?

&gt;<i> I also see plenty of counter examples. Take&#160; Placeavote. It went out of
</I>&gt;<i> business in August, so you cannot look inside, but can roughly describe it.
</I>&gt;<i> People were voting on bills dealing with global issues: gun control and gun
</I>&gt;<i> rights, abortions, etc.
</I>
But did you actually *look* at the bills? I did (a long time ago) and
found only boring gibberish. Not the more refined pap that slacktivism
sites provide. I plan to combine the two: A *real* government that's
also interesting.

&gt;<i> Bills your rewritten in simple language condensed in
</I>&gt;<i> no more than a couple of paragraphs. There was a marketing push, so they got
</I>&gt;<i> some attention, some several hundreds people registered. About 10^2 bills
</I>&gt;<i> were voted on, some 10^3 comments made (people could also discuss issues),
</I>&gt;<i> at most some 10^4 votes were cast. There was no delegation. After 5 months
</I>&gt;<i> the place was deserted. With 500k funding, why did not it grow big like
</I>&gt;<i> change, avaaz or moveon?
</I>
My recollection of how it worked is a little fuzzy, but in addition to
having only very weak content there were lots of other fatal design
flaws in PlaceAVote, including their obsession with security (instead
just using open voting), their deference to an existing broken system
(The People's votes would get filtered through misrepresentatives),
and my recollection of the discussion system is that it was a ghost
town and not anywhere near what people would need to cast an informed
vote if they chose to override their proxies.

&gt;&gt;<i> So, what is your proposed alternative?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I do not have a good proposal. As a helpful partial goal, I think that
</I>&gt;<i> a successful demonstration (in any context) that delegation is working and
</I>&gt;<i> that it is useful would be a significant achievement. Even that has not been
</I>&gt;<i> done. (I do not consider the pirate party a successful example).
</I>
I count our current misrepresentative governments as examples of
success of a delegation model (albeit a very limited success ;-) We're
alive and having this discussion, aren't we? That must count for
something...
