<PRE>&gt;<i> Well, I don't respond to *every* message posted to this list ;-)
</I>Sure. But there is difference between knowing that you did not reply because something was not interesting to you, and uncertainty of whether you saw a post in the first place. The latter messes up discussion big time and it is very frustrating.
&gt;<i> I'd prefer a mailing list *anywhere* to Reddit, even if we could agree on a &quot;no deletions&quot; policy from the moderators.
</I>What we have now is so bad, that simply a functioning mailing list will be way better. I do not insist on reddit.

Well, I don't respond to *every* message posted to this list ;-)

&gt;<i> I am experiencing various problems: in addition to

</I>&gt;<i> threatened couple of times to terminate my subscription.
</I>
I haven't seen that, but this message itself ended up in my Gmail Spam
folder, which I now have to remember to check every day to find these
messages. Very frustrating....

&gt;<i> It seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> other people experience problems too. I am saying it again: it would be
</I>&gt;<i> better to move somewhere else. I do not care where. Even reddit would be a
</I>&gt;<i> better place.
</I>
I'd first like confirmation that the problems are not going to be
fixed, and then maybe a public vote ;-)

I read that Ed was going to &quot;delegate&quot; to some others who would look
into the Wiki and/or mailing list problems. If this isn't going to
happen then I'd second your motion that we abandon metagovernment.org
and go somewhere else. I'm actually not that concerned about the Wiki
(IMHO it's worth saving, but not enough for me to lift a finger to
help fixing/moving it), but the mailing list, even though it's mostly
lurkers, is something I'd miss and *would* be willing to step in and
run if anyone asks. In fact I could move it to matchism.org (or even
metacard.com if anyone preferred) in a few minutes if there was no
objection and Ed would send me the subscriber list. At this point,
given that the wiki is dead, we could even just park
metagovernment.org pretty much anyplace and start over and it'd be a
big improvement.

&gt;<i> Hypothetical issues that you have with reddit, are nothing in
</I>&gt;<i> comparison to very real misbehaving of this mailing list. Speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> rationality and efficiency.
</I>
I'd prefer a mailing list *anywhere* to Reddit, even if we could agree
on a &quot;no deletions&quot; policy from the moderators. But agree that even
Reddit is looking pretty good compared to what we're having to deal
with now. How about Google Groups? I'd suggest Yahoo, but, well, you
know...
