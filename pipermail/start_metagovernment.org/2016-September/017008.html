Wow, you really *haven't* been paying attention, have you? The idea
that &quot;experts&quot; will automagically create proposals that reflect the
Will of The People has been so thoroughly discredited that I'm
actually stunned to see someone seriously propose this. Are you
unaware that these &quot;experts&quot; are exactly the same people who run our
current misrepresentative democracies?

While I agree with the idea that the vast majority of proposals will
not come from The People directly (to keep the numbers down and the
quality up, which is necessary to maximize efficiency), I'm not at all
sure what percentage of proposals should pass in order to consider a
system (or a proposer) a success. Considering the stuff that comes out
of the &quot;experts&quot; in the US congress I'd be willing to say that if
that's the quality of proposals we get that the pass ratio should be
pretty close to 0%. But after a few rounds of that kind of humiliating
repudiation I have faith that the proposal generators will actually
bother to do a little real social engineering backed by actual
measurement of what The People want and will accept. In your proposal,
these &quot;experts&quot; (who I maintain will be SDAP because those are just
the people that want to make the rules) will never even have any check
on their behavior.

&gt;<i> As an example, a proposal would
</I>&gt;<i> need to double the number of vetoes acquired from the general public than it
</I>&gt;<i> initially got votes for in the committee stage. The proposal has the ability
</I>&gt;<i> to be reintroduced if the vetos for the veto doubled the number again in the
</I>&gt;<i> general public. This, in my view, removes SDAP's ability, they aren't able
</I>&gt;<i> to push things through easily. Education would play a bigger role.
</I>
I'm not following the math here. A group of a 100 SDAP &quot;experts&quot; come
up with a proposal to build a new nuke system that they pass
unanimously: How many &quot;veto&quot; votes must a population of a million need
to cast to prevent that proposal from going into effect?

&gt;<i> Would there not be extremists on both sides of these committees? E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> Citizens who have relatives in another country who want nothing more than to
</I>&gt;<i> get them here so would vote for more immigration. Or hippies who take it
</I>&gt;<i> upon themselves to protect the world from all arms, and so would oppose any
</I>&gt;<i> new weapon system.
</I>
But what are the ratios sizes of the two groups? I think history has
shown that the number of &quot;hippies&quot; who are willing to sit through
endless hours of meetings and rewrites with the goal of only thwarting
a weapons-system bill from being passed are dwarfed by the number of
authoritarians who are highly motivated to &quot;save the world&quot; by telling
other people what they have to do (and in the case of &quot;foreigners&quot;
actually threatening them with violence if they don't comply). The
number of immigrants willing to stick their necks out to try to change
how the system works is negligible, at least compared with the number
of authoritarians who will work to protect our resources by keeping
them out (and I speak from experience here: My wife and her family and
many of her friends are from Taiwan and their take on how to deal with
the government is completely different from mine and so I'm usually
the one who has to coach them not to just give up when some tin-pot
bureaucrat puts up a roadblock that they don't see any way around).

The same thing will occur even in highly polarized areas like
abortion: While there are extremists on both sides of the issue the
numbers are nowhere near equal in any gathering of &quot;experts&quot; (and does
the concept of &quot;experts&quot; even apply to a moral issue like this?)  This
is why abortion in the US (and things like abortion and gay marriage
and many other issues in most countries) end up being decided by the
courts instead of The People or their &quot;expert&quot; misrepresentatives. It
doesn't need to be this way, but it does require a complete system
design such that The People actually retain *all* of the power and
that the proposal generation system is engineered to ensure that the
proposals are designed to meet the requirements of The People rather
than the preferences of the &quot;experts&quot; (e.g., in my system an executive
with a very low proposal acceptance rate would just be replaced).

    Scott
