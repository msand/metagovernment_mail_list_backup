Sounds reasonable ;-) Unfortunately it's not much of a marketing

message: Although The People are only approximately rational they're

actually pretty insecure about even that rough level of competence. So

your #1 sounds to me like it will sound to them like &quot;tools for

eggheads and other elites&quot;.





Ok, let's collaborate for public use of reason, be transparent and open... as much as possible, no need to wreck for it.





&gt;<i> 2. utopistic thinking with focus on society - more focus on system of

&gt;<i> society rather than on individual responsibility (subsystem) or hypothetic
</I>
&gt;<i> environment (suprasystem).
</I>


A worthy endeavor, but again one that smacks of elitism and oligarchy.





Actually no need to mention this point, but we should have such a documents imho.




&gt;<i> 3. search for &quot;leverage points&quot;
</I>
&gt;<i> 4. engineering of desirable &quot;stable intermediate forms&quot;
</I>


Here's the real meat, although at this point it should probably more

accurate to say that at this point we're only &quot;searching for ways to

search for leverage points&quot; ;-)



&gt;<i> And I would like to propose these points as an activity for Metagovernment
</I>
&gt;<i> group.
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> What do you say?
</I>


Maybe we should try something simpler: After being on the Aspen

Institute's mailing list for awhile and visiting their center a few

days ago, I'm now fairly confident in identifying them as part of the

problem rather than part of the solution. It is a very impressive

project (and facility), but if you look at who attends the Ideas

Festival (and who can afford the $5K+ entrance fees), it's a virtual

who's who of the oligarchs (e.g., the Koch's even have their own

building there!):

<A HREF="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/">https://www.aspeninstitute.org/</A>



In this case the &quot;leverage point&quot; I think is the definition of

&quot;Leadership&quot;: What does that word really mean, and why is it so hard

to pin down? Seems to me &quot;leader&quot; and &quot;leadership&quot; are used in two

completely incompatible ways:

1) The Wikipedia definition, which applies to someone who facilitates

achieving common goals (e.g.,

<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership</A>)

2) The way it mostly works in the &quot;real world&quot;, which applies to

someone who is able to articulate their *own* goals and then

manipulate people into being subservient &quot;followers&quot; to help achieve

them.



I think we need a new word for the second definition. Maybe something

like &quot;exploitership&quot; or maybe &quot;fabulead&quot;: getting people to do what

you want by making shit up that they find convincing...



What do you say?



Dictionary changes may work, but I remember just the negative changes and misuses, e.g. socialist, hacker, learning (lost &quot;metanoia&quot; meaning), anarchist, bourgeois,

Actually &quot;democracy&quot; is better off now in comparison with Plato, still misuse. Elites seem to be better at telling us what revolutionary words mean. Any contrary examples?

 Scott
