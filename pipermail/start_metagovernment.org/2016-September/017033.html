Well, that was just one attempt of deployment. As a tool for writing a
party programme it was excellent &#8211; unprecedented compared to all the
seriously flawed working group approaches.

It certainly would have been interesting to see LQFB deployed in
parliament the moment the party implementing LQFB decisions is actually
at government. But that means that a new political force is actually
empowered rather than cluelessly criticized by nay-sayers.

&gt;&gt;<i> You will never understand that it is silly to even speak about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government ignoring you, are you even expecting the government to HELP you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when you are trying to take power away from them?
</I>
Oh, populist simplification again, as if all elected politicians are
always ill-intended and not trying to do the right thing.

&gt;&gt;<i> Facebook did not need any government help to succeed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Twitter did not need any government help to succeed
</I>
But neither of those have any business interest in genuine democracy.
Genuine democracy has no viable business model. As long as a company
is earning money with it, people cannot trust the set-up. Also, the
success of Twitter and Faceboogle is built on bulk data exfiltration
and abuse of privacy.

So if you bring these examples up I get the impression I am spending
time talking to people that have little idea of what they are talking
about. No idea about how government actually works, what politicians
actually try to do and how capitalism is at odds. Just a thick layer
of prejudice which simplifies decisions for yourself - but now you are
trying to impose your prejudices on other folks.

I guess this mailing list is pointless. For a moment I thought there
was genuine scientific interest in here.

&gt;&gt;<i> LQFB and Airesis could be used by millions of people right now, the only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reason why they are not used is simply because people do not want to use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And they do not want to use them as simply they do not see them as fitting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their needs
</I>
Wild guesses without the slightest evidence.
