<PRE>Thanks for the detailed account of the LD rise and fall. It was a very interesting reading. Hopefully the downturn in LD popularity is temporary. I still do not quite understand why Berlin pirates, of all people, decided to drop LQFB? Were not they the most familiar with it, who actually tried it and saw all the benefits that come with LD? Why did not they stand their ground? You mentioned some legal issues, I think. So, why Berliners dropped LD while some other units are still using it? How large are those groups who still use it?

Since you can follow developments within Italian and German pirate parties, I wanted to ask you a question. What is your prediction about dynamics of LD in Europe in the next few years (maybe 3-5 years)? Thanks.

As for the Mainz paper, of course I read it! I just did not see no Mainz guy among the authors :) so I thought you are talking about some other paper.
RegardsSergey

Simplification is not helpful. If you ignore that LD brought them

You probably have heard of the N.I.H. syndrome. When the German
Pirates were founded in 2006, they made the mistake of copying
the party structures of established parties - in particular they
copied the federal structure, establishing directorates and
warlords in each Bundesland.

In 2007 a working group met in Berlin, discussing how they could
avoid ending up just like the Green Party. Within this working
group somebody introduced the concept of Liquid Democracy.

Unfortunately the promoters of LD weren't avid programmers, so
it took until 2009, a point in time when the Pirate Party was
already prominently in public view for the huge anti-surveillance
demonstrations and &gt;2% election results, that a bunch of Pirate
programmers got together, designed and implemented LQFB.

Now the stories ties in with what I said in the first post:

&gt;<i>I was part of the initial installation of Liquid Feedback in Berlin
</I>&gt;<i>2010 that pulled several political topics out of a magician's hat
</I>&gt;<i>that are still being talked about everywhere in the world, at a time
</I>&gt;<i>when the Piratenpartei was only aware of itself as a digital civil
</I>&gt;<i>rights platform. The Piraten who won the 2011 elections agreed that
</I>&gt;<i>the principle of Liquid Democracy was the key ingredient to their
</I>&gt;<i>success.
</I>
The problem was, the rest of the republic didn't know anything
about this. The heard all the frantic news about LD being the magic
ingredient and felt cut out. Bavaria in particular had just lost
the regional elections before the Berlin triumph. The Pirates thus
experienced an extreme case of N.I.H. - the Not-Invented-Here
syndrome. Several important southern bundeslands rejected LQFB
simply because it wasn't their thing. Some of them in fact liked
representative democracy, because it gave them power. The idea of
sharing power with the party base didn't appeal to everyone. And
then a lot of fertile ground was burned by the arrogance of
certain representatives that chose to travel the republic, giving
lectures in LD in a not very appreciated top-down manner. At the
following general assembly, a thin majority decided to introduce
nation-wide LQFB as a timid platform to develop motions for the
next general assembly. It didn't even have any decisional powers.
Immediately the Berlin crowd stormed the new instrument, recon-
structed their delegation trees. By the time the others started
understanding how to use the instrument, prominent Berliners were
already at the top of the delegation charts, giving the impression
that they were steering all the important decision-making.

You begin to see how the problem is social? Large parts of the
German Piratenpartei never even *started* using LQFB. While the
Berliners were convinced this was going to be the way to go, it
was cool in certain parts of the country to call LD all kinds of
names and ignore it. A large number of experts arose from
everywhere, making all sorts of claims why LD can't possibly work.
In particular the so-called superdelegates were the number one
point of concern. Exactly the point that the researchers examined
in 2015 and found to be innocuous. But 2015 was too late.
The existing mixture of representative and direct democracy
(the huge general assemblies) drowned out the tiny chances of
LQFB making its way to power within the Piratenpartei.

What we know now is that LQFB works, but the Piraten were too
messed up to make good use of it.

&gt;&gt;<i> Are you alluding to the Mainz paper? If so what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is your scientific analysis to disprove their findings?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I never read it. Could you give a reference?
</I>
It was in my first post.
