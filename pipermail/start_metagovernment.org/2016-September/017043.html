<PRE>Hi Michal,

there are a few points.

First of all if you speak about an index you are speaking about a single
value that somehow is summarising what is going on. Of course this is a
very limited form of information, and of course you will lose a lot of
interesting and sensible information.

You can double that up by taking a measure of the spread. For example if
you take the average and the standard deviation. But if you really want to
know about those subgroups, the tool to use is not the average (which just
will give you a wrongly aggregated measure, subject to the whims of single
people) but you should try to cluster the points.

Now, I have to admit it has now passed 17 years from when I studied those
tools. And it was brief. But I would point you to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/">https://en.wikipedia.org/</A>
wiki/Cluster_analysis as a starting point. But of course if you do this you
are not looking at a good decision *index*, but something else. But it
might be still very good, or maybe even better.

If instead you want to have an index, then you are aggregating all those
data. And it is not a matter of getting people to agree on a result, but it
is a matter to have a number that can correctly represent everybody. Now
whatever is the system you use, you probably want to have a system that
does not depend on the whims of a single person. That's what the solidity
against strategic voting is about.

Look into clustering :-)

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thank you and yes, I should have written &quot;average&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Median is also an option. From my theoretical point of view, average would
</I>&gt;<i> mean computation with &quot;individual good&quot;, and median would be the best guess
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;collective good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to strategic voting, I was thinking that it is included in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;good&quot;. That some people consider good, the things that *they* decided
</I>&gt;<i> or the were decided by their favourite method or by their favourite leader.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe they &quot;honestly&quot; think so.
</I>&gt;<i> Median
</I>&gt;<i> may mean that I am cheating the methodology. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, consider a decision that was slightly positive to larger group and
</I>&gt;<i> very negative to a small group. Median may entirely mute the small group
</I>&gt;<i> (The groups would need to be hostile to each other, no inequality aversion,
</I>&gt;<i> to be muted entirely) in the evaluation.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michal,
</I>&gt;<i> regarding your evaluation function, you are now summing the individual
</I>&gt;<i> valuation. I suppose you intend to also divide by the number of people
</I>&gt;<i> voting. If you do not do it, your evaluation would raise for every person
</I>&gt;<i> voting and it would more measure how many people do you receive feedback
</I>&gt;<i> from, than how good was your evaluation. So you are basically taking the
</I>&gt;<i> average.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that instead you take the median of all the votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why? Because of the median voter theorem (Aka Black theorem).
</I>&gt;<i> which states that if a group of people are voting on a 1 dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> ordered set of possibilities such that each person has a maximum, and how
</I>&gt;<i> much they like the result decreases as we go away from that maximum, then
</I>&gt;<i> the vote of the median voter will be the Condorcet winner among all the
</I>&gt;<i> maximum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words if you have 100 people, and each person makes an evaluation
</I>&gt;<i> from 1 to 10. And then you compare all the evaluations two by two (how many
</I>&gt;<i> would rather vote 3 over voting 6? What about 4 vs 6? ...) the number
</I>&gt;<i> expressed by the median voter will win all pairwise comparisons (which
</I>&gt;<i> means, is a condorcet winner).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not true if the votes are not ordered, or not unidimensional. For
</I>&gt;<i> example if you (or someone) would rather vote 3 than 4, but also 5 than 4,
</I>&gt;<i> thus you have not one maximum preference but two maximum preferences then
</I>&gt;<i> it is not true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now when you are casting a judgment as a rating this is usually considered
</I>&gt;<i> true. So much that a whole form of election is based upon this (aka
</I>&gt;<i> Majority Judgment).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would suggest you use the median.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider also that using the median is strong against strategic voting.
</I>&gt;<i> Meaning, if you already know how everybody votes (or you guessed it
</I>&gt;<i> correctly), and your vote is x, and the result of the vote is y (with y !=
</I>&gt;<i> x) then if you are taking the average you would want to vote for something
</I>&gt;<i> more extreme to pull the result from y to x stronger. But if the system
</I>&gt;<i> uses the median, this is impossible.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spoken like a true SDAP: You can't trust the people because they're
</I>&gt;<i> poorly informed and/or too emotional and/or just don't have the right

</I>&gt;<i> you're worth: My claim in the Matchism manifesto is that people who
</I>&gt;<i> think like this (and exhibit other anti-social behavior) are actually
</I>&gt;<i> far more common in the general population now than they were in the
</I>&gt;<i> Pleistocene because they didn't survive very long back then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that everyone can't be an expert on everything, but if you
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the fact that people who want to make the rules/decisions are
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically different (i.e., they want different things) than the
</I>&gt;<i> rest of us, you're not ever going to solve these political problems
</I>&gt;<i> before some SDAP pushes the button that will end the species.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will go even further, if it were for the will of the people &#8211; we will
</I>&gt;<i> be still living in trees, not even in caves, because it was the
</I>&gt;<i> non-conformist mind, the bold, the explorers, who got us were we are now.
</I>&gt;<i> We will stil be stuck in our &quot;primordial gut feeling&quot;, if it were not for
</I>&gt;<i> these faulty/heretics :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Non-sequitur: The People have nothing against inventors or explorers
</I>&gt;<i> or even leaders even though most of them are not those things. They
</I>&gt;<i> *do* have a problem with these self-selected elites dictating how
</I>&gt;<i> things are going to be with no regard for what The People want. In the
</I>&gt;<i> EEA they could just opt out when these conflicts occurred (or, take
</I>&gt;<i> action to end the wannabe dictator, solving the problem permanently).
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately SDAP technology (i.e., armies wielded by kings, lords,
</I>&gt;<i> slave owners, misrepresentative government, etc.) makes that much more
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to do now. But the SDAP need the control of the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals to keep them from recklessly starting wars or
</I>&gt;<i> discriminating against some segment of the population just as much as
</I>&gt;<i> the neurotypicals need them to explore/engineer/organize/operate the
</I>&gt;<i> systems we all rely on now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, that you mentioned brexit &#8211; they casted a vote without even
</I>&gt;<i> questioning what is the plan once they get out, and how will that be
</I>&gt;<i> better, not even bother to ask the basic questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, it was a bad decision. But not because the decision was left
</I>&gt;<i> to The People, but because the people that made the initial proposal
</I>&gt;<i> did a half-assed job and the people that explained it to the people
</I>&gt;<i> essentially manipulated them into voting against their own interests.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is just a design flaw in the system the people were operating
</I>&gt;<i> in, and IMHO you therefore can't use it to reject the idea that The
</I>&gt;<i> People should get to make the decisions that are required to run a
</I>&gt;<i> government. We can use technology to reduce the incidence of bad
</I>&gt;<i> decisions like this, but, as with my gay-marriage example, sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> The People will lag the moral pioneers more than some of the pioneers
</I>&gt;<i> (probably including most of us) would like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A measurement of the will of the people will end in just something this
</I>&gt;<i> &#8211; All I want is a better life. Sorry but that is what every living thing
</I>&gt;<i> wants and how would that help say in trying to make a decision on a
</I>&gt;<i> critical piece of infrastructure?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How do you write &quot;you'll have a better life&quot; in a proposal that people
</I>&gt;<i> vote on? You can't, so your example is bogus. People will have to vote
</I>&gt;<i> on specific things, and again, they don't have to be experts on all
</I>&gt;<i> theses things, they just have to find people who would vote the same
</I>&gt;<i> way they would if they *were* experts. Misrepresentative government
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't work this way. At all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do believe in democracy as a right of all people to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> decision making directly or through representatives but that comes with a
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility to be knowledgeable of what it takes. Is knowledge,
</I>&gt;<i> research, passion and a lot of hard work that got us where we are not the
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;primordial&#8221; gut feeling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why are you here, then? Seems to me we already have exactly the system
</I>&gt;<i> you prefer...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, yeah, people want to be happy, have a decent job, nothing too hard

</I>&gt;<i> on the telly, basics. There are just a few who struggle and dedicate an
</I>&gt;<i> important part of their lives to try to understand, learn, research and
</I>&gt;<i> make things better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, and your preference seems to be that we let these people make
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions for everyone. Why not wish for a benevolent dictator
</I>&gt;<i> while you're at it? That'd be even more efficient. And unfortunately
