</I>
Right, but we've already established that you're an advocate of
oligarchy and so it's not surprising that a 20% turnout is just fine
with you. Seems to me your only problem is figuring out how to get the
*right* 20% to show up. My problem is that I can't live in that
fantasyland because I already *know* what the 20% who show up are
going to be like.

&gt;&gt;<i> You're assuming that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> corrupt or otherwise unsuitable individuals would be outed and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed as delegates by everyone. But most people aren't going to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paying that close of attention to these kinds of things
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't assume. I relay empiric experience. Call it anecdotical if
</I>&gt;<i> you like, but it is more than what you have.
</I>
Sure, I'll call it anecdotal, but it's much weaker than that: The
participants in the PP LQFB system were a highly homogeneous group and
probably contained very few authoritarians (given the PP's extremely
progressive platform), and probably a lower-than-proportional number
of high SDO and psychopathic individuals (given the PP's relative
obscurity and low prospects for becoming a major force in German
politics). I have zero doubt that your experience would have been
completely different if LQFB was used in the general population. None
of the other LQFB experiments have fared even as well even though none
of *them* even attempted a general-population run either.

&gt;<i> Oh wow, one quarter of the population stinks so let's try the other
</I>&gt;<i> half. No, I don't think you are going to obtain much better results
</I>&gt;<i> by taking the other half's prejudices and making those into law.
</I>
It's an empirical question, to be sure. But I do have the science on
my side: It's not just Altemeyer who has found that the other 50% are
far better at decisionmaking, there is a whole body of literature in
evolutionary psychology and the anthropology of LPA bands (e.g.,
Christopher Boehm's &quot;Hierarchy in the Forest&quot; and &quot;Moral Origins&quot;)
that clearly show that the way we make decisions now (by delegating to
SDAPs) is not the system we evolved to function in. By creating an
environment (using technology) that is closer to the one we're
genetically programmed to function in, my claim is that our
performance will markedly improve.

&gt;<i> That has been proven to be wrong. It does not have those flaws.
</I>&gt;<i> It helps remove fallacious choices. It impedes the promotion of
</I>&gt;<i> corrupt, lobbyist or populist proposals. It impedes corruption
</I>&gt;<i> as the proxies wouldn't get far with it.
</I>
Sure it helps with those things, but as it turns out those are not
even the major problems with misrepresentative democracy. The major
problem is that the people most interested in participating in public
policy decisions are SDAP and don't have the same priorities as the
neurotypicals that make up the majority of the population. LQFB does
*nothing* to help with those problems, and may in fact make them worse
because the SDAPs that formulate policy can operate without the public
and press scrutiny that is directed at our current misrepresentatives.
This is absolutely clear from the published data, which showed that
the median voter only voted 8 times in 3 years and where there was on
average less than 20% turnout for each final decision.

&gt;<i> There are a lot of aspects of LD that are amazing and surprising.
</I>&gt;<i> This one for example works out because of the long debating times.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Voter&quot; is the wrong term. It sounds like there is no debate.
</I>
Agreed. Then again, this is exactly its most fatal flaw: By requiring
more time than most neurotypicals are willing to spend, LQFB virtually
guarantees the final decision will fit the needs of the SDAPs instead
of the majority, who are not SDAP.

&gt;<i> Look, the discussion we are having is clearly among left-wing
</I>&gt;<i> extroverts. You are one opinionated extrovert. I am an experienced
</I>&gt;<i> extrovert.
</I>
I'm not an extrovert, though, which just shows how little you
understand about psychology (or me). Actually a true extrovert would
probably not even engage in a debate like this, which is really more
the realm of introverts or even autistics and other highly-focused
individuals.

As it turns out, extroversion is not even a relevant personality
dimension for on-line political activity or ideology, but the other 4
of the Big 5 are, e.g., see:
<A HREF="http://abstractpolitics.com/2010/05/personality-and-political-attitudes-relationships-across-issue-domains-and-political-contexts/">http://abstractpolitics.com/2010/05/personality-and-political-attitudes-relationships-across-issue-domains-and-political-contexts/</A>

&gt;<i> Funny that the term extroverts actually made into the Wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> entry because it came from the OccupyWS people that never used
</I>&gt;<i> LQFB at all. Here's the background story from 2012:
</I>&gt;<i>         <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/activerts">http://my.pages.de/activerts</A>
</I>
Same mistakes there: extroversion is not correlated with on-line
political participation (though it may be for conventional caucus or
&quot;town hall&quot; types of activity or ideology. &quot;Activerts&quot; might be a
better term, but I still prefer the more psychologically-based acronym
&quot;SDAP&quot;, with particularly the SD and P particularly applying
(authoritarians follow those two types, but I would think would tend
not to be &quot;Activerts&quot; themselves). But as per your claim, they are
indeed the people who ruin everything by claiming and then wielding
power. What I don't understand is how you could miss that LQFB,
because it requires so much time investment to use, doesn't address
the &quot;Activert&quot; problem at all and may indeed even make it worse...

&gt;&gt;<i> OK, so your point is that delegation *isn't* to make the system more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic (i.e., more closely reflecting the Will of The People), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> merely to make it more stable? Again, if this is the case I'd consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it to be an example of false advertising.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Politically stable = more democratic.
</I>
LOL! So the most democratic countries include Cuba and China, which
have far more &quot;stable&quot; political climates than even representative
democracies? But seriously, &quot;stability&quot; has nothing to do with
democracy, only with efficiency. By definition he most &quot;democratic&quot;
institutions are those where the broadest range of individuals have
significant influence in the decisionmaking. This certainly doesn't
apply to any LQFB run, where 20% of the participants make all the
decisions, and the vast majority have no impact at all (they only
voted on average 8 times in 3 years, and less than 15% of them even
ever delegated their votes).

&gt;<i> There isn't much homogenous about tenthousand pirates other than they
</I>&gt;<i> probably all dislike surveillance.
</I>
That actually tells us a lot: For example, we know that they're mostly
not authoritarian for one (authoritarians *love* surveillance).

&gt;<i> I'm sorry if the actual way digital democracy does work is not
</I>&gt;<i> fitting your ideological expectations. But that only means that
</I>&gt;<i> your ideology is broken, not the method that has proven to work.
</I>
No, it means you're so in love with that technology that you're blind
to its obvious flaws.

Again, we can agree to disagree if you'll just admit that you don't
find it troubling that the majority of the decisions made in the PP
run of LQFB were based on the input of only 20% of the party members,
that only 15% of them ever delegated, and that the median number of
votes for each party member was only 8 in 3 years. I find those things
*deeply* troubling, but can't argue the fact that you're entitled to
your opinion.

    Scott
