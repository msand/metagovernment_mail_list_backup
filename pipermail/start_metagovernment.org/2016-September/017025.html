<PRE>Hi Scott,
I have some critical comments about your automatch system, but I will not write them down. Because I suspect that some of my past comments were not delivered to you again. I am experiencing various problems: in addition to not seeing some of the posts, this (broken) mailing list algorithm threatened couple of times to terminate my subscription. It seems to me other people experience problems too. I am saying it again: it would be better to move somewhere else. I do not care where. Even reddit would be a better place. Hypothetical issues that you have with reddit, are nothing in comparison to very real misbehaving of this mailing list. Speaking of rationality and efficiency.
Regards,Sergey

 Subject: [MG] AutoMatch = AutoParty, a &quot;virtual&quot; party system
   
In hashing out the marketing plan for AutoMatch it occurs to me that
most people will have no idea what the Big 5 Personality Profile is
(even though it's the bread and butter of personality and social
psychologists). Here's a way to explain it. Take a look at the
following graph, using data from the 2015 British Election study (a
brilliant piece of work, BTW):
<A HREF="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg</A>

You should see that if you are given the values on these five
dimensions you could already make a very good prediction about which
party that person would support. High Openness and low
Conscientiousness? Definitely a Green. The reverse? Definitely a
Conservative. High Agreeableness? Labor, and you don't even need to
know the values for the other 4 dimensions.

But party affiliation is a seriously flawed way to look at political
inclinations because:

1) Party affiliation is as much social/environmental as genetic (Big 5
being primarily genetic). So a lot of people end up being registered
as &quot;Labor&quot; merely because their families traditionally have done that,
degrading the fidelity of the match between them and the votes cast
for them by their &quot;misrepresentatives&quot;.

2) Even if you take just a binary measure (high vs. low), big 5
predicts 32 (2^5) different &quot;parties&quot; whereas in the UK there are only
5 major parties (plus a few more minor ones). But it's worse than
that: Although there are clusters of characteristics, the Big 5 was
originally defined by factor analysis, which tells us that the
dimensions are *independent* from each other, and that indeed all 32
types exist (although of course the numbers of individuals in each
category will differ). There *are* people who are high in both
Openness and Conscientiousness (I'm one ;-) and there clearly just
isn't a party that represents those people (who knows, maybe
organizing us is like herding cats ;-) Worse, these dimensions are not
just high-low, but a continuous (normal) distribution, so there is
just no way to make a good match using only a binary decision tree,
even if you had all 32 different parties.

3) The third most common affiliation is &quot;none&quot;, meaning that those
people already know that no one matches/represents them (I'm one of
these too ;-)

Many of these people just fail to vote at all, a problem that
particularly discriminates against the young:

So, one way to look at AutoMatch is as being an automatically
generated political party that contains *only* the people that will
most likely share your voting preferences. But it's a &quot;virtual&quot; party,
a party without bosses or other apparatus. A party that, no matter how
few people belong to it, will have exactly proportional influence all
final decisions, with no need for coalitions or the vote trading
necessary to build one.

Sound appealing?

&#160; &#160; Scott
