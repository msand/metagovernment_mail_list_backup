<PRE>Hi Scott,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  I have looked at previous projects, and believe that there should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; several factors that should help a team to have a successful project:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; User Experience: most of the projects, lacked in this area. A team should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; understand what his users needs, and solve the with great UX. Without UX,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users will have difficulties using our system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
*multi-Platform: *

&gt;<i> Agreed! Although I'd add that, at least as it applies to the subject
</I>&gt;<i> line &quot;Direct Democracy&quot; convenience and having it available on all
</I>&gt;<i> platforms (especially smart phones) are also essential features.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yap, that is what we do we build web-app, that can work on any device that
have web :-)



&gt;<i> &gt; Good understanding of deliberative theory. Deliberation is a very complex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; field. Having good understanding in the filed, may help the team
</I>&gt;<i> understand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what they should develop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For a deliberative system, I agree. Unfortunately my considered
</I>&gt;<i> opinion is that deliberative systems and &quot;direct democracy&quot; systems
</I>&gt;<i> are almost entirely non-overlapping fields: A direct democracy system
</I>&gt;<i> that must support more than a few dozen individuals cannot even have a
</I>&gt;<i> significant deliberative component, nor does it need one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
For the time being, you are correct.
The best way, I know of today, is to raise a national issue, and talk with
our friends. This the Deliberative Day
&lt;<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation_Day">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberation_Day</A>&gt; concept brought by Fishkin.

But this is what we try to change in delib.org. We try to build a
deliberative system that will allow large groups deliberate together online
and Face-To-Face. To accomplish this, we use several teams of development.
One team is responsible for the methodology, the other to run ground
experiments (like the one you have seen in the video), and the last team
builds technology. We work together to find ways to broaden the number of
effective participants.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Money: developing a software is a long run effort. Most of us couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> run
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so long, without monetary support.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, but we need to be extremely careful about what the source of
</I>&gt;<i> support is: I for one am sure that no government funding is
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable, nor is funding from any organization that receives
</I>&gt;<i> government funding. The reason is that those funds will be cut off as
</I>&gt;<i> soon as the new (and competing) system gains any traction at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Self-funding and then crowdfunding is therefore the only viable path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agree: This is why we go for philanthropic sources that wants to promote
democracy.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A good way to work together and develop together. Most of the projects I
</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; met, where not so cooperative in their developing strategy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not so sure about this either: I've been out of the business for
</I>&gt;<i> awhile now, but at least up until 2000 or so there was very little
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;breakthrough&quot; software that wasn't developed by at most a handful of
</I>&gt;<i> people. In most cases in my experience the majority of the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality was developed by a single developer. My prediction is
</I>&gt;<i> that this is how it will be for the new EDD system too: If there are
</I>&gt;<i> 10 people who want to develop a system, better 9 of them each devote
</I>&gt;<i> 10% of their income to fund 90% of the time of best coder among them
</I>&gt;<i> than try to help out by each donating 10% of their time. This is
</I>&gt;<i> certainly not an optimal situation, but I believe it is an accurate
</I>&gt;<i> description of how the world really works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

In this point I do have some other perspective. It is right that we have
one major developer how creates 90% of the code, but the other developers
are valubales They give insight to the major developer. by discussing the
different problems, to help him solve difficult problems. They also prevent
stagnation. As a team leader, I can tell that the need to attract more
coders, make me become more responsive to suggestions. So delib team as a
whole, develop and bring about new ideas in to the drawing board every
week. from there 50% are implmented.

Cheers,
