<PRE>I was writing a longer email, but it was blunt...



I would like to resurrect the wiki. If you may please provide me with temporary passwords. Next week (18.) I may work on it.

Hm. I understand your words but am not following your reasoning. What is it you are proposing we do?



I do understand the engineering to get desired emergent properties; but that leads to the ongoing issue of us having many theorists but few developers.

Hi Ed,



glad you are back and getting better.



Well, I will start with my assumptions, there will be a lot of mistakes, but I hope for no fatal ...

Metagovernment started in 2007 as &quot;political wikipedia&quot;. This I understand as wikipedia for normative science.

In comparison to positive science the main trouble appears to be validation (Karl Popper would say falsification) for some reasons. First, it is too complicated, complex, dynamic, mind-boggling.... Second, there is not much space for trial and error. Third, we are humans.



0. We may go for validation by agreement (compared to validation by power, Foucault ). e.g. Metascore, Candiwi and my &quot;systems decision index&quot;

1. Complex, dynamic, etc. things are generally solved by &quot;systems theory&quot;. It is very abstract as well as our wiki should initially be imho, e.g. just recommendations how to create policy.

2. Labs, trial and error are weak and pricy tools for the biggest problems, so I propose &quot;stable intermediate forms&quot;

3. Humans are as they are, but societies show emergent properties. We just need to engineer ourselves to get desirable emergent properties.



I hope this explains points 1., 2., 4. and 5. in previous emails.

Point 3. &quot;Leverage points&quot; is just tool to make things happen.



What do you say?



Cheers

m.

Michal, I am not sure what you are proposing here. Perhaps I am missing some context? Can you explain a little further what this is about?

Hi,



in a broad sense, I have redefined my work again...



1. collective intelligence for public use of reason

2. utopistic thinking with focus on society - more focus on system of society rather than on individual responsibility (subsystem) or hypothetic environment (suprasystem).

3. search for &quot;leverage points&quot;

4. engineering of desirable &quot;stable intermediate forms&quot;



And I would like to propose these points as an activity for Metagovernment group.



What do you say?



Cheers
