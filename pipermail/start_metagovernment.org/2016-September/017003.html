I wasn't actually alluding just to the ill-intended but also to the
many well-intended who easily misunderstand each other and escalate
into flame wars if left talking electronically without guidance,
moderation and a justice system.

&gt;&gt;<i> The reason why the original LQFB of 2010 worked like a charm was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> social: there was hardly any participant with mean intentions. Of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> course this is not a long-term solution, so e-democracy platforms

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intentionally be evil.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly why I believe that any consensus-based system (even consensus

</I>&gt;<i> potentially) work with homogeneous group, and The People are anything
</I>&gt;<i> but one of those...
</I>
Consensus is another topic. Any electronic debate runs the risks of
failing on the social of the Internet. The solution to that however
is not technological, it is structural and legal. If you properly
implement such a solution, many electronic debate systems stand quite
a chance of functioning. For LQFB this is to us who have experienced
it undoubtedly the case.

&gt;<i> My take on all these &quot;parties&quot; is that they're doomed to failure
</I>&gt;<i> *regardless* of the quality of any tools they develop. Besides the
</I>&gt;<i> obvious problem that the system is so hopelessly broken and corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> that there is no way to effect real change from within, you have the
</I>&gt;<i> additional problem that the very people who choose to participate in
</I>&gt;<i> these projects are mostly SDAP, just like the people they're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> replace. How is that any improvement?
</I>
Sorry, but this is superficial opinionism. In theory a digital party
can be designed to work well even if all members are assholes.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, certifying the authenticity of 1% of the world population would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be a terrific endeavour. Without certification it's just a big falsifiable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> play tool, like holding elections on Facebook.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I actually don't worry about this much because I believe &quot;open voting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> will take care of it. The voter rolls are public information, so the
</I>&gt;<i> problem isn't that you have to certify a log-in is who they say they
</I>&gt;<i> are, all you have to do is ensure that only one vote is cast per
</I>&gt;<i> person. If a person tries to vote but is rejected as already having
</I>&gt;<i> voted they'll *know* that somebody is impersonating them. They can
</I>&gt;<i> also just go and check any past vote to verify that their vote was
</I>&gt;<i> properly recorded.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now this does still allow for fraud: People could just create accounts
</I>&gt;<i> and vote for people who haven't bothered to sign up yet. But this
</I>&gt;<i> comes with pretty serious risks: At least in the US this would be
</I>&gt;<i> identity theft and the federal government would likely actually
</I>&gt;<i> prosecute it as such if such a person or group were committing this
</I>&gt;<i> kind of fraud in significant numbers. Now if the fraud was coming via
</I>&gt;<i> the governments of Russia or China (and the way they've been acting
</I>&gt;<i> lately I would be surprised if they *didn't* try something like this
</I>&gt;<i> at some point), there'd be no government action, but imagine what a PR
</I>&gt;<i> coup it would be: The new movement being perceived as a threat to
</I>&gt;<i> other governments would legitimize it in a way that would be hard to
</I>&gt;<i> match by just adding some numbers of participants.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, there is also a significant marketing advantage if
</I>&gt;<i> system-gamers were able to have a small but still significant effect
</I>&gt;<i> on the operation of the system: People would have a strong incentive
</I>&gt;<i> to actually sign up to *prevent* themselves from becoming victims of
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of voter fraud.
</I>
Interesting approach. I'm skeptical but I leave it at that.

&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> soccer on TV.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> True, but with some pretty huge caveats: In the relatively small and
</I>
Small?

&gt;<i> short-term dataset they used, the majority of the voters never even
</I>&gt;<i> used delegates, although they also said that the frequency was
</I>&gt;<i> increasing over time. These votes being merely advisory and corruption
</I>&gt;<i> taking time to develop, it's *way* too early to make any claims about
</I>&gt;<i> whether or not LQFB will be susceptible to this problem.
</I>
A-ha.

&gt;<i> But what really jumped out at me from the article is the statement at
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom of the section on &quot;Voting Behavior&quot;, where they state that
</I>&gt;<i> inter-voter correlation was 0.51 (i.e., no correlation), but that
</I>&gt;<i> correlation between voters and their delegates was only 0.61 (which is
</I>&gt;<i> very little correlation). This seems to me a fatal flaw: If the
</I>&gt;<i> delegates you chose are not voting how you would vote, why choose them
</I>&gt;<i> as delegates at all? Seems to me the system would work about as well
</I>&gt;<i> if the system chose delegates for you at random!
</I>
They may be voting differently because they know better about the issue,
the implications, the details. It's like you may be inclined to vote in
favor of erecting a wall on the Mexican border. If somebody who has
better understanding of the things gains your trust, your vote is used
more wisely.

&gt;&gt;<i> Italian populists had a strong interest in making the Pirates look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like they failed on liquid democracy, but the truth is the Pirates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failed on setting up a solid legal architecture that would punish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people's wrongdoing, so whoever publicly attacked other people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would frequently have a strategic advantage in the inner party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> career.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Twas ever thus: The people who choose to participate in politics do so
</I>&gt;<i> not to make a better world for The People, they do it merely because
</I>&gt;<i> they crave power.
</I>
Excuse me, but that is BS. The people who dared to make a political
party because there was no other way of achieving change (several of
the founders had an NGO background) are cool folks trying to
achieve something. The minority that craves power appears later, and
at first they aren't even aware of being power-cravers themselves.
The art of doing a functional political party is to structure it
such that power cravers are moderated or disciplined. Nothing you
can achieve by technology. You need legal statutes for that.

&gt;&gt;<i> Many Pirates had an interest in tearing down the electronic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy platform and they successfully did so, but I wrote up a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document (in German, unfortunately) which dissects and dismantles
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all the incorrect criticism that was thrown at liquid democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.">http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.</A> There are things worth improving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about those technologies, but interestingly the attackers always went
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for fundamentally incorrect criticism.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Google translate kind of butchered it, but I could at least get the
</I>&gt;<i> gist. Just a couple of comments on it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Management at Wikipedia is IMHO deeply dysfunctional. There are
</I>&gt;<i> countless cases of articles there where the foxes are &quot;documenting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> the hen-house, and pointing problem this out (as I have, on numerous
</I>&gt;<i> occasions) results in exactly no effort being expended to correct the
</I>&gt;<i> problematic article or remove the foxes. Which is why I no longer
</I>&gt;<i> contribute there...
</I>
Me neither. Wikipedia has no effective separation of powers and the
mechanism of appeals against an administrator is designed in a way
that will hardly ever punish anyone. In other words, administrators
can do whatever they like. No surprise the problem has led to a
desperate increase in rule-writing: it's what legislators always do
when the laws aren't working, even if they aren't working for other
reasons.

But the degree of failure in neutrality on *this* Wikipedia article
is just plain staggering.

&gt;<i> 2) I disagree with the claim that Aristotle was somehow in the
</I>&gt;<i> minority among philosophers by proposing an oligarchy as the ideal
</I>&gt;<i> form of government. It's actually the *standard* proposal, from Plato
</I>&gt;<i> to Skinner (in Walden Two).
</I>
I just mentioned that citing Aristotle as a critic of LD in Wikipedia
is ridiculous populism.

&gt;<i> And claiming that Lenin ever had any
</I>&gt;<i> intention to have democratic principles operate in any significant way
</I>&gt;<i> in any organization he was a part of is to fall for one of his tricks.
</I>
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_centralism</A> exists.
It doesn't really matter if Lenin was sincere in promoting it.

&gt;<i> Trotsky, maybe, but Lenin was SDAP through and through and IMHO never
</I>&gt;<i> had any intention of sharing power with The People.
</I>
Ok, I think we understood what you think of humans who try to
influence the world through politics in absence of alternatives.
I find individuals irrelevant in this regard.
