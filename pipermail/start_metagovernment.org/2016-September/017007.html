Don't confuse one city with the entire nation. Berlin pirates were
always convinced LD won them an election - but that didn't stop the
in-fighting. I said that a few renegades filled with sufficient
hatred to hope for a demise of the pirates found a legal way to
blackmail the party from using LD. So, again, the unsolved social
issues impeded the use of LD.

&gt;<i> who actually tried it and saw all the benefits that come with LD? Why

</I>
Entire bundeslands, but winning an election in those lands is harder.
Berlin has the ideal electorate for innovation.

Berlin pirates will resume using LD soon, but in these elections they
only made some 1,7%, which is more than other small parties, but no
longer enough to make it into the parliament. The next elections are
five years away. Long time to re-invent themselves, if there is a will.

&gt;<i> Since you can follow developments within Italian and German pirate
</I>&gt;<i> parties, I wanted to ask you a question. What is your prediction about
</I>&gt;<i> dynamics of LD in Europe in the next few years (maybe 3-5 years)? Thanks.
</I>
I don't know how long it takes to get the fallacy out of people's heads
that the failure of the Piraten has anything to do with LD.

&gt;<i> As for the Mainz paper, of course I read it! I just did not see no Mainz
</I>&gt;<i> guy among the authors :) so I thought you are talking about some other
</I>&gt;<i> paper.
</I>
University of Koblenz--Landau, Rhabanusstra&#223;e 3, 55118 Mainz, Germany.

Mainz caught my eye, but I should probably refer to it as the Koblenz
paper.

Oh c'mon. Social problems need to be handled with appropriate measures.
Declaring that something can't work just because you don't have a
suggestion on how to deal with the problem or not the patience to
identify the actual problem is really not helpful to anyone.
You are blurring your vision.

&gt;<i> significant change. Not only can we not trust anyone in the current

</I>&gt;<i> the game the same way the insiders do.
</I>
Humans produce social problems in *any* kind of organization they
create and it will fail whenever there are no suitable rules. Nobel
prize winner Elinor Ostrom says you can't run a working commons if
the rules the assembly makes are not enforced and respected. The
Pirates thought anarchy was cool and nobody would have to be
disciplined, and that is plain wrong. From a theoretical point of
view a political party is the most democratic form of organization.
Neither a company, nor a corporation or nor an NGO is half as
democratic as a political party with democratic statutes - but even
if that is the least worse form of organization, it still can fail
big time if participants do not understand human nature.

So whatever you have in mind to replace the current political system,
I highly doubt you will be able to deal with the social problems, so
it would turn out not to be better than what we have.

&gt;&gt;<i> At the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following general assembly, a thin majority decided to introduce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nation-wide LQFB as a timid platform to develop motions for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next general assembly. It didn't even have any decisional powers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Immediately the Berlin crowd stormed the new instrument, recon-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structed their delegation trees. By the time the others started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understanding how to use the instrument, prominent Berliners were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already at the top of the delegation charts, giving the impression
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they were steering all the important decision-making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, this is the fatal flaw I see in how LQFB manages delegation:
</I>&gt;<i> There doesn't even seem to be any concern that the votes cast by the
</I>&gt;<i> proxies don't correlate with those of the people they end up casting
</I>
A frequent problem with criticism about LD is that apparent problems
are constructed which do not actually exist. The fact that a delegator
could have voted differently than the person he delegated to simply
reflects the situation by which the person delegated to probably
understood the matter better than the person that delegated - exactly
because they didn't have time to dig deeper and achieve expertise
or similar reasons.

LD works also because it defeats superficiality and populism. You
can't beat populism if delegation is only about being lazy to log in.
It is about understanding that your own competence can be insufficient
to achieve the common goal.

And I'm sorry if I might not find the most convincing words to relay
this notion, but how I put it in words isn't actually important. The
numbers and the experience show that the model works.

&gt;<i> votes for (as clearly shown in that paper you referenced:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07723v1.pdf</A>). It still baffles me as to why
</I>&gt;<i> no one seems to think this is a problem. Any idea why such a blatant
</I>&gt;<i> defect can seemingly go unnoticed? What do they think delegates are
</I>
You are assuming that a feature is a defect, but you are wrong in your
judgement.

&gt;<i> *for* if not just a way to ensure that the Will of The People is
</I>&gt;<i> properly assessed? Was it *designed* to be just another tool for the
</I>&gt;<i> powerful to use to exploit them?
</I>
The Will of The People is not direct democracy. If you let everyone
click their current opinion they will actually achieve populism, not
democracy. LD produces a better rendering of what the people want
than if they all try to become competent enough to not fall into the
traps of superficiality.

The AfD election programme is full of subtly wrapped statements of
racism and homophobia, simply because there was no analysis of the
fallacies behind those attitudes. The AfD participants were simply
interviewed on their &quot;views&quot;. In LD there would have been an intense
debate of pro and con racism and homophobia, and the arguments
against populism would have convinced those who took the time to
participate, even if they were prejudiced themselves at the beginning
of the debate, so it is good they get the delegation. Delegates are
those, that didn't stop at having prejudice and pre-manufactured or
pre-manipulated opinion.

If your idea of democracy is the sort where prejudice would win over
reason, then I don't want to use your tools..  :)

&gt;&gt;<i> In particular the so-called superdelegates were the number one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point of concern. Exactly the point that the researchers examined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in 2015 and found to be innocuous. But 2015 was too late.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't go that far. In fact, after re-reading that paper it seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me very strange in the way it hints at and then fails to fully
</I>&gt;<i> explore the most interesting findings. Besides the voter/delegate
</I>&gt;<i> non-correlation (as above), there is this little gem (at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> the Discussion section):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We believe that this is due to a responsible selection of delegates,
</I>&gt;<i> the social control in an enforced public voting and the risk of the
</I>&gt;<i> immediate loss of voting power by recall of delegations.&quot;
</I>
Exactly. This is probably why it works.

&gt;<i> WTF? Are the delegates running for office? Are they somehow being
</I>&gt;<i> rewarded for carrying a lot of votes? Isn't this exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> foundation that allows for the kind of corruption we see in our
</I>&gt;<i> existing misrepresentative democracies?
</I>
The reward is a degree of influence, it motivates them to continue
being the informed ones, to dig deep and avoid superficiality.
No, it is not the same. Representative corruption happens because
once somebody is elected they are out of control for several years,
out of transparency, directly available for the lobbyist. Exactly
this scenario does *not* work in LD.

&gt;<i> While I would have liked to see it run a lot further to see how it
</I>&gt;<i> actually works on a large scale and over the long term, I have far
</I>
To me a deployment of &gt;10000 running over a year isn't so small.
It is sufficient to produce much better output than your average
national parliament.

&gt;<i> less faith than you that LQFB is not just another version of
</I>&gt;<i> misrepresentative democracy, where votes are not even intended to
</I>&gt;<i> represent the will of the people, but merely a way to provide them
</I>&gt;<i> with the illusion that they have control over the government when in
</I>&gt;<i> fact all the important decisions are being made by SDAP leadership. A
</I>&gt;<i> final quote that I think summarizes this fact that what the authors,
</I>&gt;<i> and indeed the PP as a whole, are really secretly searching for is a
</I>&gt;<i> way to identify and then promote benevolent dictators:
</I>
If your prejudices are challenged and FUD feels fuzzier to you, then
I can't help but letting you output some more FUD about LD.

&gt;<i> &quot;Both the analysis of voting behaviour and the empirical measurement
</I>&gt;<i> of potential and exercised power exhibit a responsible exercise of
</I>&gt;<i> power by super-voters.&quot;
</I>
And the idea that delegation is bad because YOU have the prejudice
the WRONG people would get that privilege in an UNCHECKED manner thus
making them DICTATORS is all your problem of prejudice. The paper is
clear in showing that the mechanism works despite its superficial
appearance. It will take humanity a long time to appreciate scientific
findings if ideology always comes first.
