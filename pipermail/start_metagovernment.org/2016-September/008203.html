I disagree that delegation is inherently necessary. There are billions of policy decisions made every year (considering every level of government around the world). Nobody can be expected to vote on all of those, but anyone should be able to vote on any of them (example: I may want to vote on a dam-construction project in India because I may have an interest in its ecological impact).

An alternative to delegation is simply consent-through-non-participation. In other words, any measure may be voted on by *anyone* who cares about it, and anything they don&#8217;t vote on is left to those who do care. If we can get beyond the concept of tying governance to geography/citizenship, this seems like the only practical approach. Otherwise, you will be required to decide who gets to participate in which decisions, and that path has an authoritarian undertone to it.
