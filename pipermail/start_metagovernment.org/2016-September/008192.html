<PRE>Hi Scott,
I have to admit, I am now very skeptical about chances of your project. Some of the most important questions (how you are going to start, what will attract people) to you are just marketing questions. I would like to be wrong, but I am afraid your priorities are misplaced. Hopefully you launch your service in couple years from now, as you plan, I will then be happy to try it out.

Regards,Sergey

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, I don't expect anyone to be convinced to dump a lot of work

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you give a specific example how people might start using your system,
</I>&gt;<i> the first 100-1000 users?
</I>
This is a marketing issue and so doesn't need to be decided now. But
I'd assume that the hooks I have to other like-minded groups (e.g.
links scraped from places like <A HREF="http://www.participatedb.com/">http://www.participatedb.com/</A> and/or
&quot;Viable Way&quot; on FB) would get that number very easily. I'm actually
more concerned about having *too many* people wanting in before the
system is really ready and then disappointing them or burning them out
than not having enough to prove viability. Once it's stable (and well
liked), scaling up should happen extremely rapidly (and of course the
system needs to be designed to run on AWS or something that can scale
with demand, even if demand gets very large very rapidly).

&gt;<i> Who will be writing proposals? What kind of proposals?
</I>
At first, probably mostly me, although I'm going to crib from a wide
variety of sources (existing and proposed laws/ordinances, review of
appeals court cases, Avaaz/MoveOn/etc.)&#160; And they'll not be wimpy
&quot;what should the MG Home Page be&quot; sorts of things, they'll be about
abortion, gun control, education (e.g., vouchers), and other stuff
that even our existing misrepresentative governments are afraid to
take on. This is what will make the project compelling.

As I've said before, IMHO doing this part right is probably even more
important than having the software fully optimized. I've therefore
already started collecting proposals and working out how to make them
digestible by regular people (budgeting and criminal penalties being
two of the biggest problem areas at present). I of course am aware of
the wannabe dictatorship perception problem this presents and so will
have a Vanguard of the Elite (i.e., another mailing list or forum) to
assist. The People will most likely accept that, even though if they
know anything about previous revolutions they certainly shouldn't ;-)

&gt;<i> What organization might use your system?
</I>
&quot;Organization&quot;? Perhaps you misunderstood: I aim to replace *all*
government, worldwide. I need to update matchism.org on this point: At
first I sort of entertained the &quot;start small&quot; philosophy that has been
adopted by Loomio and other projects, but now see that this is
unworkable. We go big, or go home: IMHO it's impossible to generate
the kind of intensity that we'll need to succeed by limiting ourselves
to HOAs that want to figure out where to put their bike racks...

&gt;<i>Will the votes be binding from the very beginning?
</I>
This too is a marketing issue rather than a design or implementation
issue and so doesn't need to be decided now. My current thinking is
just to be up front about the plan: That it's a beta test for an
actual replacement government. The votes won't be binding until a
majority of The People vote to make them so. At that point, a Critical
Mass having been assembled, the revolution will have already occurred.
This requires some faith that it won't happen so quickly that it
destabilizes civilization itself although I myself have some fear that
this is indeed the way it will go, particularly if it gets picked up
in a country experiencing a civil war or other unrest (this issue is
dealt with in more detail on matchism.org). My backup faith is that if
we do a good job of tapping into the Will of The People, Neurotypical
behavior will be robust enough to prevent any major disasters even if
the SDAPs try to capitalize on the instability (preppers, ugh).

&gt;<i> I find description of your system (1-3) to be similar to what I have in mind
</I>&gt;<i> or what Matteo was proposing. Except that I am willing to incorporate your
</I>&gt;<i> matchism engine as an option, while you are insisting that it be only
</I>&gt;<i> permitted mechanism of selecting proxies. But you still have not explain how
</I>&gt;<i> you are going to start (see the above questions please). For me, it is a
</I>&gt;<i> huge gap in your explanation. That people are naturally interested in
</I>&gt;<i> politics and are naturally efficient may not be enough to expect them to be
</I>&gt;<i> engaged in non-binding votings on some imaginary laws.
</I>
Again, this is (just) a marketing issue, and in my experience is the
least of our problems. It's only a problem the other projects have
died from because they don't have compelling content and that's simply
not going to be a problem with the MatchSys. There's a whole lot of
people who can't get enough of some of these things and put the fear
that having sat on the sidelines prior the point when Critical Mass
has been reached will result in changes they don't agree with actually
being implement will I'm sure inspire most of them to least follow the
process. E.g., we'll have the zealots on both sides of the guns and
abortion issues paying close attention, but I figure even knowing that
will encourage everyone else to at least watch too. Watching will be
extremely low cost: You'll get one email or text a week. That's it:
Once you learn to trust your proxies, you won't even have to read past
the subject line.
&#160; Regards,
&#160; &#160; Scott
