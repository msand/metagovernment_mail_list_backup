<PRE>Hi Lynx,

If this was true:


*What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were*
*kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate*
*percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy*
*actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political*
*outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being*
*distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching**soccer
on TV.*


This would be quite interesting. I honestly doubt it is true.


*Has anyone studied the Banzhaf measure of the people actually casting the
last votes in the decisions?*
Where can I download the tree of the delegation network to make the
calculations myself? I just need the list of the people voting at the end,
and how many delegates (summing up all the direct and indirect delegates)
each had. In other words, a list of names, and of weights. This for each
decision taken (at least for the important ones).

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was part of the initial installation of Liquid Feedback in Berlin
</I>&gt;<i> 2010 that pulled several political topics out of a magician's hat
</I>&gt;<i> that are still being talked about everywhere in the world, at a time

</I>&gt;<i> the principle of Liquid Democracy was the key ingredient to their
</I>&gt;<i> success. I documented this in Italian at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/laricetta.">http://my.pages.de/laricetta.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The original voting result at <A HREF="https://lqpp.de/be/issue/show/635.html">https://lqpp.de/be/issue/show/635.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> is in German, but apparently the server is down, possibly following
</I>&gt;<i> legal action by party dissidents and opponents. The greatest threat
</I>&gt;<i> to electronic democracy is social and political, not technical. The
</I>&gt;<i> reason why the original LQFB of 2010 worked like a charm was social:
</I>&gt;<i> there was hardly any participant with mean intentions. Of course
</I>&gt;<i> this is not a long-term solution, so e-democracy platforms have to
</I>&gt;<i> learn to deal with dominant people - they may not even intentionally
</I>&gt;<i> be evil.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Berlin Pirates are attempting a new run at the elections this
</I>&gt;<i> year, bare of liquid democracy because of legal threats. No surprise
</I>&gt;<i> the election program looks quite boring compared to 2011. They
</I>&gt;<i> attempted to follow the lead of Italian Pirates in instituting a
</I>&gt;<i> permanent assembly rather than just a survey tool, but they still
</I>&gt;<i> haven't solved the in-fighting issues - so the LQFB assembly has
</I>&gt;<i> been impeded by people that do not want the Pirates to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily it worked in other German bundeslands, so by now several
</I>&gt;<i> Pirate Parties exist that not only have LQFB running - they use it
</I>&gt;<i> as an official form of permanent assembly, empowered to take real
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As all direct democracy projects developed so far have failed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is an assertion which I can effortlessly reject knowing several
</I>&gt;<i> counter-proofs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No one has been used at global level by, say, at least one percent
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the global populations
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's because there are other powers at play, discrediting legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> successes. Who knows why. Also, certifying the authenticity of 1% of
</I>&gt;<i> the world population would be a terrific endeavour. Without certification
</I>&gt;<i> it's just a big falsifiable play tool, like holding elections on Facebook.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; LQFB has failed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is plain incorrect. Too late to save the Pirate movement, only
</I>&gt;<i> in 2015 scientists made a profound analysis of the effects of liquid
</I>&gt;<i> delegation on the democratic intentions. The paper that you should
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely be aware of resides at <A HREF="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07723.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What those non-pirate people found was that the superdelegates were
</I>&gt;<i> kind of a myth, because they never really exceeded a moderate
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of voting power, and that the promise of liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> actually proved true: delegations were &quot;stabilizing&quot; the political
</I>&gt;<i> outcome of LQFB even in the face of majorities of participants being
</I>&gt;<i> distracted by other political issues or simply being busy watching
</I>&gt;<i> soccer on TV.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we know now is that the liquid modeling of a representative
</I>&gt;<i> approach actually works and actually reduces the risks of demagogy
</I>&gt;<i> that come with direct democracy. Still, there are reasonable and
</I>&gt;<i> unreasonable ways of setting up a liquid democratic platform.
</I>&gt;<i> Depending on the legal architecture around it you can either reap
</I>&gt;<i> the best of both direct and representative democracy or earn the
</I>&gt;<i> worst of both worlds.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Italian populists had a strong interest in making the Pirates look
</I>&gt;<i> like they failed on liquid democracy, but the truth is the Pirates
</I>&gt;<i> failed on setting up a solid legal architecture that would punish
</I>&gt;<i> people's wrongdoing, so whoever publicly attacked other people
</I>&gt;<i> would frequently have a strategic advantage in the inner party
</I>&gt;<i> career. Many Pirates had an interest in tearing down the electronic
</I>&gt;<i> democracy platform and they successfully did so, but I wrote up a
</I>&gt;<i> document (in German, unfortunately) which dissects and dismantles
</I>&gt;<i> all the incorrect criticism that was thrown at liquid democracy
</I>&gt;<i> at <A HREF="http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.">http://my.pages.de/liquidspin.de.</A> There are things worth improving
</I>&gt;<i> about those technologies, but interestingly the attackers always went
</I>&gt;<i> for fundamentally incorrect criticism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's understand: electronic democracy has many enemies - anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer to have things done their way rather than having to
</I>&gt;<i> listen to some thousand strangers clicking their vote from their sofas.
</I>&gt;<i> And being against something is usually much easier than being for it.
</I>&gt;<i> Demagogy and populism does the rest. As frequently in politics, if
</I>&gt;<i> we're not going to be scientific about this, we will succumb.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here are the five steps of the typical direct democracy project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let's be more scientific on this mailing list. If this is
</I>&gt;<i> your theory, please mark it as such. If you are presenting facts,
</I>&gt;<i> please provide links to the empiric research or evidence. The
</I>&gt;<i> irrationality of the debate around electronic democracy is what
</I>&gt;<i> harms it the most, quite ironically. E-democracy, a victim of
</I>&gt;<i> political manipulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    The _decline phase_: the group accuses the public at large of being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    lazy, the media of being non collaborative and biased, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governments of mobbing and the other groups of sabotaging. There is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    little or no self-criticism about why the project is not going as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    planned. People start to leave the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't find that very accurate. The things I experienced were
</I>&gt;<i> quite totally different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neither.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the moment, all direct democracy projects do follow this pattern,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no one excluded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Incorrect assertion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why new developers do not listen to old developers who failed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do people form new political organizations without learning
</I>&gt;<i> from the mistakes of previous ones? Why do people still develop
</I>&gt;<i> federated chat systems when federation doesn't solve the privacy
</I>&gt;<i> problem? Why do people think that all anonymity problems can be
</I>&gt;<i> addressed with a bit of Tor, all data structures can be rendered
</I>&gt;<i> into XML and the semantic loss of using JSON instead is suddenly
</I>&gt;<i> no problem at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are just some examples of how rationality is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> ruling the Internet (I think it was up to 1995, when Java came
</I>&gt;<i> out). Maybe it happens because the Internet is really good at
</I>&gt;<i> giving the illusion you learned all you need to know in a day
</I>&gt;<i> or two of surfing websites? What you actually did was absorb
</I>&gt;<i> superficial hypes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why they do not study why other system failed and instead build a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new system also doomed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know some people who did.
