Redirecting this to the <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A>, although that may
not be long for this world. Seems to me that this is a case where
actual leadership could be a useful thing, although in deference to
Ed, IMHO he needs to abdicate first. What say you, oh great founder
and leader: Will you permit someone to move this list to another host?

</I>
Exactly: The time any existing government wants to get involved in any
of these projects is the time to run screaming in the other direction.

&gt;<i> Facebook did not need any government help to succeed
</I>&gt;<i> Twitter did not need any government help to succeed
</I>
Exactly: Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door.

&gt;<i> LQFB and Airesis could be used by millions of people right now, the only
</I>&gt;<i> reason why they are not used is simply because people do not want to use
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> And they do not want to use them as simply they do not see them as fitting
</I>&gt;<i> their needs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is as simple as that
</I>
Well, maybe not quite: There is a difference between &quot;wants&quot; and
&quot;needs&quot;. Nobody really &quot;needs&quot; FaceBook or Twitter, they mostly just
&quot;want&quot; to be entertained. But that alone is sufficient justification
for the existence of those products, and to create a new tool that
enables creating a government that they &quot;want&quot; to live under. If you
can provide for real &quot;needs&quot; (being part of a community, information
exchange, etc.) so much the better. IMHO neither FB nor Twitter
actually provide either of these, the &quot;being part of a community&quot;
feeling being an illusion (e.g., very few of people's FB &quot;friends&quot; are
true friends) and both providing about as much misinformation as
actual information, rendering the real truth actually harder to
ascertain.

There's also the issue of marketing (the better mousetrap theory
notwithstanding): It may be that Airesis or LQFB just haven't been
marketed properly and therefore that people don't know enough about
them to make the decision to use them. Carlo I think was trying to
address that issue, although at least in my case it seriously
backfired: I thank him for posting the link to the Kling paper, which
I found extremely helpful in tweaking my own design because it so
clearly showed the fatal flaws in LQFB when it was used in a
real-world run. I found that paper in particular more useful than even
our trial runs of Loomio and Vilfredo and Airesis, all of which I had
some remaining doubts about whether my dislike of them was something
idiosyncratic. With LQFB the statistics on proxy use and voting record
left no room for debate: It, and my original voting system proposal,
requires a major redesign.
  Regards,
    Scott
