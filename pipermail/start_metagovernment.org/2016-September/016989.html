<PRE>Concerning regulation, I accept your point. But I am not looking for a solution for everything right now; but rather just a toehold. I suspect a well-developed idea-creation system could produce ideas that get implemented by popular demand. It may not be the only solution in the short-term, but it would demonstrate the power of collaboration. I posit that it hasn&#8217;t happened much so far because we haven&#8217;t focused on idea-creation and/or we haven&#8217;t had good enough tools for it.

I am inclined to disagree with your point about voting being separate from idea-creation. I think it is fundamentally a question of what should be voted on in the first place. If a community puts to a vote &#8220;should we build this dam?&#8221; the whole conversation is limited to that black-and-white issue. If instead the community said &#8220;we need more/better/cleaner energy production in this area, what can we do?&#8221; then building a dam could be one idea, but there might be a much, much better idea that could come out of the crowd.

My (untested/unproven) hypothesis is that such an idea might be so good that voting on it would be more of a formality than a necessity. Such an idea could have such an overwhelming level of support (because the crowd found a way to satisfy the concerns of everyone involved) that everyone just wants it to happen.

This is why I think it is crucial to focus on policy-shaping over decision-making. If the policy is shaped beautifully, the decision-making is practically irrelevant. Is that not the goal? To have decisions that are not majority-rule, but rather gain a broad/deep consensus?

(Note: Shortly I will be traveling for the next few days, so may a while in following up to any replies.)
