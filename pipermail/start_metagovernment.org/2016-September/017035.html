<PRE>In fact I would say we should all learn to get over Scott. I am very
grateful to Carlo for pointing out some the numerous inconsistencies where
Scott contradicts himself. For example when he says that when you vote,
people are different and so should not be treated all in the same way, and
then in some other emails when he points out how you cannot let the expert
defines the options.

And then he keeps speaking about his matchism as the solution. Which would
be fine if he ever actually had coded it, and it could be tested, and would
thus be open itself to criticism.

Honestly if only I were to believe in trolling, I would say Scott is a
troll that have hunted this mailing list for several years so far. Mostly
silencing its voices with his critics. An old saying goes that those that
do not believe something can be done, should not stop people trying to do
it.  Several years ago out of frustration I decided not to interact with
him any longer as I did not see this going anywhere. But being a mailing
list this has actually pushed myself out of the mailing list. If one thing
I have learned from those exchanges, is that a completely unmoderated
discussion only goes in circles. Something I unfortunately new before.

So, well come Carlo. You know I do not agree with your enthusiasm for
liquid feedback (although I am still observing it with moderate interest).
But I agree with you on the importance of a scientific approach to this
topic.

So welcome Carlo, let not your voice be missing here.
Pietro
