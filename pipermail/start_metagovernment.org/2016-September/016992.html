<PRE>&gt;<i> And I believe that we should consider a new decisionmaking/government system as just another consumer product.
</I>I find this analogy somewhat weak. Utility of a consumer product usually becomes apparent as soon as you try it. I do not expect this to be the case for a decision making system. You said earlier that it may take years before voted decisions become binding (in the sense that someone will be obliged to implement them). So you are not giving any real product to people, but rather promising them a bright future and asking them to participate to make (your vision of) that bright future a reality.
I have similar problems with your other statements that follow from the consumer product analogy. Such as: 
1) people will either like it or not, will like it if it is useful
2) the timing is very important, the system should not be revealed before it is fully ready

My classifying things as &quot;marketing issues&quot; isn't an attempt to
belittle their importance: As a (at least somewhat) successful
entrepreneur I recognize that proper marketing is a key component of
product success. In some areas, such as consumer products (soft
drinks, Apple products, etc.) it is actually the more important
component. And I believe that we should consider a new
decisionmaking/government system as just another consumer product.

My point is merely about scheduling: In the product development world,
making key marketing decisions too early is at least as bad as making
them too late (or not at all). We've all seen product disasters
brought on by marketing overriding the technical side (&quot;New Coke&quot;
being the classic example, but I consider the VW diesel fiasco to be
another example of marketing making promises that engineering was
unable to keep). We don't even know what the product will be like and
how it will be perceived and so IMHO it's *way* too early to be
thinking about how we're going to &quot;sell&quot; it. It may be the &quot;better
mousetrap&quot; that needs no marketing at all, or marketing may only need
to concentrate on specific areas (like &quot;Hey, really, it's safe and
reasonable to talk about replacing our current governments&quot;). Design a
product that you think will be popular (even if it in fact becomes
wildly popular) to help the marketing side but not ensuring that it
has the technical chops to back it up and what you've created is a
&quot;fad&quot;, not a permanent change in the world. Which is why I prefer to
concentrate on the technical side for now.
