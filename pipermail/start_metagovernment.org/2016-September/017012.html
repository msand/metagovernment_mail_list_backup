</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm thinking it would not be a voting process, but a vetoing process.
</I>&gt;<i> These
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals are assumed to be created by the experts, only significant
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposition should prevent it from passing.
</I>&gt;<i> Wow, you really *haven't* been paying attention, have you? The idea
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;experts&quot; will automagically create proposals that reflect the
</I>&gt;<i> Will of The People has been so thoroughly discredited that I'm
</I>&gt;<i> actually stunned to see someone seriously propose this. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> unaware that these &quot;experts&quot; are exactly the same people who run our
</I>&gt;<i> current misrepresentative democracies?
</I>

Ha alright, clearly 'expert' was the wrong word to use. An advocate would
be a better word I guess. I mentioned earlier these 'experts' are
self-appointed, they are anyone who claims to have knowledge on the
subject. It's not a position of power, anyone can sign up for whichever
committee they have the most interest in.

While I agree with the idea that the vast majority of proposals will
&gt;<i> not come from The People directly (to keep the numbers down and the
</I>&gt;<i> quality up, which is necessary to maximize efficiency), I'm not at all
</I>&gt;<i> sure what percentage of proposals should pass in order to consider a
</I>&gt;<i> system (or a proposer) a success. Considering the stuff that comes out
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;experts&quot; in the US congress I'd be willing to say that if
</I>&gt;<i> that's the quality of proposals we get that the pass ratio should be
</I>&gt;<i> pretty close to 0%. But after a few rounds of that kind of humiliating
</I>&gt;<i> repudiation I have faith that the proposal generators will actually
</I>&gt;<i> bother to do a little real social engineering backed by actual
</I>&gt;<i> measurement of what The People want and will accept. In your proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> these &quot;experts&quot; (who I maintain will be SDAP because those are just
</I>&gt;<i> the people that want to make the rules) will never even have any check
</I>&gt;<i> on their behavior.
</I>

I agree, numbers down, quality up in proposals is key. The 'experts' can be
limited by the system only allowing a certain number of proposals per user
per year, 3 for example. Also having a comprehensive proposal creation
criteria will make it no small feat to properly get a proposal filled out
and on to the discussion phase. This way only if you have some confidence
it will get passed would you bother submitting.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As an example, a proposal would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to double the number of vetoes acquired from the general public
</I>&gt;<i> than it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initially got votes for in the committee stage. The proposal has the
</I>&gt;<i> ability
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be reintroduced if the vetos for the veto doubled the number again in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; general public. This, in my view, removes SDAP's ability, they aren't
</I>&gt;<i> able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to push things through easily. Education would play a bigger role.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not following the math here. A group of a 100 SDAP &quot;experts&quot; come
</I>&gt;<i> up with a proposal to build a new nuke system that they pass
</I>&gt;<i> unanimously: How many &quot;veto&quot; votes must a population of a million need
</I>&gt;<i> to cast to prevent that proposal from going into effect?
</I>

Sorry for not communicating properly. This group of 100 SDAP's would all
need to be in the same 'weapon system committee' or whatever to pass that,
that's the only committee they can be a part of. In this case then, 200
outside users, not associated with the 'weapon system committee' would be
required to veto the proposal.

(big snip)

Point taken, that the committees would not be balanced, but that voice of
opposition would be there still. And would be a rallying cry when the
proposal passed the committee stage and was out in the general public
space. The users in the committee hold no power in voting once the proposal
is moved to the general public.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Would there not be extremists on both sides of these committees? E.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Citizens who have relatives in another country who want nothing more
</I>&gt;<i> than to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get them here so would vote for more immigration. Or hippies who take it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; upon themselves to protect the world from all arms, and so would oppose
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; new weapon system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what are the ratios sizes of the two groups? I think history has
</I>&gt;<i> shown that the number of &quot;hippies&quot; who are willing to sit through
</I>&gt;<i> endless hours of meetings and rewrites with the goal of only thwarting
</I>&gt;<i> a weapons-system bill from being passed are dwarfed by the number of
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians who are highly motivated to &quot;save the world&quot; by telling
</I>&gt;<i> other people what they have to do (and in the case of &quot;foreigners&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> actually threatening them with violence if they don't comply). The
</I>&gt;<i> number of immigrants willing to stick their necks out to try to change
</I>&gt;<i> how the system works is negligible, at least compared with the number
</I>&gt;<i> of authoritarians who will work to protect our resources by keeping
</I>&gt;<i> them out (and I speak from experience here: My wife and her family and
</I>&gt;<i> many of her friends are from Taiwan and their take on how to deal with
</I>&gt;<i> the government is completely different from mine and so I'm usually
</I>&gt;<i> the one who has to coach them not to just give up when some tin-pot
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucrat puts up a roadblock that they don't see any way around).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The same thing will occur even in highly polarized areas like
</I>&gt;<i> abortion: While there are extremists on both sides of the issue the
</I>&gt;<i> numbers are nowhere near equal in any gathering of &quot;experts&quot; (and does
</I>&gt;<i> the concept of &quot;experts&quot; even apply to a moral issue like this?)  This
</I>&gt;<i> is why abortion in the US (and things like abortion and gay marriage
</I>&gt;<i> and many other issues in most countries) end up being decided by the
</I>&gt;<i> courts instead of The People or their &quot;expert&quot; misrepresentatives. It
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't need to be this way, but it does require a complete system
</I>&gt;<i> design such that The People actually retain *all* of the power and
</I>&gt;<i> that the proposal generation system is engineered to ensure that the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals are designed to meet the requirements of The People rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the preferences of the &quot;experts&quot; (e.g., in my system an executive
</I>&gt;<i> with a very low proposal acceptance rate would just be replaced).
