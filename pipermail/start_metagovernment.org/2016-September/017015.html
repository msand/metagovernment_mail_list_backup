I pulled out two contradictory statements of yours from two
different mails and put them next to each other. By writing an
extra mail, asserting victory over LQFB all by yourself, you
deliberately chose to make things more complicated (by organization)
and superficial (by quality).

My empiric experience does not confirm your assumption.

</I>
I don't assume. I relay empiric experience. Call it anecdotical if
you like, but it is more than what you have.

&gt;&gt;<i> You must understand that your established criteria for good and bad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are challenged by this totally different model, and your attempt to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand it without several years of practice is like trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give lessons in disco rollerskating without attempts to either dance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or skate. Excuse me if your attempts to categorize LQFB by your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> expertise falls flat on its feet.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hey, I only know what I read. And what I read, in the Kling paper but
</I>&gt;<i> also from many other sources, is that LQFB just doesn't do what it
</I>&gt;<i> claims to, which is to improve democracy by reducing the burden on
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary voters via a delegation system: Because so few people
</I>&gt;<i> actually delegate, and even those that do aren't matched
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically (or even ideologically) to their proxies, most
</I>&gt;<i> people's opinions are simply not reflected in the final decisions.
</I>
If some anecdotical reports say that it hasn't been working for their
group whereas others know they won actual elections with it, they
question to ask I think is to figure out why it worked here and didn't
over there. What are the differences in the social structure, in the
intentions of the participants. How can these factors be influenced
to ensure that the software will be empowered to help? It is evident
that the problems are beyond what software can fix, so it is important
to understand structural and legal requirements for successful
deployment. The idea that the software is wrong just because some
people used it in a GIGO manner equals not learning from that success
story.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I am not a promoter of direct democracy. I see how the AfD
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right-wing populist movement in Germany is growing because it uses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democracy to re-enforce and legitimize the existing prejudices
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of its members and electorate, and I think it is Trumpism in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> digital age. Trumpism legitimized by the ideal of participation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad about your cynicism. But you should take heart in the
</I>
What's cynical about that? I see the facts as they are.

&gt;<i> statistics published by Altemeyer and more precisely by Stenner:
</I>&gt;<i> Although those people make a lot of noise and *seem* like a formidable
</I>&gt;<i> force, they're actually a relatively small proportion of the
</I>&gt;<i> population (around 25%, depending on threat level). The trick, in my
</I>&gt;<i> considered opinion, is to have the opinions of the 50+ percent of the
</I>&gt;<i> population who *don't* actively participate in politics properly
</I>&gt;<i> recorded in the voting. Neither LQFB nor misrepresentative democracy
</I>&gt;<i> do that, with the completely predictable result that it's the SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> who end up making public policy.
</I>
Oh wow, one quarter of the population stinks so let's try the other
half. No, I don't think you are going to obtain much better results
by taking the other half's prejudices and making those into law.

The *problem* of that approach is that it pulls out opinions and
prejudices instead of getting people to assert the facts, understand
the issues and come up with real solutions that tackle the problems.

As long as your approach allows for ideas that are known to be
fallacious to come out as winners of the process, you have failed
Karl Popper and a lot of other people. E-democracy's results must
be within the span of possible reasonable choices, after all the
fallacious and idiotic ones have been debunked. If your approach
to e-democracy doesn't consider any of that, it's not going to work.

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, there is room for improvement in LQFB, but the astounding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thing to learn is that according to the data we have now it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the least bad system of governance/consensus and we should work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from that, not keep making mistakes of excess direct democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or corrupt representativity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that I would claim that LQFB is any worse than our current
</I>&gt;<i> misrepresentative democracies, but to my mind it has most of the same
</I>&gt;<i> flaws (most seriously that policy ends up being decided by only the
</I>&gt;<i> most active participants) and so would not be a significant
</I>&gt;<i> improvement if it were implemented widely.
</I>
That has been proven to be wrong. It does not have those flaws.
It helps remove fallacious choices. It impedes the promotion of
corrupt, lobbyist or populist proposals. It impedes corruption
as the proxies wouldn't get far with it.

&gt;&gt;<i> No, the only &quot;elites&quot; that can arise out of LQFB are because of their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ability to dissect problems and come up with reasonable proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And their status is tied to that ability to stay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, naive *and* delusional: How can you hold these two ideas in your
</I>&gt;<i> head at the same time?
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Voters are too ignorant/irrational/busy/etc. to make decisions for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Voters search out and recognize &quot;expertise&quot; and incorruptibility
</I>&gt;<i> and properly delegate only to proxies who display these things.
</I>
There are a lot of aspects of LD that are amazing and surprising.
This one for example works out because of the long debating times.
&quot;Voter&quot; is the wrong term. It sounds like there is no debate.

It is enough if one participant is paying attention and noticing
a bogus explanation for a bogus political choice to draw the
attention of many of the other participants. The result can be
a reorganization of delegations or simply that the proxy who
expressed that fallacious argumentation understands their mistake
and corrects it.

So I would guess that LQFB works things out with a healthy form
of inner attention economy. One thing that actually can disturb
the process is if proposal promoters do massive amounts of out-
of-band publicity, like advertising on Twitter - but then again
even if the influx of people is biased at first, the LQFB method
still leads them to confront also the criticalities of a proposal
and the alternative options. That's hugely better than say a
campaign on change.org.

Again I am taking guesses why it works. I just experienced that
it works. It would be important to have more scientifically proven
understanding of why it works. You can only achieve that if you
drop the prejudice and accept that most of it is working.

&gt;<i> I'm not here to win any arguments. I'm here to learn what all the
</I>&gt;<i> flaws in previous systems were, and to challenge other people to find
</I>&gt;<i> the flaws in my proposals to save me (us) some time and grief when it
</I>&gt;<i> comes time to implement them.
</I>
I'm afraid the method you are using will lead you to implement flawed
proposals anyway, because your tendency to organize factoids and
criticism around your pre-architected beliefs is keeping you from
achieving a neutral view of the knowledge. You declared LQFB a lost
battleground before fully understanding it. That is an indication
that in no way you have a chance of developing a neutral rational
standpoint out of your own mind. You may want to use a good
tool for aggregating some collective intelligence instead.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Luckily the paper was quite an interesting read, but it has not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addressed the issue of extroverts at all and we have had PLENTY of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems with left-wing extroverts causing havoc, so the idea that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problematic social behavior only comes from the right is utterly false.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again with the &quot;extroverts&quot;. Read the paper again: It's not
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;extroverts&quot; that are the problem (indeed although high SDO is highly
</I>&gt;<i> correlated with extroversion, authoritarianism *isn't*). As for the
</I>&gt;<i> left wing &quot;extroverts&quot;, I think you may be confusing extroversion with
</I>&gt;<i> left-wing authoritarianism. Although there isn't much research on this
</I>&gt;<i> type (which makes up a small minority of authoritarians), IMHO they
</I>&gt;<i> frequently appear as SJWs, some of which are extroverts, but most of
</I>&gt;<i> which are probably just introverted trolls.
</I>
Look, the discussion we are having is clearly among left-wing
extroverts. You are one opinionated extrovert. I am an experienced
extrovert. A tool that tames our tendence to dominate other
people's thinking and pulls out the facts out of our babble is
worth gold here. LQFB is really good at that. Mailing lists are
the worst.

Funny that the term extroverts actually made into the Wikipedia
entry because it came from the OccupyWS people that never used
LQFB at all. Here's the background story from 2012:
	<A HREF="http://my.pages.de/activerts">http://my.pages.de/activerts</A>

I'm really lucky that four years later every single line in that
post is still accurate and even backed by scientific work.

&gt;<i> OK, so your point is that delegation *isn't* to make the system more
</I>&gt;<i> democratic (i.e., more closely reflecting the Will of The People), but
</I>&gt;<i> merely to make it more stable? Again, if this is the case I'd consider
</I>&gt;<i> it to be an example of false advertising.
</I>
Politically stable = more democratic. You are clutching at straws,
trying to figure some way out to criticize this thing that you didn't
invent. Your biased approach is annoying. You should be cheering that
some folks have made some progress in the modeling of democracy but
instead you are suffering severe attacks of N.I.H.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it ignores the fact that these &quot;supervoters&quot; will as a result engage in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> all kinds of corrupt activity (quid-pro-quo favors, log rolling,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> etc.), activity that's can't even be monitored by the public (via the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> press) like it is in misrepresentative democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bullshit. This has never worked and never happened in my experience.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You are again talking about disco rollerskating. I explained why this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can't happen and you have your own reasons to teach rollerskating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it didn't ever happen with the PP. But then, you'd surely
</I>&gt;<i> concede that because it didn't fail when used by a homogenous group of

There isn't much homogenous about tenthousand pirates other than they
probably all dislike surveillance.

&gt;<i> a few thousand people out of a population of 80 million (i.e., 0.01%
</I>&gt;<i> of the population) operating over a couple of years is hardly &quot;proof&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> that it wouldn't become a dominate characteristic if *everyone* were
</I>&gt;<i> using it for millennia to come...
</I>
My empirical experience in half a dozen LQFB instances with different
participant structures is that corruption of proxys does not pay off
compared to the corruption of members of physical parliaments. It is
okay to want to dig deeper into this experience and try to find data
for it, but it is not okay to proclaim the opposite and present it
as a fact.

&gt;&gt;<i> In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual can't know what is the best choice.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Elitism, in its purest form ;-)
</I>
Populism in its purest form, to reduce something to one word and
expect that word to sound bad. Luckily everyone in this mailing list
has an understanding of anti-democratic psychology and sees how you
are manipulating, albeit probably not consciously.

&gt;&gt;<i> I understand your allergy against that kind of thinking, but there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a fundamental difference to representative democracy: In the broken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance models we experience in western democracies we are told
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that the experts and oligarchs know better, but thanks to the power
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of corruption that isn't true. Whereas in the liquid democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model the temporary leadership arises out of actual reason and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not corruptible, therefore it is not only okay, it is necessary to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model the failure of the individual to assert what's best for him.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So your claim would be that LQFB would be immune to demagoguery and
</I>&gt;<i> other ways SDAPs game the system? I don't see that at all.
</I>
It doesn't matter what you don't like to see. You have no clue.

I am the one who has not seen this happen in six years of deployment
over n different instances. So if you are not going to do a research
project digging up some facts around your fantasies, you are just
babbling.

[removed some repetitions]

&gt;&gt;<i> I personally have come to the conclusion that citizen have to decide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whether they want to participate in political decision-making processes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or rather not. Protection against political discrimination is difficult
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to enforce, but luckily it only needs ten thousand people in a LQFB to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already produce much much better governance than Capitol Hill. I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> convinced we can save humanity on planet earth even if only about 1%
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of people care to do politics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again with the delusional. We've had systems like that for thousands
</I>
No, LQFB was first deployed in 2010.

&gt;<i> of years and they don't work precisely because the people who &quot;care to
</I>&gt;<i> do politics&quot; are SDAPs. Their beliefs and their priorities are just
</I>
Again, you are basing your judgement on your prejudices. This is blabber.

&gt;&gt;<i> Oh right. Logical fallacies and classical troll-style ad hominem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attacks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's only ad hominem if it isn't true. You just stated above that
</I>&gt;<i> you're elitist and want the 1% to run the world. To call you out on
</I>
Yeah right, go ahead and interpret BS into things I say.
Populist simplification is your game. You are arguing like Trump.

I'm sorry if the actual way digital democracy does work is not
fitting your ideological expectations. But that only means that
your ideology is broken, not the method that has proven to work.

You are axiomatically rejecting the idea that the temporarily
&quot;anarchically&quot; formed subgroup of people that has a little more
influence on one singular voting event over the disinformed
majority is a problem - when empiric experience and scientific
papers suggest that this is exactly what makes LQFB work.

Your ideological preconceptions are impeding you from making mental
progress, and disturbing everybody of your readers' ability to get
an honest picture of the situation.

I admit that this could be the toughest challenge to all
e-democracy scientists: recognize your axiomatic pre-assumptions
and weed them out if they are wrong.

I guess axiomatic broken prejudice is the only real enemy LQFB has
ever faced. So rare that somebody points out a real weakness that
needs improvement.

&gt;<i> that is fair play. And BTW, I bring up Hitler all the time, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> not an example of Godwin's law because I take the time to tie my
</I>&gt;<i> arguments to the actual behavior of Hitler and Nazis (they're SDAP, of
</I>&gt;<i> course ;-)
</I>
Godwin's law does not credit pseudo-rational argumentation as an
exception to the rule.  :P
