<PRE>Hi Arthur,



thank you for the movie and also for including the picture of (what I believe is) deliberative decision-making in your clip.



As much as I know, metagovernment.org is inactive from January and new site isn't under development. There are groups on social networks, but that is not official. The last active official tool is this mailing list.



We are up to many project in these days. Some developers came back here to talk about their ideas and also when struggling to find some design pattern.
I'm looking into archives to see what projects were active in this year. It is Jacopo Tolja from Airesis.eu , Scott Raney from Matchism.org, Ned Conner and Larry Lart with a lab proposal, Michael Allan from Waymaker, Pietro Speroni from Vilfredo goes to Athens, me, Michal &#352;t&#283;p&#225;nek with Agora Ekklesia.

Anyway, I hope that you will get a reply from other members too, I am sure they have more to say.

Warmly,

Michal &#352;t&#283;p&#225;nek
