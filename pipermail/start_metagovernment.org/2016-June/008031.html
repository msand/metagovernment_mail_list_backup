<PRE>Hi,

this was in previous email, but I think we should cover it as a topic.



 As for the consent, there was one interesting remark, that decision-making in metagovernment should have differnt decision-making method from what we see as optimal in politics. In other words metagovernment is different from politics in some important aspects 

 - it is entirely online, but politics do not need to be (see deliberative democracy) 

 - human needs are mostly absent in metagovernment (see J. W. Burton or Ian Shapiro)

 - size / scale of groups is different

  - metagovernment is full of educated people, nobody will tell you here: take my vote, use it as you like

  - and more



What do you see as optimal decisio-making method for metagovernment?

Do you find it possible to keep decision-making in metagovernment and political decision-making separate?



Imho, here we should discuss our integrity of goals and tools (not to be as Bolsheviks). From my point of view, it is simple. Agora Ekklesia decision-making cannot be used for metagovernment. From my point of view, it is obvious to me that we should use another method in metagovernment.

On the other hand if your method may be used in metagovernment as well as in politics, you may be in a tricky situation. Still I thing you should make difference between metagovernment and politics for the reasons above.



As for me, I propose allourideas.org for decision-making about the metagovernment site.

What do you support?



Cheers

m.
