<PRE>Anthony,

 thank you for your email.

As for metagovernment.org, the wiki is waiting for some member to update the wiki software. The problem is not as much technical as it may seem. I would simply say that there is too little will to resurect the old wiki.

Imho the main problem is the policy of the wiki. Basically, it was easy to create new wiki page and list it on different wiki pages. On the other hand, editing an existing site was quite difficult, because consent was required. So the wiki was bloating with pages that have just a few editors.

As for the consent, there was one interesting remark, that decision-making in metagovernment should have differnt decision-making method from what we see as optimal in politics.

In other words metagovernment is different from politics in some important aspects 

- it is entirely online, but politics do not need to be (see deliberative democracy) 

- human needs are mostly absent in metagovernment (see J. W. Burton or Ian Shapiro)

- size / scale of groups is different

- metagovernment is full of educated people, nobody will tell you here: take my vote, use it as you like

- and more



So here we are. I will better start another email.

Kind regards

Michal

I still can't believe the metagovernance's coalition site's down, someone told me they took it down to make a better one but why couldn't they just build the better version without taking down the existing site? Seems weird

Hi Arthur,



thank you for the movie and also for including the picture of (what I believe is) deliberative decision-making in your clip.



As much as I know, metagovernment.org is inactive from January and new site isn't under development. There are groups on social networks, but that is not official. The last active official tool is this mailing list.



We are up to many project in these days. Some developers came back here to talk about their ideas and also when struggling to find some design pattern.

I'm looking into archives to see what projects were active in this year. It is Jacopo Tolja from Airesis.eu , Scott Raney from Matchism.org, Ned Conner and Larry Lart with a lab proposal, Michael Allan from Waymaker, Pietro Speroni from Vilfredo goes to Athens, me, Michal &#352;t&#283;p&#225;nek with Agora Ekklesia.



Anyway, I hope that you will get a reply from other members too, I am sure they have more to say.



Warmly,



Michal &#352;t&#283;p&#225;nek
