<PRE>No, it all starts with the &quot;Global&quot; BIG PIZZA  in the center. .it contains a
couple of slices.

 

When you click a slice, the &quot;Global&quot; Pizza shrinks and moves to the upper
left and rotates, so that the clicked slice points towards the center, where
a new pizza appears which is details for the clicked one on &quot;Global&quot;.

 

Now you can click a new slice, so the current slice will shrink and move to
the upper left, next to the global pizza. The global pizza will rotate, so
that the &quot;branch&quot; you took on global will now point to the upper left moved
pizza, and the upper left moved pizza where u just clicked on will point
towards the center, where another new pizza appears..

..

You can repeat this process, filling the top row or multiple rows with tiny
pizzas, while the current pizza you are interested in is always at the
center of the screen.

Now if you want to go back to where you started, you could just click on one
of the tiny pizzas which represent your &quot;C:\folder1\folder2\folder3\...&quot; and
instantly the tiny one will go to the center.

Alex, in your example you pick the east pizza-slice a couple of times and
then the south one. What would happen if you pick north, west ...? Will the
pizza be automatically be turned around to east again? But this would
probably make the user loose orientation, about where he is in the whole
tree, wouldnt it?

It's also not perfect regarding accurate drawing, choosing colors that can
be read well because they do not compete with the background color.
There is much room for improvement. The main features are:
1. Shows taken path through the voting-tree (like
c:/programs/votorola/whatever/...)
2. Shows details of focused current node
3. Removes unintuitive abbreviations
4. Reduces visual clutter
5. blablabla ;)

Your idea of the pizza slices, was that to eliminate the complicated lines

in 

the center (above), or in the periphery (attached)?  Or both?

Both :)
 
...

FIRST - (The Ugly Abbreviations) &lt;&lt;

I think a very very important thing is to get rid of the ugly abbreviations
(Bo. No. Rh. Aq. Pa. .....) we might try something like this:
<A HREF="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2009/08/10/mbti-map/">http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2009/08/10/mbti-map/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2007/OntarioElectionViz0.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2007/OntarioElectionViz0.png</A>
Right now, the abbreviations are absolutely meaningless. A person who's
looking at the visualization doesn't know what kind of information to
expect. Why would I want to navigate through the branches? What am I
searching for?
Maybe I'm searching for a branch where I could have more impact if I follow
that branch? ...what's (Bo. No. Rh. Aq. Pa...) all about?
 
 

SECONDLY - (Eagle's Persective) &lt;&lt;

I think the visualization we are talking about right now is more from a
chickens perspective... you navigate through the tree step by step. It's not
easy to see more than 3 or 4 branches at once, because at the moment, the
screen will become way to cluttered to understand the current visualization
with maybe 4 or 5 expanded &quot;nodes&quot;.
So if we also will go for an overview visualization we might try something
like:
<A HREF="http://lip.sourceforge.net/ctreemap.html">http://lip.sourceforge.net/ctreemap.html</A> (circular treemap)
<A HREF="http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/">http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/</A> (treemap)
<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marc_smith/1474524836/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/marc_smith/1474524836/</A> (treemap)
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MLPC_p4.gif">http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MLPC_p4.gif</A> (sunburst diagram)
Another visualization combines circular treemap with crosslinks, but I don't
know if there is use for something like this
<A HREF="http://neoformix.com/2009/TorontoTwitterCommunity.html">http://neoformix.com/2009/TorontoTwitterCommunity.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_1.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_1.png</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_2.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_2.png</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/TwitterEmployeeClusters.jpg">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/TwitterEmployeeClusters.jpg</A>
 
 
 

THIRDLY - (Different Approach) &lt;&lt;

A completely different approach might list all polls in a menu-like-list and
while you hover over the polls, they become highlighted in the main view.
The filled circles attached to each poll will show you the (Bo. No. Rh.....)
and their diameter will tell you how much votes they have donated:
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2008/AuthorLine.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2008/AuthorLine.png</A>
 
 

FOURTHLY - (TAG Approach) &lt;&lt;

The center of a branch could be written like a heading (eg. &quot;America&quot;).
The &quot;child nodes&quot; could be written as weighted TAGs
(eg.states,president,...)
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2008/CloudComparison2.html#SummaryEnd">http://www.neoformix.com/2008/CloudComparison2.html#SummaryEnd</A>
(Clicking a Tag will open a sub branch and the path from root node down to
the current branch could be shown through something like (root:G / p / moo /
Bo. / ...)
But please try to use meaningfull names  like (Global / Polls / Joe's Cow /
Boring Abbreviations / ...)

Thanks Alexander,
 
This drawing of the center came from one of your earlier suggestions:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht</A>
 
I like it.  I think it's faster on the uptake than this one:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht</A>

(Will reply to your other points, soon.  An, Ji, Th, etc. are  people's
names.)

Wow :-)
 
It's getting better and better.
I like the geomap and I also like the bubbles, which tell visitors its 
real people talking and not just bots or something...
 
I still hate the abbreviations (Ge. Fr. An. ...) What's there meaning?
Countries?
Can't we then use flags and tell people the country's name when 
hovering the flag?
(What flag do we use for global  (G.)? Maybe a planet earth icon?) 
Really, I think there must be something done about the annoying 
abbreviations. They really look very nerdy and cryptic to an average 
visitors eye.
 
I like the circles, the cyan navigation highlighting, the numbers and 
the percentages :) I don't like all these lines because I think they 
generate visual clutter and so do the ugly Abbreviations ;)
 
Maybe one could use colored pizza slices, where the intensity of the 
used color indicates the percentage given to the &quot;pizza center&quot; by each

slice.

 
...when a user nagivates through the branches of the tree, the active 
circle maybe should go to the center of the screen while the former 
circles should &quot;fade out&quot; or &quot;shrink&quot; a little ..or both? ...or they 
should auto-move to the top of the screen, creating a &quot;row of circles&quot; 
which are similar to G/p/bla ...
...they would just show the path a user took while navigating through 
several branches of the tree.
