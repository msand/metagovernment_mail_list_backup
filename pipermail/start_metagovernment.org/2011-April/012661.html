<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Concerning the choice of text, I don't like either yours or

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rough agreement.  Otherwise, I feel we're wasting time on

No, I thought we were trying to agree on a decision mechanism for the
main page.  The problem was low participation in G/p/mho, and it got
us thinking: Why would people bother to participate if the main page
is never actually going to change?

So we figured we'd show that we *do* have the capability of changing
it.  That was mostly your idea, if I recall.

So no, I honestly don't see it.  It's not clear to me why we're
opening up the conundrum of how a democracy legitimates itself.  It's
a tricky question and I doubt we can answer it through formal rules.
Meantime, the main-page issue is still suffering for lack of
participation.  I think we lost sight of that.  (I don't mean to imply
that the metaquestion is unimportant, only that it's not the immediate
problem.)

&gt;<i> &gt; As my teacher used to say: KISS, keep it simple students, ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! Lets finish the problem with just one poll instead of
</I>&gt;<i> 100.000. ;-)
</I>
Seriously, we only need 1 poll.  G/p/m00 is fine.

Suppose it's not an issue of the main page, but some real-world issue.
People are in danger somewhere.  They need help but nobody is trying
to help them because nobody believes we actually have the capability.
Our first attempt will be when the main page actually changes.  The
clock is ticking.

That's not the case ofc, but it offers a refreshing perspective.  To
avoid getting lost in distractions and tangles, I feel we should a)
focus on the issue at hand and b) express our proposals in short,
simple form (at least till we agree on the basic rule):

Or is there a faster way?
