<PRE>Thomas, I posted a link at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#von_der_Elbe">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#von_der_Elbe</A>
However, I'm not sure how else I might contribute.  It seems to me the next
step might be to render your plan in StratML Part 2 format, so that
&lt;PerformanceIndicator&gt;s and &lt;Stakeholder&gt;&lt;Role&gt;s can be documented (i.e.,
how progress will be measured and who will be responsible for each
performance indicator).  Andre Cusson's XForms form
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.hyperbase.com/xml/cosmos/resource/apps/stratedit.xml">http://www.hyperbase.com/xml/cosmos/resource/apps/stratedit.xml</A>&gt;  could be
used to do that.

 

If you want to attract more attention, more folks might be interested in
providing feedback on a plan like this one:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRR-FinalwStyle.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRR-FinalwStyle.xml</A>  Or, somewhat less
controversially, this one:  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/25PPwStyle.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/25PPwStyle.xml</A> 

 

I responded to Ed off the list and defer to him on whether my comments on
his proposal are worth sharing with the group.

@ Ed:




I don't want to get overly complex, but perhaps it would be reasonable to
use some more complex math than simple counting or percentages.

 

For example, how defining consensus (C) as:

( X * (P+2) ) - 1, rounded up.

 

where P = the number of people voting,

and X = a variable set by the software, defaulting to 0.8.

 

Therefore, for X = 0.8...

For 1 person, C is equal to 2. (i.e., impossible)

For 2 people, C is equal to 3. (i.e., impossible)

For 3 through 7 people, C is equal to P. (i.e. 100%).

For 8 people, C is equal to 7.

For 20 people, C is equal to 17

For 100 people, C is equal to 81.

For very large numbers of people, C is basically equal to 80% of P.

 

In other words, the standard is, roughly:

Impossible for one or two people. Complete consensus for small numbers of
people. Near-consensus for intermediate groups. And 80% (or X) for large
groups.


Wow! I like this! Its flexibility perfectly fits with my feeling of how it
should be in large vs. small groups.




If I am considering changes to my proposal, then is it appropriate for me to
change my current proposal, which already has votes for it? 


Yes, please change your current proposal! I think a note above the text
would be helpful like &quot;This draft is still (always) under developement
(improvement). Please add it to your watchlist to get informed about
changes!&quot;

@ Owen:

&gt;<i>Thomas, where can I see goals and objectives documented in StratML format
</I>on which &gt;feedback can be provided via a Metagov application(s)?

My picture is the following: Projects continue to put their goals,
objectives, etc. into StratML documents and publish them as they do already
now. What is new now is the possibility to get feedback. For that they open
a poll where everybody can suggest, i.e. draft improved versions of the
objectives, ... These are going to be very fluid, changing all the time. One
wouldnt necessarily want to have these suggestions themself in the technical
format of StratML, which AFAIK is more solid, fixed. But their content
should be structured in the StratML-fashion already. So only after through a
decision mechanism it has become clear, that a specific improvement should
be adopted, then the original (one official) StratML document of the project
gets changed. 

Here is an example. It links to the official StratML document, it is
structured like it, but it can change all the time. The people voting for
it, can also have slightly different versions of it and so on: 

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp</A>

If enough people reach consensus about how the official version should be
improved, that the original StratML document gets changed. What do you
think?

Thomas
