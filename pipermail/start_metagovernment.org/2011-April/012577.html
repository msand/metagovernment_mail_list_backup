<PRE>Alex,
if we know what the options are, then we should not use those tools
which are being developed for open questions, but we should instead
use tools for closed question. Namely voting theory.

I don't see why so far no one has suggested, once all the options has
been decided to set up a condercet voting among them, and just pick
the winner. Better than majority voting, and better than using only
the consensus (or requiring an 80% wide majority).

My suggestion only work for some situations, for example in Vilfredo
we want to have a picture of the relevant element of a situation,
taking away as much irrelevant information as possible. Telling you
that there were two agreements important on this, and reading what
people have voted can be good to decide what to do. In Vilfredo that
works because people then are asked to write new proposals, and the
historical records help them in writing those proposals.

In a wiki page you can also put the possible options side by side, or
one above the other. Does this sound like giving to a person that
arrive the image of a divided group? Good! Because this is exactly
what we would be.

Of course if we are speaking about a law, with mutually exclusive
options this is not possible. But then again, you can also have
situation where multiple laws, even mutually exclusive are in place.
Consider how when you go abroad you are subject to your homecountry
law as well as the local law. ANd this is the same for other people to
the point where different people are thus subject to different laws.
Sometimes you will need to take the stricter law.
