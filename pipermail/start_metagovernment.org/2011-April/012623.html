&gt;&gt;<i> ... (BTW, is sorting of voters by number of votes like in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> current vote-space theoretically still possible or not?)...
</I>&gt;<i> No.  A single shift in a leaf might have a massive effect on the
</I>&gt;<i> layout of the tree.  We require a stable layout.
</I>
Ok. But in the rarer cases, where a voter reaches the top20 of his 
candidates voters he would replace the former 20. voter, right? BTW, 
will we have a place for &quot;others&quot; in the circle too, i.e. voter 21, 
voter 22, ... and one for &quot;me&quot; if I'm not among the top20?

Another thing: I feel, it might be better to give the positions not 
according to the name of the voter. The only advantage I see, the easy 
recognition across different polls, will probably not work many times, 
because the places will be taken. Then people might even give up to look 
for him, because they think, he always has to be the &quot;south-guy&quot;. If we 
give this up, we can give the first voters always the positions 
rectangular to the tangente of the circle, which looks more beautiful 
imo. And if they grow in number, they open up to half a circle, like a 
flower. :-) Also it looks more like real people: if they want to talk to 
their candidate, they will all try to be in front of his face, as long 
as there is room there. And then I would stick to the rule, The_User has 
proposed: if a voter withdraws his vote, leave the position open for his 
return until all others are taken. What do you think?
