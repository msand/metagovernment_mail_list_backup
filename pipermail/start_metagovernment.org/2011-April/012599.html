<PRE>Hi guys:  I'm working on a couple of things, and would like your advice.

I'm applying to do a 4 year Phd starting this September, and need to formulate more clearly the topic of the research. My hope is that this research topic can be phrased in such a way as to be useful to the efforts of this group.

The proposal as it stands is to research &quot;augmented decision making spaces&quot;. I am particularly interested in the following aspects:

  1) The physical (theatrical) interface, within which groups meet and how these connected spaces can be made to embrace a full range of participants and expressed human values.

  2) The legal aspects of the technical language that these spaces are programmed in. How to both democratise the underlying technology and make the decisions legally binding.

  3) Longitudinal studies. To establish a research paradigm based on real world effects of democratic methodologies on long term group behaviour.

Those are my thoughts at the moment. I've not been accepted yet, and the first year of study is designed to help define the subsequent research topic - any thoughts with regards what would be most useful?

</PRE>
