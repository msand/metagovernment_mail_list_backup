Thanks Jens.  My library has a copy, I'll pick it up.  It looks well
written.

&gt;<i> This doesn't really ease my thoughts about developing the theory,
</I>&gt;<i> but I'm somewhat excited about the unexplored aspects here. To me
</I>&gt;<i> though it's pretty obvious to connect the deliberate ideas and the
</I>&gt;<i> more general notion of &quot;network&quot; democracy (here: proxy voting) with
</I>&gt;<i> an institutional setup, since some of these brilliant thoughts needs
</I>&gt;<i> to be fleshed out somewhere. Your attempt in your very interesting

</I>&gt;<i> the specific, tecnical aspects. The section about communicative
</I>&gt;<i> compositions particularly invoked my interest. I've been thinking a
</I>&gt;<i> lot about the practical aspects of deliberation, but your ideas of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cascading contribution&quot; really makes sense. Thanks for showing me
</I>&gt;<i> this :)

You're welcome!

I don't mean to ignore connections with state institutions.  I only
mean that the existing institutions are probably well enough
structured and sufficiently adaptable to handle the connections, once
we're ready to offer them.

&gt;<i> ... Hopefully this will happen soon. As political scientists I
</I>&gt;<i> really think we have an obligation to probe these regions with (in
</I>&gt;<i> my opinion) such a great potential. Even though it may seem
</I>&gt;<i> challenging. Hopefully my attempts will help shred some light on
</I>&gt;<i> this, although I wouldn't get my hopes up - there is so much
</I>&gt;<i> literature here. But again, thanks for taking your time to guide me.
</I>
It's an encouraging sign that ordinary people, such as us, feel we can
talk with some authority about such extraordinary things.  Not to
mention, it's a pleasure. :-)  If this is a pattern for the future,
then I feel we're on the right track.
