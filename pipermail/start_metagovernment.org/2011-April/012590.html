<PRE>Thanks, Owen. I think all of your suggestions make a lot of sense.  
I'll see if I can work the math, but I'm not sure if I have the time.

Pietro... seeing as you have a PhD in Mathematics, perhaps you'd like  
to chime in here... :)

&gt;<i> Interesting proposal, Ed.   I wish it applied to Congress.

</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me no time limits should be applied to voting, at least  
</I>&gt;<i> not initially, but that the pool of eligible voters should be able  
</I>&gt;<i> easily to determine when their votes (positive or negative) may  
</I>&gt;<i> begin to &#8220;count&#8221; (make a difference), such as:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a)      When 3 to 7 people have voted for a proposal, and
</I>&gt;<i> b)      Whenever the percentage of votes in support of a proposal is  
</I>&gt;<i> near (just below or just above) 80%.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under those circumstances, I doubt any time limit would be necessary  
</I>&gt;<i> to motivate individuals to vote on issues about which they care &#8211;  
</I>&gt;<i> unless the number of proposals is large enough to create an burden  
</I>&gt;<i> on voters.  However, if that proves to be the case, I suspect that  
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient numbers might vote negatively on most issues, in protest  
</I>&gt;<i> of being so burdened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively, they may wish to impose a new rule raising the degree  
</I>&gt;<i> of support required to more than 80%.   Perhaps the percentage  
</I>&gt;<i> should automatically increase as the number of proposals rises, to  
</I>&gt;<i> account for the burden that is implicit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, perhaps time limits should be applied when the required degree  
</I>&gt;<i> of agreement has been reached, before proposals are considered to be  
</I>&gt;<i> approved, and perhaps those limits should be inverse to the degree  
</I>&gt;<i> of agreement on each proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those thoughts prompt this further thought:   How about enabling  
</I>&gt;<i> voters to condition their votes upon the actions of others?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, for some proposals that I personally oppose, I might be  
</I>&gt;<i> willing to accept a level of 80% support among other voters, whereas  
</I>&gt;<i> I might insist upon a higher or accept a lower percentage for other  
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.  And I might be willing to accept a proposal that has 90%  
</I>&gt;<i> approval sooner (in less time) than one that has 80%.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, too, there is the case of greatest interest to me, in  
</I>&gt;<i> which those who favor an objective are willing and able to  
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish it by applying their own resources and efforts, in which  
</I>&gt;<i> case I may vote for it even though I don&#8217;t plan to contribute to  
</I>&gt;<i> it.   At least I would not vote against it unless I believe that it  
</I>&gt;<i> might be harmful to me or others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be similar to the concept of &#8220;challenge&#8221; grants, whereby  
</I>&gt;<i> one or more parties pledge to match resources provided by others.   
</I>&gt;<i> For example, I might be willing to match the average monetary  
</I>&gt;<i> contribution of others to develop and support an application  
</I>&gt;<i> enabling users to do likewise with respect to other objectives  
</I>&gt;<i> openly documented on the Web in StratML format.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does not interest me much, if any, is voting just for the sake  
</I>&gt;<i> of voting, i.e., without any understanding, much less commitment to  
</I>&gt;<i> see that the resources necessary to achieve the objective might  
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably be applied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, if your proposal is implemented in a working system, I&#8217;d be  
</I>&gt;<i> supportive of establishing an objective to try to recruit 100 people  
</I>&gt;<i> to participate in testing it.

</I>&gt;<i> Just to be clear, that's not specifically what I want. My objection  
</I>&gt;<i> was to the other proposals, so I encoded the status quo as my  
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. But I also pointed out that I didn't think it was the best  
</I>&gt;<i> answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't want to get overly complex, but perhaps it would be  
</I>&gt;<i> reasonable to use some more complex math than simple counting or  
</I>&gt;<i> percentages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, how defining consensus (C) as:
</I>&gt;<i> ( X * (P+2) ) - 1, rounded up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where P = the number of people voting,
</I>&gt;<i> and X = a variable set by the software, defaulting to 0.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, for X = 0.8...
</I>&gt;<i> For 1 person, C is equal to 2. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> For 2 people, C is equal to 3. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> For 3 through 7 people, C is equal to P. (i.e. 100%).
</I>&gt;<i> For 8 people, C is equal to 7.
</I>&gt;<i> For 20 people, C is equal to 17
</I>&gt;<i> For 100 people, C is equal to 81.
</I>&gt;<i> For very large numbers of people, C is basically equal to 80% of P.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, the standard is, roughly:
</I>&gt;<i> Impossible for one or two people. Complete consensus for small  
</I>&gt;<i> numbers of people. Near-consensus for intermediate groups. And 80%  
</I>&gt;<i> (or X) for large groups.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I am considering changes to my proposal, then is it appropriate

</I>&gt;<i> Alternately, a rule like the above could be applied to the amount of
