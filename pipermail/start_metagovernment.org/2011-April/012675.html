<PRE>I made a small example...
...its about &quot;pizza slices&quot; and about getting &quot;rid of abbreviations&quot; and
about &quot;chicken perspective&quot;, but not about all the stuff I've given in the
example URL's of my previous message to this mailinglist.

It's also not perfect regarding accurate drawing, choosing colors that can
be read well because they do not compete with the background color.
There is much room for improvement. The main features are:
1. Shows taken path through the voting-tree (like
c:/programs/votorola/whatever/...)
2. Shows details of focused current node
3. Removes unintuitive abbreviations
4. Reduces visual clutter
5. blablabla ;)

&gt;<i> Your idea of the pizza slices, was that to eliminate the complicated lines
</I>in 
&gt;<i> the center (above), or in the periphery (attached)?  Or both?
</I>Both :)

...
&gt;&gt;<i> FIRST - (The Ugly Abbreviations) &lt;&lt;
</I>I think a very very important thing is to get rid of the ugly abbreviations
(Bo. No. Rh. Aq. Pa. .....) we might try something like this:
<A HREF="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2009/08/10/mbti-map/">http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2009/08/10/mbti-map/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2007/OntarioElectionViz0.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2007/OntarioElectionViz0.png</A>
Right now, the abbreviations are absolutely meaningless. A person who's
looking at the visualization doesn't know what kind of information to
expect. Why would I want to navigate through the branches? What am I
searching for?
Maybe I'm searching for a branch where I could have more impact if I follow
that branch? ...what's (Bo. No. Rh. Aq. Pa...) all about?


&gt;&gt;<i> SECONDLY - (Eagle's Persective) &lt;&lt;
</I>I think the visualization we are talking about right now is more from a
chickens perspective... you navigate through the tree step by step. It's not
easy to see more than 3 or 4 branches at once, because at the moment, the
screen will become way to cluttered to understand the current visualization
with maybe 4 or 5 expanded &quot;nodes&quot;.
So if we also will go for an overview visualization we might try something
like:
<A HREF="http://lip.sourceforge.net/ctreemap.html">http://lip.sourceforge.net/ctreemap.html</A> (circular treemap)
<A HREF="http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/">http://bund.offenerhaushalt.de/</A> (treemap)
<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marc_smith/1474524836/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/marc_smith/1474524836/</A> (treemap)
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MLPC_p4.gif">http://www.neoformix.com/2006/MLPC_p4.gif</A> (sunburst diagram)
Another visualization combines circular treemap with crosslinks, but I don't
know if there is use for something like this
<A HREF="http://neoformix.com/2009/TorontoTwitterCommunity.html">http://neoformix.com/2009/TorontoTwitterCommunity.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_1.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_1.png</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_2.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/ttcs_2.png</A>
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2009/TwitterEmployeeClusters.jpg">http://www.neoformix.com/2009/TwitterEmployeeClusters.jpg</A>



&gt;&gt;<i> THIRDLY - (Different Approach) &lt;&lt;
</I>A completely different approach might list all polls in a menu-like-list and
while you hover over the polls, they become highlighted in the main view.
The filled circles attached to each poll will show you the (Bo. No. Rh.....)
and their diameter will tell you how much votes they have donated:
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2008/AuthorLine.png">http://www.neoformix.com/2008/AuthorLine.png</A>


&gt;&gt;<i> FOURTHLY - (TAG Approach) &lt;&lt;
</I>The center of a branch could be written like a heading (eg. &quot;America&quot;).
The &quot;child nodes&quot; could be written as weighted TAGs
(eg.states,president,...)
<A HREF="http://www.neoformix.com/2008/CloudComparison2.html#SummaryEnd">http://www.neoformix.com/2008/CloudComparison2.html#SummaryEnd</A>
(Clicking a Tag will open a sub branch and the path from root node down to
the current branch could be shown through something like (root:G / p / moo /
Bo. / ...)
But please try to use meaningfull names  like (Global / Polls / Joe's Cow /
Boring Abbreviations / ...)

Thanks Alexander,

This drawing of the center came from one of your earlier suggestions:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht</A>

I like it.  I think it's faster on the uptake than this one:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht</A>

Your idea of the pizza slices, was that to eliminate the complicated lines
in the center (above), or in the periphery (attached)?  Or both?

(Will reply to your other points, soon.  An, Ji, Th, etc. are  people's
names.)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe one could use colored pizza slices, where the intensity of the

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...when a user nagivates through the branches of the tree, the active

</I>&gt;<i> circles should &quot;fade out&quot; or &quot;shrink&quot; a little ..or both? ...or they 
</I>&gt;<i> should auto-move to the top of the screen, creating a &quot;row of circles&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> which are similar to G/p/bla ...
</I>&gt;<i> ...they would just show the path a user took while navigating through 
</I>&gt;<i> several branches of the tree.
