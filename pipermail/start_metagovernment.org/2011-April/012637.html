<PRE>Welcome, Matteo!

The idea of setting up a bulletin board has been brought up  
frequently, and at our last meeting we agreed to get one set up. There  
are just some technical and temporal hurdles to getting it done. We  
are in the process of migrating to a new hosting service, and I  
haven't had the time to work out the order of events to best effect a  
smooth transition. I'd of course like the new BB to be on the new  
host, instead of having to migrate it. I have updated my Upgrade  
Backlog to better reflect reality:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Upgrade_backlog</A>

Personally, I don't like phpBB very much at all. I think it is rather  
primitive, despite having such a large development community and  
userbase. Mat&#237;as did some research and suggested Vanilla or Phorum. I  
previously had suggested Vanilla (because it is highly flexible, and  
probably can be easily integrated into other systems later), so I  
would like to start by considering that one. I'd love to hear what  
others think...

</I>&gt;<i> This forum is a good one for people to join and discuss, as there

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.phpbb.com/community/">http://www.phpbb.com/community/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It would then be easier to look for posts in the past, add images  
</I>&gt;<i> and HTML pages, evn movies, etc. and it would be easier for people  
</I>&gt;<i> to discuss.
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to give my help in this, while of course the property  
</I>&gt;<i> and location of the forum will remain where it is now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If possible, I would like to receive a feedback on this idea
</I>&gt;<i>
