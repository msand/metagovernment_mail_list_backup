</I>&gt;<i> other words, something on the order of a hashtag, where the
</I>&gt;<i> connections are made by the users, regardless of the underlying
</I>&gt;<i> structure.
</I>
We could begin at the page that defines the governance issue.
For example: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00</A>

&gt;<i>From there we could point to the equivalent issue(s) in Facebook using
</I>semantic properties.  Vote-servers could read these properties and
automatically copy the relevant Facebook votes for verification and
inclusion in aggregate counts.  This is vote mirroring.  It would
require only that Facebook post its issues and votes in public where
we can copy them, e.g. by Web scraping.  (Not sure they do that, yet.)

&gt;<i> &gt; On the other hand, they might still manage to attract lots of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users.  Not all of them would remain 100% satisfied, of course,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and some might even stir up trouble for the company.  We could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe take some of the pressure off by offering connections to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alternative toolsets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a lot of potential there. People may start out on Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> because that's what they know, but when they find that they have
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of answers and a simplistic voting system, they may start
</I>&gt;<i> looking outward for something more robust. The Crossforum should
</I>&gt;<i> allow them to easily migrate the discussion to a more robust
</I>&gt;<i> platform without necessarily losing all of the initial input (nor
</I>&gt;<i> the social publicity, which is not to be undervalued).
</I>
Yes, it's part of the beauty of vote mirroring.  It's compatible with
all possible voting methods and formats (past and future) and fully
preserves their unique advantages and peculiarities.  Kudos to Thomas.

Crossforum theatre should be a good place to display all that variety.
