I don't think it would be overly ambitious, though it might pan out as
more of an exchange than a simple subsumption.  They have a
rudimentary voting facility that doesn't easily dovetail with other
media, such as drafting or discussion - not to mention other voting
facilities.  So they won't likely be strong on that front.  We could
maybe show them a thing or two.

On the other hand, they might still manage to attract lots of users.
Not all of them would remain 100% satisfied, of course, and some might
even stir up trouble for the company.  We could maybe take some of the
pressure off by offering connections to alternative toolsets.

There could be gains all round.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In an action that might prove to be the biggest revolution in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-gov in the last 10 years facebook made a tiny change that might have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; huge consequences.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It added the possibility for people to ask questions, and to keep the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; poll open for answers (even as a default! -This is so important-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is an image of it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not only but the question can go viral. Your friend can follow it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which probably amounts to share it?), and it is very clear that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everybody on facebook could answer it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We wanted to do something similar with Vilfredo on FB, but FB was  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faster.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The next days will be vital to understand how the new tool will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used. I invite everybody who has a FB account to test the system. Ask
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions, ask open questions, ask about the future, about what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; politicians should do, and see who answers, see how they spread.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know many people here don't like facebook, but we want it or not, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is here, and it is here to stay. We will have to consider it in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programs. For example it is pretty useless to rebuild a system that is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; basically just doing the same thing.
