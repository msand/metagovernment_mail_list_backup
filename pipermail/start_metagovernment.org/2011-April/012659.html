<PRE>Is it possible to integrate the forum with the mailinglist? (HTML
Mailinglist?)

I'd like to view new postings or topics within my email program, but would
be great if I can see the forum within the mail from the mailinglist.

I often made the experience that I forget to subscribe to topics or other
stuff on the forum and would like to automatically get everything that's on
the forum.

.would be great to answer to topics by clicking buttons within the email and
sending emails to the list will automatically add the answer to the topic .

.never saw such a thing, but it would combine the good stuff of both worlds.

Forums are more structured

Email is my everyday inbox without the need to go to a special website or
without subscribing to topics every time someone starts something :)

I agree with Ed.

 

We need a Forum, but it should be integrated and inside metagovernment.org.

I'm not opposed to an external forum, but we do have hosting resources. Also
there are some things I'd really like to see in a forum, such as:

- unified login with mediawiki and/or openid

- e-mail capabilities to integrate with this list or to supplant it

- simplicity but robustness

 

Matteo, if you can be a little patient, give me a week to see if I can get
it done. I'll try to find the time to get something set up on the tuxfamily
site.

 

Alternately, if you or someone else wants to be the co-admin, I think I or
Michael can get them set up on the tuxfamily site without necessarily giving
them destroy privileges. If we build the forum at /forum, hopefully we can
later just migrate the domain name without significant trouble.

 

As for forum software, I have been leaning toward Vanilla, but after a brief
recent review, I suspect phorum might be more capable. Namely one or both of
these for my second point above:

<A HREF="http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,143310,143310#msg-143310">http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,143310,143310#msg-143310</A>

<A HREF="http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,129244,129244#msg-129244">http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,129244,129244#msg-129244</A>

 

That's all the time I have for now to evaluate, so others please comment on
possible features and/or possible software packages to meet the feature
requirements.

I have read with some interest that there have been at least two positive
replies to the idea of setting up a discussion forum on the metagovernment
site.

It looks however that this may take some time, so I suggest I can set up the
forum by myself, and then link it at an address of the metagovernment site
when ready.

The forum structure should be done as people here want, and the forum should
be open to all people interested in discussion about internet government for
exchanging opinions and broaden the discussion base among people.

What do you think about this idea?

 

Matteo
