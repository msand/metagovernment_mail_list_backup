But you want to keep the footings in the drafting medium anyway, dont 
you? I do. And if yes, I'd like it as conviniant as possible. Default 
would be the tool-menue open (nobody needs the left wiki-menue anyway) 
so almost no added complexity. Its not a top-priority, but I imagined it 
to be relly easy to do.

</I>
Yes, it doesnt bring it back, because it shows the footprint of 4c. 
then, which equals no footprint. Thats perfectly logical!

&gt;<i> If I'd done that in the first place, you
</I>&gt;<i> would never have noticed. ;-)
</I>
Maybe I would have, because it costs time to search for the one fixed 
user, after I browsed through all the different footprints (through 
hovering) and then wanted to get rid of them again and look at the 
original text ... the text of 4c. Its very intuitive to click on 4c if I 
want to see 4c.
