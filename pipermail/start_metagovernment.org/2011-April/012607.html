&gt;<i> The radial layout is Thomas's idea.  The angle for each voter will be
</I>&gt;<i> calculated from an alphabetical hash of the username (poorly simulated
</I>&gt;<i> here by random numbers).  So if a voter withdrew his vote, then he'd
</I>&gt;<i> vanish from the tree, but there'd be no other effect on the vote
</I>&gt;<i> structure.  This kind of stability is required in order to support
</I>&gt;<i> rapid animation across historical vote structures, e.g. when sliding
</I>&gt;<i> time controls backward and foreward.
</I>
Mike, this thing here made me thinking: <A HREF="http://debategraph.org/home">http://debategraph.org/home</A>
It does change all the time, but it also very fast opens up a new node. 
If the time control was sliding backwards 20 events and it would 
directly jump to it and not show the ones in between, it should work, or 
not?

Then, to have a fixed angle per person has the clear advantage of being 
easy to recognise even after other things changed. But a disadvantage is 
the overlapping. Now the old tree-map did also change in case of vote 
shifts, couldnt it be possible here too? And have all voters in a circle 
with the same distance to each other ... sorted by number of votes?

Then, with this space around each voter, when climbing one node up in 
the tree, it would not need to overlap others anymore too. It could just 
zoom into the map. So like you suggested before, have all (millions) 
voters visible in the first picture already, only that they be very tiny 
the further away from the endcandidate. And to really see them one would 
have to zoom in. Always a circle of voters around each voter, but the 
circle most far up in one branch would not even touch the circles of the 
neighbours branch. It would be really 2-dimensional whereas the current 
proposal is semi-3-dimensional.

&gt;<i> Myself, I'm starting to think that the inverse video in the theatre
</I>&gt;<i> app could be a mistake.  It could cause us trouble in future: hard on
</I>&gt;<i> the eyes; hard to ensure that a faded background graphic is still
</I>&gt;<i> visible across all hardware.
</I>
By &quot;inverse video&quot; you mean the ability to slide the time contral 
backwards? I think this is very very useful, isnt it?

Thomas
