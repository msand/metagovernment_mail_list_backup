&gt;<i> +1 Matteo, a prize could give us a real boost.

</I>&gt;<i> One possible problem: Setting a specific task might not mesh well with
</I>&gt;<i> free software.  Ordinarily developers are free to do their own thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the judges (whoever they are) could decide not only the
</I>&gt;<i> recipient of the prize, but also the reason.  (Like with the Nobel
</I>&gt;<i> committee, for example, they don't set a target in advance.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A suggestion: Float the award mechanism - the rules about how the
</I>&gt;<i> prize is awarded - as a poll to which everyone is invited.  That way
</I>&gt;<i> the prize money could do double duty, attracting not only developers
</I>&gt;<i> but also users (and with that, possibly more prize money).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Thomas, don't restict it to Votorola developers.  I
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't even restrict it to developers.  There are many ways to help
</I>&gt;<i> - present case in point - and we need good people of all kinds. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very promising!
