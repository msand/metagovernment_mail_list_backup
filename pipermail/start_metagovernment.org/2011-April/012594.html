<PRE>Hey Thomas and Ed,

&gt;<i> @ Ed:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't want to get overly complex, but perhaps it would be reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use some more complex math than simple counting or percentages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, how defining consensus (C) as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ( X * (P+2) ) - 1, rounded up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where P = the number of people voting,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and X = a variable set by the software, defaulting to 0.8.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore, for X = 0.8...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 1 person, C is equal to 2. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 2 people, C is equal to 3. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 3 through 7 people, C is equal to P. (i.e. 100%).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 8 people, C is equal to 7.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 20 people, C is equal to 17
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For 100 people, C is equal to 81.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For very large numbers of people, C is basically equal to 80% of P.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In other words, the standard is, roughly:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Impossible for one or two people. Complete consensus for small numbers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of people. Near-consensus for intermediate groups. And 80% (or X) for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; large groups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wow! I like this! Its flexibility perfectly fits with my feeling of how
</I>&gt;<i> it should be in large vs. small groups.
</I>
I have incorporated that formula in the rule set as well as formalized it a 
bit more to remove redundant wording. There was also a bug in they saying 
&quot;stood for waiting period&quot;, which also allows the case where there have been 
no objections in the past for that waiting period, but they have risen lately 
before the change has been applied (assuming it does not happen 
automatically). If it is about to happen automatically then we have to reflect 
that.

Thomas, could you please patch it and adjust it?

If you have any proposals already, Ed, then you can tell them Thomas now, so 
we can get to a consensus quicker after patching upwards.
