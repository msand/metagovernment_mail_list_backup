<PRE>Mike, you are right, it is all not important! And we can all leave it 
for later. I (as a non-tech) had the idea, that it would take much less 
time to implement, than we already spend talking about it. If I was 
wrong, than lets leave it!

If not here are my answers:
&gt;&gt;<i> But you want to keep the footings in the drafting medium anyway,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dont you? I do. And if yes, I'd like it as conviniant as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible. Default would be the tool-menue open (nobody needs the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> left wiki-menue anyway) so almost no added complexity. Its not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> top-priority, but I imagined it to be relly easy to do.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't mean to dismiss your proposal, especially not lightly.  To
</I>&gt;<i> explain why I think it's not easy and to debate the alternatives will
</I>&gt;<i> take energy.  I need to understand the problem behind the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> that motivates it, so I can gauge its importance.  Although we
</I>&gt;<i> urgently need 2-3 alpha users, and for that reason I'm mostly
</I>&gt;<i> interested in problems related to participation, it's not an
</I>&gt;<i> *exclusive* interest.  We can discuss other problems, too.  But in
</I>&gt;<i> this case, what is the particular problem?
</I>
The problem was described several times by you too. The problem is the 
little space available for the nav-thing. With more space, the names 
could be longer, co-voters could be displayed too, maybe a draft-button 
could be beside each name ...


&gt;&gt;<i> ... after I browsed through all the different footprints (through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hovering) and then wanted to get rid of them again and look at the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original text ... the text of 4c. Its very intuitive to click on 4c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if I want to see 4c.
</I>&gt;<i> Is there is a problem here, too?  Are you saying it's difficult to get
</I>&gt;<i> rid of a footprint, once displayed?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Test-bg-ZeleaCom/G/p/sandbox">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Test-bg-ZeleaCom/G/p/sandbox</A>
</I>&gt;<i> If you click on T4, it shows a footprint.  To remove the footprint,
</I>&gt;<i> either:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * Click again on T4.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Press the back button.
</I>&gt;<i>    * Press the backspace key.
</I>
I am aware of these 3 and wanted to add a forth as a small improvement, 
to make it even more easier. Nothing big or important.

And I felt it would be good to be able to hover over &quot;My&quot; and see my 
footings in the text, e.g. in the case, that I am in a different tree 
atm. Again, nothing big, I just thought it would be a small improvement 
with very little cost. And those sorts of little things also make it a 
little bit easier for alpha-testers. But if you disagree about the 
usefulness, lets move on and leave all this for later.
