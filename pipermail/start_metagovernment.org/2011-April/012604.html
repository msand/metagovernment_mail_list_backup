<PRE>Hi David,

if I were to go back to political sciences, I would concentrate on the 
question, how mass-participation can become meaningful via 
internet-technology. Because (as you know) this is the very core-problem 
of direct democracy and it being unsolved is the only legitimate reason 
for pure representative democracy.
This would be the most fascinating question for me. I would then look at 
the proposed solutions so far and really examine them theoretically 
about their ability to enable meaningful collaboration of millions of 
users.

Thomas

&gt;<i> Hi guys:  I'm working on a couple of things, and would like your advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm applying to do a 4 year Phd starting this September, and need to formulate more clearly the topic of the research. My hope is that this research topic can be phrased in such a way as to be useful to the efforts of this group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal as it stands is to research &quot;augmented decision making spaces&quot;. I am particularly interested in the following aspects:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1) The physical (theatrical) interface, within which groups meet and how these connected spaces can be made to embrace a full range of participants and expressed human values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    2) The legal aspects of the technical language that these spaces are programmed in. How to both democratise the underlying technology and make the decisions legally binding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    3) Longitudinal studies. To establish a research paradigm based on real world effects of democratic methodologies on long term group behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Those are my thoughts at the moment. I've not been accepted yet, and the first year of study is designed to help define the subsequent research topic - any thoughts with regards what would be most useful?
