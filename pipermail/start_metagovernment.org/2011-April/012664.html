That was my intention in posting the links to phorum extensions. There  
are two which could be applicable.

<A HREF="http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,129244,129244#msg-129244">http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,129244,129244#msg-129244</A>
transcribes posts on the forum into a mailing list. That would allow  
all posts on the forum to pipe into the list.

<A HREF="http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,143310,143310#msg-143310">http://www.phorum.org/phorum5/read.php?62,143310,143310#msg-143310</A>
allows users to subscribe to all new messages or only to new threads.  
I think it might allow users to subscribe only to particular sections  
of the forum as well.

Both of those have plusses and minuses. The first one preserves the  
list as the center of the community, but it might get rather  
overwhelming. There are options inside of Mailman (the list software)  
which might allow us to segment input into it and thus allow people to  
unsubscribe from sections or threads while keeping subscribed to the  
whole list. That would take some research. If someone wants to look  
into it, I think it is &quot;umbrella lists&quot; in Mailman.

The second one is more granular (though more complex to setup, I  
think), but it operates entirely outside of the list. Then we have  
fragmentation of discussions, some on-list, some off.

Then... there may be other phorum modules, and of course there are  
loads and loads of other BB applications, each with their own modules,  
each with their own ups and downs.

So it would help to go through some more and see if anything else  
might provide a more robust solution. I just don't have time at the  
moment.

I would also very much like to see some sort of login unification.  
OpenID would be ideal, since I hope to get the wiki onto OpenID at  
some point.
