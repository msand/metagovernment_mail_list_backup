<PRE>Hey guys,

I like mockup II very much! If this is possible to code, then we will 
have something very impressive, I feel!
How do you think: if we climb up the tree, does the map pan the new node 
into the centre of the screen? It must, right? Because it may happen, 
that you go south 5 levels. Thats too much for the screen then, right?

With panning we can create (use) endless amounts of space. We 
theoretically wouldnt even need to overlap at all (like currently in the 
picture linked above). The smaller angle for the 20 voters of Fr. could 
be compensated with a longer radius. ... just to mention.

Another version of creating endless amount of space would be zoom, 
though. With it something like here becomes possible too, i.e. full 
circles of sub-voters, right?:

<A HREF="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project_details.cfm?id=744&amp;index=744&amp;domain=">http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/project_details.cfm?id=744&amp;index=744&amp;domain=</A>

One would just zoom in deeper and deeper. And like in this picuture and 
like proposed before by The_User in the chat, we could have 2 circles 
around the centre, which would give us even more space. Would voters 
feel bad, if they were positioned in the second row for no obvious 
reason? (BTW, is sorting of voters by number of votes like in the 
current vote-space theoretically still possible or not?)
But with the zoom we would loose some of the oversight, or not?
Just an idea, I dont know, what is better. What do you think?

&gt;<i> A poster in #metagov (The User) came up with a similar idea.

</I>&gt;<i>      In addition, he suggested reserving abandoned slots in case their
</I>&gt;<i>      voters return.
</I>
Yes, perfect!
