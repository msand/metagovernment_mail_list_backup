<PRE>Ok, I agree, that rank is pretty unimportant. Especially up the tree. 
Would it be possible to have only the first circle (the one without 
center) be sorted. This is imo where rank still has some importance.

</I>&gt;<i> Here's the view Thomas mentioned, which gives emphasis to rank:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's another view with even more emphasis on rank, to the exclusion
</I>&gt;<i> of almost everything else:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?u=Test-af-ZeleaCom&amp;p=G!p!sandbox">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Rank?u=Test-af-ZeleaCom&amp;p=G!p!sandbox</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main question in mind should be the different user roles and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the user might want to do with the view. What is the user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interested in when he visits the site. A journalist or a politician
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might have different needs than an average voter or a technician or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> whatever reasons a visitor of crossforum theater has :)
</I>&gt;<i> Rank would matter if you needed to think like an executive, for
</I>&gt;<i> example - one who must execute decisions.  Then you might want to see
</I>&gt;<i> the consensus in light of decision rules.  Decision rules vary, but
</I>&gt;<i> tend to be sensitive to differences of rank.  (I look forward to
</I>&gt;<i> coding a decision-oriented view for Metagov, because it's definitely
</I>&gt;<i> needed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, a newcomer stumbling on a social circle will
</I>&gt;<i> probably be uninterested in details of rank.  Folks don't ordinarily
</I>&gt;<i> gather in together wearing the insignia of rank, and getting in a huff
</I>&gt;<i> if someone occupies the wrong chair.  Aristocrats used do that, at
</I>&gt;<i> least on formal occaisions.  Military officers still do it.  But it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't mesh with current, civil society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could argue that parity is more important than rank.  Day-to-day
</I>&gt;<i> consensus making is based on free discussion among peers.  Or we could
</I>&gt;<i> argue that it's best to have fewer votes, because it puts you in
</I>&gt;<i> closer touch with ordinary folk who have to obey the law, or whatever
</I>&gt;<i> you're drafting.  If the essense of democracy is to recognize no other
</I>&gt;<i> basis for the legitimate exercise of power than the willing assent of
</I>&gt;<i> those who are ruled by it, then the essential view will be one that
</I>&gt;<i> shows people in *actual* communication at the periphery of a *formal*
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.  Views like that are not currently available from other
</I>&gt;<i> sources.  Other sources focus on formalities.  The formalities are
</I>&gt;<i> artificial and untrue, so far as we know.  Democracy is cast in doubt.
