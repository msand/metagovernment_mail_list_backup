<PRE>Am Wednesday 06 April 2011 schrieben Sie:
&gt;<i> Conseo, with reference to your concluding question below, StratML is not
</I>&gt;<i> abstract at all.  It is quite specific and concrete.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Part 1 has been approved as an American national standard (ANSI/AIIM
</I>&gt;<i> 21:2009).  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part1">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> 
The note about abstractness was about your goals for better action towards a 
wealthy society (which where abstract enough to reach consensus between us). I 
have seen value in StratML in the past and I still do so now, esp. when it is 
actually used (many ANSI standards are not widespread). And I still have 
doubts to trust the same governments which always block democratical action to 
introduce real processes. Is it in use somehwere already?

Plan towards &quot;integration&quot; in the semantic web (SMW of Votorola)

Having said that I am willing to support you if adjustments or code becomes 
necessary. I don't see that though, since we use Semantic MediaWiki, which can 
export RDF like this:  
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:ExportRDF/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:ExportRDF/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp</A>
Our &quot;DB&quot;, Semantic MediaWiki, is much more generic than any specific format, so 
we simply have to teach it how to speak StratML (or any other format we are 
interested in). To export it we only have to transform the RDF to our desired 
output (which seems to work already for stuff like OpenDocument (which even has 
included RDF support) or PDF files. Maybe most interesting for you is the 
queryable structure of documents, so drafting within Votorola's SMW will give 
you straightforward access to create complex queries for drafts by StratML 
properties like goals, persons, stakeholders, ...

Steps:

1. Create an OWL-ontology

As you can see the formatting done by Thomas is not reflected in the structure 
of the exported RDF (non semantic content is not included), since we haven't 
defined the semantic properties which would be necessary for the structure to 
show up. Now instead of simply adding properties as we need (and therefore 
creating inconsistencies between different usage patterns like StratML and 
other formatting options), Semantic MediaWiki supports external ontologies 
which is perfect for us. All you need to do is create a valid OWL 
representation of the StratML.xsd which should be doable with a proper XSLT-
stylesheet. * No &quot;programming&quot; is needed. Once we have an equivalent 
representation of the StratML.xsd (which has nothing to do with Votorola in 
particular, but rather enables access to the StratML structured documents from 
the semantic web), it should be stored in an official domain like the XSD is, so 
that it can be shared from the semantic web.

* Example XSLT attached. Fetched from here: 
<A HREF="http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/677/xsd-to-owl-importer">http://answers.semanticweb.com/questions/677/xsd-to-owl-importer</A>

2. Setup Semantic MediaWiki

We then need to import the ontology in the semantic media wiki, which will 
allow us to structure drafts in a StratML compatible way. This is documented 
here: 
<A HREF="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Import_vocabulary">http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Import_vocabulary</A>
We would be able to draft StratML exportable documents then. This might be the 
tricky part, since some parts of StratML will overlap with the already 
existing data from Votorola. I think subproperties might help here, but I am 
currently learning MediaWiki setup and development myself, so I am not sure 
how to solve that yet. This is not mandatory though, it is only desirable to 
keep the properties unified between different ontologies. We can then use 
semantic forms to create is to fill in web forms for templates containing the 
StratML properties. Have a look here it is extremely flexible: 
<A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Forms</A>

3. Transform RDF back to StratML 

Last we need an XSLT stylesheet to transform the OWL output back into StratML
Again no programming is needed since all we do is XML transformations. It 
might be tricky though to write this XSLT stylesheet. Again this stylesheet 
would not be specific to Votorola or even Semantic MediaWiki, but would simply 
map the XSD with the OWL ontology and would be therefore a candidate for 
standards approval as well. We might need to add an &quot;Export&quot; functionality for 
formats like that then.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you willing and able to incorporate the usage of StratML documents into
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola?  If so, this might be a good test/use case:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRR-FinalwStyle.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/NCFRR-FinalwStyle.xml</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am willing to support StratML and see value in it. It won't be high priority 
though, since I am most interested in driving economical processes 
democratically and have to work on Crossforum. I can do step 2 for you and can 
help you with step 3. But you have to do step 1 first as I am not familiar with 
StratML and OWL (yet) and the outcome should be approved as an equivalent 
standard to the XSD. 

Are you still interested? You can barely lose, since most of the work needed 
would further backup StratML and has nothing to do with Votorola.
