<PRE>@ Ed:

&gt;<i> I don't want to get overly complex, but perhaps it would be reasonable 
</I>&gt;<i> to use some more complex math than simple counting or percentages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, how defining consensus (C) as:
</I>&gt;<i> ( X * (P+2) ) - 1, rounded up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where P = the number of people voting,
</I>&gt;<i> and X = a variable set by the software, defaulting to 0.8.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, for X = 0.8...
</I>&gt;<i> For 1 person, C is equal to 2. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> For 2 people, C is equal to 3. (i.e., impossible)
</I>&gt;<i> For 3 through 7 people, C is equal to P. (i.e. 100%).
</I>&gt;<i> For 8 people, C is equal to 7.
</I>&gt;<i> For 20 people, C is equal to 17
</I>&gt;<i> For 100 people, C is equal to 81.
</I>&gt;<i> For very large numbers of people, C is basically equal to 80% of P.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, the standard is, roughly:
</I>&gt;<i> Impossible for one or two people. Complete consensus for small numbers 
</I>&gt;<i> of people. Near-consensus for intermediate groups. And 80% (or X) for 
</I>&gt;<i> large groups.
</I>
Wow! I like this! Its flexibility perfectly fits with my feeling of how 
it should be in large vs. small groups.

&gt;<i> If I am considering changes to my proposal, then is it appropriate for 
</I>&gt;<i> me to change my current proposal, which already has votes for it? 
</I>
Yes, please change your current proposal! I think a note above the text 
would be helpful like &quot;This draft is still (always) under developement 
(improvement). Please add it to your watchlist to get informed about 
changes!&quot;

@ Owen:

&gt;<i>Thomas, where can I see goals and objectives documented in StratML 
</I>format on which &gt;feedback can be provided via a Metagov application(s)?

My picture is the following: Projects continue to put their goals, 
objectives, etc. into StratML documents and publish them as they do 
already now. What is new now is the possibility to get feedback. For 
that they open a poll where everybody can suggest, i.e. draft improved 
versions of the objectives, ... These are going to be very fluid, 
changing all the time. One wouldnt necessarily want to have these 
suggestions themself in the technical format of StratML, which AFAIK is 
more solid, fixed. But their content should be structured in the 
StratML-fashion already. So only after through a decision mechanism it 
has become clear, that a specific improvement should be adopted, then 
the original (one official) StratML document of the project gets changed.

Here is an example. It links to the official StratML document, it is 
structured like it, but it can change all the time. The people voting 
for it, can also have slightly different versions of it and so on:

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/G/p/frvp</A>

If enough people reach consensus about how the official version should 
be improved, that the original StratML document gets changed. What do 
you think?

Thomas
