<PRE>We're talking about the new &quot;my&quot; link; as shown here, for example:

It's designed to solve the problem that Ed fingered, which is
confusion and difficulty in creating an intitial draft.  The solution
is that clicking on the 'my' link takes you to your own draft.  If you
don't have a draft, then it guides you in creating one.

I cut some corners to save time.  I coded it as a link, not a mode
switch.  I think problems of participation are the top priority, so
I've been focusing on solving those, usually at the expense of others.
I can't spend as much time on UI details as I would like.

&gt;<i> ... And it leads me through to the vote-server-login. Why not to the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki-login?
</I>
Clicking on the 'my' link shows your own draft regardless of where it
is located.  It needn't be in the same wiki you're looking at (or even
in a wiki), so you needn't be logged in there.  On the other hand, the
vote-server needs to know your identity so it can find your draft and
effect the link.  Are you able to use the vote-server's &quot;keep me
logged in&quot; feature?
