<PRE>&gt;<i>From what I see facebook is not sharing its information about
</I>questions outside. And there goes Ed idea of mapping those questions
on the crossforum theater. Saying that they can attract more users
must be the under statement of the century ;-) . They have 500 million
users! If one in 500 users uses it they still have a million users.
With the others willing and able to jump in when the question is
interesting enough.

On the other hand what I noticed in one day is that people are not
really using it. In a website where people go there to relax, and
lousily click on a few &quot;I Like&quot; button, and little more it looks like
few people are willing to put the effort to think about answers.

Let's look at me. I have 430 &quot;friends&quot;, of those about 350 have access
to my wall. Many of those do not speak italian, say half. So if I ask
a question in italian (or in english) I only reach 180 people. But
then some of those are only nominally my friends, some do not come on
facebook at all. Atthe end I suspect about 10-15 people might read my
question. If they don't comment it, or try to answer it the question
dies there. It might be different for people who are actively working
in trying to get the biggest imprint on facebook. They have hundreds
and hundreds of friends (usually at least 800), the friends are all in
one language, and they give access to all their friends to the wall.
The result is that maybe 80 people might see their question, and
probably there is a threashold, after which you have a relatively high
probability chance to receive answers. If any superstar were to use
the question, for example, I am sure he would receive the answer he
was looking for.

Is this the system we wanted? No. But it is what is coming out, and it
will be hard to change it.

But still there will be cases of a person that has only 20 friends or
so that writes a question, and receives thousands of answers. It's
just very improbable!!!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Facebook just did it!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; In an action that might prove to be the biggest revolution in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; e-gov in the last 10 years facebook made a tiny change that might have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; huge consequences.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; It added the possibility for people to ask questions, and to keep the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; poll open for answers (even as a default! -This is so important-).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Here is an image of it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Not only but the question can go viral. Your friend can follow it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (which probably amounts to share it?), and it is very clear that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; everybody on facebook could answer it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We wanted to do something similar with Vilfredo on FB, but FB was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The next days will be vital to understand how the new tool will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; used. I invite everybody who has a FB account to test the system. Ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; questions, ask open questions, ask about the future, about what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; politicians should do, and see who answers, see how they spread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I know many people here don't like facebook, but we want it or not, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is here, and it is here to stay. We will have to consider it in our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; programs. For example it is pretty useless to rebuild a system that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; basically just doing the same thing.
