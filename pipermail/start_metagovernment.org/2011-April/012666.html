Exactly! We are still trying to solve exactly this problem.

Imagine, G/p/m00 comes up with the consensus to change the homepage as 
soon as 66% of all voters reached a consensus which stays over 3 weeks. 
This feels like we achieved all that we wanted with G/p/m00 and that we 
could move on to the homepage (G/p/mho) itself now. BUT, what if: once 
we have the 66% for 2,5 weeks in G/p/mho, suddenly the consensus in 
G/p/m00 breaks and 10% come up with an alternative version which 
requires 75% for the homepage? Will it be changed with only 66% now or 
not? Unless this is answered I see no point in working on the homepage.

And my solution is this: 
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php?oldid=2874&amp;vodd=4268.2888-4198.">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php?oldid=2874&amp;vodd=4268.2888-4198.</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> Exactly! Lets finish the problem with just one poll instead of

</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, we only need 1 poll.  G/p/m00 is fine.
</I>
Yes, I'm also serious. One is enough! Therefore my above draft.

&gt;<i> Suppose it's not an issue of the main page, but some real-world issue.

</I>&gt;<i> That's not the case ofc, but it offers a refreshing perspective.
</I>
Unfortunately in a wider sense this is exactly the case.
