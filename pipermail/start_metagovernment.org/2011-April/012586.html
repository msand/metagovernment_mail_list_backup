<PRE>Sorry Thomas, I didn't mean to jump into my suit.
I answer some below:

Intuition tells me the problem (which we can avoid for now) is best
solved outside of any particular drafting medium.  It might not be
clear how that is possible, but I think crossforum theatre will take
us a step in that direction, even if it doesn't go the full distance.
So we'll be better positioned to revisit this in the future, as you
suggest.

Ah, you thought it might show your own footing!  Unfortunately, we
can't easily do that.  It would slow down the page loads when
navigating the tree because you'd always be ploughing into uncached
diffs.  It would also generate too many (approaching N factorial)
diffs in the cache.  Solutions are possible, but they are complicated
to consider.  So again, I agree it's best to postpone the issue.

Mike
