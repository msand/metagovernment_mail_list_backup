The problem here seems to be in sorting out the irrelevant posts. I  
can see people posing important questions on Facebook, but I can  
imagine that 95% of what appears in the Questions will be on the order  
of &quot;who is going to advance in American Idol&quot; and &quot;What should I get  
Susan for her birthday.&quot;

Can you think of a way to tie into only the governance-related  
questions without any input from Facebook? All I can think of off hand  
is a simple hack: telling people that if they add something into their  
question, then it will get pulled into the Crossforum. In other words,  
something on the order of a hashtag, where the connections are made by  
the users, regardless of the underlying structure.

&gt;<i> On the other hand, they might still manage to attract lots of users.

There is a lot of potential there. People may start out on Facebook  
because that's what they know, but when they find that they have  
hundreds of answers and a simplistic voting system, they may start  
looking outward for something more robust. The Crossforum should allow  
them to easily migrate the discussion to a more robust platform  
without necessarily losing all of the initial input (nor the social  
publicity, which is not to be undervalued).
