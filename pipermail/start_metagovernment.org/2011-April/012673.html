I agree, it makes it easy to get for the mind. But unfortunately I think 
its  aesthetically not as appealing.

&gt;<i> I like it.  I think it's faster on the uptake than this one:

Here I feel, the pointers begin to look like radio-towers somehow.

&gt;<i> Your idea of the pizza slices, was that to eliminate the complicated

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It could work for the center circle to show the percentages. Maybe thats 
a good solution. Its hard to imagine for me in my head though.

Until now, I like the simple solution of different long pointers with 
percentage numbers the best.

And yes, the bubbles are great! ... and also the way they point to one 
or the other user ... left is always voter and right is candidate, 
right? (only, I hope, we can change the colour again)
