<PRE>To Ed and others:
I agree that it would be better to have a forum integrated with the 
existing structure.
I also agree with the idea of an unified login.
I am not sure I would be the best co-admin (or moderator) as I live in Tokyo and I have an 
8 hours time difference from Europe, but if you think this would not prove to be 
an obstacle, please count on me, I would be honoured.
If you need any help to set up the forum, please ask me, I have few 
programmers who can maybe help.
There are other 3 Portuguese guys who would like to join the forum, as soon 
as it is up!
So, I look forward to have the discussion forum up, as it will be easy for 
me to invite other people
&#160;
Regards,
Matteo
