<PRE>Hi All,my name is Matteo and I have just joined this list, even if I have read some of the topics in the last few weeks and have been involved in discussions with Thomas and Mike.I am very interested in the idea of internet democracy, you can have a look at my small presentation site here: www.idemocrazia.it and I would like to contribute to the success of Votorola.I believe that one of the keys for the success of an e-democracy project is the number of people supporting it, as it is basically all about a mass movement of people.I have noticed that there are many projects, many times similar to Votorola, with small differences between one or the other.I believe it would be a good idea if people working on different projects could agree, or at least talk about points of similarities and dissimilarities among projects.This forum is a good one for people to join and discuss, as there are already many informed and serious people in it, however I would
 suggest that the overall structure of the forum could be made better, for example making it similar to this one:<A HREF="http://www.phpbb.com/community/It">http://www.phpbb.com/community/It</A> would then be easier to look for posts in the past, add images and HTML pages, evn movies, etc. and it would be easier for people to discuss.I would like to give my help in this, while of course the property and location of the forum will remain where it is now.
If possible, I would like to receive a feedback on this idea
Regards,Matteo
