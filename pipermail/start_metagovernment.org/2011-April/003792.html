<PRE>Facebook just did it!

In an action that might prove to be the biggest revolution in the
e-gov in the last 10 years facebook made a tiny change that might have
huge consequences.

It added the possibility for people to ask questions, and to keep the
poll open for answers (even as a default! -This is so important-).

Here is an image of it.

And the help page is at:

Not only but the question can go viral. Your friend can follow it
(which probably amounts to share it?), and it is very clear that
everybody on facebook could answer it.

We wanted to do something similar with Vilfredo on FB, but FB was faster.

The next days will be vital to understand how the new tool will be
used. I invite everybody who has a FB account to test the system. Ask
questions, ask open questions, ask about the future, about what
politicians should do, and see who answers, see how they spread.

I know many people here don't like facebook, but we want it or not, it
is here, and it is here to stay. We will have to consider it in our
programs. For example it is pretty useless to rebuild a system that is
basically just doing the same thing.
