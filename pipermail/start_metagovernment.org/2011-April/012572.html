Just to be clear, that's not specifically what I want. My objection  
was to the other proposals, so I encoded the status quo as my  
proposal. But I also pointed out that I didn't think it was the best  
answer.

I don't want to get overly complex, but perhaps it would be reasonable  
to use some more complex math than simple counting or percentages.

For example, how defining consensus (C) as:
( X * (P+2) ) - 1, rounded up.

where P = the number of people voting,
and X = a variable set by the software, defaulting to 0.8.

Therefore, for X = 0.8...
For 1 person, C is equal to 2. (i.e., impossible)
For 2 people, C is equal to 3. (i.e., impossible)
For 3 through 7 people, C is equal to P. (i.e. 100%).
For 8 people, C is equal to 7.
For 20 people, C is equal to 17
For 100 people, C is equal to 81.
For very large numbers of people, C is basically equal to 80% of P.

In other words, the standard is, roughly:
Impossible for one or two people. Complete consensus for small numbers  
of people. Near-consensus for intermediate groups. And 80% (or X) for  
large groups.

If I am considering changes to my proposal, then is it appropriate for  
me to change my current proposal, which already has votes for it? It  
that considered a corollary of delegation? Or should I create a new  
proposal?

Alternately, a rule like the above could be applied to the amount of  
time as well, as with Aktiv Demokrati. In other words, the more people  
participating (and agreeing) the sooner something can pass.
