<PRE>Hey Ed,

&gt;<i> I've tried to simplify yours some and also add in some more of Owen's
</I>&gt;<i> input. (There was some math I haven't been able to work out yet, so I
</I>&gt;<i> just explained it instead of encoding it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/draft_rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/draft_rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas, on yours, I'm not sure I see the value of a decision-rule for
</I>&gt;<i> articles. Would the be in the wiki? We don't want every change to the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki to require a vote, do we? Or am I misunderstanding? I stated mine
</I>&gt;<i> as one overarching decision rule, since it is a definition of
</I>&gt;<i> consensus. For anything which needs consensus, including a change to
</I>&gt;<i> the meta-rules, the definition should be pretty much the same.
</I>
My proposal was to allow anybody to create a poll if they see it is necessary 
for the resource to be managed by consensus building. I don't think it should 
be default. Best would be to draft a rule for new polls as well imo.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let me also be clear that I am still pretty shaky on a lot of what I
</I>&gt;<i> have proposed. In other words, I am not sure I 100% advocate what I
</I>&gt;<i> said as it is stated.
</I>
The nice thing is that this is supposed to be a vivid democratical process and 
not be set in stone. This is a mandatory prerequisite for a first and any 
following ruleset imo. I do understand your hesitation, but this is also an 
easy way out to keep it open. Ideally we decide upon a ruleset which stays 
open for improvements and I think this is possible atm.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a tangent of that, I really like Owen's idea of being able to vote
</I>&gt;<i> for things based on how much other people support them (which in a
</I>&gt;<i> sense is a reflection of how much one supports them onesself), but I
</I>&gt;<i> can't figure out how to begin approaching encoding that into a
</I>&gt;<i> ruleset. I think that would require returning to my now-long-overruled
</I>&gt;<i> idea of scoring proposals instead of simply voting for or against
</I>&gt;<i> them. In that case, I am about 80% in favor of the proposal I made
</I>&gt;<i> myself, and about 60% in favor of yours. That sort of scoring adds a
</I>&gt;<i> huge amount of complexity to the overall process, but... it's true.
</I>&gt;<i> That's how I feel, and I think most decisions are not absolute but
</I>&gt;<i> rather degrees of preference.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, if everyone likes your idea, I'd be happy to go along
</I>&gt;<i> with it. But I'd prefer my idea. And I would even more prefer
</I>&gt;<i> something else which I have not been able to state yet. No idea on the
</I>&gt;<i> table has my 100% support at this time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Scoring needs a bar to score against. My proposal is to draft needs as well as 
contributions (one idea would be to simply use semantic properties for that, 
but the technical stuff is not yet clear to me). That way people can both 
describe the amount of work (or prerequisites) and what they are willing to 
support themselves. Better than an abstract mathematical algorithm to generate 
a score, this would give you a clear hint (like a budget summary) on how much 
support compared to its needs each proposal has. Work is imo the most 
important category as it shows how serious the participants are about their 
plan, but you could also use money or even weaker sympathy values.
The program would generate the budget summary and give a more sophisticated 
overview which can also be used to fine tune the rules for decision and also 
see how well supported a position is besides its vote count.

Anybody interested in this? Any further resources on that? This is what is my 
main interest, so any help is appreciated. I have (losely) summarized my pov 
here <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:4consensus_WebDe/Budgeting_system">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:4consensus_WebDe/Budgeting_system</A> 
Feel free to edit (add links, notes...) or mail me. 

Conseo
