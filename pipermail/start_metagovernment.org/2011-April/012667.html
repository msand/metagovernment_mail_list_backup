<PRE>Would it be quicker to chat?  Maybe I'm not getting enough sleep,
because I just don't see the reason for the delay.  I'll wait for you
or Ed on irc or skype.

All we're trying to do (I thought) is demonstrate our ability to
change the home page.  We've had an absolute consensus on Ed's
proposed changes for something like a month now, and nobody's raised
any objections to them.  Yet still, the home page doesn't get changed.
Our only purpose is to test/debug our governance mechanism.  I think
everyone knows this.  Surely in *that* context, there's a way to speed
things up.

:<i>-) Not complaining, just voting for a little acceleration.

</I>&gt;<i> Exactly! We are still trying to solve exactly this problem.

</I>&gt;<i> we have the 66% for 2,5 weeks in G/p/mho, suddenly the consensus in 
</I>&gt;<i> G/p/m00 breaks and 10% come up with an alternative version which 
</I>&gt;<i> requires 75% for the homepage? Will it be changed with only 66% now or 
</I>&gt;<i> not? Unless this is answered I see no point in working on the homepage.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Exactly! Lets finish the problem with just one poll instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 100.000. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Seriously, we only need 1 poll.  G/p/m00 is fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I'm also serious. One is enough! Therefore my above draft.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Suppose it's not an issue of the main page, but some real-world issue.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People are in danger somewhere.  They need help but nobody is trying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to help them because nobody believes we actually have the capability.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our first attempt will be when the main page actually changes.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clock is ticking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's not the case ofc, but it offers a refreshing perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately in a wider sense this is exactly the case.
