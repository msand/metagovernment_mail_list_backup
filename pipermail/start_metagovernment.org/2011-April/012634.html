<PRE>First:

What always annoyed me somehow is:

G/p/blabla

Or Do. Er. Fa. Mi. ..An. Ji. Th.

That's something I don't get and also I've looked up G/ stands for Global, I
forget it on a regular basis and have to look it up again ;)

Wouldn't it be possible to use real words? Maybe combined with Icons? Maybe
combined with onMouseOver-text with a short descrption?

These abbreviations really make it hard to read.

 

Second:

All nodes of the circular tree layout could also be little bubbles with a
diameter which corresponds to the percentage or absolute amount of votes
given by that bubble.

Here are a couple of ideas for showing the percentages (I agree
they're needed).  The first uses numeric labels:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht</A>
 
The second (attached) uses segmented needles.  Each full segment
represents 10%.  Labels would also be shown (much as above) but only
while hovering with the mouse:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1b.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1b.xht</A>
 
Which seems better?  I prefer the second.


Its strange, but in the second version for my eyes the first and the third
largest look almost identical at first glance. It really took me a while to
realize, that the first largest has one segment more than the third. Maybe
thats just because of my eyes. But so I would prefer the first version,
which is really clear. (Plus, it also makes really clear for a first time
user, what the bars are about and that they are not some sort of strange
clock ;-)

True, rank matters in the first circle. Here's one possibility:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht</A>
And with some more circles expanded:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/3.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/3.xht</A>
 
So instead of sorting the candidates and rotating the whole forest on
each rank change, this would only rotate the needle-indicators.  The
length of each needle is proportional to the number of votes held.

 

What do you think?

 
I think you are pretty smart! :-)
This way its even much better! You always find your end-candidate at 
first glance, because he stays were he always is, just the needle 
changes once in a while (maybe the needles could even have little 
numbers with percentage).
