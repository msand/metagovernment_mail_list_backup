<PRE>In response to Ed's plea for context: We're discussing what the look
and feel of this (right side) should be:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!m00">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!m00</A>

In function, it'll be something like this when it's finished:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!sandbox">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!sandbox</A>

Except that it'll be part of crossforum theatre:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png</A>
Which means there'll be lights and action.  The feed (stage left) is a
dynamic thing, and it's going to light up the votespace with events.
It'll also have time controls (not yet coded) that enable long-term,
historical animation.  So you'll see how the social structure around
the consensus (or dissensus) was formed.

Here are some mockups (just static views) showing how it might look:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; These abbreviations really make it hard to read.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. The poll-name in the middle could be longer, thats true. The url 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to stay short though. And I like the onMouseOver-text-idea for the 
</I>&gt;<i> names. To make them longer just as they are seems not possible if you 
</I>&gt;<i> want them to stay in a circle, right? But I agree, 2 letter for a name 
</I>&gt;<i> is pretty little.
</I>
Maybe the user doesn't need to know what &quot;An.&quot; stands for, at least
not immediately.  What he does need to know immediately is that An. is
a real person, active engaged in discussion with other people.  That's
the crucial thing.  If we don't get that part right, then the rest
doesn't matter.

Maybe we should do some mockups of the captions.

BTW - We're now getting real count data from the server.  A small
addition, after lots of path-clearing in the code:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; Second:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All nodes of the circular tree layout could also be little bubbles 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a diameter which corresponds to the percentage or absolute amount 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of votes given by that bubble.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I like the pointers more in this case.  Best would be a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Settings-page&quot; where everybody could make is favorite settings for
</I>&gt;<i> the display. Wouldnt it?
</I>
Yes, at least for some parts.  That bit at the center, for example, is
essentially a view of the decision mechanism.  There may be multiple
decision mechanisms in play for a given issue, even some of them in
competition.  So probably the center is going to end up as a user
choice.

Here's another idea for it (also attached).  This is inspired by
Alexander's bubble suggestion.  It's kind of attractive, I think:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1c.xht</A>

Compare to the previous two:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1.xht</A>
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1b.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/vote/_/1b.xht</A>

And here's a fourth idea, which is just to show the numbers:
