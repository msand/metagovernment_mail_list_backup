I'm hoping that it would be the opposite of competitive. What I was  
suggesting was that each project present itself, and then everyone  
else provide input, opinions, criticism, etc.

I would think this is the best avenue to cooperation... it would allow  
each project a time in the spotlight where they can get input from the  
other projects. Each project has come up with some really amazing  
ideas, and this would allow them to share those ideas with each other  
in a way that it could be easily processed.

Each project is working with a different model, different programming  
environments, different structures, and different philosophies. This  
makes direct collaboration somewhat of a problem. But verbal input on  
specific issues could still be a very productive form of cooperation.  
One project could say, as part of their exposition, that they've had  
problems figuring out X, and another project could say, &quot;well when we  
came across that problem, we found Y to be successful.&quot; And another  
individual might suggest Z.

I don't think there is much spirit of cut-throat competition in this  
group. There are billions of communities out there which could be  
using our software... enough to go around. :)
