<PRE>This is an interesting dialog, but from my perspective, key points include:

1) government should do only that which is duly authorized by constitution and law and more explicitly documented in strategic and performance plans upon which citizens and other stakeholders should be given the opportunity to provide input and feedback;

2) except as required by law (e.g., social security and voter registration), each of us should be free to maintain our digital personas anywhere that *we* choose on the Web; and 

3) eventually, any intermediary (e.g., Facebook) seeking to &quot;serve&quot; us should be capable of referencing and using our digital personas by virtue of the fact that we maintain them in conformance with an international voluntary consensus standard for such data.  OpenID looks like a good candidate: <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID</A>  It is compared to SAML here: <A HREF="http://identitymeme.org/doc/draft-hodges-saml-openid-compare.html">http://identitymeme.org/doc/draft-hodges-saml-openid-compare.html</A> 

While I may occasionally use Facebook, LinkedIn, Google Docs, etc., etc., I am less inclined to do so and certainly have no intention of making them my preferred service provider unless and until they support something like OpenID (and SAML).

  Hi Giovani, thanks for your input.

  I don't think anyone is suggesting that the government should be using facebook itself.

  More than while the government catches up with the civil society we develop the tools and test the algorithms on FB. A bit like we would run the algorithm to self organise a small chess club before graduating to bigger organizations.

  But the point remains that it is not enough to have a government platform, if no one uses it.

  Would the government insert the data of everybody in the website, and then just send at home the password?

    Not sure what's all about Facebook for e-democracy here... maybe we have different thoughts. 
    I agree that FB is a very nice platform with very well done features.
    I would also agree with the statement that it could be a good place for e-democracy movements *IF* started by Civil Society *BUT NOT* if promoted by Governments as a way to take seriously into account citizen's input (at maximum it could be used for institutional propaganda, and communication of results).

    But if governments start using FB to create their e-participation tools, well then we are far away from real e-democracy. The only and simple fact that FB is &quot;closed-source&quot; and governments can't be sure of how FB treats their and citizen's data is alone a non-go. Let alone talking about EU governments, as FB is a US-based company.

    The EUGAGER proposal we submitted was thought to be supported by governments as an alternative to facebook (it does not exclude integrations for non-secure apps), but it would provide citizen's and govs with &quot;secure&quot; apps that can really be trusted (not only in terms of identification, but also data integrity and checking). And of course be fully-auditable open-source.  (soon news about that... :-)

    Maybe you guys were suggesting FB for grassroot apps created by citizens and for the citizens... I just wanted to be sure that when we talk about real governments supporting open and transparent governance it does not mean using facebook to interact 2-way with citizens for serious stuff...

    my 2 cents ;-)

      Knowing how complex the definition of e-democracy can get, I would say that Facebook has a number of features which I would associate with online governance, namely: Profiles, Calendaring, and many, many, different types of Messaging. Where it is lacking as far as e-democracy is concerned it makes up for in its mark-up language. The point at which sensitive data is communicated through Facebook is a point at which personal security becomes an issue.

      That's something I know nothing about.

      What I do know is that big companies are waking up to Facebook and building their fanbase on top of it. Many of the applications aren't really relevant to the users' needs and primarily focus on driving consumerism. Nevertheless, they're using Facebook because of its population boom, its ability to spread personally relevant information, as well as the amount of customer loyalty it provides.

      Given its rising popularity our politicians, I would expect that the governments will soon begin communicating with us through Facebook in much the same way that the White House communicates through Facbook -- except, one would hope, a little more personally. If this is the case, then an e-democracy application would be perfectly positioned on Facebook to help users administer their local governance.

      And if Facebook isn't your thing, make another one on Orkut. :)

        It should, I agree.  I may have missed the security discussion, but I
        can't see why security concerns would be relevant, unless I
        misunderstand you.  Do you wish (for example) to develop a
        Facebook/e-democracy interface, allowing Facebook users to vote and
        view results?  That kind of thing?

        If so, I may be able to help.  Votorola needs interfaces like that,
        and we're keen to develop them.  I'm sure other e-dem projects would
        be interested too, especially if we got the ball rolling.
