<PRE>Yes Ed,
&quot;Open democracy&quot; was suggested by you on the third generation of the
Vilfredo proposal and was endorsed by me and you, but not by Jackie. Which
is why &quot;Collaborative governance&quot; was considered better. I don't think
Jackie has changed her mind on this.

Should we re-open the question with more people?
As you know, anybody can do it. Personally I am not keen on doing it right
now as it seems few people would participate.
In any case if someone opens it, I will participate.

BTW, we are also discussing with my friend, the programmer, to add some sort
of karma (a la stackoverflow) to Vilfredo. Where people would get positive
points when they participate, but only if they participate in all the voting
rounds after the first they join in. The idea is that someone that comes in,
and then goes away, is not really helping the process. Because the process,
being different from a discussion, requires people to actually stick with
it.
