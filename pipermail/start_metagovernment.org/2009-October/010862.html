<PRE>Agreed, Pietro.  We don't live in a perfect world, nor will we ever.
However, we can make continuous improvement . if only we have the
understanding and will to do so.

Well, Owen,
when that times arrive I am sure we will all be very happy to provide for
those new open services.
But please remember that it is not enough for something to exist. It must
have the traction that Facebook now have, and my Space had in the past.

It is not enough to have the greatest solution, if a suboptimal one is
holding the market. Think about the multiple instances where something less
good than it was possible held its ground forever. Without ever being put
down. Think about the QWERTY keyboard respect to the DVorak. 
So maybe the time you describe will come, maybe it will not. 

In the meantime shall we  work on the world as it is right now? Or as we
wish it was?
We have tests to run, ideas to share, concepts to merge. Let's try those
things out right now with Facebook.
Once Facebook era is over we can rebuild everything with our new wisdom
coming from the experience during Facebook era.

Pietro

The reason that many of us have resisted joining Facebook, Linked In, and
other &quot;social networking&quot; services is that we resent having to re-create our
digital personas and turn them over to every Tom, Dick, and Harry working on
their own &quot;solutions&quot;.  The paper I wrote on that topic a decade ago is
available at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/PushShove.html">http://ambur.net/PushShove.html</A>

Fortunately, progress is being made, as evidenced, for example, by the
conference on OpenID conducted at NIST last week.  See
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp">http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp</A> and, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://events.oasis-open.org/home/forum/2009/schedule">http://events.oasis-open.org/home/forum/2009/schedule</A>

Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, it will become socially
unacceptable to continue to try to &quot;capture&quot; and hold customers hostage (by
making the switching cost unduly high) -- rather than attracting customers
by providing superior service (for each logically separable transaction)
without regard to where they choose to maintain their digital personas.

It should, I agree.  I may have missed the security discussion, but I
can't see why security concerns would be relevant, unless I
misunderstand you.  Do you wish (for example) to develop a
Facebook/e-democracy interface, allowing Facebook users to vote and
view results?  That kind of thing?

If so, I may be able to help.  Votorola needs interfaces like that,
and we're keen to develop them.  I'm sure other e-dem projects would
be interested too, especially if we got the ball rolling.
