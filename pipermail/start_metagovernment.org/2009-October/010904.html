<PRE>I certainly have no argument with that, and I would like to see the  
presentations have a low impact on the developers: ie, not require a  
glossy presentation; just a concise, simple presentation in whatever  
format is easiest, followed by a leisurely Q&amp;A.

As for real-world input; several projects are still in much earlier  
stages of development and could use some feedback from others such as  
yourself who have had input from a large userbase (if you're willing).  
Also our small group makes a nice beta-testing group of real-world  
people... for example, I think quite a few of us gave a lot of input  
into the development of Vilfredo, once we started playing with it. The  
key is to get us started on it.

I also see utility in developers talking directly with other  
developers. The end-users are the ultimate feedback machine, but other  
developers may sometimes have more useful input into solving certain  
specific problems. As I have been learning, crowdsourcing is not about  
using the idea that gets the most votes, but rather allowing the best  
ideas to shine out of the crowd.
