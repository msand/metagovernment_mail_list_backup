<PRE>The fact we have not unsubscribed from the listserv suggests that we haven't 
given up hope, but from my perspective, it still seems to be unclear whether 
many, if any of us are pursuing the same objective(s).

At least it remains to be seen whether we are sufficiently committed to 
devote the necessary time, effort, and resources to accomplish any 
objective(s).  If so, we should be able to transform a strategic plan into a 
performance plan, which could in turn produce measurable results.

Please recall the reason I subscribed to the Metagov listserv was to explore 
prospects for using Metascore to enable feedback on goals and objectives 
documented in StratML format.  Thus far, I have not seen much evidence that 
anyone else shares my objective in that regard.  That's not to disparage 
anyone else's objectives but merely to suggest that perhaps we may be 
lacking the basis for producing anything together.

Time will tell and the results (or lack thereof) will speak for themselves.

</I>&gt;<i> I haven't seen nearly as much discussion as I had hoped. But then  again, 
</I>&gt;<i> there have been some good discussions and overall this  community's 
</I>&gt;<i> activity comes and goes in waves. So we may just be at a  sort of low-tide 
</I>&gt;<i> event right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do have an idea to spur discussion, which would be for each Active 
</I>&gt;<i> Project to be the focus of discussion for a week. Sort of a precursor  to 
</I>&gt;<i> the exposition event we were discussing for the conference. That  is, one 
</I>&gt;<i> project posts a brief description of what it is and how it  works, and 
</I>&gt;<i> others comment on it for the rest of the week. The next  week, another 
</I>&gt;<i> project does the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  2. Has Metagov worked to foster cooperation among the various
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     projects?  Has the level of cooperation increased, as a result?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Pietro noted, there are some barriers to cooperation, but I do  think 
</I>&gt;<i> there is a lot more we could be doing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I sincerely believe that a formal conference would be a real 
</I>&gt;<i> energizing event for this group. However, I have had little luck in 
</I>&gt;<i> energizing the community to get around to thinking about organizing  the 
</I>&gt;<i> conference in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  3. Has Metagov become neutral with regard to Metascore/Candiwi?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By my perception it has. The wiki has been mostly modified to take a 
</I>&gt;<i> group approach, and discussions on the list are certainly not limited  to 
</I>&gt;<i> Candiwi. I should note that I personally consider myself to also be  a 
</I>&gt;<i> part of the Candiwi project and I very much want it to succeed  (because I 
</I>&gt;<i> am very fond of the distributed, ground-up approach)... but  by no means 
</I>&gt;<i> do I want that at the expense of any other project. I  communicate with 
</I>&gt;<i> various individuals about Metagov all the time, and I  tend to then 
</I>&gt;<i> suggest a specific project based on what that  individual's particular 
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy indicates would be the best match  for them. I think it would 
</I>&gt;<i> be a fantastic world where there were 5-10  mature, mainstream projects 
</I>&gt;<i> all being adopted by different communities/ governments around the world. 
</I>&gt;<i> Like the food-court at a shopping mall,  there is strength in numbers; 
</I>&gt;<i> even among competitors.
