<PRE>What a great idea, the idea to have a period for each project.

My only suggestion would be to make it a bit slow.
I would give one week for each project, and then one week of rest in
between. We are all very busy.
In the week of rest we would know what the next project discussed will be.
So people can start to get ready. In fact we could even do it as:
1) 1 person give a brief how to presentation of the project (this is rapidly
how to use it). This should be possibly not taking longer than be a 5
minutes screencast, and just giving instructions on how to use it.
2) everybody plays with it for one week. (Who feels like could even prepare
a first report but he should NOT post it yet).
3) the person responsible for presenting the project gives a second talk,
this time going in depth into what they want to achieve, why did they do
things in one way (instead of another), what are the future directions they
intend to take.
4) Who has written a report posts it at this point.
5) everybody discusses.

I would also suggest that we do not put a hard stop on when we stop
discussing a project, but we wait until no one has posted anything on that
topic for 2 days.

This approach would permit to look at each project from wo point of views,
First as a common user, who is not really interested in the project, and
just want to get some work done with it (or some decision made). The second
view would instead look at the project as part of the overall metagovernment
approach to governance.

Also it would permit to the people of the list who don't have much time to
devote to the discussion to participate only one week over two, avoiding the
first testing week of each project.

BTW, let me add that on the 9th of November I will be in Southampton giving
a talk on Vilfredo. I am preparing it right now. The opportunity came during
the ECAL conference. I just bought a video camera, and I intend to video
record the whole talk (those talks are usually for 1 hour) and them make it
available on internet.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Pietro noted, there are some barriers to cooperation, but I do think

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I sincerely believe that a formal conference would be a real energizing

</I>&gt;<i> community to get around to thinking about organizing the conference in the
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Has Metagov become neutral with regard to Metascore/Candiwi?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By my perception it has. The wiki has been mostly modified to take a group
</I>&gt;<i> approach, and discussions on the list are certainly not limited to Candiwi.
</I>&gt;<i> I should note that I personally consider myself to also be a part of the
</I>&gt;<i> Candiwi project and I very much want it to succeed (because I am very fond
</I>&gt;<i> of the distributed, ground-up approach)... but by no means do I want that at
</I>&gt;<i> the expense of any other project. I communicate with various individuals
</I>&gt;<i> about Metagov all the time, and I tend to then suggest a specific project
</I>&gt;<i> based on what that individual's particular philosophy indicates would be the
</I>&gt;<i> best match for them. I think it would be a fantastic world where there were
</I>&gt;<i> 5-10 mature, mainstream projects all being adopted by different
</I>&gt;<i> communities/governments around the world. Like the food-court at a shopping
</I>&gt;<i> mall, there is strength in numbers; even among competitors.
