(For a tool in alpha, success isn't measured by its popularity.  What
 you want is to uncover the design problems, and elaborate the
 development opportunities.  Premature popularity is no help.  You
 don't need a lot of people, just a few good ones.)

&gt;<i> What were you expecting that has not happened?
</I>&gt;<i> Not in general, but in practical terms.

Things we might be doing:

 a) Coming up with ideas to promote collaboration.

    Ed, you suggest &quot;exposition events&quot; in which each project takes
    the stage and promotes itself for a week.  That's more of a
    support for competition.  I agree that competition is needed, but
    I don't think it's the missing ingredient.

    Instead of this (just for example) we might put all the projects
    on the stage together, where all are visible.  Then we could give
    the spotlight over to the collaborations (actual and potential)
    that we see among them.

 b) Putting these ideas into practice.

    Collaboration probably isn't something that pops out of thin air.
    It probably has to grow from small beginnings.  It probably needs
    a little tending.  So again, instead of events, we put long term
    supports in place, and we look for practical results.

These are things that we (as individuals) or Metagov (as a group)
might be doing.  The general aim is to move the field a little closer
to maturity.  I don't think e-democracy can benefit from star projects
and a winner-takes-all mentality.  I think it needs a healthier
balance between competition and collaboration, and a level of maturity
that's more attractive to partners in other domains.  So shouldn't we
be moving in that direction?
