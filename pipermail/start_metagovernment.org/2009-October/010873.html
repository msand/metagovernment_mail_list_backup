<PRE>Sorry I have been out of the loop for so long. Comments to a couple  
posts in this thread are below.

Most of the negativity toward FB has been from me, so let me clarify.  
I don't have any problem with governance software extending to  
FaceBook (or another commercial site), only with it being *restricted*  
to or *dependent* on it.

It just does not seem appropriate to force people to join a commercial  
interest in order to participate in an unrelated community. This is  
especially true in terms of political governance, but I think it  
applies to any system. It is an unnecessary and burdensome imposition.

I see this as another problem, because people are forced to entrust FB  
with their own data security. Even if FB is imagined to be entirely  
acting in your interest (which certainly can not be assumed), they  
still can have incompetent security personnel and/or can be forced by  
outsiders (police, judges, threatening lawyers, etc.) to open your  
account to strangers.

&gt;<i> Given its rising popularity our politicians, I would expect that the

</I>
But what about individuals who do not have an account on FaceBook?  
There are so many open communication protocols and technologies out  
there, it seems silly to restrict communication to an advertising- 
laden, membership-required, closed-source, single-commercial-entity  
site.

Look at the fiasco with American voting machines. Many localities used  
closed-source, proprietary systems (ie, Diebold running on Windows)  
which can be readily hacked and which have no auditable accountability  
(there is no way of telling if the vendor is toying with the results,  
nor is there any paper-trail). If instead we used open source  
machines, these flaws could be very easily overcome.
