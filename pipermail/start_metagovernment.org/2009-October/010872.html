Dear Ed,

We're writing to update you on Personal Democracy Forum's inaugural conference in Barcelona, November 20-21, at the spectacular Torre Agbar. It's not too late to take advantage of our early-bird registration, which closes tomorrow night.

Update on Speakers and Schedule

We have a great group of speakers from Europe and the United States already confirmed (listed here) and expect to be adding several more, over the next few days and weeks. We've also posted a outline of how the two days of the conference will flow, to give you a sense of topics and timing.

Earlybird Registration Ends October 16th

Early registration is still open and you can assure yourself a space while saving 50 Euros off the regular conference rate if you register now. Act quickly because space is limited and the advance rate expires Midnight October 16 EST.

Google Fellowships

Google and Personal Democracy Forum are teaming up to offer registration fellowships that cover the full forum registration costs, plus two days lodging, in order to enable twenty well-qualified, creative public sector entrepreneurs to attend PdF's first conference in Europe.

Fellows will be chosen based on evidence of how you've turned ideas into action and into new applications of technology in the political or civic arena.

To get started, take a few minutes to fill out this form. The deadline for applications is October 22.

To join the conversation about how technology is changing politics in Europe and around the world, please visit our site. For more updates and conference details, including how to save 50 Euros off registration through out advance rate, please visit our PdF Europe conference page.

We're interested in your feedback and participation in PdF Europe, so if you have any ideas, suggestions or criticisms, please write us at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">Europe at personaldemocracy.com.</A>

Regards,


Andrew Rasiej
Founder, Personal Democracy Forum

Micah L. Sifry
Editor, Personal Democracy Forum

Marc Lopez
Co-Producer, Personal Democracy Forum Europe

and the PdF Team

PS: If you'd like to contribute to the PdF Europe blog, either with original material or cross-posting from your blog, please write us to plug in.
