<PRE>While Open Source Governance makes a lot of sense, that's not true for
people who don't know what Open Source is. Treating our laws as programmers
work on FOSS *code* is contained in Open Governance concept too; it includes
also the Executive Power aspect (open decision-making) rather than only the
Legislative (open rule-making).
Another annoying thing about Open Source Governance name is a common
misinterpretation: to have a government as programmers (often) govern their
*projects*, which is dictatorial... not democratic.

There is no page about Open Governance on Wikipedia (I've just created it
and redirected to Open Source Governance). I think that would be clearer if
Open Source Governance redirects to Open Governance instead. Of course,
we'll need to make changes in Metagovernment's site. What do you think?

This petition is for making easier to reach this political philosophy for
those who don't know about it yet.
