<PRE>To Metagov and the other projects,

Some months ago, we shared ideas about working together in
e-democracy.  We were looking for ways of cooperating, instead of just
promoting our own projects, or ganging up in consortiums.  We had a
long discussion.  In response to that discussion, Ed Pastore initiated
a reorganization of Metagov.  Metagov was to stop promoting its own
software (Metascore, aka Candiwi) and become a neutral umbrella group,
&quot;where all the great ideas of the various projects can be bounced off
each other and promoted together.&quot;
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-June/001623.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-June/001623.html</A>

In retrospect, has this worked out?  In other words:

  1. Has the discussion of ideas increased?

  2. Has Metagov worked to foster cooperation among the various
     projects?  Has the level of cooperation increased, as a result?

  3. Has Metagov become neutral with regard to Metascore/Candiwi?

Given all the energy that went into the earlier discussion, it's worth
a look back, if only for a sense of closure.  I still believe that
openess and cooperation are the missing ingredients in e-democracy.  I
doubt that any progress can be made until the first two projects start
cooperating, in a way that openly invites a third.  And so on.

Shouldn't we be moving forward, in this direction?
