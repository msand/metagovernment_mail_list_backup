<PRE>The reason that many of us have resisted joining Facebook, Linked In, and
other &quot;social networking&quot; services is that we resent having to re-create our
digital personas and turn them over to every Tom, Dick, and Harry working on
their own &quot;solutions&quot;.  The paper I wrote on that topic a decade ago is
available at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/PushShove.html">http://ambur.net/PushShove.html</A>

Fortunately, progress is being made, as evidenced, for example, by the
conference on OpenID conducted at NIST last week.  See
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp">http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp</A> and, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://events.oasis-open.org/home/forum/2009/schedule">http://events.oasis-open.org/home/forum/2009/schedule</A> 

Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, it will become socially
unacceptable to continue to try to &quot;capture&quot; and hold customers hostage (by
making the switching cost unduly high) -- rather than attracting customers
by providing superior service (for each logically separable transaction)
without regard to where they choose to maintain their digital personas.

It should, I agree.  I may have missed the security discussion, but I
can't see why security concerns would be relevant, unless I
misunderstand you.  Do you wish (for example) to develop a
Facebook/e-democracy interface, allowing Facebook users to vote and
view results?  That kind of thing?

If so, I may be able to help.  Votorola needs interfaces like that,
and we're keen to develop them.  I'm sure other e-dem projects would
be interested too, especially if we got the ball rolling.
