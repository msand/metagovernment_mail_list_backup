<PRE>Knowing how complex the definition of e-democracy can get, I would say that
Facebook has a number of features which I would associate with online
governance, namely: Profiles, Calendaring, and many, many, different types
of Messaging. Where it is lacking as far as e-democracy is concerned it
makes up for in its mark-up language. The point at which sensitive data is
communicated through Facebook is a point at which personal security becomes
an issue.

That's something I know nothing about.

What I do know is that big companies are waking up to Facebook and building
their fanbase on top of it. Many of the applications aren't really relevant
to the users' needs and primarily focus on driving consumerism.
Nevertheless, they're using Facebook because of its population boom, its
ability to spread personally relevant information, as well as the amount of
customer loyalty it provides.

Given its rising popularity our politicians, I would expect that the
governments will soon begin communicating with us through Facebook in much
the same way that the White House communicates through Facbook -- except,
one would hope, a little more personally. If this is the case, then an
e-democracy application would be perfectly positioned on Facebook to help
users administer their local governance.

And if Facebook isn't your thing, make another one on Orkut. :)
