<PRE>While I think presenting projects to each other isn't really going to hurt
anything, I'd encourage folks to put more effort into figuring out what
works with real people.  If you don't have something out there that people
are using, you're probably going in the wrong direction because you aren't
getting the feedback that really matters.  The really hard part with the
type of tools we're building is making something people want to use.

My two cents.
