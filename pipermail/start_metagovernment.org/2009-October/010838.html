<PRE>Hi Christopher, yes you have been silent lately.
I hope you learned a lot in your web2.0 job.

Actually you were the first one to present to me the idea of an integration
of vilfredo with twitter. Giving to twitter people the power to read about
vilfredo question, and answers from twitter, and to send in questions and
answers from twitter. I think that was a great idea, and it kept on sitting
on the back of my mind until I had the help to try to make it a reality. Now
we are discussing how to do this with a colleague who will be working with
me on this.

I think we have two problems here, and we need to somehow face them
separately.
There is an algorithmic problem, and a platform problem.

The algorithmic problem is that we do not know how to build an egov website.
We guess that is possible, but we still haven't found any way to actually do
it.

The platform problem is that by now most of us have realized that the
government need to be set up as a sort of platform where different
applications are run. A platform where the applications can address
questions only to certain people, and so on.

We thought about that during the FP proposal, we heard Tim O'Reilly come up
independently with the same idea, we were reaching similar conclusions here,
and so on.
And there are many problems involved in this: privacy will want that you can
check that everybody has voted, while making sure the government cannot find
out who voted for what.
And even if we were to build such a perfect platform, we still would have
the bigger problem... convincing the whole population of the world to adopt
it. Or at least 10% of it. That's a biggie. Maybe if the gov were to do it,
it would be easier. Here is an example of a government working in this
direction:
<A HREF="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/uk-calls-british-coders-leap-frog-their-country-open-government">http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/uk-calls-british-coders-leap-frog-their-country-open-government</A>
the fp7 was another. The obama administration is moving in that direction.

So there is a big movement that is naturally happening in that direction.

So my position is that we do not need all this to start off. I don't need
the perfect platform to build a vilfredo that works. The more people use
Vilfredo the more we test it, people are accostumed to it, people can ask
for it, and developers will &quot;steal&quot; its ideas to be used elsewhere.

tell us more about what you learned in your new job.

Cheers,
Pietro
