<PRE>Hi,

I just answered this on the Vilfredo forum and thought I would send it here
too.  To make up for double posting here&#185;s a summary of some key content so
you can skip over quickly if need be (certainly some parts are well
represented in metagovernment email correspondence).  Fuller details and
reasoning are in the complete version at the end.

Question: Under what form do you think that this kind of consensus building
technique, can be applied for a whole nation governance with maximum
efficiency?

* Transition: I see the best way of transferring to e-governance from
current methods as being through a continuous route: current elected
representatives receive delegated  votes in proportion to the votes they
currently &#140;hold&#185;.  Individuals would immediately have the power to begin
diverting that power away to others (including themselves) in all the
different areas. 
* Morality and law: in my view any e-governance system needs to distinguish
between law and morality.  Morality is, I think, the way that people
generally approach issues of the sort that would be in play here.  Having a
framework for developing shared views, or recognising differences will
provide a very useful mechanism for developing a cultural solidarity.  The
legal stage beyond that is in recognition that sometimes solid mechanisms
and procedures are required.  Whilst there is much shared ground between the
two systems, the legal framework also brings its particular challenges.
These have a structure (or possibilities for different structures) which
could also be incorporated into the structure of the site.
* Participation and delegation: I&#185;m aware that this is an area that has
received a lot of attention.  My ideas on this are basically a justification
for why I think I think that everyone should vote on every issue (though
this will usually be through delegated voting), once issues have been
formulated and developed by a team of interested parties using the
wiki/voting etc technology available.  Two stages.  I sketch basic ideas on
what I think delegation might look like.

Best,

Tom





Complete version:

Transition to whole nation governance using these internet consensus
building techniques

First, the techniques would need to gain acceptance through usage
successively at increasingly higher levels of organisation size and
complexity. &#160;They also need to have trust in terms of resilience, security
and software engineering etc.

Then one would needs to think about the transition point itself. &#160;I see two
basic (and polarised) positions on how this might be achieved. &#160;
    &#128;    First, there could be continuity from the political norms that we
have today. &#160;Under this type of transition, people's current political
representatives would 'inherit' the delegated power that they have now -
i.e. elected political representatives would have the number of votes under
their control on the online system that they had immediately prior to the
change. &#160;Change would then follow gradually and piecemeal: people would
gradually begin to take their voting power away from those representatives -
diverting it elsewhere or keeping it for themselves. &#160;Thus a much more
complicated web of political delegation, alongside self-representation,
would evolve, also giving people the ability to change political allegiances
outside the constraints of any political calendar (unless some type of such
a calendar was still generally condoned).&#160;
    &#128;    On the other hand, though, the first method might cause a different
type of discontinuity that could be disruptive: if some kind of pilot
e-governance system (presumably working as a generator of points of view
rather than legislation) had been operating before the point of transition,
then shifting the delegated power of those that had been participating would
be to some extent disruptive.
Of these two my view is that the first is preferable: for example because
current political systems are more likely to adapt into a framework that
offers continuity. &#160;It is also the case that a 'generator of points of view'
is clearly different to a e-governance system and thus discontinuity in the
second system is perhaps to be expected and indeed possibly preferable (to
mark the seriousness of the change and new impact of people's online input).

Ethics, morality and law

In my view, it will be important to have a system that distinguishes between
ethics and morality, on the one hand, and law, on the other. &#160;On an
individual level, my feeling is that people's first concern on issues
revolves around rights and wrongs (morality) and therefore a 'moral' forum
is the natural base for people's point of entry. &#160;Having decided what they
think on this they will then be equipped to think about how their moral
views can be translated into the practical setting of a legal framework.
&#160;Separating the systems would&#160;assist clarity of thinking by&#160;highlighting
underlying structures such as:&#160;
    &#128;    enforceability;
    &#128;    perfect knowledge (which might, for example, affect people's stance
on capital punishment);
    &#128;    the boundaries between where society should deal with issues, and
where state mechanisms (inasmuch as they would be the same as they are today
in terms of courts etc) should do so. &#160;This would mean establishing not just
binding laws but culturally binding non-legal principles that are generally
accepted, helping to building a culture hopefully viewing law as a fallback
mechanism beyond the healthy functioning of common values and society.&#160;
Separating the systems of morals and law would also be helpful in an
environment where the hope would be that more and more people would have the
sort of knowledge of constitutional and legal affairs to provide the quality
of input needed. &#160;Other ways of doing this could include structuring
different legal options within the software (subject to modification through
e-governance). &#160;This could allow issues such as choice of court, use or not
of a jury, which appeal courts may be used (and how), the involvement of any
special tribunals or administrative authorities, etc. etc., all to be
supplied on an (ignorable) pro-forma.

Where different sub-communities might develop different moral positions that
were incompatible to some extent with each other (for example, different
geographical or religious communities), it might be possible to find degree
of common overlap greater than that in some cases. &#160;This would allow
practical co-existence but recognition of deeper differences.

Participation and delegation

In my conception, voting on any issue would be performed, directly or
indirectly, by the maximum number of people possible, or perhaps all. &#160;This
is markedly different to some ideas I have seen about a capacity for those
working on a particular area to vote between themselves and then impose this
on the community. &#160;As I understand it, the justification for this is to
ensure that those having input on legal (or moral) changes would have
expertise in the area. &#160;

However, I think that this is where delegation should step in. &#160;Having a
small number of people making changes for the crowd seems impractical and to
leave open to many possibilities for tactics beyond the pure application of
broad democratic rule. &#160;For example, it would never be possible to say, on
any particular issue, that a decision reached was representative and
'un-hijacked'. &#160;I see instead a process whereby a group of people would work
up a proposal through the e-governance forum (using wiki and voting
processes etc). &#160;This proposal would then be put out to general vote. &#160;Most
people would delegate their votes sufficiently so that those looking at it
would have sufficient knowledge to participate meaningfully. &#160;I would also
possibly envisage a system whereby those to whom votes were delegated would
attract financial rewards according to the number of votes delegated to
them. &#160;This would essentially be designed to remunerate them for the time
investment that they would make.

The method of delegation would need considerable thought. &#160;The following are
just initial ideas:&#160;
    &#128;    having a default delegation to an elected representative (under the
old system), at least initially, for all issues where no responsibility had
been allocated elsewhere and also those where no personal vote (including a
'no-vote') was cast by the voter;
    &#128;    subsequently having each voter being able to set a different
default delegation on each issue or group of issues;
    &#128;    delegatees having a default delegation, leading forward in a chain
until a high enough level of delegatee (potentially being an elected
representative (under the old system));
    &#128;    thus there being someone, ultimately, who has responsibility or
incentive to vote or who actively chooses not to;
    &#128;    if people choose to have no ultimate default delegation then this
would have an effect something like not voting at an election now - it would
open potential for much non-participation;
    &#128;    voters/those delegated to receiving email feedback of their
actions/the actions taken for them, their voting patterns and level of
participation, and potentially emails warning them that their delegate has
failed to vote by an initial deadline, and giving them time to make a
subsequent vote.
The issues around delegation are difficult and would also, I think, evolve
gradually from the point of transition.


These ideas are not intended to be a complete answer to the question, just
some input that will I hope is useful for some elements.

Tom
