2. Recruiting: Professorship of Internet Governance and Regulation
--------------------------------------------------

Oxford Internet Institute in association with Keble College

The University of Oxford intends to make an appointment to the Professorship
of Internet Governance and Regulation in the Oxford Internet Institute (OII)
from 1 October 2010, or as soon as possible thereafter. The professor will
play a central role in maintaining the OII as an internationally leading
research centre that shapes policy and practice in internet governance and
regulation.

The successful candidate will be a scholar of international standing with a
distinguished and active record of high-quality publication and recognised
intellectual leadership in the social sciences (such as economics or
information studies), law and policy or computing sciences and a recognised
intellectual leader in research on the policy and regulatory issues
concerning the market and non-market shaping of the internet&#8217;s role in the
innovation, production and distribution of information and communication
products and services.

The appointee will be expected to manage advanced collaborative research
projects, to publish in high quality academic outlets and to present his or
her work in ways that engage practitioners and the policy community in its
substance and significance. He or she must demonstrate a record of success
in obtaining and managing research funding in areas that cross traditional
disciplinary boundaries. The successful candidate will also be expected to
play a central role in postgraduate teaching, and therefore must demonstrate
an ability to teach at postgraduate level and to work effectively with
colleagues as part of a professional team.
