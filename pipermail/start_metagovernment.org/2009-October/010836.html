<PRE>Perhaps this might be of interest with respect to another example of the use cases for the sort of tools being considered to help plan (govern) the OpenGov/eDemocracy conference.  

Ideally, the prospective participants would determine the focus (objectives) of each session in which they would like to participate, as well as the time, date, and venue if it is to be a F2F event. (Their &quot;votes&quot; might be weighted in accordance with their degree of certainty/commitment to participate, including any contributions they may be willing and able to make in advance.)

If the &quot;event&quot; is to be virtual, thus removing needless constraints based upon time and space, the effect might be to create an ongoing dialogue until such time as the participants feel their shared objective has been achieved (or they agree to disagree and amicably part company due to having differing objectives).

Looks fine to me, Omar.  Have the date and venue been determined?

As soon as the details are available, I'll post the agenda at <A HREF="http://firmcouncil.org/programs.htm">http://firmcouncil.org/programs.htm</A> 

In the meantime, if the date has been determined, I'll post it at <A HREF="http://firmcouncil.org/calendar.htm">http://firmcouncil.org/calendar.htm</A>  It might also be good for you to post a save-the-date notice on the <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">announcements at firmcounicl.org</A> listserv, particularly if it may take awhile to firm up the details.

Abstract for FIRM&#8217;s Fall 2009 Program

In our Spring 2009 program we discussed and reviewed the entities
within our own organizations which are of value and support to
information and records management professionals.   We saw how our
understanding of the Information Technology (IT) role in the Federal
Enterprise Architecture (FEA) was of value in identifying mutual points
of interest within IT.   We also had presentations from legal counsel
and information security perspectives.  These two expositions helped us
visualized internal agency resources sharing mutual interest with our
discipline.

Continuing the general theme of resources beneficial to records and
information management, this year&#8217;s Fall Program will explore federal
resources available to our discipline.   The program will explore
several value-added information support services currently available
from other federal agencies:

	NARA&#8217;s Federal Record Center (FRC).   A presentation of
records and information management services available through the
existing Inter-Government Agreement (IGA)  already in place and used by
most federal agencies using FRC resources.   The topic includes
information restoration, conversion, and eDelivery services among
others.
	Web Site:  <A HREF="http://www.archives.gov/frc/">http://www.archives.gov/frc/</A> 


	UNICOR Federal Prison Industries.   This government-owned
corporation provides a wide variety of federal products and services
including but not limited to military equipment, vehicle maintenance,
furniture, and computer materials recycling to name a few.   The federal
staff of UNICOR will be presenting digital conversion services available
as alternative to offshore international alternatives for sensitive and
non-sensitive information.
	Web Site:  <A HREF="http://www.unicor.gov/services/">http://www.unicor.gov/services/</A> 


	Government Printing Office (GPO)   Aside from the printed media
services, GPO has a number of digital media products and services of
value to our discipline.   Staff from their Creative and Digital Media
Services will present and explore information delivery services
including but not limited to optical, Web-based, and streaming digital
video content.   Other areas of interest will include guidance on 508
compliance, Web 2.0, digital graphics services, and best practices in
these areas.

	General Services Administration (GSA).  TBD
