<PRE>Hi Michael,
I think that the changes in the group was more an acknowledgement than a
plan of action.

We mostly realised that the list had already changed into a place where
people from many different projects were gathering. And the wiki did
represent that. I don't think it is realistic to think that suddenly we are
all going to collaborate from a code point of view with each other. Exactly
because each of us has its own project. I think the maximum that we can hope
is to get some feedback from each other on the latest ideas we had, and the
latest development we reached. What we could do (and we are doing) is from
time to time to outsource particular decisions from this group, using one or
the other tool. And somehow when people are not using a tool that is already
a feedback (although not a pleasant one... Vilfredo is dying).

Once some of those projects suceed in being really good we could use them
for particular part of our discussion project.

What were you expecting that has not happened?
Not in general, but in practical terms.

regards,
Pietro

&gt;<i> To Metagov and the other projects,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some months ago, we shared ideas about working together in
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy.  We were looking for ways of cooperating, instead of just
</I>&gt;<i> promoting our own projects, or ganging up in consortiums.  We had a
</I>&gt;<i> long discussion.  In response to that discussion, Ed Pastore initiated
</I>&gt;<i> a reorganization of Metagov.  Metagov was to stop promoting its own
</I>&gt;<i> software (Metascore, aka Candiwi) and become a neutral umbrella group,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;where all the great ideas of the various projects can be bounced off
</I>&gt;<i> each other and promoted together.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-June/001623.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-June/001623.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In retrospect, has this worked out?  In other words:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Has the discussion of ideas increased?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Has Metagov worked to foster cooperation among the various
</I>&gt;<i>     projects?  Has the level of cooperation increased, as a result?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3. Has Metagov become neutral with regard to Metascore/Candiwi?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given all the energy that went into the earlier discussion, it's worth
</I>&gt;<i> a look back, if only for a sense of closure.  I still believe that
</I>&gt;<i> openess and cooperation are the missing ingredients in e-democracy.  I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt that any progress can be made until the first two projects start
</I>&gt;<i> cooperating, in a way that openly invites a third.  And so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't we be moving forward, in this direction?
