<PRE>Not sure what's all about Facebook for e-democracy here... maybe we have
different thoughts.
I agree that FB is a very nice platform with very well done features.
I would also agree with the statement that it could be a good place for
e-democracy movements *IF* started by Civil Society *BUT NOT* if
promoted by Governments as a way to take seriously into account
citizen's input (at maximum it could be used for institutional
propaganda, and communication of results).

But if governments start using FB to create their e-participation tools,
well then we are far away from real e-democracy. The only and simple
fact that FB is &quot;closed-source&quot; and governments can't be sure of how FB
treats their and citizen's data is alone a non-go. Let alone talking
about EU governments, as FB is a US-based company.

The EUGAGER proposal we submitted was thought to be supported by
governments as an alternative to facebook (it does not exclude
integrations for non-secure apps), but it would provide citizen's and
govs with &quot;secure&quot; apps that can really be trusted (not only in terms of
identification, but also data integrity and checking). And of course be
fully-auditable open-source.  (soon news about that... :-)

Maybe you guys were suggesting FB for grassroot apps created by citizens
and for the citizens... I just wanted to be sure that when we talk about
real governments supporting open and transparent governance it does not
mean using facebook to interact 2-way with citizens for serious stuff...

my 2 cents ;-)
