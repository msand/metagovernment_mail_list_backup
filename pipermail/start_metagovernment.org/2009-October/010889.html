&gt;<i>  1. Has the discussion of ideas increased?
</I>
I haven't seen nearly as much discussion as I had hoped. But then  
again, there have been some good discussions and overall this  
community's activity comes and goes in waves. So we may just be at a  
sort of low-tide event right now.

I do have an idea to spur discussion, which would be for each Active  
Project to be the focus of discussion for a week. Sort of a precursor  
to the exposition event we were discussing for the conference. That  
is, one project posts a brief description of what it is and how it  
works, and others comment on it for the rest of the week. The next  
week, another project does the same.

&gt;<i>  2. Has Metagov worked to foster cooperation among the various
</I>&gt;<i>     projects?  Has the level of cooperation increased, as a result?
</I>
As Pietro noted, there are some barriers to cooperation, but I do  
think there is a lot more we could be doing.

And I sincerely believe that a formal conference would be a real  
energizing event for this group. However, I have had little luck in  
energizing the community to get around to thinking about organizing  
the conference in the first place.

&gt;<i>  3. Has Metagov become neutral with regard to Metascore/Candiwi?
</I>
By my perception it has. The wiki has been mostly modified to take a  
group approach, and discussions on the list are certainly not limited  
to Candiwi. I should note that I personally consider myself to also be  
a part of the Candiwi project and I very much want it to succeed  
(because I am very fond of the distributed, ground-up approach)... but  
by no means do I want that at the expense of any other project. I  
communicate with various individuals about Metagov all the time, and I  
tend to then suggest a specific project based on what that  
individual's particular philosophy indicates would be the best match  
for them. I think it would be a fantastic world where there were 5-10  
mature, mainstream projects all being adopted by different communities/ 
governments around the world. Like the food-court at a shopping mall,  
there is strength in numbers; even among competitors.
