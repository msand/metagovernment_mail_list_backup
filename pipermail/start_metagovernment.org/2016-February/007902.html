<PRE>The United States has two main parties.  Here in Oregon we also have a
third.  Each state is of course different but we like to innovate
sometimes.  So what a major party does is get 5% of the votes in a major
statewide race and then they can have a state supported primary just like
the cool kids.  I think our third is Green.

There are minor parties and quite a few here but they just get together and
sign up members and if they have enough members then they can do the
paperwork and pay the money and be on the ballot for the general election.

There is here a minor party Independent.  Oops, that is actually the new
major party.  However if I am not dating anyone I can sign up as
Unaffiliated.

Offices are either partisan or non-partisan but everyone knows the
candidates party and vote accordingly.

As an unaffiliated I can vote in the primary for any partisan office,
except maybe the Independent party is talking about having an open primary.

But as Unaffiliated there is a statute and regs so I can be nominated to
run for partisan office.  This has never been tried.  The only reason it is
there is because the pros did not think the net would be important.  Last I
talked to the secretry of state's office in early 2012 they became
uncooperative.  Grin.

I think I will try to implement this.

The motivation is that the existing majors are going to be gone shortly
anyway and it would be good to get rid of the winner take all in the POTUS
race anyway.  This has a local value because of rural urban splits.
Underlying is the thought that an available software aid would structure
this In a useful way.

Questions?
