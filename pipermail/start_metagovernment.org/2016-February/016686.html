<PRE>I'm somewhat of an anarchist to a degree.
BTW happy early birthday Ned I saw it was coming up the other day.
I don't necessarily believe we need to be governed I believe we need rules
not government I believe we can govern ourselves once a good system is in
place.
That's why I like Metagovernment so much I actually had the idea then when
I was researching I came across Metagovernment in my research and saw you
guys already had started the project.
If I didn't say it before I'm huge into metaphysics and witchcraft and
secret societies I became very interested and started researching these
areas when I was researching freemasonry and government.
I was studying the psychological aspect of controlling the government so I
had to see what they did and that led me into witchcraft and paganism as
all our leaders this is thier religion of choice.

&gt;<i> Hi everybody,

</I>&gt;<i> let's talk again. I was reading a little bit and here are some notes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reading Amartya Sen I replaced my quest for rationality for
</I>&gt;<i> humanism. Stating that being good to each other is a quest by itself. No
</I>&gt;<i> higher goals than that. (Still it caused just minimal changes to my
</I>&gt;<i> project:). What is your quest?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social
</I>&gt;<i> ecology is better IMHO. Is it helpful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to me.
</I>&gt;<i> It was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support flat
</I>&gt;<i> large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It might be
</I>&gt;<i> different later, but society needs to be stronger before that ( /I will be
</I>&gt;<i> also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of
</I>&gt;<i> libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I would
</I>&gt;<i> like to try to replace his delegates with information system, since their
</I>&gt;<i> role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but now
</I>&gt;<i> even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, act- when
</I>&gt;<i> confused start again - it will move you forward. Well at least I like it
</I>&gt;<i> that way:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
