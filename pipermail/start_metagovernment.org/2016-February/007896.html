<PRE>Hi everybody,

let's talk again. I was reading a little bit and here are some notes.

After reading Amartya Sen I replaced my quest for rationality for humanism.
Stating that being good to each other is a quest by itself. No higher goals
than that. (Still it caused just minimal changes to my project:). What is
your quest?

As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social engineering
papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social ecology is
better IMHO. Is it helpful?

I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to me. It
was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support flat
large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It might be
different later, but society needs to be stronger before that ( /I will be
also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?

Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of
libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I would
like to try to replace his delegates with information system, since their
role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?

Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?

It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but now
even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, act- when
confused start again - it will move you forward. Well at least I like it
that way:)

Cheers
M.
