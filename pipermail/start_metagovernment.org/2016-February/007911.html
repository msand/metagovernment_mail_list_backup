<PRE>Hi,

one week ago I ordered old IBM R50e laptop from site similar to ebay. It
came with Czech post. Yesterday I have found some empty holes without
screws and some other signs of very unprofessional assembly. I contacted
seller. Old man was really surprised, but willing to ship me my screws for
free. But when I told him about bad assembly. He just sad, that somebody
was playing with my machine maybe in post. He was servicing these machines
as long as they exist. The auction photos support his statements, PC is OK
there.

My question is, who was playing with my laptop? Who needed to take keyboard
out?

What would you do?

I will probably buy another just in case that I was attacked by somebody
who wanted to steal my credit card numbers.

There is no way for me how to protect against government. I was trying
Tails, still there is no way how to communicate privately with ordinary
people, they have no PGPs etc. So, I will go back to mainstream
communication tools. We need to spread messages, not to hide.
Right?

Cheers
Michael
