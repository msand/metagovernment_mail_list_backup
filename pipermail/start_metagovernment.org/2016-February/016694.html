<PRE>Sorry Max, my video may have been sent out of the context.
I will make you a comparison by personal experience as italian.
The reality in Italy is that we are more politicised and our energy is
waisted by manipulated TV debates where the presenter carefully give time
to the supported politician and non in a very subtle way to present the
agenda of the ruling party.
There is a secret (not so anymore) deal between the two major party
(italian dem. rep.) to keep the status quo and the real opposition that
last election collected a majority of the vote by a microfraction is not
given the opportunity to govern because to control the power the third
party (the looser) split into two and on side formed a coalition with the
second (looser too by a fraction), the result is. STATUS QUO.
We are governed by a non winner because of secret deal. I am ashamed by
this political scenario but I believe that was directly imported from the
US.
The biggest fraud is that the unaffiliated people during last election
where driven to vote by a famous Italian comedian promising to establish a
direct democracy by telematic mean. Promise that was never put in place and
the telematic platform (that after two year from the election was
presented) is closed source and for people like the member of
Tecnologiedemocratiche.it like me that we even try it out is a classic top
to bottom system where people cannot propose but only vote for proposal
made by the elected.
Consider that Airesis was strongly promoted within the new movement and was
offered 2 months before the election to the comedian but never implemented.
Actually was used to spot the non aligned and to kick them out of the
movement!
What i want to say here is, even if you get the unaffiliated to vote the
two major party will neutralise the possible next big winner by the system
that is already well oiled to keep the status quo. You have critical mind
so I guess you can see that the only way IMHO is to create critical mass by
a bottom up structured sw. A silent revolution that with overwhelming
number will change the sick status quo.
Kind Regards

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The United States has two main parties.  Here in Oregon we also have a

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes.  So what a major party does is get 5% of the votes in a major
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> statewide race and then they can have a state supported primary just like
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the cool kids.  I think our third is Green.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There are minor parties and quite a few here but they just get together

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There is here a minor party Independent.  Oops, that is actually the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> new major party.  However if I am not dating anyone I can sign up as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Unaffiliated.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Offices are either partisan or non-partisan but everyone knows the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As an unaffiliated I can vote in the primary for any partisan office,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But as Unaffiliated there is a statute and regs so I can be nominated
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to run for partisan office.  This has never been tried.  The only reason it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is there is because the pros did not think the net would be important.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Last I talked to the secretry of state's office in early 2012 they became
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> uncooperative.  Grin.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think I will try to implement this.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The motivation is that the existing majors are going to be gone shortly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anyway and it would be good to get rid of the winner take all in the POTUS
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> race anyway.  This has a local value because of rural urban splits.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Underlying is the thought that an available software aid would structure
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this In a useful way.
