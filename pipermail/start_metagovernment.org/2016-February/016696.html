</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; let's talk again. I was reading a little bit and here are some notes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; After reading Amartya Sen I replaced my quest for rationality for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; humanism. Stating that being good to each other is a quest by itself.
</I>No
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; higher goals than that. (Still it caused just minimal changes to my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; project:). What is your quest?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Until &quot;we&quot; (populations, humanity, whoever) have decided how to decide,
</I>we
&gt;<i> &gt; cannot decide anything else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And probably the most important aspect of this is deciding *who*
</I>&gt;<i> decides. My own opinion is that our biggest problem in this area is
</I>&gt;<i> that representative government is fundamentally and fatally flawed
</I>&gt;<i> because the people who choose to run for office in these systems are
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically very different from the people they are supposed to be
</I>&gt;<i> representing. They cannot make appropriate decisions for us because
</I>&gt;<i> they simply are not like us.
</I>Good
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does Amartya Sen have anything interesting to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say about the matter of how to decide?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've run down pretty much all the major philosophers (political and
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise), including Sen, and have come to the conclusion that they
</I>&gt;<i> don't really have much to offer in this debate because their proposals
</I>&gt;<i> all fail to address two major points:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Philosophers as a whole are obsessed with what is &quot;good&quot; and/or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;virtuous&quot; but seem blind to the fact that even the definitions of
</I>&gt;<i> these things depends entirely on context: What is &quot;virtuous&quot; in an era
</I>&gt;<i> of plentiful resources and stable social and political systems may be
</I>&gt;<i> unworkable or even actually be harmful in an era of scarce resources
</I>&gt;<i> (war, famine, zombie apocalypse, alien invasion, etc. ;-) In
</I>&gt;<i> particular, none of them I've found have have incorporated the process
</I>&gt;<i> of progress in technology or scientific knowledge into their systems.
</I>&gt;<i> A good example of this being the scientific determination that
</I>&gt;<i> homosexuality is an anatomical/physiological phenomenon and not a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of social or personal choice: From a social engineering
</I>&gt;<i> perspective (which IMHO is the only one that can be reliably
</I>&gt;<i> distinguished from the mental masturbation that is characteristic of
</I>&gt;<i> most philosophy) whether it's acceptable to discriminate against gays
</I>&gt;<i> depends not on some fuzzy feeling about whether it's &quot;good&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;virtuous&quot;, but merely on whether doing so has any beneficial effect
</I>&gt;<i> on individuals or society as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Philosophers, like politicians, are essentially proposing to do
</I>&gt;<i> social engineering without having any particular knowledge of
</I>&gt;<i> psychology or engineering. This is just malpractice IMHO. We ought not
</I>&gt;<i> to listen to anyone's proposals in these areas unless they include at
</I>&gt;<i> least some claim about how their proposals will affect individuals
</I>&gt;<i> (particularly their level of stress) and how stable they would be
</I>&gt;<i> given human social behavior. Marx I think is the best example here of
</I>&gt;<i> what happens when you dabble in social engineering but only have a
</I>&gt;<i> philosophical perspective on the issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not persuasive, but I will think about the stress indicator.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; engineering papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ecology is better IMHO. Is it helpful?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does the field of social ecology have anything interesting to say about
</I>the
&gt;<i> &gt; matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Keep in mind that creating a new decisionmaking system is an
</I>&gt;<i> *engineering* problem, not an scientific or philosophical question.
</I>&gt;<i> Social science can certainly help us evaluate the success of a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal (measure the &quot;match&quot; between a decision and the people it
</I>&gt;<i> would apply to, measure the level of stress after a proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> implemented, etc.) but I think probably doesn't have much to say about
</I>&gt;<i> the engineering choices we have to make in creating the new system.
</I>&gt;<i> Whether political philosophy has anything to contribute, I'm less sure
</I>&gt;<i> about ;-)
</I>
Sure, we have limited engineering choices, still we decide what to build.
You would like to build something maybe &quot;reassuring&quot;. Me something maybe
&quot;hospitable&quot;. Both simplifications have flaws. In Europe, family of foreign
ethnicity may raise stress, but that is IMHO acceptable in some low stress
period. Being hospitable to torturer is self-destructive...
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to
</I>me.
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support flat
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; different later, but society needs to be stronger before that ( /I
</I>will be
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They seem to be very rare in my experience. Your best bet is to look
</I>&gt;<i> for radical libertarians: Many of them are actually anarchists IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> even though they don't call themselves that. Unfortunately it is also
</I>&gt;<i> my experience that you won't get very far in trying to understand
</I>&gt;<i> them: They're like religious fundamentalists in that respect and run
</I>&gt;<i> away if you probe their philosophies more than superficially.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I
</I>would
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; like to try to replace his delegates with information system, since
</I>their
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Source: <A HREF="http://www.democracynature.org/vol1/bookchin_libertarian.htm">http://www.democracynature.org/vol1/bookchin_libertarian.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the article above, I failed to find anything new and interesting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regarding the matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations).
</I>Did I
&gt;<i> &gt; miss something?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's interesting to see Bookchin walking back from his previous
</I>&gt;<i> anarcho-syndicalism, but I don't see any real enlightenment WRT what
</I>&gt;<i> the real issues are in creating a political or economic system (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> he ignores the issue of context, and the issues of social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but
</I>now
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, act-
</I>when
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; confused start again - it will move you forward. Well at least I like
</I>it
&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that way:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's like the benefits the teacher gets from teaching: You never know
</I>&gt;<i> you understand something until you can explain it to someone else. It
</I>&gt;<i> used to bother me that the MG list members could never use our systems
</I>&gt;<i> to come to agreement on anything (in the technology field it's called
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;eating your own dog food&quot;, and it is a common belief that any company
</I>&gt;<i> that can't claim to be doing that is doomed to failure eventually).
</I>&gt;<i> But it doesn't bother me so much lately: This list and that site has
</I>&gt;<i> value even if we're just using it to get our stories straight. There's
</I>&gt;<i> no need to agree on any of these principles anyway: Our decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> systems will succeed or fail based on whether they can be used to make
</I>&gt;<i> decisions in the domain of public policy, not political philosophy.
