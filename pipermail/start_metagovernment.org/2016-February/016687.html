It seems that we believe the same.
The question I would like to ask is, how to tame capitalism in consistence
with anarchism. I believe that predefined mass-organizing is not in
anarchist arsenal (no matter that is not hierarchical).

&gt;<i> That's why I like Metagovernment so much I actually had the idea then

you guys already had started the project.
&gt;<i> If I didn't say it before I'm huge into metaphysics and witchcraft and
</I>secret societies I became very interested and started researching these
areas when I was researching freemasonry and government.
&gt;<i> I was studying the psychological aspect of controlling the government so
</I>I had to see what they did and that led me into witchcraft and paganism as
all our leaders this is thier religion of choice.

And how is it going? What are the weak spots of government that result from
witchcraft and paganism?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi everybody,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let's talk again. I was reading a little bit and here are some notes.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After reading Amartya Sen I replaced my quest for rationality for
</I>humanism. Stating that being good to each other is a quest by itself. No
higher goals than that. (Still it caused just minimal changes to my
project:). What is your quest?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social
</I>engineering papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social
ecology is better IMHO. Is it helpful?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to me.
</I>It was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support flat
large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It might be
different later, but society needs to be stronger before that ( /I will be
also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of
</I>libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I would
like to try to replace his delegates with information system, since their
role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but now
</I>even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, act- when
confused start again - it will move you forward. Well at least I like it
that way:)
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers
