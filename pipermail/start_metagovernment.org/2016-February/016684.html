</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> let's talk again. I was reading a little bit and here are some notes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After reading Amartya Sen I replaced my quest for rationality for 
</I>&gt;<i> humanism. Stating that being good to each other is a quest by itself. 
</I>&gt;<i> No higher goals than that. (Still it caused just minimal changes to my 
</I>&gt;<i> project:). What is your quest?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Until &quot;we&quot; (populations, humanity, whoever) have decided how to decide, 
we cannot decide anything else. Does Amartya Sen have anything 
interesting to say about the matter of how to decide?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social 
</I>&gt;<i> engineering papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social 
</I>&gt;<i> ecology is better IMHO. Is it helpful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Does the field of social ecology have anything interesting to say about 
the matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations)?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to 
</I>&gt;<i> me. It was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support 
</I>&gt;<i> flat large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It 
</I>&gt;<i> might be different later, but society needs to be stronger before that 
</I>&gt;<i> ( /I will be also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of 
</I>&gt;<i> libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would like to try to replace his delegates with information system, 
</I>&gt;<i> since their role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?
</I>&gt;<i>

In the article above, I failed to find anything new and interesting 
regarding the matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations). Did 
I miss something?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but 
</I>&gt;<i> now even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, 
</I>&gt;<i> act- when confused start again - it will move you forward. Well at 
</I>&gt;<i> least I like it that way:)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i> M.
