</I>
And probably the most important aspect of this is deciding *who*
decides. My own opinion is that our biggest problem in this area is
that representative government is fundamentally and fatally flawed
because the people who choose to run for office in these systems are
psychologically very different from the people they are supposed to be
representing. They cannot make appropriate decisions for us because
they simply are not like us.

&gt;<i> Does Amartya Sen have anything interesting to
</I>&gt;<i> say about the matter of how to decide?
</I>
I've run down pretty much all the major philosophers (political and
otherwise), including Sen, and have come to the conclusion that they
don't really have much to offer in this debate because their proposals
all fail to address two major points:

1) Philosophers as a whole are obsessed with what is &quot;good&quot; and/or
&quot;virtuous&quot; but seem blind to the fact that even the definitions of
these things depends entirely on context: What is &quot;virtuous&quot; in an era
of plentiful resources and stable social and political systems may be
unworkable or even actually be harmful in an era of scarce resources
(war, famine, zombie apocalypse, alien invasion, etc. ;-) In
particular, none of them I've found have have incorporated the process
of progress in technology or scientific knowledge into their systems.
A good example of this being the scientific determination that
homosexuality is an anatomical/physiological phenomenon and not a
matter of social or personal choice: From a social engineering
perspective (which IMHO is the only one that can be reliably
distinguished from the mental masturbation that is characteristic of
most philosophy) whether it's acceptable to discriminate against gays
depends not on some fuzzy feeling about whether it's &quot;good&quot; or
&quot;virtuous&quot;, but merely on whether doing so has any beneficial effect
on individuals or society as a whole.

2) Philosophers, like politicians, are essentially proposing to do
social engineering without having any particular knowledge of
psychology or engineering. This is just malpractice IMHO. We ought not
to listen to anyone's proposals in these areas unless they include at
least some claim about how their proposals will affect individuals
(particularly their level of stress) and how stable they would be
given human social behavior. Marx I think is the best example here of
what happens when you dabble in social engineering but only have a
philosophical perspective on the issues.

&gt;&gt;<i> As much as I remember Scott was looking for some ethical social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engineering papers. A. Sen may be useful here, but the field of social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ecology is better IMHO. Is it helpful?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does the field of social ecology have anything interesting to say about the
</I>&gt;<i> matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations)?
</I>
Keep in mind that creating a new decisionmaking system is an
*engineering* problem, not an scientific or philosophical question.
Social science can certainly help us evaluate the success of a
proposal (measure the &quot;match&quot; between a decision and the people it
would apply to, measure the level of stress after a proposal is
implemented, etc.) but I think probably doesn't have much to say about
the engineering choices we have to make in creating the new system.
Whether political philosophy has anything to contribute, I'm less sure
about ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> I was also trying to find why local anarchist do not want to talk to me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was obvious, I am not anarchist. The trouble is that I support flat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> large-scale uniform organizing for some decades or century. It might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different later, but society needs to be stronger before that ( /I will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also dead, unable to change my opinion :) Any anarchist here?
</I>
They seem to be very rare in my experience. Your best bet is to look
for radical libertarians: Many of them are actually anarchists IMHO
even though they don't call themselves that. Unfortunately it is also
my experience that you won't get very far in trying to understand
them: They're like religious fundamentalists in that respect and run
away if you probe their philosophies more than superficially.

&gt;&gt;<i> Still what will make us probably different is that I am in favor of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> libertarian municipalism, still with some modification to Bookchin. I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like to try to replace his delegates with information system, since their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> role is just administrative. Anybody has the same opinion?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Source: <A HREF="http://www.democracynature.org/vol1/bookchin_libertarian.htm">http://www.democracynature.org/vol1/bookchin_libertarian.htm</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In the article above, I failed to find anything new and interesting
</I>&gt;<i> regarding the matter of how to decide (at the scale of populations). Did I
</I>&gt;<i> miss something?
</I>
It's interesting to see Bookchin walking back from his previous
anarcho-syndicalism, but I don't see any real enlightenment WRT what
the real issues are in creating a political or economic system (i.e.,
he ignores the issue of context, and the issues of social
engineering).

&gt;&gt;<i> Anyway, enough of nerdiness. What do you do?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It was always good time to write something to this mailing list, but now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even newbie may be sure to get a reply:) Think, read, type, send, act- when

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that way:)
</I>
It's like the benefits the teacher gets from teaching: You never know
you understand something until you can explain it to someone else. It
used to bother me that the MG list members could never use our systems
to come to agreement on anything (in the technology field it's called
&quot;eating your own dog food&quot;, and it is a common belief that any company
that can't claim to be doing that is doomed to failure eventually).
But it doesn't bother me so much lately: This list and that site has
value even if we're just using it to get our stories straight. There's
no need to agree on any of these principles anyway: Our decisionmaking
systems will succeed or fail based on whether they can be used to make
decisions in the domain of public policy, not political philosophy.
