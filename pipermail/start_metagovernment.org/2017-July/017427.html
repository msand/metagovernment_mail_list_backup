<PRE>I suggest to mention the MG and our ML in any of the proposals that may be
generated by members of the MG.
This will draw attention to the effort that we are discussing long before
the GCP was in place given that we have the same goal.
My 2 cents

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Imposing this as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirement not only will result in a winning entry that will fail to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; achieve anything, let alone the goals of the competition,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Big assumption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not assumption, prediction, perhaps even to the level of actual
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;knowledge&quot;. As Spock said:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I
</I>&gt;<i> need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but will likely be such a spectacular failure that it will set back
</I>&gt;<i> progress
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this domain for years or decades.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe. Maybe the winner(s) will work around that in some way. Like
</I>&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that allows the Nation State to remain sovereign, but declares individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sovereignty to be even greater, and/or establishes that *Global Citizens*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are supreme to *Corporate Citizens*. (We could gain a lot of ground just
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instituting the latter.) I think it&#8217;s all about setting our priorities.
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that to me means building a platform whereby we can collaborate in
</I>&gt;<i> crafting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a collective agreement, at scale. With that in place we could perform all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kinds of magic on the current power structures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm certainly not going to rule out the possibility of someone out
</I>&gt;<i> there having an epiphany and coming up with some way around SDAP
</I>&gt;<i> behavior that doesn't involve creating a system that prevents SDAPs
</I>&gt;<i> from climbing into positions of power. But given that so few people
</I>&gt;<i> even realize that this is in fact the problem it seems very unlikely
</I>&gt;<i> to me (i.e., most people are going to need to have back-to-back
</I>&gt;<i> epiphanies to come up with anything even equivalent to DeMP, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> provably better). Unfortunately I see that same blindness in your
</I>&gt;<i> comment above. It just doesn't matter what sort of power-sharing
</I>&gt;<i> system you come up with: If at its root it relies on SDAPs in existing
</I>&gt;<i> government systems (including corporate oligarchies) voluntarily
</I>&gt;<i> ceding power to The People it's a hammer that's going to fall whether
</I>&gt;<i> you see it or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Having their hearts in the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; place does not excuse anyone from the responsibility of ensuring that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The People are not harmed as the result of spending millions of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dollars promoting unworkable or even counterproductive ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you can express your concern without the snarky judgement and
</I>&gt;<i> assumption
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sandwich, you may save your entry from a quick trip to the round file.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; assuming it&#8217;s a real concern and not just some cynical dart you&#8217;re
</I>&gt;<i> throwing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is, but I would concede that it's a pretty minor concern and so can
</I>&gt;<i> probably be left out. The odds of them actually harming anyone or
</I>&gt;<i> stopping people like us from soldiering on are down there in same the
</I>&gt;<i> sub-1% realm that the winning plan will actually amount to anything,
</I>&gt;<i> at least to the extent that it follows the rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And that includes any requirement that the system must prop up
</I>&gt;<i> dictators.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think I see where you&#8217;re coming from. It&#8217;s easy for some billionaire to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; throw a little change at a problem without having thought through the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consequences deeply in his own mind. On top of that, he&#8217;ll likely earn a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; substantial dose of celebrity for being all kinds of cuddly things to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current progressive wave of waking discontent. He might even cover has
</I>&gt;<i> ass
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (consciously or un) by injecting a little safety clause that safeguards
</I>&gt;<i> his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very comfortable (elite) position in the current hierarchy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He's old enough that I doubt he worries about such things. And he
</I>&gt;<i> seems to not have any children, hopefully eliminating any bias he
</I>&gt;<i> might have against a system that deals with oligarchy in part by
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating the custom of inheritance (for the record, though, his
</I>&gt;<i> wife was apparently opposed to forming the GCF).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I wasn't insinuating that I think he has any ulterior motives for
</I>&gt;<i> imposing a requirement that the proposed model not destabilize
</I>&gt;<i> dictatorships (as a goal or merely as a side-effect). I'm sure they
</I>&gt;<i> think imposing such a rule is just a matter of practicality. It's
</I>&gt;<i> possible, though, that they also harbor a niggling fear of being held
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for being the cause of a revolution in some faraway place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we are going to *crowd-source* a new paradigm, I imagine we&#8217;ll need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get very accustomed to working around (what we judge to be) incomplete or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; faulty reasoning without damaging the connection we have with others.
</I>&gt;<i> Tricky
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; business!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tell me about it ;-)  Fortunately this *doesn't* seem to be an issue
</I>&gt;<i> when explaining my system to regular people. Most of them are rightly
</I>&gt;<i> skeptical about its chances, but that always seems to originate from a
</I>&gt;<i> cynicism that there is any possibility of taking the-powers-that-be
</I>&gt;<i> down a notch or two. It seems to not come from perceived flaws in its
</I>&gt;<i> goals or mechanisms (like one gets if one proposes something
</I>&gt;<i> recognizable as libertarianism or communism). Even the most rabid
</I>&gt;<i> constitutionalists I've dealt with (on FB) seem to at least have half
</I>&gt;<i> an open mind about the fact that the US constitution has serious flaws
</I>&gt;<i> and that there might be better ways to organize a government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback: I'll take another stab at pruning back the snark
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
