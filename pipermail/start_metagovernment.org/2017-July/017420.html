There is an overlap in features, for sure. If LQFB was better known
and/or more successful I might have even marketed it this way. But
besides the delegation fail, LQFB makes a big noise about the
multi-proposal feature which I *also* believe doesn't work the way it
was supposed to.

&gt;<i> Still the proposal building does not have a collaborative process and I

</I>
I of course disagree: IMHO proposal generation is something that
should be, and probably can only be, left to experts. I would
therefore challenge you to answer these questions:

1) What evidence do you have that this sort of collaboration results
in better proposals? Certainly this has never been shown to be the
case for LQFB and we've never seen this in any of the experiments this
group has run on any of the other decisionmaking systems (Loomio,
Vilfredo, etc.). In all of those examples the more participation there
is at the proposal generation stage the *worse* it gets...

2) Have you looked closely at the various petition oriented
(slacktivism) sites like  change.org, avaaz.org, or
petitions.whitehouse.gov? Would you be satisfied with that level of
quality in the proposals on an actual decionmaking system?

3) You may not be aware of this, but one feature of proxyfor.me is
that the proposal owner, unlike everyone else, *does* get to see the
running vote count. And of course gets to see all the comments posted.
With the built-in Q&amp;A and versioning features of proxyfor.me, doesn't
that provide a kind of &quot;collaboration&quot; albeit with primarily a one-way
flow from voter to proposer?

4) If you still believe that &quot;collaboration&quot; is necessary, what's to
prevent people using some other tool (Slack, Google Docs, etc.) to
collaborate prior to exposing it to a large population, the majority
of which would not be interested (or even able) to collaborate on the
actual preparation of a proposal?

5) I think the main, and perhaps only, concern in this area is that
proposals that would pass with large supermajorities might be excluded
from the queue by whoever is maintaining it. My main rebuttal to this
is that is what I've said before: If you don't trust the executive
branch of government you've got worse problems than whether your
proposal generation or decisionmaking system have flaws. It agree,
however, that it might be useful to create a separate site (or even
encourage the use of a slacktivism site) as a screening mechanism
where something that gets an endorsement from X% of the voter rolls
*automatically* gets put into the proxyfor.me queue.

Of course I'm not going to hold my breath that you'll be able to
respond to any of these: The recent example of the block-chain and
economic commons proponents on this list simply crawling back under
their rocks when any challenge to their proposals is raised leads me
to believe that I'm pretty good at poking holes in things  ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
