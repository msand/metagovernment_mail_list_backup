<PRE>Scott,

it's not just about better ideas, is a superior model against classic
private vs public property

you can get in touch reading its theories or putting it in practice

this talk (video) is a discussion towards the formalization of a model
that is currently working, and revolutioning our society.

For example, look how big it is that in this communication we are
heavily using tools operated by free software/open source (by diferent
third party entities: email, IETF, Internet, service providers). This
is fairly new approach in our recent history. And is the init for a
new commons revolution, step by step.

Here you have some examples of different revolutions with its great wars:

microsoft vs linux (microsoft is joining open source movement)
private encyclopedias vs wikipedia
private networks vs Internet ( still running -&gt;
<A HREF="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/">https://www.fightforthefuture.org/</A> )



decision making is not a problem (for me), this problem is from some
people to accept the consensus approach

I agree a lot with this guys, and I try to run this way in the
organizations I'm part of (and are governing a commons resource):

In many ways, the IETF runs on the beliefs of its participants. One of
the &quot;founding beliefs&quot; is embodied in an early quote about the IETF
from David Clark: &quot;We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe
in rough consensus and running code&quot;. Another early quote that has
become a commonly-held belief in the IETF comes from Jon Postel: &quot;Be
conservative in what you send and liberal in what you accept&quot;.

found here: <A HREF="https://www.ietf.org/tao.html">https://www.ietf.org/tao.html</A>

Well, in this words, or otehrs, is the suggested way to run a Commons
(common infrastructure, consensus about the rules taking in account
big majority of participants =&gt; consensus)

</I>&gt;<i> arguments that couldn't easily be ripped to shreds by anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> understands both systems) you *still* have to solve the decisionmaking
</I>&gt;<i> problem first in order to implement any replacement. They all seem to
</I>&gt;<i> live in this fantasyland where oligarchs just voluntarily give up
</I>&gt;<i> their power as a response to a small minority of activists asking them
</I>&gt;<i> to do so, armed only with &quot;better ideas&quot;. Has any revolution happened
