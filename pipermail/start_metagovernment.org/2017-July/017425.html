Agreed.

&gt;<i> So here's what I've got in the &quot;argument&quot; section.

(big snip)

&gt;<i> It is simply not possible [IMO] to design a system that corrects for externalities if it is a

</I>&gt;<i> characteristic of the system&#8230;

Very powerful point. Could maybe stand on it&#8217;s own.

&gt;<i> To claim (or even hope) otherwise is merely incompetent social engineering.
</I>
Meh. 

&gt;<i> Imposing this as a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement not only will result in a winning entry that will fail to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve anything, let alone the goals of the competition,
</I>
Big assumption. 

&gt;<i> but will likely be such a spectacular failure that it will set back progress in
</I>&gt;<i> this domain for years or decades.
</I>
Maybe. Maybe the winner(s) will work around that in some way. Like something that allows the Nation State to remain sovereign, but declares individual sovereignty to be even greater, and/or establishes that *Global Citizens*  are supreme to *Corporate Citizens*. (We could gain a lot of ground just by instituting the latter.) I think it&#8217;s all about setting our priorities. And that to me means building a platform whereby we can collaborate in crafting a collective agreement, at scale. With that in place we could perform all kinds of magic on the current power structures.

&gt;<i> Having their hearts in the right
</I>&gt;<i> place does not excuse anyone from the responsibility of ensuring that
</I>&gt;<i> The People are not harmed as the result of spending millions of
</I>&gt;<i> dollars promoting unworkable or even counterproductive ideas.
</I>
If you can express your concern without the snarky judgement and assumption sandwich, you may save your entry from a quick trip to the round file. I&#8217;m assuming it&#8217;s a real concern and not just some cynical dart you&#8217;re throwing.  :)

&gt;<i> And that includes any requirement that the system must prop up dictators.
</I>
I think I see where you&#8217;re coming from. It&#8217;s easy for some billionaire to throw a little change at a problem without having thought through the consequences deeply in his own mind. On top of that, he&#8217;ll likely earn a substantial dose of celebrity for being all kinds of cuddly things to the current progressive wave of waking discontent. He might even cover has ass (consciously or un) by injecting a little safety clause that safeguards his very comfortable (elite) position in the current hierarchy.

Or he could just be a very fortunate man whose had a change of heart and wants to do the right thing, but the extension in his critical thinking hasn&#8217;t yet caught up with the expansion in his heart. It may be that he&#8217;s created the Challenge because he feels incapable of generating some workable solution on his own. Who can say? 

Personally, I see this Challenge as emerging from a greater existential impulse. I think it&#8217;s admirable that you&#8217;ve positioned yourself through what I&#8217;m guessing has been years of deep thinking and hard work such that you have a very well-developed and intelligent model (IMO) that you can contribute to the Challenge. 

If we are going to *crowd-source* a new paradigm, I imagine we&#8217;ll need to get very accustomed to working around (what we judge to be) incomplete or faulty reasoning without damaging the connection we have with others. Tricky business!
