<PRE>First off Scott, kudos to you for having put all of this together. In my mind, it's well-thought-out and has obviously been a lot of work.

I&#8217;m very curious about the outcome of this competition and am hoping we'll have a chance to peruse the top entries, including the ones that don&#8217;t win the big $$$. I appreciate being able to read yours ahead of time and hope you do well!

Overall I would say it&#8217;s &quot;intelligible&quot; and &quot;complete&quot; enough. I read the material on Matchism.org &lt;<A HREF="http://matchism.org/">http://matchism.org/</A>&gt; a while back, so I already have a deeper understanding of your project. I think what you&#8217;re presenting to this competition will certainly get the overall idea across. 

As far as the level of &#8220;snark&#8221;&#8230;. I think you could probably leave out the criticism of those running the competition as being a part of the problem, and still achieve your objective.
&quot;Again this is a decision for The People to make, not some elites running a contest that seeks to &#8220;improve&#8221; things without being willing to compromise on their &#8220;elite&#8221; status (or the elite status of &#8220;leaders&#8221; in other fields or countries) or their preferences for how things should be done.&quot;

&quot;What is wrong, at least with respect [to] what&#8217;s best for the human species as a whole, is for elites of any sort to prescribe the outcomes of public policy decisionmaking, the people running this competition included.&quot;

Also, I noticed a few typos or grammatical errors, like the one in the line above. (Sorry I didn&#8217;t make a note of the others.)

Overall, I find myself agreeing with many aspects of your project. I've been working on a decision-making *process/structure* of my own and am surprised to see how many parallels there are between the two. (At this point I don&#8217;t know if I will be submitting mine to the GCF competition as I&#8217;m not sure I'll have the time to complete it before the 9/30 deadline. And there is a project developing closer to home that may be a more concrete and practical application. We&#8217;ll see.)

Also, I have some questions for you:

1. Is there a limit to the number of votes any one proxy can carry? (You may have stated this on your website but I don&#8217;t remember seeing it, and it&#8217;s a lot of material to reread.)

2. Also, would proxies be aware of how many votes they are representing?

3. I can see how being a proxy (particularly for a large number of people) would be a huge responsibility that might encourage one in that position to become more deeply familiar with the records of candidates, and the complexity of proposals being voted on. I can also see how a large segment of the population, through assigning their votes to a proxy, could ultimately become disengaged from, or abdicate, their civic responsibility by no longer paying as much attention to the issues that matter most. (Not that the malaise of apathy and cynicism generated by our current system is any better.) I&#8217;m curious though if you have a deeper sense of how this might actually play out&#8230;.in real life&#8230;.in that regard?

What I really like about your Plan is how it would make the one-size-fits-all dynamic of political parties obsolete.

All the best,
Steve
