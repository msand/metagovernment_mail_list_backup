Maybe I'm just thick but I've read several of these blockchain
proposals and have never been able to grasp what problem it is that
they're really trying to solve.

Mostly what I come away with is that these people are so obsessed with
the technology that they'll enthusiastically endorse virtually
anything just so long as it uses blockchains. But blockchains are very
slow, non-scalable (they all just break down entirely if more than a
few thousand transactions per second are required), but most damningly
they're simply *not* transparent because you have to trust massive
amounts of code and computing cycles with no possible way to verify
the outcomes by hand. Blockchain proponents need to defend their
proposals vs. open voting (as in proxyfor.me) where you can look
directly at the raw data and see that you're not being screwed over by
some hacker that understands the system better than you do. In the
case of blockchain it means that only approximately 0.000001% of the
population is capable of controlling or even verifying the operation.
Which is exactly the recipe we already have for corruption and
oligarchy...
