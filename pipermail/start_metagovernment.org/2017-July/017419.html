<PRE>Scott I read your proposal and I can say that you did a really good job and
I believe you have a very strong candidate for the Global Challenge.
Proxyfor.me is an advanced LQFB, were the liquid function is automated.
Still the proposal building does not have a collaborative process and I
believe in this fall short.
Kind Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> First off Scott, kudos to you for having put all of this together. In my
</I>&gt;<i> mind, it's well-thought-out and has obviously been a lot of work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m very curious about the outcome of this competition and am hoping we'll
</I>&gt;<i> have a chance to peruse the top entries, including the ones that don&#8217;t win
</I>&gt;<i> the big $$$. I appreciate being able to read yours ahead of time and hope
</I>&gt;<i> you do well!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall I would say it&#8217;s &quot;intelligible&quot; and &quot;complete&quot; enough. I read the
</I>&gt;<i> material on Matchism.org a while back, so I already have a deeper
</I>&gt;<i> understanding of your project. I think what you&#8217;re presenting to this
</I>&gt;<i> competition will certainly get the overall idea across.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as the level of &#8220;snark&#8221;&#8230;. I think you could probably leave out the
</I>&gt;<i> criticism of those running the competition as being a part of the problem,
</I>&gt;<i> and still achieve your objective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Again this is a decision for The People to make, not some elites running
</I>&gt;<i> a contest that seeks to &#8220;improve&#8221; things without being willing to
</I>&gt;<i> compromise on their &#8220;elite&#8221; status (or the elite status of &#8220;leaders&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> in other fields or countries) or their preferences for how things should be
</I>&gt;<i> done.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What is wrong, at least with respect [to] what&#8217;s best for the human
</I>&gt;<i> species as a whole, is for elites of any sort to prescribe the outcomes of
</I>&gt;<i> public policy decisionmaking, the people running this competition included.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I noticed a few typos or grammatical errors, like the one in the
</I>&gt;<i> line above. (Sorry I didn&#8217;t make a note of the others.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Overall, I find myself agreeing with many aspects of your project. I've
</I>&gt;<i> been working on a decision-making *process/structure* of my own and am
</I>&gt;<i> surprised to see how many parallels there are between the two. (At this
</I>&gt;<i> point I don&#8217;t know if I will be submitting mine to the GCF competition as
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m not sure I'll have the time to complete it before the 9/30 deadline.
</I>&gt;<i> And there is a project developing closer to home that may be a more
</I>&gt;<i> concrete and practical application. We&#8217;ll see.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have some questions for *you:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Is there a limit to the number of votes any one proxy can carry? (You
</I>&gt;<i> may have stated this on your website but I don&#8217;t remember seeing it, and
</I>&gt;<i> it&#8217;s a lot of material to reread.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Also, would proxies be aware of how many votes they are representing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I can see how being a proxy (particularly for a large number of people)
</I>&gt;<i> would be a huge responsibility that might encourage one in that position to
</I>&gt;<i> become more deeply familiar with the records of candidates, and the
</I>&gt;<i> complexity of proposals being voted on. I can also see how a large segment
</I>&gt;<i> of the population, through assigning their votes to a proxy, could
</I>&gt;<i> ultimately become disengaged from, or abdicate, their civic responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> by no longer paying as much attention to the issues that matter most. (Not
</I>&gt;<i> that the malaise of apathy and cynicism generated by our current system is
</I>&gt;<i> any better.) I&#8217;m curious though if you have a deeper sense of how this
</I>&gt;<i> might actually play out&#8230;.in real life&#8230;.in that regard?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I *really* like about your Plan is how it would make the
</I>&gt;<i> one-size-fits-all dynamic of political parties obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Steve

</I>&gt;<i> Here's the current draft of my entry for the GCF prize:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/GCF_entry.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/GCF_entry.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Questions:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is it intelligible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Is the argument complete, or are there holes to be filled?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Is the level of snark appropriate (I didn't follow the rules, and
</I>&gt;<i> make specific arguments about why this is necessary and why any entry
</I>&gt;<i> that does follow the rules is doomed to failure).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) I came in at 5100 words for the description (close to the 5500 word
</I>&gt;<i> max), but am well under for the other two sections. Have I &quot;left money
</I>&gt;<i> on the table&quot; by doing this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For anyone who hasn't read matchism.org or my other white papers, this
</I>&gt;<i> is a good summary of the system and includes only a skeleton
</I>&gt;<i> description of the philosophy behind it. It'd therefore be especially
</I>&gt;<i> helpful to get your take on it to make sure I didn't leave too much
</I>&gt;<i> out.
