I'm still struggling with this. I removed all the snark from the model
description section, but am left with a big hole about why the model
doesn't comply with the rules. And so I do believe it's necessary to
confront this issue, and in fact also believe that the people running
the contest *are* likely to be a part of the problem if their winning
entry goes pear-shaped: I'd give any winning entry that follows the
rules about a 99% chance of amounting to nothing, but about a 1%
chance of resulting in global instability (knowing what I know about
human and government behavior, I'd estimate the chances of it actually
achieving the desired outcome at essentially 0%).

So here's what I've got in the &quot;argument&quot; section. Unfortunately I
think it goes beyond mere snark to outright hostility, but &quot;No guts,
no glory&quot;, right?

1. Core Values.

It is admittedly a leap of faith that a truly accurate democratic
decisionmaking system will facilitate the stated goals of the GCP
(&#8220;the good of all humanity&#8221;, &#8220;respect for the equal value of all human
beings&#8221;, etc.). Nor is there even any guarantee that it will &#8220;solve&#8221;
the climate change or any other environmental problem in any way that
has been proposed or predicted so far. But it is (or will be) what it
is: A reflection of the Will of The People. To predict that the result
of this change will be counter to any particular set of moral
principles would mean believing that existing government architectures
(dictatorship, oligarchy, and misrepresentative democracy) are somehow
more motivated or able to achieve them. Does anyone believe that?

But what happens if The People decide to not change their lifestyles
by reducing their energy consumption but instead decide that their
response to climate change will be an adaptation strategy where they
force (albeit also fund) the relocation of people in low-elevation
nations/areas? While this would be a &#8220;failure&#8221; by the criteria
implicitly imposed for the GCP, it is hard to make a coherent argument
that it is actually &#8220;wrong&#8221;: What is wrong, at least with respect
what&#8217;s best for the human species as a whole, is for elites of any
sort to prescribe the outcomes of public policy decisionmaking, The
Will of The People be damned.

This means that although the proposed model has a large overlap with
the overall goals and specific requirements for this competition, it
explicitly and by design does not comply with all of them. The choice
here is clear: You can either prescribe the outcome of a
decisionmaking process and design a system to achieve that result, or
you can decide in advance to accept the result of a global and truly
democratic process and then work to create a system that implements
that process, even if that means putting aside your prescriptions
(biases) about how (or even whether) any particular problem is solved.
In other words, It is simply inappropriate to include requirements
such as &#8220;decisions within the governance model must not deal with the
internal affairs of individual states&#8221;: Again this is a decision for
The People to make, not some elites running a contest that seeks to
&#8220;improve&#8221; things without being willing to compromise on their &#8220;elite&#8221;
status (or the elite status of &#8220;leaders&#8221; in other fields or countries)
or their preferences for how things should be done.

Unfortunately there is an even bigger  misconception that the Global
Challenges Prize (GCP) rules seem to be based on, a requirement that
is also deliberately disregarded in this entry:  It is simply not
possible to design a system that corrects for externalities if it is a
requirement that misrepresentation remain a fundamental  operating
characteristic of the system (i.e., that &#8220;This requirement eliminates
models that rely on time-consuming and controversial changes in the
political system of individual states, e.g. models that postulate that
all states should be democracies.&#8221;). To claim (or even hope) otherwise
is merely incompetent social engineering. Imposing this as a
requirement not only will result in a winning entry that will fail to
achieve anything, let alone the goals of the competition, but will
likely be such a spectacular failure that it will set back progress in
this domain for years or decades. Having their hearts in the right
place does not excuse anyone from the responsibility of ensuring that
The People are not harmed as the result of spending millions of
dollars promoting unworkable or even counterproductive ideas. And that
includes any requirement that the system must prop up dictators.
