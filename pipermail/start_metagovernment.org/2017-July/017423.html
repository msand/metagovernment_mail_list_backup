I believe this to be the natural mode of human decisionmaking: It's
essentially how &quot;public policy&quot; decisions were made by members of our
species for millions of years before technological advances supported
the development of hierarchical forms of government.

&gt;<i> Giving everyone a vote, whether directly or by proxy, is relatively easy. Crowd-sourcing a collaborative social-organism that can successfully manage it's own affairs is the real design challenge. And scaling it to regional and global levels adds an even greater level of complexity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It doesn't seem that daunting to me: The trick is to use the *same*
system for all levels, and even the same proposals, at least to the
greatest extent possible. For example everyone votes using the same
system on the same proposal (e.g., the last proposal on proxyfor.me,
the &quot;Idaho stop&quot;) but it only becomes binding in those localities
where it passes by majority vote. Eventually natural flow of people
and culture between localities will have the effect of homogenizing
public policy, reducing the level of conflict between localities.

&gt;<i> I actually believe these constraints are surmountable. Indeed, I think to some degree, they&#8217;ve already been solved for. The greatest challenge, as I see it, is to bootstrap a System that&#8217;s completely unfamiliar...through a collaborative global mindset that doesn&#8217;t yet exist.
</I>
I.e., it's a marketing problem, not a technical problem. Proxyfor.me
*seems* to work and can easily be scaled to a worldwide population.
The problem is that people have to *believe* that it can change things
long before it will have any chance to actually do so. This is hard to
do without either having a lot of money, a population that is under
severe stress and so is willing to try anything, and/or a charismatic
leader.

The more scary part for me is that this is a &quot;tipping point&quot; kind of
thing, where once momentum starts to build the transition will occur
incredibly rapidly. Cars and cell phones and even computers were
niche-market kinds of things for years or decades and this worked to
the benefit of the technology because a physical infrastructure had to
be developed to support them, allowing time to work out the bugs.
Cultural changes can happen *much* more rapidly even when the
&quot;technology&quot; isn't quite ready, the various fascist and communist
revolutions being demonstrations of that problem. I worry a lot less
about what level of collaboration and consensus is required to make a
system optimal than about the people getting the idea in their heads
that they deserve something better and things going all haywire when
the technology turns out to have problematic emergent properties.

    Scott
