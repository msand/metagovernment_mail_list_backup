Not assumption, prediction, perhaps even to the level of actual
&quot;knowledge&quot;. As Spock said:

&quot;If I let go of a hammer on a planet that has a positive gravity, I
need not see it fall to know that it has in fact fallen.&quot;

</I>
I'm certainly not going to rule out the possibility of someone out
there having an epiphany and coming up with some way around SDAP
behavior that doesn't involve creating a system that prevents SDAPs
from climbing into positions of power. But given that so few people
even realize that this is in fact the problem it seems very unlikely
to me (i.e., most people are going to need to have back-to-back
epiphanies to come up with anything even equivalent to DeMP, let alone
provably better). Unfortunately I see that same blindness in your
comment above. It just doesn't matter what sort of power-sharing
system you come up with: If at its root it relies on SDAPs in existing
government systems (including corporate oligarchies) voluntarily
ceding power to The People it's a hammer that's going to fall whether
you see it or not.

&gt;<i> &gt; Having their hearts in the right
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place does not excuse anyone from the responsibility of ensuring that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The People are not harmed as the result of spending millions of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dollars promoting unworkable or even counterproductive ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can express your concern without the snarky judgement and assumption

</I>&gt;<i> assuming it&#8217;s a real concern and not just some cynical dart you&#8217;re throwing.
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
It is, but I would concede that it's a pretty minor concern and so can
probably be left out. The odds of them actually harming anyone or
stopping people like us from soldiering on are down there in same the
sub-1% realm that the winning plan will actually amount to anything,
at least to the extent that it follows the rules.

&gt;<i> &gt; And that includes any requirement that the system must prop up dictators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I see where you&#8217;re coming from. It&#8217;s easy for some billionaire to
</I>&gt;<i> throw a little change at a problem without having thought through the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences deeply in his own mind. On top of that, he&#8217;ll likely earn a
</I>&gt;<i> substantial dose of celebrity for being all kinds of cuddly things to the
</I>&gt;<i> current progressive wave of waking discontent. He might even cover has ass
</I>&gt;<i> (consciously or un) by injecting a little safety clause that safeguards his
</I>&gt;<i> very comfortable (elite) position in the current hierarchy.
</I>
He's old enough that I doubt he worries about such things. And he
seems to not have any children, hopefully eliminating any bias he
might have against a system that deals with oligarchy in part by
eliminating the custom of inheritance (for the record, though, his
wife was apparently opposed to forming the GCF).

But I wasn't insinuating that I think he has any ulterior motives for
imposing a requirement that the proposed model not destabilize
dictatorships (as a goal or merely as a side-effect). I'm sure they
think imposing such a rule is just a matter of practicality. It's
possible, though, that they also harbor a niggling fear of being held
responsible for being the cause of a revolution in some faraway place.

&gt;<i> If we are going to *crowd-source* a new paradigm, I imagine we&#8217;ll need to
</I>&gt;<i> get very accustomed to working around (what we judge to be) incomplete or
</I>&gt;<i> faulty reasoning without damaging the connection we have with others. Tricky
</I>&gt;<i> business!
</I>
Tell me about it ;-)  Fortunately this *doesn't* seem to be an issue
when explaining my system to regular people. Most of them are rightly
skeptical about its chances, but that always seems to originate from a
cynicism that there is any possibility of taking the-powers-that-be
down a notch or two. It seems to not come from perceived flaws in its
goals or mechanisms (like one gets if one proposes something
recognizable as libertarianism or communism). Even the most rabid
constitutionalists I've dealt with (on FB) seem to at least have half
an open mind about the fact that the US constitution has serious flaws
and that there might be better ways to organize a government.

Thanks for the feedback: I'll take another stab at pruning back the snark ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
