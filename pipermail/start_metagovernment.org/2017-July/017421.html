</I>
I think having experts writing proposals is critical. I think the collaborative process is equally so. I don&#8217;t see them being mutually exclusive. In my mind, a hybrid is possible if the two are allowed to inform each other.

Experts are more efficient, more experienced, more knowledgeable than the average person, and very likely have some gift and/or passion they bring to the project or proposal. 

Collaboration brings people together for a conversation about things that really matter to them. They become informed (often by the experts) not just about the details of the project but about each other as well. This could be very healing for a community, particularly if it&#8217;s a regular practice. I would say the connections that follow a community coming together to make agreements about their commons will have repercussions that will last for generations.

I&#8217;m a builder by trade and would offer this analogy. A home is much more likely to fit those who it&#8217;s built for if the architect, the owners, and the builder all work closely together throughout the entire process.
