It's a good rule ;-)

</I>&gt;<i> war with the same majority as they are able to decide about road sign.
</I>
Unfortunately I don't know of any actual research that shows that this
is true. Supermajority rules do reduce the ability to make bad
decisions, but they also reduce the ability to make good ones. And
again I know of no research that shows that no decision is better than
*some* decision, even a bad one. Declaring war is probably the
worst-case scenario (hard to undo that one), but my claim would be
that as long as you have a sufficiently high participation rate, even
a simple majority is sufficient to ensure good decisions (i.e.,
certainly having 51% of 30% of the electorate voting yes is *not*
sufficient because they could easily be all SDAP). Which is why
getting the participation rate up is vastly more important than
dicking around with supermajority settings. Hence, my proxy proposal.

&gt;<i> That is probably one of the main characteristics of deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, that the actors seek balance, appropriate state,... not
</I>&gt;<i> maximum as governments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So as the result, some people may refuse to support any proposal where
</I>&gt;<i> is simple majority required. Do you have any better idea ?
</I>
Again, if you want to impose a condition, I recommend proposing a
condition where some larger percentage of the population casts a vote,
not any supermajority of the actual votes cast. My rule of thumb for
SDAP control is 50% because SDAPs make up at most 25% of the
population in low-activation conditions. Unfortunately this percentage
goes up in times of scarce resources when activation levels are higher
(e.g., Stenner claims up to 53% of the population has authoritarian
tendencies, which means the only way to prevent mob-rule/SDAP-rule in
a crisis is to take Fox News off the air when the shit hits the fan to
keep them from activating the latent authoritarians ;-)

    Scott
