</I>&gt;<i> Hi, I want to discuss this a little bit. Direct democracy will have an

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Corruption
</I>
Two things to add to this I didn't mention before:

1) SDAPs are more susceptible to corruption than neurotypicals (see
Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiments: e.g.,
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>)

2) The main problem isn't even corruption per se, it's the fact that
SDAPs are simply not *representative* of neurotypicals because of
their higher levels of prejudice and tolerance for inequality. Bad
enough having corrupt individuals in office, but they're also just
inclined to pass laws that protect the status of themselves and their
cronies.

&gt;<i> Marketing &amp; education &amp; propaganda
</I>
This is an important point. Our whole conception of advertising needs
to shift as part of the progress of civilization. Fearmongering in
particular is called out in several places on matchism.org as
something that we need to develop strong aversion to and express that
feeling whenever we see it. In general advertising works because it
can be used to manipulate our animal natures (emotions) rather than
our human/rational sides. Which means that it's just inappropriate
form of behavioral engineering for the most part. But restricting
commercial advertising is relatively easy to do compared with how to
deal with it in the operation of the decisionmaking system itself
(disclosure policy, flagging of paid shills, etc.)

It's for The People to decide, but as for me I see little problem with
restricting corporate &quot;speech&quot;: Corporations are not people and
there's not much to be lost by imposing strict controls on external
speech. Internal speech is a different matter: Telling all their
employees that their jobs depend on some proposal being passed (or
rejected) would seem to be fair game to me, albeit with the same
standard for things like fearmongering (i.e., you can inform people
without deliberately attempting to scare them).

&gt;<i> Resource control
</I>
Direct democracy is also the solution to this problem, though: For
example, if you can pass and enforce a decent law against monopolistic
behavior (or monopolies in general), the single biggest source of
power in this realm will shift back to The People.

&gt;<i> Army (hopefully just for threatening)
</I>
Or even just the police: The Ferguson government using fines to
finance operations would be an example of this:
