</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is quite similar to what I had in mind. It is short, I hope you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will read it. I still want to make sure you understand what I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; write, do you ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I always have to pause when I hear that phrase: Isn't &quot;Deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy&quot; redundant? Do &quot;nondeliberative&quot; democracies exist?
</I>:<i>), it is about definition, I recall that they define it as a way of
</I>decision making where deliberation is unavoidable substantial part ...
understanding... reflexion...discussion, not just reading papers.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for that particular paper, it was a slog because I just had to stop
</I>&gt;<i> and say a prayer every page (&quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not
</I>&gt;<i> what they do.&quot;). For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;innovative ways of engaging citizens in joint decision making with
</I>&gt;<i> government&quot;. WTF? Are we citizens not *the* government? There's a
</I>&gt;<i> false dichotomy implied here: They are our *employees*, not our
</I>&gt;<i> masters!
</I>yes, I was calmly overlooking it, because for me it wasn't the essential
part of the paper.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;participants who are representative of the population, seated in ways
</I>&gt;<i> to maximise diversity&quot;. Can you say &quot;SDAP-rule&quot;? I thought you
</I>&gt;<i> could...
</I>I do not remmember how they choose the participants... anyway,
attendance is important in real world. Here comes my recent proposal
how to make it more fun (girls, food, drinks, games, music ...)

&gt;<i> &quot;the capacity to influence policy and decision-making&quot;. Listen people,
</I>&gt;<i> no actual decisionmaking by you lot, that clear?
</I>Here I am still struggling with one question. How SDAP behave when
talking to individuals (one on one). I know that they will try to lie,
but that seems to be useless here, becuase gossip should be able to
stop their intentions.
I have no evidence to prove it, but I feel that the SDAP business starts
in a group of 3 or more. Do you know about any research about this ?
That would be really helpful.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Things I do like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Simulations are great for helping people discover what they really
</I>&gt;<i> want.
</I>Great

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) They consciously avoided the term &quot;consensus&quot;, using &#8216;the search
</I>&gt;<i> for common ground' in it's place.
</I>ok, I will use 'the search for common ground'. Anyway, I always
mean soemthing between 60-70 percents when sayint that forbidden word :)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) I love the pushback part, where the elected officials tried to
</I>&gt;<i> propagandize their way back to a status-quo solution but lost. Problem
</I>&gt;<i> is, they probably will just go ahead and implement the way they want
</I>&gt;<i> anyway because there is no actual accountability. I see this all the
</I>&gt;<i> time here (in Boulder): Most of the day-to-day decisions are made by
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucrats rather than elected officials and we citizens have no
</I>&gt;<i> control over that group (which is why the ability for the people to
</I>&gt;<i> remove from their job *any* public employee is a key proposal in
</I>&gt;<i> Matchism).
</I>yes, I loved it too.
How is Matchism going to deal with this ? You have no people that were
there in &quot;agora&quot;, that are then able to go to the media and say how it
was.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This paper is a good example of how people with degrees in &quot;public
</I>&gt;<i> policy&quot; think. After SDAPs, they're my new favorite whipping boy.
</I>Good.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>   Scott
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; m.
