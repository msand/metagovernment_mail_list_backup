Authoritarian behavior, yes. Social Dominators and Psychopaths will
skew even one-on-one encounters (i.e., they'll just fight and likely
not come up with any solution at all if paired with each other, and
will tend to dominate the opinion (or at least the vote) of any
authoritarian or neurotypical person they are paired with). There's
not much research I'm aware of on RWA in small vs, large groups, but
there's some on SDO. For example Altemeyer's global change game
experiment shows this, where when he seeds the &quot;countries&quot; with a high
SDO individual that individual immediately and decisively takes charge
(in 6 out of 7 cases). And of course the prisons are full of
psychopaths who committed crimes one-on-one or in small groups.

But in summary, making the groups smaller, even down to one-on-one,
isn't a solution to the SDAP problem.

</I>
Removing an elected official, especially in the executive branch, is
so difficult as to be useless as a fix or even as a deterrent in our
current representative systems. The matchism proposal is just that
Managers or any member of their staffs can be removed with a simple
majority vote. It'll be a good test of my theory that &quot;mob rule&quot; is
really a euphemism for SDAP rule and that if some Manager has an
affair with his intern and then lies about it there will be much
screaming and yelling from the Authoritarians but when it comes to a
vote the neurotypicals won't actually remove him (assuming he's doing
a good job otherwise, of course).
