I always have to pause when I hear that phrase: Isn't &quot;Deliberative
Democracy&quot; redundant? Do &quot;nondeliberative&quot; democracies exist?

As for that particular paper, it was a slog because I just had to stop
and say a prayer every page (&quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not
what they do.&quot;). For example:

&quot;innovative ways of engaging citizens in joint decision making with
government&quot;. WTF? Are we citizens not *the* government? There's a
false dichotomy implied here: They are our *employees*, not our
masters!

&quot;participants who are representative of the population, seated in ways
to maximise diversity&quot;. Can you say &quot;SDAP-rule&quot;? I thought you
could...

&quot;the capacity to influence policy and decision-making&quot;. Listen people,
no actual decisionmaking by you lot, that clear?

Things I do like:

1) Simulations are great for helping people discover what they really want.

2) They consciously avoided the term &quot;consensus&quot;, using &#8216;the search
for common ground' in it's place.

3) I love the pushback part, where the elected officials tried to
propagandize their way back to a status-quo solution but lost. Problem
is, they probably will just go ahead and implement the way they want
anyway because there is no actual accountability. I see this all the
time here (in Boulder): Most of the day-to-day decisions are made by
bureaucrats rather than elected officials and we citizens have no
control over that group (which is why the ability for the people to
remove from their job *any* public employee is a key proposal in
Matchism).

This paper is a good example of how people with degrees in &quot;public
policy&quot; think. After SDAPs, they're my new favorite whipping boy.

Regards,
  Scott
