Definitely. But that's mostly background information needed for the
design of the actual decisionmaking system and to motivate the early
adopters that it is the only viable alternative. Few people beyond
that will read it, or need to, because the system will be all they
have to interact with.

It actually explicitly states in there that it would be inappropriate
to start a Matchist commune. Matchism works for all of us (global and
bottom up), or none of us. Which makes it different from every other
proposal except maybe Marxism. And it would be far less disruptive
than Marxism because it works primarily as an effective regulator for
our existing capitalist system rather than a full replacement for it.
