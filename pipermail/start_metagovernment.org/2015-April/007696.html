&gt;<i> I've contemplated the pro and con list idea before, I came to a few problems

</I>&gt;<i> con.
</I>
Right. I'm actually considering having 4 categories: pro, con, Q&amp;A,
and &quot;discussion&quot;. The latter might be like Slashdot or Reddit, which
hopefully would increase the quality of the pro/con sections by
allowing an outlet for some of the less well thought out comments.
When you've really got your position worked out, then and only then
should you polish it up and put it into the pro or con list.

&gt;<i> 2) Do you intend to have a pro con list to each comment or just the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal? I think this would gum up any flow of conversation once a debate
</I>&gt;<i> began.
</I>
It might devolve into settle-it (<A HREF="https://settleit.org/">https://settleit.org/</A>). I found that
system too easy to game because people can just add *anything* and it
counts for/against the comment (i.e., there's no rating of comments
which could be used to weight them, or even flagging which could be
used to constrain trolls). So I'm thinking no: comments on comments
maybe can be rated, but not separated into pro/con streams.

&gt;<i> 3) People gaming the system, say adding a pro to the con list instead
</I>&gt;<i> and getting it 5 star rated so it stays at the top. Makes for additional
</I>&gt;<i> moderating/flagging that isn't necessary otherwise.
</I>
People will always do stuff like this, and sometimes even just
accidentally. Flagging would seem to me the best way to combat this.
Gaming by gang-up-rating would require large-scale cooperation which
should be easy to detect, and again flag. I'm not sure it's going to
be necessary, but have put flagging trolls as *people* rather than
just as posts in the spec. Get too many posts flagged as trolls, and
*you* get flagged as a troll and people will then have the option of
filtering *everything* you do out of their feed.

&gt;<i> Having every comment listed on one feed is easier visually I think. The
</I>&gt;<i> comment header should be enough to determine if this comment is a pro or con
</I>&gt;<i> statement.
</I>
I think not, plus it makes people wade through a lot of stuff they may
not need to see. We can also do some little psychology experiments
here to help decide where/how to present things: Do people who vote
for a proposal generally read both sides, just the pros, or just the
cons (I'm probably in the latter category, but most people and in
particular most authoritarians are probably going to be in the second
category).

&gt;<i> My site is a fully threaded forum yes. I assume yours will be as well?
</I>
Yes, although I'm still a little worried about sorting based on rating
with this: Do posts that come later somehow depend on context derived
globally from earlier posts, even if they don't specifically attach to
any of them? I think I see this effect on Slashdot sometimes...

&gt;<i> If these re-drafts were fair enough to gain the support of the original
</I>&gt;<i> proposer as well as all the highest rated commenters then there would be no
</I>&gt;<i> issue, right? Everyone agreed this was an accurate summary. I think this is
</I>&gt;<i> achievable, the re-drafters include the top comments in the summary and gain
</I>&gt;<i> their approval. Original proposers want to see their proposal go through to
</I>&gt;<i> the vote so they would approve as many redrafts as they thought was fair in
</I>&gt;<i> hopes that top commenters would do so as well.
</I>
So the original proposer has veto power over the redrafts? That would
seem to address my concern, but this is also something that could be
worked out off-line (e.g., one of these experts could just email the
original proposer and offer to edit it).

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know, you'd have to pay me *a lot* before I'd be willing to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this as a job. But I'd be willing to do it for free if it can be made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy and interesting (maybe fun, even). A system that requires
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> payments to function also has a pretty major bootstrapping problem:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Somehow we need to get enough people to use the system to show that it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works and so is worthy of spending tax dollars on. We surely won't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have enough money to pay the numbers needed to get to that point...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True enough, but really what's a lot? As long as I'm getting paid more for
</I>&gt;<i> the hour then I make in an hour that's worthwhile. I'd have no issue
</I>&gt;<i> stepping up every once and a while and helping out, especially if it was
</I>&gt;<i> easy and fun.
</I>
Good luck with that ;-)  My hunch is we can't really do either: making
law/policy is just always going to be boring for us neurotypicals
because power just doesn't fascinate us the way it does the SDAPs. And
work is a funny thing: People will insist on being paid far more then
they're really worth if it's anything they don't enjoy and don't
absolutely have to do. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have the budget to
pay anyone who knew what they're doing (do you know how much political
consultants make? The competent ones make 6 figures, and the good ones
can make several times that).
  Regards,
    Scott
