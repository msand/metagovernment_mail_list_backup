</I>
It's not anything to do with the social system: IMHO pretty much any
direct democracy is going to be able to achieve this. The main problem
with regulating corporations now is simple corruption: You can't get
elected in a representative democracy if you make enemies of the
plutocrats. This whole class of problem simply goes away with a direct
democracy (i.e., they can't pay off all of us). No evidence I know of
to show that this is what will occur, because it's never been done, so
it's more of an engineering claim (e.g., will the bridge stand up? I
predict it will, but we'll run a few small-scale experiments first,
just to make sure)

&gt;<i> With that, what would be the empirical measures of &quot;effective regulation&quot;?
</I>
By the &quot;prime directive&quot; of Matchism it would simply be a shift in
public opinion. You could measure this many ways, but perhaps the
easiest would be in the Goals section where it asks about perceptions
of power. If the power of the people shifts to be larger than that of
the corporations, job's done.

For me personally, I could tell when I no longer see whinging about
Monsanto or Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMorgan) in my FaceBook feed ;-)
