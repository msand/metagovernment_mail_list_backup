Agreed, you just have to make sure that the corrupted input doesn't
propagate it's way up some hierarchy (as it will if the SDAPs have
anything to say about it).

&gt;&gt;<i> There's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not much research I'm aware of on RWA in small vs, large groups, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's some on SDO. For example Altemeyer's global change game

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> SDO individual that individual immediately and decisively takes charge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (in 6 out of 7 cases). And of course the prisons are full of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> psychopaths who committed crimes one-on-one or in small groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, they may take charge of some minority (15%) of dialogues (that is
</I>&gt;<i> up to 85% working dialogues against them at the same time). That gives
</I>&gt;<i> them even smaller portion of influence in percents of votes.
</I>
Right, just keep in mind that they're the most *motivated* 15%...

&gt;<i> Let us model some spread of ideas. 8% SDAP, 30% RWA, 57% Neurotipicals
</I>&gt;<i> 5% Psychopaths At the begining SDAP take RWA on their side for some
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward solution. Neurotipicals are trying to find some good
</I>&gt;<i> solution and are scaterred. Psychopaths are and will be scaterred till
</I>&gt;<i> the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then neurotipicals finaly find a good solution and start joining
</I>&gt;<i> together. At the moment when they surpass SDAPsolution, RWA take their
</I>&gt;<i> solution into consideration and join them =&gt; We are safe.
</I>
Should work, depending on this &quot;joining together&quot; process. If there's
a way for Social Dominators or Psychopaths to influence this process,
they will. If it's straight majority votes at that point, the wouldn't
be able to do anything, but if there's some negotiation involving
&quot;representatives&quot;, it'll probably break down because the SDAPs will
end up as the representatives.

&gt;<i> Why is this not working in reality ? IMHO, because we have marketing and
</I>&gt;<i> SDAP are able to dominate 90% of political (not dialogues, but more
</I>&gt;<i> general term) comunication. RWA join them and never leave them.
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals have trouble to recognize propaganda, because it is
</I>&gt;<i> almost everywhere and is invading their uncounsiousness. Some of them
</I>&gt;<i> realize some parts of propaganda, but unfortunately not the same parts
</I>&gt;<i> as other groups, that leads them to different conclusions, we are all
</I>&gt;<i> scattered.
</I>
Those things, *and* that neurotypicals just will step aside if it
seems like someone else has a strong drive to take over.

&gt;&gt;<i> But in summary, making the groups smaller, even down to one-on-one,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't a solution to the SDAP problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why ? There are no voting groups, just discussion groups. One person,
</I>&gt;<i> one vote.
</I>&gt;<i> This is like telling me that I can't get poeple out of SDAP influence,
</I>&gt;<i> till they are able to meet them on the street, isn't it ?
</I>
I'm not even sure most people will be able to recognize them in person
(or on TV or in an on-line forum). This is another key design criteria
for Matchism: Not only can you expect people to miraculously change
their own behavior, but you can't even count on them learning how
they're being exploited and/or by who. IMHO raw numbers is the only
antidote to SDAP influence. One person one vote has apply to the
*final* decision, not just giving your input into some hierarchical
process.
