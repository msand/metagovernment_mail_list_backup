&gt;<i> it's me again. I was searching for some other forum where I could

</I>&gt;<i> to get rid of me :).
</I>
No need for that, but I will admit to not getting much from your last
few posts. Struck me as another &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; experiment.
Having grown up in the 60's and gone to UC Santa Cruz, I've seen
plenty of that, thank you. Not sure what to recommend because it's
hard to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of that environment from reading books.
Maybe movies: Have you ever watched &quot;Easy Rider&quot;?

&gt;<i> I will tell you something before I leave. I finally realized my opinion
</I>&gt;<i> that the whole success of internet communication may be just the
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of political reality, where stability of the state is based
</I>&gt;<i> on egotism that is causing isolation of individual (see Bookchin:
</I>&gt;<i> Ecology of freedom). It may be so that in healthier society people would
</I>&gt;<i> not want to use computers for private &amp; political communication... There
</I>&gt;<i> is no human drive for sitting behind computer.
</I>
Technology marches forward. We wouldn't be using it if we didn't
prefer it to what came before. Your's is the Luddite proposition.

&gt;<i> There are many human characteristics that support our visions, people
</I>&gt;<i> do want to be free, they like to talk, they like unity... but that were
</I>&gt;<i> not enough till now. I propose to use another powerfull human
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics, sexuality.
</I>&gt;<i> Today sexuality is mostly based on illusion and manipulation with
</I>&gt;<i> (mostly female) instincts. I believe that the union of sexuality with
</I>&gt;<i> politics may be helpful for further family life and prevention of
</I>&gt;<i> divorces. ( This different from ordinary politicazion. This is not
</I>&gt;<i> sexual politics, this is political sexuality)
</I>
And I thought I'd chosen a hard row to hoe! You not only have to
overcome all our existing moral imprinting, but do it *without* the
benefit of rationality (Matchism can at least take advantage of that).

&gt;<i> Finally, there may be many improvements to the proposed model (if you
</I>&gt;<i> will believe in it).
</I>&gt;<i> My latest invention are quick opinion polls in the agora in order to
</I>&gt;<i> determine what proposal is most mature for consent or majority (depends
</I>&gt;<i> on local conditions). This allows to support more proposals at once.
</I>&gt;<i> Or another obvious improvement is that at the moment when is nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> do people may do what they like, eat, talk, dance... They just
</I>&gt;<i> need to look at some big table with opinion polls results and take the
</I>&gt;<i> right party hat to confirm the opinion poll ( that was done by some
</I>&gt;<i> nice girl and charming man before).
</I>
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The world doesn't need any
more small-scale decisionmaking systems. If you're not working on
something that scales easily into the millions of users, you're
wasting your and everyone else's time.

&gt;<i> I know that this is not the most effective way for decision making, but
</I>&gt;<i> that is not important if people will like to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is &quot;love in agora&quot; good ? Please tell me , is there something I have
</I>&gt;<i> forgotten to appreciate ?
</I>
The Sosis articles on utopian communities linked to from the Matchism
site would also be worth your time to read.
  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;<i> Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> m.
