<PRE>Hello,

the thread &quot;Love in agora&quot; is probably at its end. The name is no
longer valid, let us call the concept &quot;Agora events&quot;.
Now I face the decision how to continue my struggle for better future
( or understanding ). 

I was attempting to write some short introduction, but I ran into
complications with complexity ( I was always thinking about
it with complexity in mind ). Still from what I have written here, it
seems to be possible to understand it somehow.
Please, is here somebody who is even slightly interested in any kind of
cooperation on &quot;Agora events&quot; ? Let me know please.

There is whole bunch of things to do:
Improving this to-do list.
Opposing me or finding somebody who will oppose us (forum,
journals,...).
Renaming the concept and finding suitable keywords and terms.
Writing short summary (academic, managerial, some...)
Planning implementation strategy.
Maybe some team stuff, finding suitable tools...
Maybe some programming, I still do not know where the map will hang.

Any ideas are welcome. Email me please.

Kind regards
m.





</PRE>
