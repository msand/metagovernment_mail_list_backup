<PRE>Greetings Jacopo Tolja, yes there might be some benefits. For one thing you
should be able to get some feedback from the Swarm community concerning the
feasibility of the Airesis project and promote awareness as well as find
new supporters as a consequence. Secondly, if Airesis draws enough interest
Swarm might be able to offer useful advice on running an open source
software development and should also have the technical capabilities to run
a shared asset exchange to divide revenue streams between contributors. On
this note, you might also want to take a look at <A HREF="https://assembly.com/.">https://assembly.com/.</A>
With Assembly you wouldn't get the token governance mechanics but you would
be able to crowdsource development and reward people in Bitcoin. It might
be in the interest of your project to pursue as many cost-effective means
as possible.

Airesis is precisely the type of initiative I think many people in the
Swarm and decentralization community would be interested in supporting.
