<PRE>Hi,

it's me again. I was searching for some other forum where I could
discuss my proposal. Could you help me please ? Please even if you do
not find any positive motivation to help me, you may find motivation
to get rid of me :).

I will tell you something before I leave. I finally realized my opinion
that the whole success of internet communication may be just the
consequence of political reality, where stability of the state is based
on egotism that is causing isolation of individual (see Bookchin:
Ecology of freedom). It may be so that in healthier society people would
not want to use computers for private &amp; political communication... There
is no human drive for sitting behind computer.

There are many human characteristics that support our visions, people
do want to be free, they like to talk, they like unity... but that were
not enough till now. I propose to use another powerfull human
characteristics, sexuality.
Today sexuality is mostly based on illusion and manipulation with
(mostly female) instincts. I believe that the union of sexuality with
politics may be helpful for further family life and prevention of
divorces. ( This different from ordinary politicazion. This is not
sexual politics, this is political sexuality)

Finally, there may be many improvements to the proposed model (if you
will believe in it).
My latest invention are quick opinion polls in the agora in order to
determine what proposal is most mature for consent or majority (depends
on local conditions). This allows to support more proposals at once.
Or another obvious improvement is that at the moment when is nothing to
do people may do what they like, eat, talk, dance... They just
need to look at some big table with opinion polls results and take the
right party hat to confirm the opinion poll ( that was done by some
nice girl and charming man before).

I know that this is not the most effective way for decision making, but
that is not important if people will like to do it.

Is &quot;love in agora&quot; good ? Please tell me , is there something I have
forgotten to appreciate ?

Kind regards
m.

</I>&gt;<i> order to be trustworthy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have found some inspiration in Bookchin's Ecology of Freedom. I'm 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not yet finished reading, but I would like to write something :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Beware, this proposal is rather odd.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Imagine meetings in agora where people are allowed to enter and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; leave in pairs, pairs according to their sexuality. They are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allowed to enter with children, but children just play there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separately.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; According to your sexuality you select your discussion partner (no 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to have crush on her or him), she or he is expected to talk to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you no matter her or his sexuality, preference or marital status.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; At the moment when you reach a consensus about what should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decided today you start creating a human chain ( white gloves are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceptable). You are free to leave the chain, if you change your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mind. At the moment when some chain is dominating agora and there
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are no reasonable objections to it, the decision is accepted and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after next meeting is enforceable by its supporters. Every decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may be changed on any meeting in agora.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now, our job might be to find a way how to establish some 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication between these meetings in agoras. I guess some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uploaded videos with basic statements and arguments should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suitable at the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you have found some inspiration in my proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would be grateful for any attempts for improvement and any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; references to similar &quot;decision making games&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael
