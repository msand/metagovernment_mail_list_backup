Umm, I think I still don't get it: What is the problem that this is
supposed to solve?

&gt;<i> I see no advantages and at least two big
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disadvantages:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Single issue voters will hoard their votes and expend them all on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the issue they care about, skewing the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but why would that be bad?
</I>
The usual failure mode is that somebody who is anti-abortion votes for
SDAPs because they promise to outlaw abortion. But then those SDAPs go
on to wreak havoc (starting wars, persecuting immigrants and
minorities, etc. which is just what SDAPs do). This problem is less
serious in a direct democracy, but you still have the problem of a
small minority holding their votes until abortion comes up and then
overwhelming the majority with their votes (a minority-rule outcome).
Meanwhile they've also shirked their duty to ensure that all the other
laws passed reflect their opinions. This makes it easier for *other*
minorities to game the system. It also reduces compliance with laws
because people feel like it's somebody else's law and so it doesn't
apply to them.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) People don't worry about losing votes: They routinely fail to cast
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the ones they already get! Providing more votes just decreases their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value even further, increasing the number that just won't be cast.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not about giving people &quot;more votes&quot;, because if you give everyone more
</I>&gt;<i> votes, it changes nothing, but you can spend more diverse if the options you
</I>&gt;<i> can vote on increase too.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, it needs time for people to get used to it, but because a major
</I>&gt;<i> part in my proposal is extremely short voting periods, it means you can form
</I>&gt;<i> habits and you have something to discuss with your neighbors and ask them
</I>&gt;<i> how they spend their votes :-)
</I>
Short voting periods, especially anything less than a week, are going
to be a problem because it will drastically reduce participation
rates. The more I think about it, the longer I want the voting
periods. Design rule #1 for our systems has to be &quot;People don't *want*
to do this, so you've got to make the system as least burdensome as
possible&quot;.

&gt;<i> I think people do get little votes and there are a lot of constraints about
</I>&gt;<i> how and when to spend those votes.
</I>&gt;<i> It's a certain time slot where you can vote, if you miss that one, you are
</I>&gt;<i> out. Upfront you even have to register and make sure you are allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> receive votes to spend in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> And at last, the choices you can make are extremely limited and often so,
</I>&gt;<i> that its virtually impossible to decide what kind of impact they would have.
</I>
Limited choices are a good thing! 99% of the population won't be
making any proposals at all, so having a few small good ones will
actually make the process work more efficiently. Even if the default
vote is always &quot;no&quot;, those few that pass will be a good match for the
population, will be free from corruption, and will be easily
enforceable (hopefully even self-enforcing).

&gt;<i> My proposal is about extremely short intervals, and voting on many proposals
</I>&gt;<i> (i can make up some proposals in private and have others vote on them, so
</I>&gt;<i> they pass votes to me).
</I>
This sounds like a proxy system to me, but instead of people picking
proxies based on personality characteristics (like my system) you
propose to have the proposers gather them. Which sounds like SDAP rule
to me (who writes proposals?  SDAPs, that's who).

&gt;<i> Because there are many small proposals that could &quot;intergrate&quot; into bigger
</I>&gt;<i> ones, you as a voter get more direct feedback and because voting periods are
</I>&gt;<i> short, you can vote differently the next time taking advantage of what you
</I>&gt;<i> learned from the feedback.
</I>
Why integrate? Why not just pass small, self-contained proposals? This
is also a very common failure mode of our existing governments (large
complicated proposals that spur log rolling, pork, or even just
failure to pay attention to what's in them).

    Scott
