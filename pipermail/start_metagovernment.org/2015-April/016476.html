'Twas ever thus: We've never had the &quot;foundations&quot; we need, since the
time we climbed down from the trees. We just have to make do with what
we have...

</I>
Agreed. Which is why I developed Matchism, which *is* a philosophical
foundation. The fact that no one will debate the issues (or, perhaps,
even read it) tells me that you're expecting too much if you expect
people to even *have* a philosophy, let alone be able to defend it or
use it as a foundation to build anything.

&gt;<i> IMHO if we want to have progress we need to form subgroups with shared
</I>&gt;<i> philosophies first. Than we may have progress in those groups.
</I>
Been tried: One of the things you'll learn if you read matchism.org is
that there have been *thousands* of these experiments. Every one of
which has been a failure!

&gt;<i> No worries we will be still metagovernment group around e-democracy and
</I>&gt;<i> I will still like you.
</I>
What's not to like? This is about the most conflict-avoidant group
I've ever experienced ;-)

    Scott
