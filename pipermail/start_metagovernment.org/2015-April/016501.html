<PRE>Hello,

I am not the first to invented something very similar.
<A HREF="http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/resources/Dialogue%20with%20the%20City%20Case%20Study%20published.pdf">http://www.21stcenturydialogue.com/resources/Dialogue%20with%20the%20City%20Case%20Study%20published.pdf</A>
This is quite similar to what I had in mind. It is short, I hope you
will read it. I still want to make sure you understand what I write, do
you ?

Kind regards
m.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Just found another one, a documentary called &quot;Commune&quot;. It's on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Netflix, and I've put it in my queue...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, thank you for that movies, I have seen it both in last days. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; made I few notes while watching. I will some it up now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We watched Commune a couple of days ago and I've also done some
</I>&gt;<i> followup research. Here's my take on it:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) BBR still going, but population has dropped below 20 several times
</I>&gt;<i> in recent years. And this is for a place which owns the property so
</I>&gt;<i> there's no rent: According to the research, owning the land is by far
</I>&gt;<i> the single most important factor in predicting community longevity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The population turns over completely about every two years (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> people show up with the fantasy of living communally, last a year or
</I>&gt;<i> so during which they discover it sucks, then they bail).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) There is no capital acquired and so no improvements are possible.
</I>&gt;<i> The buildings look like they did when they bought the place 40 years
</I>&gt;<i> ago (and probably pretty much like they did when they were built in
</I>&gt;<i> the late 1800s). My guess is that this is a major reason why people
</I>&gt;<i> leave: Avoiding resource scarcity and physical discomfort are two of
</I>&gt;<i> the strongest drives in all animals (and I'm sure especially humans
</I>&gt;<i> who have experienced life without these things).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Community childrearing was a major fail (as it was for the
</I>&gt;<i> Kibbutzim), as was the attempt to reject pair bonding. These proposals
</I>&gt;<i> are just too far from our Clinations as every experiment in this area
</I>&gt;<i> has clearly shown.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aggresion against symbolic cultural difference (by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; authoritarians). Where symbol might be anything from earring to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sexual practices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do not know how to avoid this entirely. Is it possible to do a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political change without symbols ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most of these symbols are designed to promote tribalism, which is a
</I>&gt;<i> very useful tool when asking people to make a sacrifice. I'm not sure
</I>&gt;<i> it's possible to have a revolution without one, but Matchism does
</I>&gt;<i> specifically address (and mostly reject) the use of this tool.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see that we should struggle to be perceived as a continuation of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mainstream, but that is the position that will be attacked by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; plutocrats anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The focus should be on politics. According to that I should change
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at least my argumentation. Now we are talking to girls, because it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reduces our verbal aggression (nothing about sexuality, forget it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; please).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The research does show that mixed-sex groups make better decisions...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now to the communes. I do not mean is as a commune. It is meant more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like a dancing ball. Just it is not about dancing but about talking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and politics. My intention was to make it similar to mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public events.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there something else I should take from those movies ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another key point for me is that these are self-selected samples: If
</I>&gt;<i> you can't make it work with them, how can you possibly hope to run a
</I>&gt;<i> whole society using these rules? The only wiggle room I see is the
</I>&gt;<i> same argument I use against SDAP leadership (in that case, the
</I>&gt;<i> personality characteristics that make people seek power are highly
</I>&gt;<i> correlated with characteristics (particularly prejudice and
</I>&gt;<i> corruptibility) that make them unfit to wield it). The argument for a
</I>&gt;<i> consent/consensus based government would therefore be that
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals would be able to do it better than the self-selected
</I>&gt;<i> groups that start and join these communities. I don't know of any
</I>&gt;<i> research that shows that this is possible, and of course it ignores
</I>&gt;<i> the entire issue of SDAPs and their ability (indeed preference) to
</I>&gt;<i> game any consent/consensus based decisionmaking system.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; m.
