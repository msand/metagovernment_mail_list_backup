Hi, thank you for that movies, I have seen it both in last days. I made I few notes while
watching. I will some it up now.

Aggresion against symbolic cultural difference (by
authoritarians). Where symbol might be anything from earring to sexual
practices.
I do not know how to avoid this entirely. Is it possible to do a
political change without symbols ?
I see that we should struggle to be perceived as a continuation of
mainstream, but that is the position that will be attacked by
plutocrats anyway.
The focus should be on politics. According to that I should change at
 least my argumentation. Now we are talking to girls, because it 
reduces our verbal aggression (nothing about sexuality, forget it please).

Now to the communes. I do not mean is as a commune. It is meant more
like a dancing ball. Just it is not about dancing but about talking
and politics. My intention was to make it similar to mainstream
public events.

Is there something else I should take from those movies ?

Kind regards
m.
