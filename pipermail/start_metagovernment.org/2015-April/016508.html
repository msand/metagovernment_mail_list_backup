<PRE>Good, they are always allowed to use 50%.

There is one philosophical note to our culture. Many of us still
believe that their deeds could be undone. Impossible in physics,
chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology...everywhere (except church).

On a practical level, it is worth considering whether concrete proposal
will have &quot;sunk costs&quot;
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs</A>
(or even whether it is reducing some future &quot;sunk costs&quot;). According to
that it is reasonable to move the decision rule.

On the other hand I do not know how to calculate decision rule and I
pass it to folks.

Does it make sense ?

Kind regards
m.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately I don't know of any actual research that shows that this

</I>&gt;<i> decisions, but they also reduce the ability to make good ones. And
</I>&gt;<i> again I know of no research that shows that no decision is better than
</I>&gt;<i> *some* decision, even a bad one. Declaring war is probably the
</I>&gt;<i> worst-case scenario (hard to undo that one), but my claim would be
</I>&gt;<i> that as long as you have a sufficiently high participation rate, even
</I>&gt;<i> a simple majority is sufficient to ensure good decisions (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> certainly having 51% of 30% of the electorate voting yes is *not*
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient because they could easily be all SDAP). Which is why
</I>&gt;<i> getting the participation rate up is vastly more important than
</I>&gt;<i> dicking around with supermajority settings. Hence, my proxy proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is probably one of the main characteristics of deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy, that the actors seek balance, appropriate state,... not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maximum as governments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So as the result, some people may refuse to support any proposal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where is simple majority required. Do you have any better idea ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, if you want to impose a condition, I recommend proposing a
</I>&gt;<i> condition where some larger percentage of the population casts a vote,
</I>&gt;<i> not any supermajority of the actual votes cast. My rule of thumb for
</I>&gt;<i> SDAP control is 50% because SDAPs make up at most 25% of the
</I>&gt;<i> population in low-activation conditions. Unfortunately this percentage
</I>&gt;<i> goes up in times of scarce resources when activation levels are higher
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., Stenner claims up to 53% of the population has authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> tendencies, which means the only way to prevent mob-rule/SDAP-rule in
</I>&gt;<i> a crisis is to take Fox News off the air when the shit hits the fan to
</I>&gt;<i> keep them from activating the latent authoritarians ;-)
