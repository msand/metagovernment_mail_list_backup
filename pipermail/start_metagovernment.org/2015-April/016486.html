</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The trouble is that we need to change the mainstream lifestyle. We
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need to find a way how to satisfy reasonable human needs and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deminish the &quot;needs&quot; created by marketing &amp; propaganda.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Matchism section on behavioral engineering does touch on this, but
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO it's too big a problem to take on directly because it involves
</I>&gt;<i> changing culture, not just government or decisionmaking. But a working
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking system will help make that next step possible (e.g., we
</I>&gt;<i> could collectively decide to severely restrict advertising and
</I>&gt;<i> entirely eliminate entire classes of it. Ads for drugs, alcohol, and
</I>&gt;<i> politicians would be a good start).
</I>
There is nothing like big and small steps. Events happen with cuasality
(or as we usualy say in time). Steps are just in our models. The
only difference is that you propose set of shorter events after each
other (as a series), where I call it one event (or paralel events).

&gt;<i> &gt; I am using technology, but just at the places where is it more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; effective than what was before. I still claim that personal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communication is more effective than electronical.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately it doesn't scale, though.
</I>
Yes, I am scaling at a different place.

As the real and the virtual (global) agora grows the number of
interactions grows ~ lineary (this paragraph is a guess). Number
of decision in agora may decrese with numbers, but this can be easily
solved by more smaller agoras (if needed, there will be some optimal
size of real agora probably)
Number of decisions grows with the number of agoras.
Number of globally accepted decisions is ~ constant in time.

The question is whether the unknown constant is enough.
The quality of the decisions is very high.
The decisions have a broad support.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This can be easily scaled. There will be naturally some people that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will connect the agoras with each other and will transfer the ideas
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from one agora to another (even from one language to another). After
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you need just a map where you will make notes about proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that are already ratified at concrete place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Those &quot;natural&quot; people will be SDAP, though, because that's just the
</I>&gt;<i> kind of people who want to do that work. Which means the decisions
</I>&gt;<i> will be contaminated by their instinctive prejudice and irrationality.
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO there's no substitute for direct democracy, and no way to
</I>&gt;<i> implement it without our latest and greatest technology (smart phones
</I>&gt;<i> and the internet).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>
yes, it might be SDAP too, but this job is also interesting for other
people. Anybody is free to do it. You just go to the map and look where
some sensitive proposal works and you propose it to the girl that looks
so good. Oh, how clewer you are for her !
