<PRE>The more I think about it. It should be probably noted in
every proposal what majority it requires.
This would be nonsensical in representative democracy, because
everybody would propose 50%.
But ordinary folks are different, they understand that they cannot start
war with the same majority as they are able to decide about road sign.
That is probably one of the main characteristics of deliberative
democracy, that the actors seek balance, appropriate state,... not
maximum as governments.

So as the result, some people may refuse to support any proposal where
is simple majority required. Do you have any better idea ?

Kind regards

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This is quite similar to what I had in mind. It is short, I hope
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you will read it. I still want to make sure you understand what I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; write, do you ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I always have to pause when I hear that phrase: Isn't &quot;Deliberative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Democracy&quot; redundant? Do &quot;nondeliberative&quot; democracies exist?
</I>&gt;<i> :), it is about definition, I recall that they define it as a way of
</I>&gt;<i> decision making where deliberation is unavoidable substantial part ...
</I>&gt;<i> understanding... reflexion...discussion, not just reading papers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for that particular paper, it was a slog because I just had to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stop and say a prayer every page (&quot;Father, forgive them; for they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know not what they do.&quot;). For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;innovative ways of engaging citizens in joint decision making with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; government&quot;. WTF? Are we citizens not *the* government? There's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; false dichotomy implied here: They are our *employees*, not our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; masters!
</I>&gt;<i> yes, I was calmly overlooking it, because for me it wasn't the
</I>&gt;<i> essential part of the paper.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;participants who are representative of the population, seated in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ways to maximise diversity&quot;. Can you say &quot;SDAP-rule&quot;? I thought you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could...
</I>&gt;<i> I do not remmember how they choose the participants... anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> attendance is important in real world. Here comes my recent proposal
</I>&gt;<i> how to make it more fun (girls, food, drinks, games, music ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;the capacity to influence policy and decision-making&quot;. Listen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people, no actual decisionmaking by you lot, that clear?
</I>&gt;<i> Here I am still struggling with one question. How SDAP behave when
</I>&gt;<i> talking to individuals (one on one). I know that they will try to lie,
</I>&gt;<i> but that seems to be useless here, becuase gossip should be able to
</I>&gt;<i> stop their intentions.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no evidence to prove it, but I feel that the SDAP business
</I>&gt;<i> starts in a group of 3 or more. Do you know about any research about
</I>&gt;<i> this ? That would be really helpful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Things I do like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Simulations are great for helping people discover what they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; really want.
</I>&gt;<i> Great
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) They consciously avoided the term &quot;consensus&quot;, using &#8216;the search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for common ground' in it's place.
</I>&gt;<i> ok, I will use 'the search for common ground'. Anyway, I always
</I>&gt;<i> mean soemthing between 60-70 percents when sayint that forbidden
</I>&gt;<i> word :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) I love the pushback part, where the elected officials tried to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; propagandize their way back to a status-quo solution but lost.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Problem is, they probably will just go ahead and implement the way
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they want anyway because there is no actual accountability. I see
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this all the time here (in Boulder): Most of the day-to-day
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions are made by bureaucrats rather than elected officials and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we citizens have no control over that group (which is why the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability for the people to remove from their job *any* public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; employee is a key proposal in Matchism).
</I>&gt;<i> yes, I loved it too.
</I>&gt;<i> How is Matchism going to deal with this ? You have no people that were
</I>&gt;<i> there in &quot;agora&quot;, that are then able to go to the media and say how it
</I>&gt;<i> was.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This paper is a good example of how people with degrees in &quot;public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy&quot; think. After SDAPs, they're my new favorite whipping boy.
</I>&gt;<i> Good.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   Scott
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Kind regards
