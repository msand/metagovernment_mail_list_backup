</I>

The &quot;progress&quot; is not &quot;one big pile of proposal&quot;, but made up of many
&quot;micro-proposals&quot; that have aggreement/disagreement.
So each &quot;micro-proposal&quot; can be challenged at all times. It's a continuous
process.




&gt;<i> The use of electronics and internet (e-democracy) is no philosophical
</I>&gt;<i> foundation. It is just accidental meeting of technical specialist and
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasts that may have very different philosophies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Electronic/Intermet means change the speed of the process and allow for
certain
new ways because they reduce the effort for a certain method in a way, that
it becomes an option,
while it was not an option before.





&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO if we want to have progress we need to form subgroups with shared
</I>&gt;<i> philosophies first. Than we may have progress in those groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I agree 100% and those sub-groups will change in a very dynamic way.
Membership is extremely fluid.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No worries we will be still metagovernment group around e-democracy and
</I>&gt;<i> I will still like you.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem with mailinglists are, that it does not track progress.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You need a system, that &quot;over time&quot; captures all the little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;aggreements&quot; and shows where there is still &quot;disagreement&quot;, so that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participants can focus on that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thus: The system needs to make &quot;proposals&quot; to participants about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;potential micro agreements&quot; and if they accepts, they are shown in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the discussion all the time to everyone, so they do not lose focus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =&gt; This way, things can slowly build up without repeating everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =&gt; It also gives motivation to focus on micro agreements instead of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating big blobs of text to drown others.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  Hi Scott,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Over a year ago now, I mostly swore off trying to conduct deep
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interconnected multi-threaded discussions on email lists, as not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; productive enough to warrant the expenditure of time and focus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I heartily agree with you that it would be best that we focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; actual proposals, and on deciding whether to adopt/implement them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The question is: &quot;Where and how shall we do that work together?&quot; My
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; first answer is, &quot;Not here (on the email list) just endlessly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; talking at one another.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; With that, the prospect of putting time into reading closely the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; material on the new Matchism site, without there being any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; immediate useful thing to *DO* as I am reading and pondering the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; material, is again not productive enough to warrant the expenditure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of time and focus. I am too busy doing useful things to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interested in spending time doing something useless. There needs to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be a use, and it needs to be an immediate use, with enduring and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; cumulative effect.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (The software decision system that I am working on will provide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what I want. At the point that it is operational (maybe 2018 with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; just me working on it), proposals drawn from the Matchism material
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; will probably be among the first proposals that I pump into it, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; test it out.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The matchism.org site (<A HREF="http://matchism.org">http://matchism.org</A>) is (finally) finished
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and polished enough that I'm now encouraging people to read it. The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sections you all would be most interested in are &quot;The MatchSys&quot; (the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; voting system), and the Goals section (the lead-in to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proxy-matching and manager-advisory systems). But I recommend
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; starting at the beginning and read at least the pages leading up to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the voting system to get the necessary background. There's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; navigation bar at the bottom if you want to jump around from that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; point.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Why read it, especially when you've probably all got other projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that will have to be put aside for a bit to do so? For one thing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it's a lot different from most other political philosophy or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; economics books in that there are a lot of very specific proposals:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If you're up for shooting fish in a barrel, here's a whole long
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; string of them to fire away at. It also addresses a much neglected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; issue in all the other &quot;alternative government&quot; projects: The claim
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of Matchism is that it is not sufficient, and may even be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; misguided, to focus on the disenfranchised minorities in our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; society. The real need, and danger, comes from that minority who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; currently hold the power. If this is correct, then the new system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; merely needs to be designed to give the *middle* majority the power
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to set the goals and control over how to achieve them. It doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have to specifically be designed to support &quot;consent&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &quot;consensus&quot; or even &quot;collaborative&quot; decisionmaking, all of which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; have proven to be extremely difficult to actually implement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A more cynical reason to read it is derived from my recent review of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; all of the projects linked out from the Metagovernment.org site (and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; most of those on the ParticipateDB.com site), none of which have not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; amounted to much and most of which have been abandoned for all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; practical purposes. Unfortunately, it seems to me that every one of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; these dead-end projects is another nail in the coffin of the idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that a new government system is even possible, let alone that it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; might be developed by any independent person or group. It's one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; thing to take on projects like these as an experiment or hobby, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I see that hundreds of thousands of person-hours and millions of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; dollars have been spent on these things. This sort of review is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; bound to make anyone very discouraged,and instill a great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reluctance to add to the pile.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The only reason for optimism I could find is that all of them I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; looked at are missing what I believe to be one key ingredient: a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; comprehensive and well-specified philosophy. No revolution has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; successful without a &quot;story&quot; that can be used to sell the new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; political &quot;technology&quot; it will be based on. Which is why I believe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that it's worth your time to invest in a philosophy/narrative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; *before* expending any more resources building tools and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; technology. Even if it turns out that Matchism isn't a good fit for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; you, the way it is organized and specifically refers to competing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; alternatives (e.g., see the &quot;isms&quot; section) should help you find or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; develop one that will be. Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;     Scott
