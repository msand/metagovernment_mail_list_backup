I think I make a convincing case on matchism.org that this isn't the
problem with it: The bigger problem is that it's simply incompatible
with our natures (Clinations). The second problem being that Marx
never really specified a government structure and if you don't have
one of those that accounts for SDAP behavior, communism is even more
susceptible to that mode of failure.

&gt;<i> i would say stricter antitrust laws, and a group to monitor it.

That's 0 for 2: The main problem with capitalism isn't monopolies
(it's on the list, but I wouldn't even put it in the top 3), it's
corruption of government officials via campaign contributions, PACs,
the revolving door (hiring people after they get out of office), and
other influence. Most of the other problems can also be traced back to
that one (i.e., we can't even regulate monopolies because they just
corrupt the regulators). The only way around this is direct democracy
IMHO.

    Scott
