Just found another one, a documentary called &quot;Commune&quot;. It's on
Netflix, and I've put it in my queue...

&gt;<i> The trouble is that we need to change the mainstream lifestyle. We need

</I>
The Matchism section on behavioral engineering does touch on this, but
IMHO it's too big a problem to take on directly because it involves
changing culture, not just government or decisionmaking. But a working
decisionmaking system will help make that next step possible (e.g., we
could collectively decide to severely restrict advertising and
entirely eliminate entire classes of it. Ads for drugs, alcohol, and
politicians would be a good start).

&gt;<i> I am using technology, but just at the places where is it more
</I>&gt;<i> effective than what was before. I still claim that personal
</I>&gt;<i> communication is more effective than electronical.
</I>
Unfortunately it doesn't scale, though.

&gt;<i> This can be easily scaled. There will be naturally some people that
</I>&gt;<i> will connect the agoras with each other and will transfer the ideas
</I>&gt;<i> from one agora to another (even from one language to another). After
</I>&gt;<i> that you need just a map where you will make notes about proposals that
</I>&gt;<i> are already ratified at concrete place.
</I>
Those &quot;natural&quot; people will be SDAP, though, because that's just the
kind of people who want to do that work. Which means the decisions
will be contaminated by their instinctive prejudice and irrationality.
IMHO there's no substitute for direct democracy, and no way to
implement it without our latest and greatest technology (smart phones
and the internet).

    Scott
