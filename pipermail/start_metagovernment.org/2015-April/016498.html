&gt;&gt;<i> Just found another one, a documentary called &quot;Commune&quot;. It's on

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi, thank you for that movies, I have seen it both in last days. I made I few notes while
</I>&gt;<i> watching. I will some it up now.
</I>
We watched Commune a couple of days ago and I've also done some
followup research. Here's my take on it:

1) BBR still going, but population has dropped below 20 several times
in recent years. And this is for a place which owns the property so
there's no rent: According to the research, owning the land is by far
the single most important factor in predicting community longevity.

2) The population turns over completely about every two years (i.e.,
people show up with the fantasy of living communally, last a year or
so during which they discover it sucks, then they bail).

3) There is no capital acquired and so no improvements are possible.
The buildings look like they did when they bought the place 40 years
ago (and probably pretty much like they did when they were built in
the late 1800s). My guess is that this is a major reason why people
leave: Avoiding resource scarcity and physical discomfort are two of
the strongest drives in all animals (and I'm sure especially humans
who have experienced life without these things).

4) Community childrearing was a major fail (as it was for the
Kibbutzim), as was the attempt to reject pair bonding. These proposals
are just too far from our Clinations as every experiment in this area
has clearly shown.

&gt;<i> Aggresion against symbolic cultural difference (by
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarians). Where symbol might be anything from earring to sexual
</I>&gt;<i> practices.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not know how to avoid this entirely. Is it possible to do a
</I>&gt;<i> political change without symbols ?
</I>
Most of these symbols are designed to promote tribalism, which is a
very useful tool when asking people to make a sacrifice. I'm not sure
it's possible to have a revolution without one, but Matchism does
specifically address (and mostly reject) the use of this tool.

&gt;<i> I see that we should struggle to be perceived as a continuation of
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream, but that is the position that will be attacked by
</I>&gt;<i> plutocrats anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> The focus should be on politics. According to that I should change at
</I>&gt;<i>  least my argumentation. Now we are talking to girls, because it
</I>&gt;<i> reduces our verbal aggression (nothing about sexuality, forget it please).
</I>
The research does show that mixed-sex groups make better decisions...

&gt;<i> Now to the communes. I do not mean is as a commune. It is meant more
</I>&gt;<i> like a dancing ball. Just it is not about dancing but about talking
</I>&gt;<i> and politics. My intention was to make it similar to mainstream
</I>&gt;<i> public events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there something else I should take from those movies ?
</I>
Another key point for me is that these are self-selected samples: If
you can't make it work with them, how can you possibly hope to run a
whole society using these rules? The only wiggle room I see is the
same argument I use against SDAP leadership (in that case, the
personality characteristics that make people seek power are highly
correlated with characteristics (particularly prejudice and
corruptibility) that make them unfit to wield it). The argument for a
consent/consensus based government would therefore be that
Neurotypicals would be able to do it better than the self-selected
groups that start and join these communities. I don't know of any
research that shows that this is possible, and of course it ignores
the entire issue of SDAPs and their ability (indeed preference) to
game any consent/consensus based decisionmaking system.
  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;<i> Kind regards
