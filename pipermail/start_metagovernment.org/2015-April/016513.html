<PRE>Swarm is one of the more interesting experiments in the technological and
organizational decentralization movement but they're far too business- and
profit-minded for my tastes. I joined up with them as a Swarm agent a
couple of months ago and have been tracking their progress ever since to
get some insight into their internal operations.

They started out as a private crypto-equity venture on the bitcointalk.org
forums and raised somewhere in the neighborhood of $700,000 USD in a
Bitcoin crowdsale. In contrast to Kickstarter which merely hands out early
release products and stretch rewards for funding projects the entire
premise of Swarm was to become a platform for accelerating the development
of crypto-related start-ups by sharing revenue and stake-based
decision-making with investors.

Swarm organized a number of crowdsales since April-May of last year with
variable levels of success. This process, I should note, couldn't function
without drawing on the good will of the general freelancer community -- who
were remunerated with nothing -- to review project candidates and provide
free labor in their incubation efforts. Swarm continues to have this issue
between mostly unproductive private investment interests and uncompensated
public aid.

Somewhere around November-December they encountered several legal disputes
with shareholders and regulators regarding the financial status of their
tokens and business model. These legal obstacles spurred them to
collaborate with a number of individuals from elite universities to develop
a new organizational model which they have started calling a Distributed
Collaborative Organization. This continues their basic initiative to
review, crowdfund, and incubate various projects although without treating
their tokens as a promise to profit monetarily in the manner of an equity.
Rather, their aim is to pool together the resources of the general public
to carry out whatever project the community brings to it. Swarm's role in
this is to provide the infrastructure for decentralized collaboration --
whether this is for-profit or not-for-profit -- by hooking everyone up into
their token economy and organizational mechanics.

While Swarm's system remains quite centralized in certain aspects I do
think they're heading in the right direction. There is a very strong
possibility that they will be moving off the CounterParty system they've
been using up to this point and embrace a full although still unreleased
Ethereum implementation around May-June. There are many interesting
socio-economic and techno-political applications in the blockchain 2.0
space. If Swarm can enable the formation of decentralized project
management, crypto-economic funding and revenue, and direct trust-based
self-governance for the general public I think they will become extremely
valuable and worth supporting.

All of that said, there is still the risk that Swarm will attempt to take
advantage of their position. Those who join into their initiative will be
tied down to their token system and will be tethered to certain forces of
centralization. If this control remains largely in the hands of their team
and if the possibility to profit from the efforts of their community
increases there is a definite danger that they will enforce their own
self-serving policies on everyone else. Given their business and legal
history and conflicting intentions to make money for themselves and their
investors I think this is a serious concern and should be monitored very
carefully.
