</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's me again. I was searching for some other forum where I could

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do not find any positive motivation to help me, you may find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; motivation to get rid of me :).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No need for that, but I will admit to not getting much from your last
</I>&gt;<i> few posts. Struck me as another &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; experiment.
</I>&gt;<i> Having grown up in the 60's and gone to UC Santa Cruz, I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of that, thank you. Not sure what to recommend because it's
</I>&gt;<i> hard to capture the &quot;feel&quot; of that environment from reading books.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe movies: Have you ever watched &quot;Easy Rider&quot;?
</I>
Not yet, I will watch it soon.

The trouble is that we need to change the mainstream lifestyle. We need
to find a way how to satisfy reasonable human needs and deminish the
&quot;needs&quot; created by marketing &amp; propaganda.

The feeling of &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot; may be diminished. It is possible
to do the same in electronic form (but without the sexual motivation).
People talking via e.g. RedPhone and indicating their opinions and
proposals electronically.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will tell you something before I leave. I finally realized my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opinion that the whole success of internet communication may be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just the consequence of political reality, where stability of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state is based on egotism that is causing isolation of individual
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (see Bookchin: Ecology of freedom). It may be so that in healthier
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; society people would not want to use computers for private &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political communication... There is no human drive for sitting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behind computer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Technology marches forward. We wouldn't be using it if we didn't
</I>&gt;<i> prefer it to what came before. Your's is the Luddite proposition.
</I>
I am using technology, but just at the places where is it more
effective than what was before. I still claim that personal
communication is more effective than electronical.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are many human characteristics that support our visions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people do want to be free, they like to talk, they like unity...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that were not enough till now. I propose to use another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; powerfull human characteristics, sexuality.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Today sexuality is mostly based on illusion and manipulation with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (mostly female) instincts. I believe that the union of sexuality
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with politics may be helpful for further family life and prevention
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of divorces. ( This different from ordinary politicazion. This is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not sexual politics, this is political sexuality)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I thought I'd chosen a hard row to hoe! You not only have to
</I>&gt;<i> overcome all our existing moral imprinting, but do it *without* the
</I>&gt;<i> benefit of rationality (Matchism can at least take advantage of that).
</I>
As you have told me before. I am expecting much.
Still I cannot tell how difficult it might be. Maybe that feminists
will like it and will fight for it. With careful explanation they may
see the current practice as unfair.

&gt;<i> &gt; Finally, there may be many improvements to the proposed model (if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you will believe in it).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My latest invention are quick opinion polls in the agora in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determine what proposal is most mature for consent or majority
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (depends on local conditions). This allows to support more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals at once. Or another obvious improvement is that at the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moment when is nothing to do people may do what they like, eat,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; talk, dance... They just need to look at some big table with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opinion polls results and take the right party hat to confirm the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opinion poll ( that was done by some nice girl and charming man
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; before).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The world doesn't need any
</I>&gt;<i> more small-scale decisionmaking systems. If you're not working on
</I>&gt;<i> something that scales easily into the millions of users, you're
</I>&gt;<i> wasting your and everyone else's time.
</I>
This can be easily scaled. There will be naturally some people that
will connect the agoras with each other and will transfer the ideas
from one agora to another (even from one language to another). After
that you need just a map where you will make notes about proposals that
are already ratified at concrete place.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I know that this is not the most effective way for decision making,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that is not important if people will like to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is &quot;love in agora&quot; good ? Please tell me , is there something I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forgotten to appreciate ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Sosis articles on utopian communities linked to from the Matchism
</I>&gt;<i> site would also be worth your time to read.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; m.
