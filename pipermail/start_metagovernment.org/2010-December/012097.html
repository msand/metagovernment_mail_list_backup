<PRE>The debate in question was over the term used to describe the concept,  
not the group. So for the moment, Metagovernment (or Metagov) is still  
the name of this group. In fact, I think there was a separate Vilfredo  
proposal about that.

This was a discussion of whether or not we could use a better term for  
the overarching idea, which this project first called Open Source  
Governance and then Collaborative Governance:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance</A>

If you disagree, then we haven't reached consensus. Same with Michael.  
And so presumably we stick with the status quo. Collaborative  
Governance isn't a bad term; it was just felt by some that it is not  
easily understood by others and that it doesn't convey much sense of  
democracy.

The idea behind using the term Open Democracy is that it does pretty  
well bring up an image of what we are talking about. And while all  
democracy is supposedly &quot;open,&quot; the fact that we would describe this  
brand as &quot;open&quot; hopefully makes the listener/reader question what  
makes it different from all other brands of democracy.

Here in the U.S., I certainly don't feel that democracy is open when  
Congress has secret sessions, the executive branch has entire secret  
agencies and vast troves of secret information, and much of the  
legislative process is done without any *chance* for me to have any  
meaningful input. Much of our legislative process at every level of  
government is carried out in &quot;informal&quot; meetings between lobbyists and  
politicians: not something that is open or democratic in any way.

So given all of the above, can you get on board with the term, or  
would you like to propose another (or stick with what we have)?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, democracy is not democracy unless it is open in the sense

</I>&gt;<i> So, to that degree, it seems to me calling democracy &quot;open&quot; is  
</I>&gt;<i> redundant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems to me that the primary objective of the Metagov group is to  
</I>&gt;<i> apply electronic means to enable individuals who choose to do so to  
</I>&gt;<i> participate more efficiently and effectively in decision-making in  
</I>&gt;<i> which they have an interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It also seems to me that it cannot accurately be called &quot;open&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> unless individuals are free to use any means *they* choose to  
</I>&gt;<i> participate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, while it doesn't make a lot of sense to me yet, I am  
</I>&gt;<i> encouraged by my understanding of the intent of Michael's so-called  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;cross-forum theatre&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (It seems to me that what is required to support the concept  
</I>&gt;<i> efficiently and effectively is an open data standard for posting the  
</I>&gt;<i> necessary information on the Web.  To me, it seems that XML is the  
</I>&gt;<i> logical choice for the format of the data and that the challenge is  
</I>&gt;<i> to agree upon the core elements and structure of the data to be  
</I>&gt;<i> shared.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Metagov: Open, Electronically Facilitated Group Decision-Making on  
</I>&gt;<i> the Web&quot; may not be a concise or catchy phrase but it seems to me to  
</I>&gt;<i> be what we're talking about, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meta ~ about <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Government ~ the management or control of something
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Gov&#8221; (as in .gov) implies *electronic* government (eGov)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov is about the use of electronic means to manage or control  
</I>&gt;<i> something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I&#8217;d prefer that such means be &#8220;open&#8221; (in the sense of  
</I>&gt;<i> open data).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am adamantly opposed to trying to use such means to impose  
</I>&gt;<i> management or control over anyone who does not explicitly agree to  
</I>&gt;<i> the use of such means for an explicitly identified objective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer that such objectives focus on results that can be  
</I>&gt;<i> observed and measured in the real world -- and achieved by those who  
</I>&gt;<i> are participating -- rather than merely opinions about what somebody  
</I>&gt;<i> else might be expected, much less forced to do against their will.

</I>&gt;<i> To: Metagovernment Project
</I>&gt;<i> Cc: Michael Maranda
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [MG] Open Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i> before deciding that we had enough, I would like to invite you all to
</I>&gt;<i> look at page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bit.ly/icpaWg">http://bit.ly/icpaWg</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please scroll through it, it is quite long.
</I>&gt;<i> Here we can see the automatic analysis of what has happened in the
</I>&gt;<i> last generation.
</I>&gt;<i> In particular we can see that we nearly all agree on &quot;open democracy&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> but for Michael Maranda.
</I>&gt;<i> Michael is a key player and the only person who, by not voting would
</I>&gt;<i> have changed the result.
</I>&gt;<i> You can see this at the end of the page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If now we all decide to accept Open Democracy without recognizing and
</I>&gt;<i> facing this situation we would be making an injustice respect to
</I>&gt;<i> Michael.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But please note that Michael hasn't been stable in his decision not to
</I>&gt;<i> support Open Democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> If we look at the page of the Open Democracy proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bit.ly/etQfyV">http://bit.ly/etQfyV</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we can see that in generation 12 he HAS supported Open Democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> So something must have changed between generation 12 and generation  
</I>&gt;<i> 13.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I would like to invite Michael to step up and tell us:
</I>&gt;<i> a) Can he give us a feedback and tell us what is wrong with the &quot;open
</I>&gt;<i> democracy&quot; proposal. And why was he willing to support it in
</I>&gt;<i> Generation 12 but not in any subsequent generation.
</I>&gt;<i> b) Can he write an alternative to it? ( BTW, actually Vilfredo.org
</I>&gt;<i> sent him an email automatically asking him to write an alternative;
</I>&gt;<i> Michael, did you receive it alright? I'd like to know it as a
</I>&gt;<i> developer)
</I>&gt;<i> c) If he is unable to give an alternative, is he willing to keep on
</I>&gt;<i> participating with Metagovernment.org even if we go forward and chose
</I>&gt;<i> the term open democracy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And if Michael does not like that we go forward, but cannot point out
</I>&gt;<i> what is wrong with &quot;open Democracy&quot; in a way that some of us might,
</I>&gt;<i> and and he cannot offer an alternative then we should do something
</I>&gt;<i> else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo has helped us to see all the alternatives, we have voted,
</I>&gt;<i> analysed possible variations, until we have reached a stable solution.
</I>&gt;<i> But the stable situation is not one solution, but two alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the suggestion that I will bring forward is that the question
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> has now been transformed from an open question to a closed question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We put to vote the answer to this with the only two solutions the
</I>&gt;<i> community has found.
</I>&gt;<i> As suggested in other mails the voting should be using a Condorcet
</I>&gt;<i> voting system.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is a pairwise voting system. And mathematically I believe the
</I>&gt;<i> most sound system.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But a pairwise system among two alternatives is essentially the same
</I>&gt;<i> than a simple poll.
</I>&gt;<i> So in this case we just can ask everybody to vote among the two  
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All this might seem unnecessarily formal, but I believe we are setting
</I>&gt;<i> up a procedure, and the procedure must be set up properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What follow are the alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A)
</I>&gt;<i> Abstract
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here I copied a list of forms of government (Source: Wikipedia).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A properly defined name for &quot;open source governance&quot; shall fit nicely
</I>&gt;<i> into the list. This &#8212;I think&#8212; is the main criteria to take care of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of us like &quot;open source governance&quot;, we just want to change it
</I>&gt;<i> for something less geek. So, I start a step-by-step transformation
</I>&gt;<i> from this point, adding, removing and changing words.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Source Governance -&gt; Open Source Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Source Democracy -&gt; Open Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Authoritarian (The Rule of the few)
</I>&gt;<i> Dictatorship
</I>&gt;<i> Military dictatorship
</I>&gt;<i> Stratocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Dictatorship of the proletariat
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightened absolutism
</I>&gt;<i> Kleptocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Kritarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Absolute monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Constitutional monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Despotism
</I>&gt;<i> Duchy
</I>&gt;<i> Grand Duchy
</I>&gt;<i> Diarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Enlightened absolutism
</I>&gt;<i> Elective monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Hereditary monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Popular monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Principality
</I>&gt;<i> New Monarchs
</I>&gt;<i> Self-proclaimed monarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Plutocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Timocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Police state
</I>&gt;<i> Oligarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Saeculum obscurum
</I>&gt;<i> Theocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Tyranny
</I>&gt;<i> Anarchism (Government of consent, not coercion)
</I>&gt;<i> Anarchist communism
</I>&gt;<i> Libertarian socialism
</I>&gt;<i> Libertarian municipalism
</I>&gt;<i> Anarcho-capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> Green anarchism
</I>&gt;<i> Isocracy
</I>&gt;<i> Local Government
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy (The Rule of the many)

</I>&gt;<i> Parliamentary system
</I>&gt;<i> Consensus government
</I>&gt;<i> Westminster system
</I>&gt;<i> Polyarchy
</I>&gt;<i> Presidential system
</I>&gt;<i> Semi-presidential system
</I>&gt;<i> Republicanism
</I>&gt;<i> Constitutional republic
</I>&gt;<i> Parliamentary republic
</I>&gt;<i> Totalitarian democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> B) Criteria For The Ideal Phrase
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ideal phrase would find a good balance between the following  
</I>&gt;<i> attributes:
</I>&gt;<i> - accuracy
</I>&gt;<i> - clarity
</I>&gt;<i> - brevity
</I>&gt;<i> - descriptiveness
</I>&gt;<i> - uniqueness of meaning
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would also take into account the connotations of the words (common
</I>&gt;<i> usage and understood meanings), rather than their denotations (strict
</I>&gt;<i> definitions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Timelessness, though desirable, is not a requirement:  the criteria
</I>&gt;<i> would recognize that meanings evolve, and so this phrase is not an
</I>&gt;<i> endpoint, but merely one stepping stone along the path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be useful for the term to be appropriate to both online and
</I>&gt;<i> offline methods/activities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Neologisms may or may not be useful.
</I>&gt;<i>
