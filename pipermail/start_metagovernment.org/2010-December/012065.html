<PRE>I have been meaning to update the list on a related note... Jaki had  
been setting up a site for us on TuxFamily.org, which hosts FOSS  
projects. She seems to have dropped away, so I have gotten permission  
from Tux to take it over (something I'll finish doing hopefully this  
week). At that point, we will have a hosting site that is not directly  
tied to me (or more precisely, to my credit card!). And I could then  
open it up to others to be admins, as long as the list accepts them.  
(Our policy in the past is that people are eligible to be an admin if  
they have been significantly active on the list recently and if no one  
else on the list objects. I think you would qualify, Thomas.)

If we want to move the wiki there, we will have to do it piecemeal,  
since we would have to take the &quot;non-commercial&quot; out of anything we  
move over (Tux only supports completely open licenses). But I think  
that is possible. I also hope to set up a forum there (perhaps  
Vanilla, which I had advocated before, and which Mat&#237;as liked as  
well), and the original intention was to also put a blog there, which  
would be more open and less constrained by consensus (i.e.,  
individuals could write about their personal ideas without being  
hampered by needing approval from others.)

Does this sound like a plan?

Separately... great work on Votorola! Please feel free to give more  
detail, as I know there is a lot of work pouring into it.
