<PRE>Dear all,
before deciding that we had enough, I would like to invite you all to
look at page:
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/icpaWg">http://bit.ly/icpaWg</A>

Please scroll through it, it is quite long.
Here we can see the automatic analysis of what has happened in the
last generation.
In particular we can see that we nearly all agree on &quot;open democracy&quot;,
but for Michael Maranda.
Michael is a key player and the only person who, by not voting would
have changed the result.
You can see this at the end of the page.

If now we all decide to accept Open Democracy without recognizing and
facing this situation we would be making an injustice respect to
Michael.

But please note that Michael hasn't been stable in his decision not to
support Open Democracy.
If we look at the page of the Open Democracy proposal:
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/etQfyV">http://bit.ly/etQfyV</A>

we can see that in generation 12 he HAS supported Open Democracy.
So something must have changed between generation 12 and generation 13.

So I would like to invite Michael to step up and tell us:
a) Can he give us a feedback and tell us what is wrong with the &quot;open
democracy&quot; proposal. And why was he willing to support it in
Generation 12 but not in any subsequent generation.
b) Can he write an alternative to it? ( BTW, actually Vilfredo.org
sent him an email automatically asking him to write an alternative;
Michael, did you receive it alright? I'd like to know it as a
developer)
c) If he is unable to give an alternative, is he willing to keep on
participating with Metagovernment.org even if we go forward and chose
the term open democracy?

And if Michael does not like that we go forward, but cannot point out
what is wrong with &quot;open Democracy&quot; in a way that some of us might,
and and he cannot offer an alternative then we should do something
else.

Vilfredo has helped us to see all the alternatives, we have voted,
analysed possible variations, until we have reached a stable solution.
But the stable situation is not one solution, but two alternatives.

So the suggestion that I will bring forward is that the question

has now been transformed from an open question to a closed question.


We put to vote the answer to this with the only two solutions the
community has found.
As suggested in other mails the voting should be using a Condorcet
voting system.
Which is a pairwise voting system. And mathematically I believe the
most sound system.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</A>

But a pairwise system among two alternatives is essentially the same
than a simple poll.
So in this case we just can ask everybody to vote among the two alternatives.

All this might seem unnecessarily formal, but I believe we are setting
up a procedure, and the procedure must be set up properly.


Thanks,
Pietro

What follow are the alternatives.



A)
Abstract

Open Democracy

Here I copied a list of forms of government (Source: Wikipedia).

A properly defined name for &quot;open source governance&quot; shall fit nicely
into the list. This &#8212;I think&#8212; is the main criteria to take care of.

Most of us like &quot;open source governance&quot;, we just want to change it
for something less geek. So, I start a step-by-step transformation
from this point, adding, removing and changing words.

Open Source Governance -&gt; Open Source Democracy

Open Source Democracy -&gt; Open Democracy

That's it.

Authoritarian (The Rule of the few)
Dictatorship
Military dictatorship
Stratocracy
Dictatorship of the proletariat
Enlightened absolutism
Kleptocracy
Kritarchy
Monarchy
Absolute monarchy
Constitutional monarchy
Despotism
Duchy
Grand Duchy
Diarchy
Enlightened absolutism
Elective monarchy
Hereditary monarchy
Popular monarchy
Principality
New Monarchs
Self-proclaimed monarchy
Plutocracy
Timocracy
Police state
Oligarchy
Saeculum obscurum
Theocracy
Tyranny
Anarchism (Government of consent, not coercion)
Anarchist communism
Libertarian socialism
Libertarian municipalism
Anarcho-capitalism
Green anarchism
Isocracy
Local Government
Democracy (The Rule of the many)
Consociationalism
Crowd Governance
Deliberative democracy
Democratic socialism
Direct democracy
Futarchy
Participatory democracy
Representative democracy
Parliamentary system
Consensus government
Westminster system
Polyarchy
Presidential system
Semi-presidential system
Republicanism
Constitutional republic
Parliamentary republic
Totalitarian democracy


And
B) Criteria For The Ideal Phrase

The ideal phrase would find a good balance between the following attributes:
- accuracy
- clarity
- brevity
- descriptiveness
- uniqueness of meaning

It would also take into account the connotations of the words (common
usage and understood meanings), rather than their denotations (strict
definitions).

Timelessness, though desirable, is not a requirement:  the criteria
would recognize that meanings evolve, and so this phrase is not an
endpoint, but merely one stepping stone along the path.

It would be useful for the term to be appropriate to both online and
offline methods/activities.

Neologisms may or may not be useful.
