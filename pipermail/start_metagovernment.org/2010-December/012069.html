<PRE>Hello everybody,
some updates from the Vilfredo front.

Let's start from this summer. This summer I went to the ePart
conference in Lausanne, where I presented the talk, don't vote,
evolve.
The talk went quite well, despite the limited time, and some technical
difficulties. I ended the talk asking is people knew communities that
might have been interested in testing it.

I made a similar plea at an activist meeting in London that I did
before in the summer.

The result was a number of people stepping forward and showing their
interest. So far we haven't managed to get any of this going. But it
became clear how the language factor was an important element. In the
moment we move from the geek community to a more local sedimentary
community we need to make sure everybody can read the website in their
language. We received interest ranging from Italy, to Brasil, to
Germany to Amnesty international, to a community in Zimbabwe. All this
shows how much the bottleneck right now is usability.

So that is what we are working on right now.

I also went to Brussel, and gave a 2 minutes talk (they call it an
&quot;elevator talk&quot;, if you were on an elevator with Bill Gates what would
you tell him to convince him to fund you), with 1 slide. This went
well, and i was approached by 4 groups that wanted to use the Vilfredo
technology in their next project. SO far so good, we are checking if
any of this will become real proposals. I am on email connection with
3 of them at the moment (too bad for the 4th, I think it was even the
most promising!).

On the meantime we are still working on Vilfredo code. Derek, the
saint who is coding Vilfredo at the moment, is finally free again (he
was busy  for most of this year) so we often Skype for a couple of
hours every 2 days working together. I just created a google group for
Vilfredo Development, so I don't have to bother this community to
discuss the latest feature and how to do it.

Oh, yes, I also went to the PdF EU conference, and despite the
frustration of having to hear only and not being allowed to present
anything, it was very interesting, and made some interesting
connections. I would say few people understood eGov as we do here. And
many are here stuck at the phase of using the e to let the Gov reach
the people. But there were also some politicians or people working in
close contacts with politicians and saying: look we get the 3000
email, but now what shall we do with them.

PdFEU was also  where came the question about ICT for Governance that
we mirrored in Vilfredo and had such rapid development.  By the way,
on that front it looks like the Crossroad project has closed the
website with the question. Hopefully taking the answers with them.
Also it looks like the EU commission might be on the verge of a big
change. And after it really supported a lot of research that worked on
using social network for eGov (and often amounted on project setting
up website to have politicians posting on twitter and Facebook all at
ones -I am not making this up!-) now they are looking for more
advanced research. Finally.

Oh, yes we are on the next generation of the name of the thing we are
trying to build. There are also a couple of extra opinions. ANd Ed,
you were key person in the previous generation, did you notice?

Cheers,
Pietro
