What you put in the wiki is very different from what I was talking  
about.

My description of distributed administration of servers is very  
similar to the concept of a RAID or RAIC (redundant array of  
inexpensive disks / computers), except that each server is  
administered by a different person. As long as there are at least  
three computers participating in the array (and preferably many more  
than three), then if one computer starts disagreeing with the  
&quot;consensus&quot; of the other computers in the array (via checksums and  
other abstracted cross-checking mechanisms), it can be considered  
compromised and be kicked out of the array. This lets anyone open up  
an administrated computer, but no one have control. Any modification  
to the current array's administration would take consensus of all the  
admins, or else result in a new fork of the instance.

That said, your concept of distributed administration is very  
intriguing. To borrow terms from the corporate world: my distribution  
is horizontal while yours is vertical.

The two are not mutually exclusive, and can work well together (in the  
same way that RAID 0 and RAID 1 can be combined into something much  
stronger than either alone).
