(sorry for the delay) Votorola's home page sucks, I agree.  I could
never get it right myself.  I'd be happy to replace it with anything
you suggest.

For the open voting network, I don't want to rule out other approaches
but I'm hopeful the new crossforum GUI will serve as a kind of home
page or window of entry.  I'm debating whether to ditch the Web
browser as its runtime platform and switch over to Java/Android.  It
comes down to deciding what's more important for an initial prototype:

 (a) Wider platform coverage, so almost anyone can use it; or
 (b) A better GUI toolkit, so it's faster to develop and more
     attractive to use

What got me thinking about (b) is this, which is attractive in itself:
