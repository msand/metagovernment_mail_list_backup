<PRE>Eudemocracia is doing well so far. Mounting a NGO is a really time consuming
job, hopefully at the very end of this year it will be concluded. Now we are
taking care of minor tasks, such as opening a bank account. We got the legal
NGO status, after almost a year of paperwork and waiting. This month we
achieved also the financial NGO status (tax deductible donations).

But not everything is what it seems. What it was supposed to support your
work turned into something you have to work to support it. Maintaining the
organization promises to be a challenge as big as its initiation for the few
(3) truly active members. I suppose that at a given time a growing
organization crosses the line of self-sustaining and can hire administrative
personnel. I believe we will able to do it within next year. What worries me
most is the lack of volunteers, surely due absence of a good project
promotion&#8212;which requires attention soon.

Meanwhile software development has not even started yet. We count with some
programmers (2 more or less) that do not play a leading role in it: they are
willing to collaborate when it is known what to be done. If only we could
get the bare design and then the specification of the application, we could
get going... I wonder if subscribers of this list would want to participate
in this area.

What we plan to code is something that would allow us to take decisions over
the mailing list (and of course, any mailing list) in a first instance,
backed by a web application that behaves as a forum (with non essential
extra functionalities) and as an archive, in a second one. Lots of groups
make use of mailing lists for internal communication, where aids for
decision making and voting are missing features; by supplying them, this
application has the potential of being successful and rapidly adopted.

Finally, we found a NGO based in New York called HelpArgentina.org that
collects tax deductible donations in the States for NGOs established in
Argentina; currently we are in the process of asking them to add
Eudemocracia to their system. To raise enough money this way to hire
full-time developers is a very attractive idea: off-shoring for
collaborative governance projects.
