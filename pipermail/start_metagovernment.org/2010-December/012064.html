<PRE>For Votorola I can say, that Michael is going back to coding (after he 
is back online soon). After spending some time on documentation and 
theory. Another German is getting more and more involved, which is 
really great. So it is making slow progress.

I personally feel, Votorola needs a proper project-homepage. On the 
other hand, the work we have been doing has outgrown the former 
Votorola-scope by far, which is why we speak of an open network 
meanwhile. But then this needs a proper homepage. And maybe also a 
proper name. I was thinking about, if Metagovernment would want to play 
a role in this, because (as we explained before) this open 
network/architekture potentially embraces all the different 
e-dem-projects. And my ideas about the homepage are similiar to the ones 
we had about Metagov: more than just a wiki and a list. Something more 
inviting, more interactive, ...

What do you think?

Best,
Thomas
