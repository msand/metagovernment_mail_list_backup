Eudemocracia is doing well so far. Mounting a NGO is a really time consuming job, hopefully at the very end of this year it will be concluded. Now we are taking care of minor tasks, such as opening a bank account. We got the legal NGO status, after almost a year of paperwork and waiting. This month we achieved also the financial NGO status (tax deductible donations).

But not everything is what it seems. What it was supposed to support your work turned into something you have to work to support it. Maintaining the organization promises to be a challenge as big as its initiation for the few (3) truly active members. I suppose that at a given time a growing organization crosses the line of self-sustaining and can hire administrative personnel. I believe we will able to do it within next year. What worries me most is the lack of volunteers, surely due absence of a good project promotion&#8212;which requires attention soon.

Meanwhile software development has not even started yet. We count with some programmers (2 more or less) that do not play a leading role in it: they are willing to collaborate when it is known what to be done. If only we could get the bare design and then the specification of the application, we could get going... I wonder if subscribers of this list would want to participate in this area.

What we plan to code is something that would allow us to take decisions over the mailing list (and of course, any mailing list) in a first instance, backed by a web application that behaves as a forum (with non essential extra functionalities) and as an archive, in a second one. Lots of groups make use of mailing lists for internal communication, where aids for decision making and voting are missing features; by supplying them, this application has the potential of being successful and rapidly adopted.

Finally, we found a NGO based in New York called HelpArgentina.org that collects tax deductible donations in the States for NGOs established in Argentina; currently we are in the process of asking them to add Eudemocracia to their system. To raise enough money this way to hire full-time developers is a very attractive idea: off-shoring for collaborative governance projects.
