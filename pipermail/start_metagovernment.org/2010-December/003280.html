<PRE>Hi all,

I've mentioned the New Economics Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/">http://www.neweconomics.org/</A>)
on here before.

They have a democracy and participation
division&lt;<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/programmes/democracy-and-participation">http://www.neweconomics.org/programmes/democracy-and-participation</A>&gt;and
have been developing
tools &lt;<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/crowd-wise">http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/crowd-wise</A>&gt; for
collaborative decision-making.

The way I see it, our aims and methods are very similar, except they are
primarily taking a low-tech, face-to-face approach: getting people together
at meetings and helping them develop the skills to collaborate and make good
decisions.

Since I'll be in London on the weekend of 16 December, I've set up a meeting
with Perry Walker from the nef, who is interested to know a little more
about Metagovernmnet (and is also on this mailing list).

Specifically they'd like to know:

Have our democracy tools been tested much yet? - so I'm also interested in
the project status updates as requested by Ed this week

and

How do we intend to get from here to there? - i.e. how will we build and
maintain a sufficiently large, diverse, cohesive and inclusive community to
achieve our aims.

We'll also talk about how we might be able to help one another, e.g. by
sharing our experiences with the voting and discussion methods we're both
trying out, and sharing any code for software (they are interested in
allowing people to vote online).

If anyone has any input on these points or would like me to raise anything
else with the nef, please post them here before next weekend.

Cheers,
Paul
