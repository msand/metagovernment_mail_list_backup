Subject: [MG] meeting with the new economics foundation

Hi all,

I've mentioned the New Economics Foundation (<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/">http://www.neweconomics.org/</A>) on here before.

They have a democracy and participation division&lt;<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/programmes/democracy-and-participation">http://www.neweconomics.org/programmes/democracy-and-participation</A>&gt; and have been developing tools&lt;<A HREF="http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/crowd-wise">http://www.neweconomics.org/publications/crowd-wise</A>&gt; for collaborative decision-making.

The way I see it, our aims and methods are very similar, except they are primarily taking a low-tech, face-to-face approach: getting people together at meetings and helping them develop the skills to collaborate and make good decisions.

Since I'll be in London on the weekend of 16 December, I've set up a meeting with Perry Walker from the nef, who is interested to know a little more about Metagovernmnet (and is also on this mailing list).

Specifically they'd like to know:

Have our democracy tools been tested much yet? - so I'm also interested in the project status updates as requested by Ed this week

and

How do we intend to get from here to there? - i.e. how will we build and maintain a sufficiently large, diverse, cohesive and inclusive community to achieve our aims.

We'll also talk about how we might be able to help one another, e.g. by sharing our experiences with the voting and discussion methods we're both trying out, and sharing any code for software (they are interested in allowing people to vote online).

If anyone has any input on these points or would like me to raise anything else with the nef, please post them here before next weekend.

Cheers,
Paul
