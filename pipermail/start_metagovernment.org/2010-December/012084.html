<PRE>Wow... my mind is reeling trying to comprehend this &lt;<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum.html">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum.html</A> 
 &gt;. It has an amazing elegance to it, but it also makes it very clear  
to me that I have not been keeping up on my e-mails because I don't  
get it. I need to revisit the idea of cross-forum theater to  
understand what is going on here. Can you point to a succinct summary?  
I think most of the rest of us are not clued into it yet, and looking  
at this, I suspect we should be.
