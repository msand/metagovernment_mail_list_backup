<PRE>Questions for Pietro, and anyone interested in UI graphics,

I guess it could be echoed in crossforum theatre, too:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/theatrePlan.png</A>
It would show up in a feed view (left).  The spatial properties of
each news item would then be projected on the map (right).

What's the purpose of your RSS service?  I guess it notifies people of
state changes in the vote server - new issues to vote on, different
stages of voting - that kind of thing?  Whatever it does, maybe
Votorola could do something similar.  Then the theatre app would
provide an overview of both simultaneously (and any others that wanted
to join the network).

Maybe we can put other Vifredo events under the spotlight, too.  I
notice your users sometimes discuss issues in the list.  Do they ever
feel the need to discuss textual differences?  If so, we're developing
a dedicated feed view for that.  It'll highlight difference based,
consensus-making discussions as they happen.  Maybe Vilfredo users
could benefit from that.

There's maybe no need to code additional APIs for any of this.  But
you might need to extend the existing APIs a little.

BTW we now have SVG graphics for mapping:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#c=DumT">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#c=DumT</A>
Compare to the non-graphical version:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#c=DumDum">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#c=DumDum</A>
It's only plotting test data at the moment.  Next I'll teach it to
plot on the basis of real activity (x), consensus (y) and turnout (z).

It's interesting because we can display just about anything in these
screens, anything that can be drawn in Inkscape.  Plus we can animate
it and manipulate it with the mouse cursor.  Does anyone else like to
play with this kind of stuff?  My visuals aren't the best, but if you
can draw better ones, I'll put them in the code.
