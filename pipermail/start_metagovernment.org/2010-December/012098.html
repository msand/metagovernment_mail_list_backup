<PRE>Happy New Year everyone!

Over in the world of DemocracyLab, there's been either tremendous progress
or none at all, depending on how you look at it.

First the bad news - our code base is in the same underdeveloped state as it
was the last time you checked, and we don't have any sort of meaningful user
community.

The good news is that our idea has captured the attention of Oregon's
largest charitable foundation, and we're working with the team they've
convened to develop specifications for a collaborative problem solving tool,
which they will likely fund the development of (the trustees have to approve
the proposal our group puts together).  You can read more about what we're
doing here: <A HREF="http://democracylab.org/news.">http://democracylab.org/news.</A>

I'll keep this group posted on our progress as it becomes more meaningful.
Here's to an inspiring 2011!

-Mark
