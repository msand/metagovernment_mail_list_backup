<PRE>Wow, thats beautiful! Now it's so much easier to imagine, what the 
theatre will do in the end. And it gets more and more obvious to me, how 
much this type of app was actually needed. It looks like, it is going to 
be the linchpin for the contact between e-democracy and the citizens.

Now right now, Mike, what does each entry stand for? Vote shifts and 
position edits for each poll?

Concerning the homepage: The running theatre is one thing, but wouldnt 
it be good to have a place, where its concepts would be described, 
discussed ... and support and developement could organize itself? I 
wonder how much Metagov-folks stand behind this theatre? IMO it is 
actually the technical manifestation of our umbrella mission. What do 
you guys think?
