<PRE>PS - I'm reminded that we probably don't need &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; and
that GWT is serviceable enough for prototyping.  I guess so.  Here's
the latest GWT code: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/</A>
Click &quot;running code&quot; to see it in action.

It doesn't do anything useful yet, and it's not much to look at.  But
I think it'll eventually fly as a prototype.  The views are backed by
clean models, so we can always port it to native platforms (like
Android) later.

What's special about this app is that it floats above the network
independent of any particular project or provider.  It's designed to
pull other voting tools willy-nilly out into the open by mirroring
their data.  (It's hard to imagine how we could ever open up politics
without first opening up the technology, and the technology is
currently as closed as any session of Congress or Parliament ever was,
and every bit as resistant to change.  Don't you think?)

</I>&gt;<i>  (b) A better GUI toolkit, so it's faster to develop and more

</I>&gt;<i> What got me thinking about (b) is this, which is attractive in itself:
