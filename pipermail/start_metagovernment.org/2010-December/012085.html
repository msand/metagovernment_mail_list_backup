<PRE>Thomas and Ed,

I moved the running code to: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/</A>
I added basic plumbing to scope the views (zoom, filter, etc).  Here's
the same view scoped to the top-left quadrant of the map, for example:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#s=05050N">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/crossforum/#s=05050N</A>

Note that it slows down when scoped (use the back/forward buttons to
compare).  That's because only a fraction of the feed is being
displayed.

These are only dummy views for test purposes.  The feed is just a
random stream of poll names and the map is a 2D scatterplot of their
hash values.

We can start coding useful views any time now.  I think someone else
is working on a feed (tweet-like summary of political discussions) so
I'll probably start with a map - probably a 3D scatterplot of poll
consensus (x), turnout (y) and discussion activity (z).  What do you
think?  Or would something else be more useful?

&gt;<i> Concerning the homepage: The running theatre is one thing, but  
</I>&gt;<i> wouldnt it be good to have a place, where its concepts would be  
</I>&gt;<i> described, discussed ... and support and developement could organize  
</I>&gt;<i> itself? ...
</I>
Yes.  Currently it's discussed etc. in private mostly, which isn't
ideal.

See the theatrePlan.png for a paper napkin sketch.  I added links to
some previous discussion threads:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/</A>

I also added this to the blurb: Basically we're trying to develop a
viewport that can show all the people, places and actions of
e-democracy as they unfold.  This seems to require a temporal feed
(left) and a spatial map (right).  If we can make the stage machinery
general-purpose enough and float it at high enough a level, then maybe
we can bring the entire field into focus.  (Anyway, it's fun to think
we might.)

Best wishes to all,
