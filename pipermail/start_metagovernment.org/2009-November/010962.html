HASTAC 2010: Grand Challenges and Global Innovations Conference

HASTAC is delighted to announce the HASTAC 2010: Grand Challenges and Global
Innovations Conference.

We want to extend an invitation to all of our HASTAC Scholars, DML Winners
and all members to please think about how you can participate in our next
conference. Below is the information on how to participate as an individual,
a group, a panel. Please read and consider being an active participant.
Remember: HASTAC is what you ma

Held April 15-17, 2010 and hosted by the Institute for Computing in
Humanities, Arts, and Social Science at the University of Illinois, HASTAC
2010: Grand Challenges and Global Innovations will be a free, entirely
virtual event held in a multiplicity of digital spaces instigated from sites
across the globe.

This years&#8217; event will focus on grand challenges and global innovations in
the form of technologies, research, teaching, and inquiry that can be
leveraged across personal, physical, geographical, institutional,
disciplinary, and organizational boundaries. HASTAC 2010 seeks to ask: what
are the influence(s) of virtual spaces that can transcend boundaries to
impact global innovations? How will the next generation of digital
technologies alter personal, physical, geographical, institutional,
disciplinary, and organizational boundaries? What are the grand challenges
in humanities, arts, and sciences that will shape the next generation of
global innovation?
