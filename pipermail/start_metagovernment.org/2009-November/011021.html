<PRE>In response to Pietro's question (here copied) :

&gt;<i> I think this is the biggest difficult Vilfredo is facing at the moment:
</I>&gt;<i> why do people start to participate and then they drop off?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How to keep them in the loop, in a way that is non abusive, but it make them
</I>&gt;<i> realise the importance of their presence in reaching an agreement. Any
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion?
</I>
&gt;<i>From personal experience, I would give a few factors that influence my
</I>likelihood to follow up :

1) the need to log on to the website in order to take the next step --
I can explain this with a few scenarios:

1a) I get so many emails in a day, that if I don't respond to this one
right away it very quickly slips my mind. Particularly for
quick-response items that don't end up on my longer-term todo list. I
am not always on a computer, and very often get email on my phone
where I am unable to respond immediately.

1b) Particularly for the 'choose responses' phase, the time to login
is ~5 minutes which is longer than it takes to make my selection and
submit. This, frankly, is not a rewarding activity since I have gone
to the trouble to find the website (the link goes to the question,
then I log in, then I have to find the question again -- which wasn't
easy in the past but is getting better with the 'todo list'), I make
my selections, then there's nothing to do. I don't learn anything, I
just have to wait a week or more to find out what other people think.
I find myself scanning other questions, or proposing new questions, to
feed my curiosity where it was unsatisfied by my activity on the
original question.

But, I often don't have time for this. Facilitating comments and
discussions might have the upside of keeping people engaged, even if
it doesn't help reach consensus. But, also, reducing the time it takes
to make a response would change the value equation to favor
participation -- for example, if the email contained the list of
possible choices AND a link for each choice which could register my
approval of that choice with a single click (like the 'click here to
authenticate your email' links), I would be much more likely to
respond.

2) each generation takes too much time -- but, this I understand is a
function of the number of people participating, so it's a catch-22.
Nonetheless, most users of the internet are impatient and prefer
immediate feedback (feedback is our 'reward', so to speak).

It might be worthwhile to experiment with different configurations --
allowing voting / submission simultaneously, for example -- to see if
this improves participation. There may be a tradeoff here between the
pareto front algorithm and the practicalities of internet user
expectations, such that increased participation improves efficiency
and outweighs the loss incurred from combining stages.

Regarding the other comment and Matias's question:

I can see where Vilfredo is designed to facilitate consensus, but what
if one were to ask 'What are the major causes of non-participation in
Vilfredo?' , or, 'What motivates participants in Metagovernment?'

One thing I really like about Vilfredo's method is that it allows for
multiple responses, and doesn't assume that one answer will be
satisfactory to all. This is a very different interpretation of
'consensus' than I have seen elsewhere.

Maybe this is helpful? Maybe not (feel free to ignore).

Jacki
