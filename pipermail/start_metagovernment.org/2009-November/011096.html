OK, that makes clear the distinction between Metagovernment and  
deliberative processes. Metagovernment, does envision an elimination  
of representative democracy (or at least some of us do... at some  
point in the future) in favor of collaborative democracy.

But our processes could still be informed by deliberative panels  
(something already proposed for Vilfredo). So don't consider us an  
alternative to deliberative panels, but an alternative to the elected  
representatives who would be informed by them.

I think it would be wonderful to have intense focus groups providing  
backgrounders on issues, which are then open for everyone to vote if  
they so please.
