<PRE>Re: [Start] Under what form do you think that this kind of consensus building technique, can be applied for a whole nation governance with maximum efficiency?W/re legitimacy, perhaps this short paper referencing French and Raven's work may be of interest:  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm">http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm</A>

Jean Lipman-Blumen's conceptualization of &quot;control myths&quot; is also relevant: <A HREF="http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf">http://ambur.net/toxicleaders.pdf</A>

With respect to morality, the thesis of my ongoing series of papers at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping">http://ambur.net/index.html#recordkeeping</A> is that there is no substitute for good and complete records that are readily accessible to stakeholders.

One of the things that was disappointing as we converted the strategic plans of .gov agencies to StratML format was how few of them explicitly value honesty.  See <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Carmel">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Carmel</A> and particularly the frequency listing of values in the pane on the right side of the screen at <A HREF="http://www.xmldatasets.net/data/fedgovt.xml">http://www.xmldatasets.net/data/fedgovt.xml</A>

With respect to the role of eGov, consider the implcations of the Theory of the Firm in the context of political institutions and practices:  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_firm</A>  

Information technology holds the potential to revolutionize &quot;governance&quot;:  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm">http://ambur.net/Cult&amp;Tech.htm</A>  

Hopefully, AIIM's emerging StatML standard will make a contribution toward that end, by enabling those who have common objectives to more easily identify each other and work directly together in pursuit of those objectives.

  Hi Michael/Ed/Craig,

  [a] Transition to e-democracy

  I still think that some element of transition might end up being highly desirable and quite possibly inevitable.  I suppose that the key question is: what legitimacy would current political representatives (and structures) have when functioning alongside healthy, viable e-democracy?  The only hypothetical source of legitimacy that I can think of is that they might be supposed to have some greater level of knowledge or suitability through continuity of office.  But I do not think that this would end up corresponding to reality.  I would have thought that their role would be quickly superseded, in itself, although many current political figures would presumably remain in the public eye and gather large numbers of default delegated votes.  On a related question, there's the issue of the extent to which existing institutions could compete with any fully-functioning system of e-democracy.  E-democracy would have such strengths - flexibility, participation, ability to tie in to other institions, etc etc - that there's the possibility that the e-democracy/conventional democracy relationship could look a little like that between computers and abacuses, for example.  

  Anyway, that's the way I see things.  However, I accept that having e-democracy only as an auxiliary mechanism for decision-making would add much.  Similarly, having it working in combination (as an additional 'chamber' for Congress or 'house' of Parliament) with the existing systems would be good.  I don't think there's anything particularly wrong in thinking about the different options, though at the same time I do very much agree with Ed that what matters most  is the gradual progress in demonstrating the ability to provide benefits for communities, starting from the bottom up.

  Michael, I'm not sure I have totally understood your description for how e-democracy would work in combination with current institutions.  I think that you are saying that e-democracy would 'stand behind' elected representatives in the way that political parties do, so that they will be aware of the voting preferences of their constituents before voting.  Thus they will have pressure to vote along the lines that their constituents would like, in the same way that elected representatives currently have pressure from their political party to stick to the party line.  That's pretty different to my version above (the different systems act essentially independently, and either the output of one is fed to the other, or the outputs of both are combined somehow).  I think that my version has advantages in terms of enabling flexibility and allowing, essentially, a different set of representatives (with correspondingly more focussed expertise) to take on each issue; indeed, one can even imagine one person being delegated all votes on an issue.  But I can see it's not an open and shut case.

  In terms of respect for existing institutions, I think this is more from an awareness that change brings real possibilities for harm as well as improvement.  As for constitutional change, I think that one should not be too pessimistic about possibilities for this.  If one imagines a situation where e-democracy had proven its ability to function well on a nation-wide scale (on a steadily growing 'shadow' basis), and was functioning well as a gatherer of opinion on that scale, then I think it's possible to see that attempts by political parties/political elites to hold on to power by maintaining existing political structures could generate significant tensions.  The most obvious parallel in terms of political elites trying to resist greater political participation is possibly 1989: a situation involving resistance by those with political power to the wider dissemination of that power, as here.  Of course, the analogy should only be taken so far.

  One final point - my work on ethics in the economy has convinced me that e-democracy is the only way that ethics can be introduced to economic decision-making on a widespread and meaningful basis, in the way that is needed to address urgent environmental and social problems.  Thus there are big incentives to achieving comprehensive, inclusive success for e-democracy, in the gradual, benefits-based way described.


  [b]  Moral platform

  Much shorter comments, you'll be glad to hear:

    a.. Opening up the moral platform to a much wider set of themes is a great idea. 
    b.. I'm a little concerned about the use of the word 'utopia', because it's so often used in a pejorative sense because there's insufficient regard for achievability.  Maybe, though, that would only require a relatively little re-branding, and maybe the usage of such a well-known term would be good.  As long as the website was clearly for the mapping of current positions and the realisation of achievable goals (giving that a totally open definition) then I think would certainly be on board. 
    c.. I think your final point here about fitting in with existing practice ties in here: it might be helpful to make the site more about plotting a course from where we are than thinking abstractly about inventing a new world (or possibly structuring the site so that that type of input doesn't dominate (though I'm not sure if one can do this in any way objectively to avoid top-down influence)).  Linking the site to the legal one will draw in users.



  [c]  (1) Thanks

        (2) And also for comments on auto-delegation and where it's at at the moment.  Thanks for the ideas for the project to develop that, but I don't imagine that my skills (or probably resources) are likely to be sufficient.  I imagine that social science-type contributions are all I'm likely to be good for.

  &gt; Hi Tom,
  &gt; 
  &gt; I have critique of [a b], but I agree with [c].  I hope we can work
  &gt; together.
  &gt; 
  &gt;&gt; [a] I assume constitutional change, but I can't see how that could be a
  &gt;&gt; popular constitutional change.  Obviously constitutional systems vary but
  &gt;&gt; I'm not aware of any that has provisions for a participative system, or any
  &gt;&gt; other popular input, to propose constitutional change, although I think that
  &gt;&gt; popular ratification by referendum is sometimes required.
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; Therefore, current elected representatives would have to relinquish power to
  &gt;&gt; a participative system, presumably with some degree of popular pressure to
  &gt;&gt; overcome resistance by those elected representatives for their loss of
  &gt;&gt; power/income.  A natural source for such pressure would be some kind of
  &gt;&gt; 'shadow' e-governance system, which growing up alongside existing political
  &gt;&gt; structures would presumably have increasing influence on policy outcomes.
  &gt;&gt; However, knowledge within society of participative alternatives, being used
  &gt;&gt; in other organisational settings, could potentially be sufficient.
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; I suppose there might be possibilities for those in an open participative
  &gt;&gt; system to take power for themselves somehow, but I'm not sure how the
  &gt;&gt; mechanics of that would work and it doesn't seem in any way an appealing way
  &gt;&gt; forward.
  &gt; 
  &gt; I agree with that.  I admire your respect for existing institutions.
  &gt; But constitutional change is historically unlikely.  What about this
  &gt; combination?
  &gt; 
  &gt; 1. Existing institutions (as they are)
  &gt; 2. Open participative system (something new)
  &gt; 
  &gt; Both 1 and 2 are mutually independent and non-interfering.
  &gt; Therefore no constitutional change is required to add 2.  Compare it
  &gt; with the party system, which also arose extra-constitutionally.  It
  &gt; dramatically changed the function of government without touching the
  &gt; structure.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Consider also that the parties are nothing but primary electoral
  &gt; systems.  So we make 2 a *better* primary electoral system, and we
  &gt; enter by the same back door the parties did, 150 years ago.
  &gt; 
  &gt; It's more than that.  There are technical and social-theoretic reasons
  &gt; why the combination (1 and 2) is stronger than 1 or 2 alone.  It's as
  &gt; though society needed two legs to stand on.

  ED ADDED

  &gt; This is similar what I envision for the most part, and why I advocate  
  &gt; starting governance systems in very small communities and then scaling  
  &gt; upward. If, for example, a new nonprofit organization is in the  
  &gt; process of starting up, they could choose to use one of the Active  
  &gt; Projects as their sole governance mechanism. If they are successful,  
  &gt; then members of that group might start using the same system to  
  &gt; replace individual committees in other organizations they work with.  
  &gt; From there, maybe eventually someone will think to use it to run a  
  &gt; small branch of their township government. And upward/outward from  
  &gt; there.
  &gt; 
  &gt; So I see it not exactly as a shadow as much as a creeping replacement,  
  &gt; bit-by-bit and only as it proves itself worthy in smaller cases.

  END OF ED'S ADDITION

  &gt;&gt; [b] As far as I can make out we're talking about fairly different things
  &gt;&gt; here.  I think you are talking about creating a utopia blueprint using
  &gt;&gt; e-governance type tools?  I'm thinking of something much less ambitious:
  &gt;&gt; just thinking through, collectively, fairly specific moral issues (such as:
  &gt;&gt; when is murder 'okay' (self-defence, mental illness, diminished
  &gt;&gt; responsibility etc)) in an open 'moral' setting before worrying about
  &gt;&gt; framing these into a practical legal setting.  These moral positions could
  &gt;&gt; then tie in to a larger whole, which would constantly be evolving.  It would
  &gt;&gt; also hopefully be possible to leave room for different groups
  &gt;&gt; (geographical/religious etc etc) to take different approaches).  The idea
  &gt;&gt; would be to provide solid moral roots/discussion for the 'higher-level' law
  &gt;&gt; subsequently produced, and for moral and legal developments to move hand in
  &gt;&gt; hand.  I think that from this perspective perhaps many of the deeper
  &gt;&gt; philosophical considerations covered in the material in your link don't
  &gt;&gt; arise, or if they do then are solved during the process I describe rather
  &gt;&gt; than through philosophy.  I hold up my hand, though, and confess to almost
  &gt;&gt; no philosophical background, so let me know if I have missed the point of
  &gt;&gt; your material.
  &gt; 
  &gt; (Sorry, it's just rough notes.  It's not a philosophical method in
  &gt; itself.  That's just my attempt to understand it.)
  &gt; 
  &gt; The idea is that people try to agree on a common vision for the
  &gt; future.  From the perspective of the users, they use the same e-dem
  &gt; tools that allow them to reach consensus on laws, and so forth.  Only
  &gt; they apply those tools to the cultural text of a utopion vision of the
  &gt; good life - the best possible future.  The consensus and/or mutual
  &gt; understanding that emerges from that effort would then serve as the
  &gt; platform for the pursuit of narrower political aims - laws and so
  &gt; forth - just as you say.
  &gt; 
  &gt; The vision would not be purely of morality, but much broader.  Utopian
  &gt; literature natually combines all of the cultural spheres into which
  &gt; modern society is fragmented - science, art, engineering, morality -
  &gt; and binds them all together.  It's a wide and deep platform to build
  &gt; upon.
  &gt; 
  &gt;&gt; In terms of the nuts and bolts of how moral standpoints would evolve - I see
  &gt;&gt; that happening using a more basic format than that for e-governance (legal
  &gt;&gt; etc) principles.  Interested individuals/organisations would explore and
  &gt;&gt; develop moral issues that one or more of their number had proposed and map
  &gt;&gt; levels of support for different ideas.
  &gt; 
  &gt; The challenge is to fit the method with existing practice.  It's risky
  &gt; to develop new tools for completely new purposes (morality building),
  &gt; because you begin with no practical guidelines, and no user base.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Analogy: I think there's a place for formal argumentation in
  &gt; discussion media, but it's a small place.  Most people prefer to talk
  &gt; the old fashioned way.  The same may be true for the expression of
  &gt; morality.  How was it expressed in the past?  Keep as close to that as
  &gt; you can, because you know it works.
  &gt; 
  &gt;&gt; [c] Again, apologies if I haven't got the full extent of what you are saying
  &gt;&gt; here.  If I have, then I think that there are additional elements in what I
  &gt;&gt; am saying.  These are: 1) a two stage process of voting; and (more
  &gt;&gt; importantly) 2) delegation of voting power to someone else for a certain
  &gt;&gt; policy area until further notice, for all votes within that area.
  &gt;&gt; 
  &gt;&gt; 1) Two (or more) stage process of voting: The first stage would involve
  &gt;&gt; proposals being worked up (using wiki/voting etc etc) by specialised
  &gt;&gt; interested parties.  Their output then would be voted for ideally by the
  &gt;&gt; whole electorate, directly or indirectly.  (If there were more stages of
  &gt;&gt; voting, then proposals would be successively scrutinised by wider and wider
  &gt;&gt; sub-communities of the overall electorate before final passing.)
  &gt; 
  &gt; I think that all such systems are staged, with the exception of
  &gt; Votorola.  We distribute the drafting effort throughout the entire
  &gt; delegation tree/forest.  It's the core of the invention.  (We're
  &gt; working right now on improving the presentation of the ideas, but for
  &gt; now all we have is this:
  &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-norm">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-norm</A>
  &gt; 
  &gt;&gt; 2) Delegation of voting power has, therefore, to be structured to give the
  &gt;&gt; idea of 'whole electorate voting' any sense of achievability.  Your cascade
  &gt;&gt; ideas represent (and go far beyond) what I was envisaging in terms of
  &gt;&gt; individual votes.  However, I was thinking of enabling people to assign
  &gt;&gt; policy areas (of whatever size and nature they wanted (within the
  &gt;&gt; capabilities of the system)) to someone else, until further notice, for all
  &gt;&gt; votes within that area.  Without such a capability, each person would need
  &gt;&gt; to participate in far too many votes, most of which they would have no
  &gt;&gt; interest in and know nothing about.  That's the basic outline.  There's a
  &gt;&gt; little more detail (such as an initial default to one's MP) in my original
  &gt;&gt; Vilfredo post.
  &gt; 
  &gt; We need such a facility for Votorola.  Other voting engines will need
  &gt; it, too.  I think that Adhocracy already has some of that built into
  &gt; it.  Friedrich has just released his &quot;beta 2&quot;: <A HREF="http://adhocracy.cc/">http://adhocracy.cc/</A>
  &gt; 
  &gt; We briefly talked (Friedrich, Thomas and I) about developing a shared
  &gt; facility of auto-delegation - a common tool that the voters of all
  &gt; engines could use.  But nobody's moved on it, yet.  It's wide open, if
  &gt; you are interested.
  &gt; 
  &gt; There's other common e-dem facilities in the pipeline - just talk, at
  &gt; the moment.  Eventually one of them is going to catch on.  Votorola
  &gt; wants to be a part of that, when it happens.  We'll work with anyone
  &gt; who feels the same.
  &gt; 
  &gt; Best,
