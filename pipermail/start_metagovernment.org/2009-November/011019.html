<PRE>Hello everyone,
 
My apologies for my lack of participation recently.
 
To update Ed's comments below, we don't really have state-wide participation
in our site.  The link he used is for Project 2059, a community for Oregon's
youth that never quite took off.
 
We're currently focused on working with the Chalkboard Project to use our
website to solicit feedback from teachers concerning Oregon's Race to
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html">http://www.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html</A>&gt;  the Top proposal.  The
intent is for Oregon to capture a share of the $3.5 billion of federal money
(in the US) available to improve public education.  The Chalkboard Project
community is still having its content populated.  We're planning a focus
group with teachers for December 7th.
 
We've also created a community for DemocracyLab team members to use the tool
to help shape the future of the organization.  This is a new community and
is just getting off the ground.  You could view all of DemocracyLab's
communities here &lt;<A HREF="http://democracylab.democracylab.org/">http://democracylab.democracylab.org/</A>&gt; .
 
I'm optimistic that we'll see further progress with our software in 2010,
though I agree with Jim that the biggest challenge is getting users.
Hopefully our strategy of engaging teachers will attract interest and help
give our project some much needed momentum.
 
Best of luck to everyone in their work.
 
-Mark
