<PRE>Hi Matias,
I am not sure I understand.

A person would ask a closed question, and give the possible answers.
then everybody would vote.

Then the pareto front would happen.
And we are left with a subset of answers.
Now what would people be writing in the second generation?


Or:

A person would ask an OPEN answer, and give SOME possible answers.
then everybody would vote.

Then the pareto front would happen.
And we are left with a subset of answers.
Now what would people be writing in the second generation?


If your suggestion is the first, then I think the answer is no. Vilfredo is
designed for open questions. There is a huge theory on closed questions. And
the book you showed me on voting is the best text I found so far.

If instead your suggestion is the second,
then yes, you can. But essentially you can do this immediately.
You open a question,
and you open this question in your own private room, so no one bothers you.
You do not invite anyone,
you set up a minimum moveon time very short,
you write, alone, the answers (at least 2),
then you move on.
(I am not sure if Vilfredo let you move on if you are in first generation,
having answers only from one person, in case I would need to fix that.)
At that point you are given a url, and then you send the email to everybody
you want to participate.
(So this is the different bit, you actually need to take care of this).

And then the rest is the same.

But why exactly would you want to do this?

Also, maybe to make this easier we could organise a system where a person
can send reminders or invites to people to participate in a question. I am
always a bit worried that Vilfredo might end up sending too much mails. But
I also have this situation where people start to participate, and then they
drop off.

I think this is the biggest difficult Vilfredo is facing at the moment:
why do people start to participate and then they drop off?

How to keep them in the loop, in a way that is non abusive, but it make them
realise the importance of their presence in reaching an agreement. Any
suggestion?

&gt;<i> Can we have a poll mode, where the generation starts with the voting
</I>&gt;<i> instead of the questioning? (The creator of the question provides the
</I>&gt;<i> possible answers as well.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example: &quot;When we do the next meeting?&quot; And I write also &quot;Monday ||
</I>&gt;<i> Wednesday || Friday.&quot; The voting happens directly, because in this question
</I>&gt;<i> it wasn't necessary to wait for others' proposals. (And if it would,
</I>&gt;<i> generation 2's input stage should fix that.)
