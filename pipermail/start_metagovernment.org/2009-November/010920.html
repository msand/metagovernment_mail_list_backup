<PRE>In my obsessive need for synthesis... I have to note that at their  
core the two ideas are not mutually exclusive.

There are distinct values to input from participants and developers.  
The idea of having developers present to each other has the additional  
benefit of encouraging developers to participate in each others'  
project and also of giving additional ideas on how to increase/ 
facilitate participation.

In any event, there is nothing to lose other than a little time making  
the presentation and a little time mulling over the unique ideas  
invented by other developers.

</I>&gt;<i> I have seen gazillions of projects die for lack of participants.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact that is by and large the only way projects die.
</I>&gt;<i> If a project has participants, but something else goes wrong (the  
</I>&gt;<i> programmer does not want to keep it anymore), he can always sell it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead the ones that I have seem successful, by and large, all  
</I>&gt;<i> started as very small, very useful tool, that were used immediately  
</I>&gt;<i> while still in pre-alpha by people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yahoo was a directory of useful links.
</I>&gt;<i> Google a search engine with a new search algorithm,
</I>&gt;<i> livejournal a way to let the first programmer let his parents and  
</I>&gt;<i> friends know what he was doing while he was away in college,
</I>&gt;<i> delicious a way to store bookmarks for few people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea were good, were easy to use, and people used them.
</I>&gt;<i> As people used them THEY started to asking for new feature.
</I>&gt;<i> And you kept on having this continuous dialogue between the  
</I>&gt;<i> programmers and the users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Look even at this list. It started with few people and a web  
</I>&gt;<i> announcement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The fact is that most of those projects are only alive and make  
</I>&gt;<i> sense if there are enough people.
</I>&gt;<i> This is why it is so difficult to produce a better version of  
</I>&gt;<i> something. Even if you program it, you still will not have the  
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I participate in a number of online communities. In one of  
</I>&gt;<i> those the administrator actually stole the community from its members.
</I>&gt;<i> We decided to leave the community, and were going to set up our oun  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion group. This guy who was at the time just arrived, set it  
</I>&gt;<i> up, and presented it, done packed, and ready. Like a swarm of bees  
</I>&gt;<i> we all joined, and when we realised that he has kept all the  
</I>&gt;<i> administrative decisions for himself it was too late. Every time we  
</I>&gt;<i> tried to fork and create a new community the new community would  
</I>&gt;<i> just not have enough support to remain alive, and eventually we  
</I>&gt;<i> would go back.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The community IS the real key thing. Once you have that you can  
</I>&gt;<i> write the code around it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You start with the code, you will end up sitting alone in your  
</I>&gt;<i> cristal palace.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. &quot;gazillions&quot;.... what a cool word!
