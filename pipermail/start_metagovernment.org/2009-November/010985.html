<PRE>Welcome back Jacki, you haven't posted in a while.  (I'm about to
retire from email myself, and get back to coding.)

My definitions of &quot;e-dem&quot; and &quot;e-gov&quot; are probably too extreme for
most.  I define e-dem as technology in support of everyday people, and
e-gov as technology in support of administrative systems.  I use these
extreme definitions because I learned from social theory that people
need to be shielded (as such) from the effects of systems, and
strengthened (as such) from within.  So I take integrity as the whole
challenge of e-dem.  If it enables people to collectively stand up in
public without being knocked down, and to speak for themselves without
being shouted down, then I say they *are* already a democracy.
Nothing more is needed.  There is no central role for government and
politics.

But this is only a stance.  It's more a way of dealing with reality
than a completely true statement of it.  It also makes it hard to
communicate with others who don't share the same stance.  Nothing I
say makes much sense to them.  (Some people are more open minded
though, and can see both sides. ;^)

I think the mission statement is where Metagov swallowed hard and
tried to embrace both.  If anyone's being too extreme and one sided,
I'm afraid it's more likely to be yours truly. ;^)
