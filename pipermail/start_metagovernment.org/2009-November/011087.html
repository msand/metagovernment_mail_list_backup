Well, I don't really agree with how you are framing the problem. Let's 
start with some definitions:

raw public opinion == What a person thinks about an issue before 
thinking about it deeply.

refined public opinion == What a person would think about an issue 
after thinking about it deeply.

The idea of a deliberative poll is that you take a random sample of the 
population and give them a good space to deliberate on an issue. 
Participants come with a raw public opinion and develop a refined public 
opinion. After the deliberations, the panel of citizens is in a position 
to report on the issue in question with refined public opinion. Since 
the random sample is statistically equivalent to the population, the 
position(s) they adopt _are_ the positions that the population at large 
would arrive at if they had a good space to think about the issues.

(For a longer discussion of the same, see Fishkin 2009)

&gt;<i> My own approach has been to develop a method that can:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Scale to help as many people participate as possible, recognizing
</I>&gt;<i> that the passionately self-selected ones will of course be among the

</I>&gt;<i> everyone who has something to say will get vetted by a minimum
</I>&gt;<i> number of peers in exchange for the responsibility of vetting
</I>&gt;<i> others, and;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Advance the most popular and &quot;best&quot; ideas through a process of
</I>&gt;<i> Coalescent Bubbling (So far I've only been able to build a primitive
</I>&gt;<i> demo piece of the 3rd element, but I haven't given up).
</I>
Fine.

I respect your efforts. I am only arguing that you ought to acknowledge 
the chief shortcoming in your approach---that random sampling is not 
employed. Furthermore, I hope you will explicitly support other efforts 
towards deliberative democracy which incorporate a random sampling 
approach.
