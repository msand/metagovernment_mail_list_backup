<PRE>&gt;<i> If it is a one dimension, I would need to code a dominant function such that
</I>&gt;<i> endorse dominates ignore
</I>&gt;<i> ignore dominates oppose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the case, then yes, there is more information. But then why stop
</I>&gt;<i> at 3, move it to 4, move it to n, order them all (A, B, ..., N) (I rather
</I>&gt;<i> have this A, than B, B than ..., ... than N). You can even give to each a
</I>&gt;<i> continuous&#160; value. Just let people move a sliding rule for each element, and
</I>&gt;<i> let them go with their gut feelings.
</I>
Ah, but that is a level of refinement that I would argue is in a
different category than the valence (+/-) of the value itself.  It's
like balancing a pin on it's tip, from the zero point it is simply
neutral, but nudge it one way or another (regardless of the level of
refinement) and it selects a much vaster category than the (later)
finer levels of intensity *within* a given valence (in this analogy,
either the force of gravity or the length of the pin would have to be
variable, but in either case the *valence* (opposed or supported) is
retained).

&gt;<i> All this works well in terms of pareto
</I>&gt;<i> front. And I do not exude to add it at some point. The only problem about
</I>&gt;<i> this is that the more valuse people have to chose from the more inconsistent
</I>&gt;<i> they will be in their choise. The more hard will be for the function to
</I>&gt;<i> converge. SO adding possibilities will not make them easier to converge, but
</I>&gt;<i> harder.
</I>
Again, I think this is only a problem with entertaining multiple
values within a given valence, not the three-valued logic as given.
(It may be interesting to note that in digital circuits, for example,
having a three-valued system of true, false, and &quot;don't care&quot;, many
operations are made much more efficient.  Adding values beyond this
add nothing.)

Each user should be seen as it's own dimension and each user is adding
a vector of force along their own dimension or &quot;angle&quot; from that
delicate, (as yet) undecided zero-point.  The intensity of that force
along any given dimension is a factor of the user's reputation.  The
factor of time, or generations, is like this:  For each given
proposal, it is already a winning proposal, a *working* proposal whose
confidence is set to the propos-ers's reputation, but upon any dissent
it is marked &quot;tentative&quot;.  Anyone can dissent at any time like
Vilfredo to start the process of further re-evaluation/synthesis, at
such point the proposal is marked &quot;in contention&quot;, but can still be
allowed to be a working proposal.

There is some fascinating number theoretical (and geometrical)
problems in here, but too cumbersome to go into...

&gt;<i> As I said, I don't rule out the possibility to add this in future.
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't want to impose what mathematically I see as an inferior system
</I>&gt;<i> to anyone, so it will have to be a choise from the questioner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A totally different idea is if the ignore, not ignore &amp; approve, not ignore
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; oppose possibilites represent elements in a 2 dimensional plane.
</I>
Yes, I believe this is what I'm suggesting if I understand your
terminology correctly.

&gt;<i> In this case I am not sure how would I have to set up the domination
</I>&gt;<i> function.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure thing
</I>&gt;<i> not ignore &amp; approve dominates not ignore &amp; oppose.
</I>&gt;<i> But how do those relate to the ignore part?
</I>
The ignore part drops out and disappears into (or as) a separate
dimension.  This is where the recursive, fractal function comes into
play because presumably these votes are occuring within an even larger
context or set of axioms/principles; in other words, ultimately all
the proposals must relate to these foundational principles (either in
support or opposition to them), like the metagovernments [[basic
principles]], for example, or the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.

In any case, and in this sense, it is important not to let the approve
part dominate the oppose part but keep each as differently valenced
forks in the decision tree, letting each evolve and decend/branch-out
into cogent elucidation of the controversy on both sides *until* one
or the other branch is seen to be in contradiction to a foundational
principles.  If no such contradiction is found, presumably, it is in
support of them.  Obviously if they are in opposition to said
principles, the proposal must be rejected (that branch of exploration
is dropped from the trunk and the points/value invested in it gets
recycled back into the community).  In the event of support, the
proposal is added off the main trunk, with all the vote points and
detail propagated down its &quot;branch&quot; to constitute its public record.

As you can see, I'm taking the voting methodology and making it into
an abstract economy of ideas, a &quot;Tree of Life&quot; with the foundational
principles as the trunk of the tree.

&gt;<i> If you have two questions, and everybody approve the first, and you ignore
</I>&gt;<i> the second, does this mean that the first dominate the second, and the
</I>&gt;<i> second should be lost?
</I>
No, both are kept, but the value (or confidence) assigned is the
summation of votes in support.  Consider it like the &quot;thickness&quot; of
the branch of the aforementioned Tree.  It represents the strength of
the proposal in relation to the foundational principles of the trunk
of that community.

&gt;<i> What if instead everybody opposes the first and ignores the second, whould
</I>&gt;<i> we now keep the second?
</I>
The first is kept until a contradiction is found further up the tree
that would put it at odds with the foundational principles (only then
could it be &quot;dropped&quot;).  Until then, the proposal is simply marked
&quot;controversial&quot;.   The second is still kept.

&gt;<i> Because if both those are true, we are back at the unidimensional case, and
</I>&gt;<i> you can as well ask people to rate things with 1 star, 2 stars or 3 stars.
</I>
Again, I think the only way to look at this coherently is within the
context of a *larger* set of (more general) axioms in which the
proposals are occurring.  Only within a certain scale is it one
dimensional, but in the larger context it is part of an enfolding of
propositions that is multidimensional.

&gt;<i> And if those are not true, I woudl like you to explicitly tell me how should
</I>&gt;<i> I handl those cases.
</I>
Hope the above makes it clearer.

&gt;<i> We have space for both.
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo needs its testing ground. When the tools developed from Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> will be tested enough, we might see them re-used in multiple sites.
</I>&gt;<i> And on the other side I prefer not to have the weight of being the main
</I>&gt;<i> developer of the official tool from metagovernment.
</I>
I would love to be, it's just a matter of finances and other support.

&gt;<i> This gives me some
</I>&gt;<i> freedom to make sure what we do is mathematically meaningful.
</I>
Personally, the project is only interesting so long as it stays
mathematically meaningful.  Without such, the project would eventually
devolve into something arbitrarily meaningless.

&gt;<i> I keep on
</I>&gt;<i> seeing site with math blunders in them, and it stops them from achieving
</I>&gt;<i> their full greatness. An example? delicious should use the symbols +,*, (,
</I>&gt;<i> ), to permit union, and intersection of tags. With * being the intersection.
</I>&gt;<i> When I suggested it it was already too late.
</I>
I know.  It sucks.  Such simple things could make sites much more
powerful and rich.

&gt;<i> we have a wiki wave on vilfredo, if you are interested in going there. tell
</I>&gt;<i> me your google wave account name.
</I>
Yeah, see below....
