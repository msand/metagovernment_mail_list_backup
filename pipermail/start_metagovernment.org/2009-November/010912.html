Share your designs with us, and we'll give you free feedback! :^) It's
the design of NationBuilder that matters, not the popularity of its
first implementation.  Attracting users may be difficult, but how
could it be the essential problem?  Mass appeal has never been a
guarantee of meaningful participation.  Many things are attractive to
a mass that run counter to democracy.

I think the tools must fit - not only in the hands of users - but also
in society at large.  We need both usability and utility, but the hard
part has always been utility.  What is the effect of the tool, and how
does the design contribute to it?  Have you posted this anywhere?
(Don't worry if it's not usuable yet, we can make it so!)
