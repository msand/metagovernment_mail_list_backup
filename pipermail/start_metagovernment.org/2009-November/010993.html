It's a political aim.  You're looking for solidarity, where people
come together in a common cause.  It's the dream of every politician.
I can't fault you for expecting that others - entrepreneurs, academics
and engineers - ought to share that dream and pull together in
acheiving it.  I can't fault you because I make the same mistake in
regard to my own ambitions.  I expect that politicians like you, and
entrepreneurs (like Jim and Craig) and academics (like Pietro and
Giovanni) ought to lend a hand in developing an open technology.
Still, I'm even more naive, because I see all this and here I am,
writing it down - that the politician dreams of building consensus,
the entrepreneur of building enterprise, the academic of career and
the engineer of machines - yet *still* I cannot see why these are
incompatible.

Four strong winds that blow lonely,
Seven seas that run high,
All those things that don't change, come what may.
If the good times are all gone,
Then I'm bound for moving on.
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.
