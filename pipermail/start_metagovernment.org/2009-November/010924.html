Why?  Is there anything unreasonable in it?

You do hope the tool will be useful.  You also hope it will be
popular, and will have some effect in society.  You're an engineer.
What effect do you intend, and how does the design contribute to it?
Is this a fair question?  (Or should the engineer aim for popularity,
without regard for the consequences?)

You said you wanted feedback from people.  Now you say, &quot;i'm not
asking for feedback&quot;.  You put in your &quot;2 cents&quot;.  What did you hope
for, in return?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in society at large.  We need both usability and utility, but the hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part has always been utility.  What is the effect of the tool, and how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does the design contribute to it?  Have you posted this anywhere?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Don't worry if it's not usuable yet, we can make it so!)
