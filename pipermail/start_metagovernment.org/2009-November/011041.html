<PRE>&gt;<i> I tend to agree that I don't see why the link is needed either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But mostly because I am not even convinced that the project is &quot;needed&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FOr me you need something if you cannot live without it. And honestly we can
</I>&gt;<i> live without it. In fact many people will live better without (the
</I>&gt;<i> politicians, the rich people, the one who use the imbalances in society to
</I>&gt;<i> exert a big influence).
</I>
Ah!  But that is the reason it IS needed!  Many people are living good
without it at the *expense* of everyone else (which is to say the bulk
of us!).  Personally I have very little voice in the process of my own
life--nearly everything was owned and &quot;staked out&quot; before I was born
and so I have to justify just doing the most *basic* human things to
live--like having a place to sleep for the night, for example.

So I implore you not to think that the project is not needed--without
a better way for the masses to be coordinated and balance out the
top-heavy institutions of power, the present way of organization is
simply unsustainable--they are simply too detached to feel the
consequences and impact of their decisions (to the extent they know
about them at all); hence disenfranchisement and apathy is the norm.
