(I didn't see the context of the question.  Pietro, is there any way
 to see the questions without logging in?  It would be more inviting.)

&gt;<i> [a] Transition to whole nation governance using these internet
</I>&gt;<i> consensus building techniques
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ... Under this type of transition, people's current political
</I>&gt;<i> representatives would 'inherit' the delegated power that they have now -
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. elected political representatives would have the number of votes under
</I>&gt;<i> their control on the online system that they had immediately prior to the

</I>
I think you assume a popular constitutional change in favour of some
form of participative democracy.  But don't you first need a
participative democracy, if you want a popular constitutional change?

&gt;<i> [b] Ethics, morality and law
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my view, it will be important to have a system that distinguishes between
</I>&gt;<i> ethics and morality, on the one hand, and law, on the other. &#160;On an
</I>&gt;<i> individual level, my feeling is that people's first concern on issues
</I>&gt;<i> revolves around rights and wrongs (morality) and therefore a 'moral' forum

I think so, too.  But it's difficult to talk about in abstract terms.
The concrete form of a moral consensus would depend on the design of
the consensus building system.  Here's one form:

&gt;<i> [c] Participation and delegation
</I>
Here's a description of a recursive delegation system:

Is that what you mean?  Or is your proposal different?
