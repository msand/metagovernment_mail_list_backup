<PRE>2009/11/3 Mat&#237;as Battocchia &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">battox at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> When a comment is submitted, the comment's windows should close.
</I>The article commenting is still &quot;work in progress&quot; I would prefer that
the comment list is shown after submitting so you can see your own
comment, but this requires some heavy javascript hacking because of
the article quoting. Currently its not high on our priority list but
we will get to it eventually ...

&gt;<i> After voting, I would like to have the possibility of changing my opinion.
</I>I don't think this is a good idea. You cant go to the voting urn in a
real election and change your mind either. Just make up your mind
before you vote ...

&gt;<i> Revision numbers don't mean anything for me. They don't aid for the
</I>&gt;<i> interface simpleness.
</I>Yes we have thought of this also. I will try not to make it so central
but it is needed as a unique identifier and will become more important
when we add proposal importing/exporting to enable offline editing.

&gt;<i> I would rename &quot;settings&quot; article by &quot;Candiwi settings&quot;.
</I>Maybe a good idea to emphasize what its for, although I do like short names.

&gt;<i> &quot;Current Proposal : 72-hour review time&quot; has its colon spaced from
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Proposal&quot;.
</I>Oh Ill fix it :)

&gt;<i> &quot;Time Remaining: 22:46:26.465137&quot; is an ugly time format.
</I>Yes this is known and on our TODO list.

&gt;<i> There is a text field &quot;&lt;proposal&gt; is in Editing/Voting status&quot; and then
</I>&gt;<i> another, &quot;Current proposal: &lt;proposal&gt;&quot;. They can be merged into one:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Current proposal &lt;proposal&gt; is in Editing/Voting status.&quot;
</I>I prefer to have simple labels which make it easier to see on a quick
glance (like &quot;Proposal: NAME&quot; State: STATE) instead of having to read
a sentence. Ultimately a matter of taste so if more prefer a sentence
oriented structure I will change it.

&gt;<i> Create article/proposal links could be converted into buttons (same color as
</I>&gt;<i> tabs), so it's easier to see them at first glance.
</I>I think manu has planning to do something like this.

&gt;<i> Tabs are somewhat confusing. It takes a while to get used to them. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> candiwi still looks minimalist adding 3 more tabs in order to solve that,
</I>&gt;<i> this way: a new orange bar is added below the blue one (with infomation)
</I>&gt;<i> that in turn is under the orange tab's bar: when a proposal is selected. In
</I>&gt;<i> this bar, tabs are upside down as if they came from the blue bar; think in a
</I>&gt;<i> 180 degrees rotation of the original tab bar. A tab says &quot;Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> articles&quot;, other &quot;Proposal history&quot;, and the last &quot;Selected proposal&quot;.
</I>This is a topic of heavy discussion and experimentation. We had a
design similar to what you suggest a few week back before manu
overhauled the UI. The problem with this is it increases complexity
and does not make it more understandable because of this. I think we
will try out various things over time and see what works best.
I personally am for a very minimalist approach and making better use
of colours/icons/breadcrumbs.

PS: If anyone finds a nice and free icons for
(proposals/editing/voting/archived, articles/added/removed/changed
Changes ...) please let me know :)
