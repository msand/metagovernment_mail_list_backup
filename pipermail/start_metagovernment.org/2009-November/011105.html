&gt;<i> The repeated proposals are a (small) problem. When I like a proposal and
</I>&gt;<i> see similar ones, I vote for all of them, and I imagine that everybody does
</I>&gt;<i> the same thing. So, the repeated proposals are likely to reach the next
</I>&gt;<i> generation together. Humans can see the consensus but not Vilfredo, who
</I>&gt;<i> thinks that --for example-- the 3 remaining proposals are all different when
</I>&gt;<i> in fact happens the opposite thing. To make Vilfredo close the question,
</I>&gt;<i> only one must left.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To tell that two (or more) proposals are equivalent: hold shift down and
</I>&gt;<i> select them, instead of a &quot;tic&quot; the letter &quot;a&quot; appears besides each one (or
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;b&quot; if you clicked twice...). Could this be useful?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Dear Matias,
I think you are absolutely correct that we need a way to tell Vilfredo what
is the relation between different proposals.

And I have been thinking a lot about what relations are there, and how to
tell it.

The problem is, what is people do not agree that two proposals are
equivalent (or generally related)?

In any case I think the minimum set of possible relations should be:
(a is equivalent to b)
(a implies b)

strictly speaking you just need implies, and if a implies b and b implies a,
then they are equivalent.

The relation implies is for situation like:
A) -let's go to Lisbon
B) -Let's go to Portugal

here A implies B.
because Lisbon is in Portugal.

generally once an implication have been certified (how?), this should have
an effect on the resulting answers.
But first it should have an implication on the way people vote.

If A imply B, and you have voted for A, but not for B,

(in the example above this would mean that you voted to go to Lisbon, but
not to Portugal)

 then you should receive an email asking you to chose between three mutually
exclusive possibilities:
1) either you claim that A does not imply B
or
2) you also support B
or
3) you stop supporting A.

And if you do not answer in x time we imply that your default answer is ...
(answer defined among the user options. Possible answer n. 2 or n. 3. It is
NOT possible to have answer 1 as default answer).

So if this system was in place the fact of having A implying B, would force
that if A is in the Pareto Front than also B should be there.
But because A is a more precise answer than B, and A is in the Pareto front
it means that everybody that votes for B also voted for A (or B would
dominate A), thus we can ignore B, and only keep A.

So if A implies B, and A is in the Pareto Front we can ignore B, and take it
away from the Pareto Front. After all it is logically implied in A.

If instead there are people that vote for B but not for A, then we also are
going to have only one solution in the Pareto Front, because everybody who
vote for A has voted for B, thus B dominates A, and B will be in the Pareto
front but not A.

So it seems that just by using the implication relation we can go a long
way, and we are assured to have always either A or B in the Pareto front but
not both.

Now we should mention the fact that the implication relation is transitive,
so if A implies B and B implies C, than A implies C. (A=&gt;B=&gt;C then A=&gt;C)
So if A=&gt;B=&gt;C then we will always have only one of the three in the Pareto
Front.

And finally there is the closed loop case: if A implies B, and B implies C,
and C implies A than A, B ad C are all equivalent!  (A=&gt;B=&gt;C=&gt;A then A&lt;=B&lt;=C
and A=B=C)
So any closed loop of implications means (implies :-) ) that all the element
in the loop are equivalent.

If we code the implication in Vilfredo, the algorithm should be able to
understand all those relations.

Instead we need to solve the problem:
how to tell Vilfredo that a proposal implies another.

I will claim that it is absolutely not possible to do it automatically.
The idea of having people at the voting time define the implications seems
good enough.
Also the author of a proposal should be able to define an implication when
he is writing it. Implications respect to the inherited proposal from last
round, and implications between the new proposal he is writing)
Maybe the person who asked the question could have an option to define those
relationships after the moveon, just before the voting time.
Also everybody else (only people logged in?) should be able to define those
relationships during the voting time.
When people have started to define relationships, Vilfredo should
immediately jump in.

If person John have started saying that A implies B, then Vilfredo should
ask Sarah (who went to vote next): does A imply B? does B imply A?

Until Vilfredo has at least 3 people agreeing on the implication, and at
least a majority of (a lot! maybe 2/3rds, 3/4rth) saying that the
implication is there.

When this happens Vilfredo should start using (-yes, even in the middle of
the voting time-) this knowledge to suggest to people what they should vote
(example: this should appear with javascript: you voted to go to Lisbon, so
you must agree also to go to Portugal?
Answers:
- yes I do
- no, I did not realise Lisbon was in Portugal/
- Vilfredo you are mistaken, Lisbon is not in Portugal).
And this is important because then the person will not need to receive an
email later, as explained later...

And of course at some point we could even consider having a specific karma
on implication (you get points by having people agree on an implication you
define, you lose points every time someone -after you- disagree on an
implication you define).

This karma could be the same or a different one that is currently being
suggested at the wall of text question.

This is it. If we were to code this system I think Vilfredo would REALLY
kick ass.

But as you can see it is not really basic, we might need some time to code
it all.

Thoughts?
