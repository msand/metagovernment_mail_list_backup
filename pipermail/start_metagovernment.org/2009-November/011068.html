&gt;<i> Pietro.  This is great!  Thanks for your message.  I am glad someone
</I>&gt;<i> else appreciates the mathematical end of it.  There is potential for
</I>&gt;<i> truly an elegant solution to these problems and I have been anxious to
</I>&gt;<i> get some real work done on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Marcos, the only thing that I need to know is how many dimension are the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; informations from the voting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it is a one dimension, I would need to code a dominant function such
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; endorse dominates ignore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignore dominates oppose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think you are coding too much.  There is no need to code
</I>&gt;<i> ignore--that happens automatically.  They are simply zero's which have
</I>&gt;<i> no weight in the function.  In contrast oppose and endorse represent
</I>&gt;<i> the unitary +1 and -1.  But you must see these integers as an abstract
</I>&gt;<i> unity, which can be split into two--much as I suggested for voting on
</I>&gt;<i> subsections within a proposal.  That is, once someone decides that the
</I>&gt;<i> (unitary) proposal isn't sufficient as a unit, it must be allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> be chopped up (&quot;drilled down&quot;) until it gets to the &quot;atomic&quot; minimum
</I>&gt;<i> which can then only be voted up or down 1.  Once that occurs, you
</I>&gt;<i> RE-NORMALIZE from that new &lt;1&gt; -- and now this becomes new integer
</I>&gt;<i> (numero) one.  Do you see what I mean?  It's pretty subtle and gets to
</I>&gt;<i> the very heart of the philosophy and essense of number and
</I>&gt;<i> mathematics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Mark, I am sorry to say but I think you have not understood the concept of
pareto front.
I do not have nothing to add to my previous messages. Sorry I do not have
time to repeat what I have already said multiple times.
Please read the paper I have written that explains how the system works.

</I>&gt;<i> And it's pretty fucking cool, if you will allow me to say...  :)
