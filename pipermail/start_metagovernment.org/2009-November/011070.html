Yes, it is self-selected. The point is not for us to figure out an  
answer to one issue, but to provide a mechanism for deliberation of  
every issue. When presented with the universe of issues, an individual  
will only be concerned with a few. It isn't practical to draft random  
groups of people to address every issue, but it is quite reasonable to  
invite everyone in the world to participate in every issue in the  
world, and let each person decide which issues they will engage.

In the status quo, there is enormous apathy precisely because people  
are fundamentally disenfranchised. People may need to be coached into  
deliberations when the subject is something huge such as reforming the  
American health care system. But our model is to start with very small  
communities, and get people used to the idea of being thoughtfully  
engaged in smaller issues.

Say for example, one issue is whether or not a particular township  
should build a community swimming pool. Most people in the world won't  
care at all about it. Many (probably a majority) of people in the  
neighborhood won't even care about it as long as it doesn't impose  
taxes on them (and it is my personal belief that all measures  
presented in collaborative governance systems must contain their own  
mechanism for funding, so that things like taxes become an integral  
part of the issue).

People who really want the swimming pool will participate. As will  
people who really do not want it in their neighborhood. And so will  
people who oppose the funding mechanism. Those groups of stakeholders  
are exactly the people who should be involved in that decision.

But now suppose that the people involved decide they should build the  
pool, and it should be placed in an area where an endangered species  
has its last refuge. Suddenly there is a new group of interested  
stakeholders, and those people can immediately join the debate and try  
to push the consensus toward a different location or toward not  
building the pool.

That's where the technology comes into play. The process is open,  
continuous, and global. It is continuously inviting stakeholders to  
join... and presumably it is also continuously losing people whose  
interest has waned.

As people get used to this form of decision-making, then it can  
gradually scale up to larger issues. Instead of the apathy we see now  
when people are presented with a handful of enormous, complex issues  
in which they have no real say, we instead move to a system where  
everyone is used to being engaged in all kinds of issues that affect  
their lives.
