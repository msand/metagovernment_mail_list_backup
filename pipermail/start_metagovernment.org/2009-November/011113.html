<PRE>Hi Ed,

thanks for the reply.

Great point..., but then it would not apply in this case.

I mean in this case the decision IS meaningful. Based on this decision we
will code Vilfredo one way or another. And this will then have an effect on
all the people who want to use Vilfredo in future.
Even if just to take the code and fork it into another project.

When I asked the question on Vilfredo I was just going to code a simple way
where each user had a fixed length, but (as you might remember) it was just
me and you supporting that solution.
The community has, de facto, decided that they did not want any hard limit.
Right now I think it is very improbable that we solve the wall of text in
the hard limit way.
So already the discussion has had some effect. And the community that is
being affected is the community of all the people utilising Vilfredo. A
community that is forming, a community that is mostly composed by
metagovernment people, but not only.

But you are right that so far Vilfredo has had only &quot;consulting&quot; power.
I could override its decision, and would only risk becoming unpopular.
But then if I start to override the decisions too often someone can just
shortcut me,
fork the project and code what has been decided. Vilfredo community will
then probably migrate.

A different scenario than if someone just forked the project and then had to
start building the community from scratch.
So in effect the question is not &quot;just&quot; consultative.

Maybe the problem is that there are too many generations. We feel that since
there is potentially no end, we can just vote next time.

Personally I am considering adding some form of karma where you gain points
each generation you vote, but you lose points every time a generation passes
in a question where you have voted in the past, and now you are not voting
anymore. This is because the community has adapted, and considered your
desires as expressed in generation x. But now you moved away making it more
difficult for Vilfredo to converge.

Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. I finished preparing the movie of the talk I gave explaining Vilfredo.
The pareto front is explained very well. It's now being uploaded. It will
take some time, as the whole video is about 1GB
