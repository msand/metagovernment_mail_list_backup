They don't say yet, since they're still in the early stages. I imagine  
they won't publish costs until early next year. The format has changed  
from last year where it was a &quot;Showcase&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009</A> 
 &gt;, but IIRC, the last year cost something like $500+ to attend. And  
the &quot;Summit&quot; was around $1000.

I used to work for a company that held large conferences, and we paid  
different honoraria to different speakers, depending on how popular  
they were and how little we could get away with paying them. I wasn't  
directly involved in that process, but I think honoraria ranged from  
$200 to $20,000 (usually on the low end of that scale). But in every  
case, we always paid for all travel expenses of speakers.
