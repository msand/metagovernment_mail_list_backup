<PRE>I started a parallel discussion about walls of text on the National  
Council for Dialog and Deliberation (NCDD) list. In that thread,  
someone linked to the TruthMapping website.

They have a novel idea for making discussions both less intimidating  
and more coherent. Instead of organizing a conversation in a time- 
linear fashion, they have a simple two-tier discussion format:  
Critique and Rebuttal.

Someone writes a critique, and someone else writes a rebuttal. The  
first person then goes back and updates their critique to try to  
better answer the issues raised in the rebuttal; and the rebutter does  
the same. Back and forth as much as they want. BUT the reader never  
has to read more than two brief positions. (They also cut up arguments  
into distinct tidbits, somewhat reminiscent of DemocracyLab, to keep  
these dialectics short.)

It's a free system, so I thought it would be great to hack their code  
into some of the active projects... until I saw that they are trying  
to patent the whole method. I guess they don't buy into the open  
source idea. But nonetheless, I think we could learn from this concept.

They explain it very well in this brief video:

What do you think? Could a project such as Candiwi or Votorola use a  
format something like this?


P.S. The NCDD thread starts here:
