<PRE>Thanks, Ed, for documenting this important issue on the wiki.  I'd propose 
some edits along the following lines but am not inclined to create yet 
another UID and password.  (I have made a proposal relative to it on 
Vilfredo.)

1) While it is undoubtedly true that complex legislation or policy proposals 
may need to be very long, it does not necessarily follow that proposals must 
or should be long (or complex).  If a &quot;proposal&quot; is so long that most of 
those who will be voting on it (e.g., Members of Congress) choose not to 
read it, that it is a pretty good indication it is more complex than it 
should be.

2) In many cases, legislation becomes more complex than it should be because 
it has been loaded down with earmarks and policies that could not pass on 
their own merits.  Legislators continue to rely upon the time-tested 
technique of log-rolling on the political gravy train, in service to special 
interests and at great cost to the electorate as a whole.

3) Brevity is indeed the soul of wit.  In many cases, verbosity is a symptom 
of the fact the writer (or speaker) has not thought the issue through 
clearly enough to distill it down to its essence.

In short, it seems to me that one of the ways the Metagov community might 
add real value is by helping to ensure that &quot;proposals&quot; on which its 
stakeholders are expected to &quot;vote&quot; or otherwise provide feedback are 
relatively short (and focused on the achievement of objectives whose results 
can be measured within the relatively short period of time the attention of 
the stakeholders is likely to endure).

Sorry, my message got a bit longer than it should have.  (Unfortunately, as 
a tool, E-mail encourages such excess.)

Owen
