<PRE>&gt;<i> Also, wanted to thank Marcos and Ed for responding to Main Page edits
</I>&gt;<i> so promptly, and to thank StalkingTime for his contributions and for
</I>&gt;<i> the opportunity to discuss.
</I>&gt;<i> That said, this edit war is *ugly* (yikes), but it is also, in itself,
</I>&gt;<i> a good demonstration of 'why the project is needed' -- or at least why
</I>&gt;<i> some of the projects in metagov are needed. Wiki's (apparently) are
</I>&gt;<i> not very good at either synthesis or consensus.
</I>
Thanks for paying attention enough to comment.  At present there are
so very few mechanisms in place for feedback that receiving *any* is
an enormous contribution to [self-]correction.  Email and Talk:
discussion are currently the only venues and pretty inefficient at
that.  I would love to help develop a way for each wiki revision (i.e.
each edit by a single individual on a single session) to be to be
given a simple, quick thumbs-up or thumbs-down so that those who
wander by can express approval or disapproval.  And if the granularity
for any given revision is too coarse, for any user to be able to split
that revision into subsections which can then be given opportunities
for separate votings.  This would be the drilling down mechanism for
resolving disputes or differences.  In contrast there would be a way
to synthesize and unite previous disparate and redundant sections into
singular pages/sections and some way to add-up the votes that were
previously spread out.  On any *living* system, feedback is
*essential*.  Without it, it will inevitably stagnate.

&gt;<i> :: &#160;What are *your* motivations for participating in metagovernment?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is, there will be several different responses among the
</I>&gt;<i> members of the list, since this has been discussed recently.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, that a large part of the controversy over StalkingTime's edits
</I>&gt;<i> lies in this diversity of responses.
</I>
Very astute.  My reason is alluded to above and incompletely implied
in my Main Page discussion comments as well as the &quot;Why is this
project needed&quot; page.  Namely, a system that finally nails the issue
that has faced society for millenia: an organized way to have Public
Forum (Fora) and participation without devolving into chaos and
without succumbing to various [[obstacles]] of the past.  From this
will spring forms of community that society has yet to hardly dream
about.  My insistence on having some link to the aforementioned page
is that it seems that few people really &quot;get&quot; just how revolutionary
and radical this opportunity is.  Though Socrates had hotly argued
against it in Greece, rhetoric and emotional appeal has its place.

&gt;<i> Also, I would add a second part to the question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> :: What is the most efficient way to have this conversation? by Email?
</I>&gt;<i> in Vilfredo? Votorola? Candiwi? using StratML?
</I>
The most efficient way has not been invented yet, I'd say.  I would
*love* to put effort into perfecting the wiki software engine to allow
it.  Until then, MediaWiki's multi-level feature (&quot;:&quot;) allows
recording of the points in semi-organized fashion in proximity to the
point of conflict while the nature of the wiki itself (like the web)
allow topics to be arranged in a context-related fashion--NOTE: both
are fucking critical points for maximizing interest and participation
which is one of the reasons I've been rather adamant on using it over
straight email.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wouldn't like to not estimate StalkingTime's contribution; but I disagree

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The way to 'a better society' is implicit in our democratisation of the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governments, we just don't like that.&quot;
</I>
But democratization alone is nothing new.  What is radically new and
insufficiently propagated into the awareness of the masses is just how
powerful these new tools could be and the new possibilities that they
offer.  For example, democratization isn't something that really
facilitates the notion of Synthesis, but it is something that the wiki
software itself could support.
