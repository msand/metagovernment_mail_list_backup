<PRE>I share Pietro's belief in the power of bottom-up efforts, which is why I hope individuals, families, and small communities will take advantage of the potential of AIIM's emerging StratML standard to engage others in cooperative effort (partnerships) in pursuit of goals and objectives they hold in common.

However, I also strongly believe that large institutions -- particularly those funded by the force of law (taxes) -- have a special obligation to enable their stakeholder to more easily discover and provide feedback on their goals and objectives, as well as to track performance (metrics for &quot;success&quot;) against those objectives.

Needless to say, the more &quot;objective&quot; the measures of success may be, the better.  However, with respect to social objectives, more subjective metrics (e.g., satisfaction ratings) may be relevant as well.

  Well,
  dear Owen, dear Michael,
  the reason why I never joined in in Owen efforts, is because 

  a) I don't believe in top down efforts in those domains (it is a pragmatic position, not a political one. I think they don't work).
  b) I think semantic web is essentially a subjective view point based on the subjective perception of the wrld of the people defining the onthology
  c) I think the only solution is an intersubjective solution that is based of getting the results from many many people.

  What do I mean? Look at any popular page, as it is represented in delicious. What tags do those people use.

  You want a list of related projects? Just go to:
  <A HREF="http://delicious.com/popular/edemocracy">http://delicious.com/popular/edemocracy</A>
  And this is being really fast and dirty. By analysing the whole set of tags that people use you could do much better.
  This weighted list of tags (also known as a tag cloud) will represent the best description of the project. And this description is devoided of any structural content, it is cultural dependent, time dependent (the tag cloud of today is different from the tag cloud of last year). But this very information is enough to make you aware, given a page (which can point to a project) of what are the similar projects that are around.
  Yes it can be done better. No, it cannot be imposed, nor can it be done in a top down way. Not unless you want to coerce people into following you, and are willing to lose a huge amount of data.


  This is why I have never responded to any StraML or CollabML message.

  Regards,
  Pietro

    &gt; I have already documented the missions, visions, values, goals,
    &gt; objectives, and stakeholders of several of the Metagov projects in
    &gt; StratML format, at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A>

    The OpenKollab crew was also thinking along these lines.  They figured
    that self-expressive info was needed for inter-project collaboration.
    But there's another point of view (almost opposite), that depends on a
    different kind of info:

     a) Visibility of projects.  Show which ones actually exist.  Show
        all of them, together.

     b) Facts about projects.  Show not just the self-expressed hopes,
        aims and interests of the projects, but verifiable facts.

     c) Actual collaborations.  The past can be a guide to the future, so
        show past and current collaborations.

    So in contrast to a *subjective* StratML, we may need an *objective*
    CollabML.  Here's one take on it, in the form of a semantic wiki:

     <A HREF="http://openkollab.referata.com/wiki/E-democracy">http://openkollab.referata.com/wiki/E-democracy</A>

    Please fill in a fact or two (anybody who's interested), or add a
    project.  It's just an experiment, but it might lead to something.
