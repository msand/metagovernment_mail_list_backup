You may wish to check out DemocracyLab, which allows people to define  
Issues, Values, Objectives, and Policies, separately and then in  
combination. Here is their running instance, where you can see that  
breakdown in the tabs at top:

This is similar what I envision for the most part, and why I advocate  
starting governance systems in very small communities and then scaling  
upward. If, for example, a new nonprofit organization is in the  
process of starting up, they could choose to use one of the Active  
Projects as their sole governance mechanism. If they are successful,  
then members of that group might start using the same system to  
replace individual committees in other organizations they work with.  
 From there, maybe eventually someone will think to use it to run a  
small branch of their township government. And upward/outward from  
there.

So I see it not exactly as a shadow as much as a creeping replacement,  
bit-by-bit and only as it proves itself worthy in smaller cases.
