</I>&gt;&gt;<i> intended to facilitate the coalition-building and consensus-finding aspect 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the application (Which is a lesson learned from Thomas Edison's work on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> electric voting tools, but that's another story).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking at the standings for &quot;Health Reform Video Challenge from
</I>&gt;<i> BarackObama.com&quot;.  I see 3 &quot;runs&quot;: <A HREF="http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/">http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now I think I understand.  These are just the unravelling of a single
</I>&gt;<i> snapshot of the current vote dispositions.  There is no time series
</I>&gt;<i> here.  We cannot see a chronological progression toward consensus.  We
</I>&gt;<i> can only see the consensus that IRV squeezes (instantly) from the
</I>&gt;<i> latest snapshot of the current votes.  At the moment, it is telling
</I>&gt;<i> the voters that they have reached a consensus on &quot;Human Instinct&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> (In fact, that's the first choice of only half the voters, so this is
</I>&gt;<i> somehat of an artificial consensus.  However, if they don't like it,
</I>&gt;<i> they can adjust their votes and try to get something else out of it.)
</I>-- That's generally how it works. It gets a lot more interesting when 
lots of people vote. Did you notice that you can click links on the 
ballot to play the video for each candidate?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Craig, the back button doesn't work well across the tabs.  It takes
</I>&gt;<i>  some getting used to.  Also we can't ref those tabs by URL, even
</I>&gt;<i>  though they are full of interesting info.)
</I>-- Just click the tab you want. No reloading necessary. At some point 
down the line I'll look for a way to link to distinct tabs. Should be 
do-able.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ... Although there's an instrumental, machine-like aspect to it,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's properly social because there's people involved; and although
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there's people involved, they are not communicating in a properly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> social manner.  Here's one place where it's less than ideal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- How could it be made more &quot;properly social&quot; in your view? I'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure what you mean by that term...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's &quot;properly social&quot; if the results are what people have discussed
</I>&gt;<i> and agreed to.
</I>-- Is not voting a form of voice? How else would you assess consensus?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... But I'll grant that the &quot;Discussion&quot; Tab, if better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nothing, is weak. A future version, if I get a chance to build it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would solicit tweet-length comments on ranks given. The challenge
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would then move to finding an elegant and useful way to display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I couldn't find the &quot;discussion tab&quot;.)
</I>-- Sorry, I should have written &quot;Opinions.&quot; That Tab surfaces Facebook's 
FBML-based Discussions and Comments features.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the technical challenge is to give meaning to the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> by somehow tying it to the possiblity of a concrete result.  So
</I>&gt;<i> imagine I find the discussion tab and it takes me to a group of 5
</I>&gt;<i> voters, all engaged in a heated debate.  I join them and I ask, &quot;What
</I>&gt;<i> exactly are you guys talking about?&quot;  They point me to the object of
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion (a), and they carry on discussing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Two days later, their efforts come to a successful conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone stands back, and there it is: the concrete result of the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion (b).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are (a) and (b)?
</I>-- Well, I am starting with (a)... the array of formally nominated 
candidates who will be subjects of a ranked-choice vote. Actually, 
there's a precursor to (a)... the election itself... the concrete 
motivation of the collaborative process. That is, Who should be the 
winner of (x)? Or, what is our consensus on the best way to say (y)? Or, 
what should our collectively-stated policy be regarding issue (z)?  The 
concrete result (b) would correspond to the tabulated results at the 
moment voting closes.

Also, in addition to a general discussion (Opinions) area for each 
election, my goal is to enable focused discussions directly off each 
nomination data point, so that there would be no need to ask what the 
discussion is about.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  (Another: the UI is nicely polished, but the monetization mars it.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -- Continued lack of funding threatens to mar things even more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's an apparent dilemma.  But I doubt there really *are* any
</I>&gt;<i> commercial opportunities in the core facilities of e-democracy.  I
</I>&gt;<i> doubt anyone could hold ownership of them, and place rents on them.
</I>&gt;<i> And ads are just a form of rent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, if we could open up the architecture of e-dem, then
</I>&gt;<i> entrepreneurs wouldn't have to bunch up in the core of it, competing
</I>&gt;<i> unproductively for nothing.  They could instead navigate out to where
</I>&gt;<i> the real opportunities are.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the separate thread &quot;Difference engine&quot; offers a good approach
</I>&gt;<i> to solving both the problem of commercial development, and the
</I>&gt;<i> integration of discussion media (a and b).  Please critique there, if
</I>&gt;<i> you see any faults in what is proposed.
</I>-- I'll have a look. Thanks.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>
