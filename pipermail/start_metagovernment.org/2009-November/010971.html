<PRE>Sorry, I have not participated much on the candiwi front recently.

I was quite busy with the talk. I gave the talk today, we had quite some
fun. The room (small) was full. ABout 20-25 people. We also asked two
questions.

We defined a personal room, for them to speak about them.

I hope some of those people will remain with us. Unfortunately the video did
not work. So I do not have a recording of my talk I have the last part, but
that would just not make sense by itself). But the talk is ready, so I now
plan to give the talk again in Coibra, to my collegues, when I get back. And
then I will record it again. (or not again, just record it for the first
time).

Regarding the candiwi, what is the relation between the wiki and candiwi.
Because when we started the wiki the idea was to use the wiki until we had
our own system. But now metagovernment has become this meta system, with
various projects. If we just move to metawi would this not identify
metagovernment again with a single project? ARe there ways in which we can
both test, and use candiwi, but still keep some sort of neutrality. Maybe
assigning different tools from different projects for different tasks.

Your thoughts would be appreciated.
Pietro

&gt;<i> Ed, I could install the OpenID plugin for MediaWiki (and there is one for
</I>&gt;<i> Mailman), but I shall have FTP/SSH access to the server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also may install the WYSIWYG editor plugin. And play around with CSS to
</I>&gt;<i> refresh to look of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And a backup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, &#191;are we moving the content to candiwi soon? If yes, that plugin work
</I>&gt;<i> on MediaWiki doesn't have many sense.
