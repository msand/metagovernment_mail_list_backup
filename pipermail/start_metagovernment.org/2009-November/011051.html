<PRE>It seems to me that there are at least three distinct concepts at issue
here: 

	1) governance -- implying *coercion* (of someone, even if it is
&quot;collaborative&quot; among others)
	2) collaboration -- implying voluntary cooperation (among those who
share common objectives)
	3) polling -- measurement of opinions/attitudes but not necessarily
implying either governance or collaboration, directly or indirectly

Having spent my entire 34-year career in &quot;governance,&quot; now that I am free to
spend my time as I wish, I am far more interested in collaboration, which is
why I am spending a lot of time working to foster the specification and use
of Strategy Markup Language (StratML) as an international voluntary
consensus standard. <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm</A>

Yes, exactly.

I have not yet heard informed criticism of deliberative democracy.

Well, how are you going to do public consultation? Are you planning to 
convene random samples of citizens?

Also, you ought to know that Prof Fishkin at Stanford works on 
deliberative polls which use sample sizes large enough to statistically 
verify that the random sampling is representative of the larger 
population.
