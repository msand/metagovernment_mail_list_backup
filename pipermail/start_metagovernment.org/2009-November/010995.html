So, does this mean you are or are not interested in proposing a group  
presentation? I guess you may be right that my aim in proposing it is  
political: but a project which doesn't even try to interact with the  
outside world is somewhat scary. At some point we need to invite the  
rest of the world to play on our toys. I think Jim has a great point  
that building a usability-oriented system is a great way to bring  
people in... but at some point advertising (of whatever kind) is also  
necessary to enter the general public consciousness.

P.S. I have to admit I'm a bit bemused at being called a politician. I  
guess I get it; but that is exactly the group of people I want to make  
obsolete. (Or I guess you could put another way: I'd like to see  
everyone be able to be a politician any time they want.)
