<PRE>I think what some of us are after, is an
&quot;internet enabled, collaborative democracy&quot;
and you can substitute enabled by enhanced,
and democracy with government.

Maybe it could be shortened to:
collaborative e-democracy
or
collaborative e-government.
And the word collaborative is meaningful because we need to stress
that we are not just after a democracy, like we already have. Just
done through the internet. But we are after something new.

And then we could express that we do not want representatives, thus we
are looking for:
non representative, collaborative, e-government
or
non representative, internet enabled, collaborative democracy.

Which is quite a mouth full. But just explaining what you mean will
probably take up all your time.

On a different note:

Sorry to be so silent,
I am currently off grid, and only have internet for about half an hour
a day, and it is very slow. I hope I will be able to catch up with you
later.

Some people have asked that Vilfredo was made so that if you go to an
URL, and you were not logged in, then the system would remember the
url, while you were logging in (or registering). I just would like to
say that I think Derek has introduced this feature. Thank you for
suggesting it.

</I>&gt;<i> While our efforts can fit under the umbrella of the term &quot;e-

</I>&gt;<i> so many other things as well. A politician sending e-mails to get

</I>&gt;<i> little to do with our aims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any event, I don't see any conflict in a group presentation to the
</I>&gt;<i> Gov 2.0 Expo. It just seems like a way to get our idea out to a much
</I>&gt;<i> broader audience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I went to a series of conferences in Washington earlier this
</I>&gt;<i> year, I saw a lot of people starting to understand a glimmer of the
</I>&gt;<i> promise of collaborative governance, but most of them didn't have any
</I>&gt;<i> belief that it could actually be made a reality. If people see a group
</I>&gt;<i> of people presenting at a major conference all working on different
</I>&gt;<i> systems toward that generally common end, I think they might begin to
</I>&gt;<i> see that this is a real possibility.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But this is only a stance.  It's more a way of dealing with reality
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than a completely true statement of it.  It also makes it hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communicate with others who don't share the same stance.  Nothing I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say makes much sense to them.  (Some people are more open minded
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though, and can see both sides. ;^)
