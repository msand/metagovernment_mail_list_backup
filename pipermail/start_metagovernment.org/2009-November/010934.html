<PRE>Right now I am travelling.
In the next days I shall answer more thoroughly.

The pareto front can be done with any type of ranking.

But the more ranking you put, the more there is the risk that people rank
thing wrongly and then it does not collapse so easily to the solution.

Right now when you ignore something, that is in effect saying that you will
not accept that.
Each person has veto power, by ignoring a solution (and voting on at least
one of the other).
Look at the discussion on the banks between me and Manuel.
I don't endorse his solution, he does not endorse mine and we are in a
deadlock because each has vetoed the other, There already IS veto.

We can change the current &quot;endorse what you like&quot; system with one that let
you rank all the solutions, or give them the possibility to rank things with
more possibilities:
* Veto
** ignore
*** accept
**** endorse

We can substitute this with n possibilities. As long as you can order on a 1
dimensional line the possibilities like
veto&lt;ignore&lt;accept&lt;endorse

nothing has really changed; at the end it all tast like chicken at the
pareto front level.

That is because the pareto front is determined by the domination function,
and the domination function will be
ignore dominates veto
accept dominate ignore
endorse dominate accept
ad you are essentially working on a similar system.


So why not putting 4 ranks, or 5?
Well, why not just jumping the whole problem, and ask people to order the
solutions?

If you have n solutions and you order them you are essentially giving them a
unique rank between 1 and n.

The problem that you are then getting is that:
voting becomes more complicated
each voting decision takes more time
there are more possibilities of people voting in the wrong way.

What does it mean to vote in the wrong way? it means to vote in a way that
does not reflect your deep values.
So that if you were to look back atyour vote with more time, you would vote
differently.

Also there is the risk of having vote that are irrelevant. If you have too
many ranks it might not really matter from the point of view of the person
if you have ranked something at 2 out of 20 or 3 out of 20. It is always
down there. But for the system it makes a huge difference. DO you remember
how we noticed that questions were people voted at random would not
collapse, while system where the question was meaningful tend to reach a
solution? I now did the math, and I can explain that.

I am writing a paper with a collegue on this. Essentially because the Pareto
Front was picking up on the values of the people, and thus reporting some
objective relation between the answers. The fact that we all (human beings)
share similar values means that the pareto front does not explode. Please
forgive me if I don't explain better.

The more voting possibilities there are the more the risks that you vote
randomly at some rises, and the more the pareto front is meaningless (it
will contain extra elements that should not be there).

So although the system could work with full ranking, the probability of
people making errors just grow and grow, and with that the paret front
becomes a random subset of answers. Or just all the answers.

Ed, I hear you. I am eager to speak about this more too. Later.


Ok, 20 mintes the cab is coming.

See you,
Pietro

&gt;<i> And checkboxes for a negative pareto front too, for proposals that you
</I>&gt;<i> aren't going to accept. That gives more information at the time to submit
</I>&gt;<i> new ideas. Also you could subtract both sets, the positive and the negative;
</I>&gt;<i> then present that as the result of the voting. (Just thinking out loud.)
