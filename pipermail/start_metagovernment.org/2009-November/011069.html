Wouldn't that be a self-selected sample?

How are you going to claim anything special about what these groups 
produce if they are self-selected?

I don't see why it makes a difference how you manage the deliberations. 

If the sample is self-selected then your sample is not representative of 
the target population, and it will be hard to claim that any results are 
the conclusions that most people would arrive at if they had a chance to 
think about it carefully.
