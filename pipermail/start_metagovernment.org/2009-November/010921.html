I never thought of it like that, but when you put it that way... that  
is incredibly cool. The very nature of Pareto front completely side- 
steps the variety of authentication problems that other projects are  
still grappling with.

And it makes me want to revisit the conversation you and I had off- 
list about Vilfredo's weakness in asking people to vote for everything  
they agree with; which can result in things they strongly agree with  
getting dropped out of the Pareto front. Perhaps people could be  
offered two levels of votes (ie, two checkboxes): one for everything  
they agree with, and another for ones they think are really excellent?  
Could something like this be done while still maintaining the lack of  
need for authentication?

(Or perhaps this conversation should be saved for the Vilfredo  
presentation, if we agree to do project presentations.) :)
