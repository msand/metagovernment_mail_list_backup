That's interesting.

Fishkin (2009) described some deliberative polls he assisted with in 
China. As you know, the Chinese government is communist (single party), 
but that didn't stop the Chinese from employing a deliberative poll to 
determine what the public would want if they had a chance to think about 
it. The elite communist officials used the results of the deliberative 
poll to set public policy. (They felt this way of making a decision was 
in harmony with Taoist philosophy. :-)
