<PRE>(Pretend we're using truthmapping.  The statement is below, followed
 by critique and rebuttal.  We can only improve the critique/rebuttal,
 we can't go off on tangents.  In each new post, the previous text is
 quoted, and new text is unquoted or in brackets.  It's OK for others
 to help Manuel and Fabian.)

Candiwi is useful.

Michael Allan critiqued:
&gt;<i> It is already the case that[, as Fabian says,] &quot;content can be
</I>&gt;<i> distributed freely on the web&quot;. &#160;Why store any of it in Candiwi?
</I>
  Candiwi provides no indication of consensus on any of the main
  articles of content, regardless of where they are stored (in Candiwi
  or elsewhere).  They appear to be nothing but (as Manuel says) &quot;the
  product of a narrow group that is willing to invest the effort&quot;.

&gt;<i> What facility does Candiwi offer that isn't available elsewhere?
</I>&gt;<i> (Again, it helps to be precise about this, and to mention it on your
</I>&gt;<i> home page.)
</I>
Manuel Barkhau rebutted:
&gt;<i> I guess it all depends on your use case. Different tools for different
</I>&gt;<i> jobs. A wiki has the advantage, of being easier to use, since there
</I>&gt;<i> is no process to go through. You just edit and save.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it doesn't make sense to add that overhead, then of course a wiki
</I>&gt;<i> may be more appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to deliberate on the content and establish that there is
</I>&gt;<i> actually some form of consensus about the content of the repository,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than it being the product of a narrow group that is willing to
</I>&gt;<i> invest the effort. Not that there's anything wrong about that, but you
</I>&gt;<i> can't tell from that, if there is any kind of consensus.
