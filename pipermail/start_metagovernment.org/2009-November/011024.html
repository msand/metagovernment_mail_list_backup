Ed, I cannot find the cost. Where is it? How much?

The usual way for conferences (of any size) is that they pay for the invited
speakers. Which is what the term invited essentially mean. You then have the
honor to speak to everybody in a joint session. In most conferences many
sessions are divided into separate rooms for different topics.

For poor people/some students the best we can get it a huge discount on the
cost of the conference. Anything more than that seems an ungrounded hope
unless they specify for it.
They do speak about sponsorhip, but looking at their pdf, they mean people
who wish to sponsor the conference, not the other way around.
