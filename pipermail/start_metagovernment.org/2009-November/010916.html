<PRE>Michael,
I have to say I really support Jim in this.

I have seen gazillions of projects die for lack of participants.
In fact that is by and large the only way projects die.
If a project has participants, but something else goes wrong (the programmer
does not want to keep it anymore), he can always sell it.

Instead the ones that I have seem successful, by and large, all started as
very small, very useful tool, that were used immediately while still in
pre-alpha by people.

Yahoo was a directory of useful links.
Google a search engine with a new search algorithm,
livejournal a way to let the first programmer let his parents and friends
know what he was doing while he was away in college,
delicious a way to store bookmarks for few people.

The idea were good, were easy to use, and people used them.
As people used them THEY started to asking for new feature.
And you kept on having this continuous dialogue between the programmers and
the users.

Look even at this list. It started with few people and a web announcement.

The fact is that most of those projects are only alive and make sense if
there are enough people.
This is why it is so difficult to produce a better version of something.
Even if you program it, you still will not have the community.
Also, I participate in a number of online communities. In one of those the
administrator actually stole the community from its members.
We decided to leave the community, and were going to set up our oun
discussion group. This guy who was at the time just arrived, set it up, and
presented it, done packed, and ready. Like a swarm of bees we all joined,
and when we realised that he has kept all the administrative decisions for
himself it was too late. Every time we tried to fork and create a new
community the new community would just not have enough support to remain
alive, and eventually we would go back.

The community IS the real key thing. Once you have that you can write the
code around it.

You start with the code, you will end up sitting alone in your cristal
palace.


Cheers,
Pietro
P.S. &quot;gazillions&quot;.... what a cool word!
