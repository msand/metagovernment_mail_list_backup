I'm looking at the standings for &quot;Health Reform Video Challenge from
BarackObama.com&quot;.  I see 3 &quot;runs&quot;: <A HREF="http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/">http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/</A>

Now I think I understand.  These are just the unravelling of a single
snapshot of the current vote dispositions.  There is no time series
here.  We cannot see a chronological progression toward consensus.  We
can only see the consensus that IRV squeezes (instantly) from the
latest snapshot of the current votes.  At the moment, it is telling
the voters that they have reached a consensus on &quot;Human Instinct&quot;.
(In fact, that's the first choice of only half the voters, so this is
somehat of an artificial consensus.  However, if they don't like it,
they can adjust their votes and try to get something else out of it.)

(Craig, the back button doesn't work well across the tabs.  It takes
 some getting used to.  Also we can't ref those tabs by URL, even
 though they are full of interesting info.)

&gt;&gt;<i> ... Although there's an instrumental, machine-like aspect to it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's properly social because there's people involved; and although
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's people involved, they are not communicating in a properly

</I>
It's &quot;properly social&quot; if the results are what people have discussed
and agreed to.

&gt;<i> ... But I'll grant that the &quot;Discussion&quot; Tab, if better than
</I>&gt;<i> nothing, is weak. A future version, if I get a chance to build it,
</I>&gt;<i> would solicit tweet-length comments on ranks given. The challenge
</I>&gt;<i> would then move to finding an elegant and useful way to display
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>
(I couldn't find the &quot;discussion tab&quot;.)

I think the technical challenge is to give meaning to the discussion
by somehow tying it to the possiblity of a concrete result.  So
imagine I find the discussion tab and it takes me to a group of 5
voters, all engaged in a heated debate.  I join them and I ask, &quot;What
exactly are you guys talking about?&quot;  They point me to the object of
the discussion (a), and they carry on discussing it.

Two days later, their efforts come to a successful conclusion.
Everyone stands back, and there it is: the concrete result of the
discussion (b).

What are (a) and (b)?

&gt;&gt;<i>  (Another: the UI is nicely polished, but the monetization mars it.)
</I>&gt;<i> -- Continued lack of funding threatens to mar things even more.
</I>
It's an apparent dilemma.  But I doubt there really *are* any
commercial opportunities in the core facilities of e-democracy.  I
doubt anyone could hold ownership of them, and place rents on them.
And ads are just a form of rent.

On the other hand, if we could open up the architecture of e-dem, then
entrepreneurs wouldn't have to bunch up in the core of it, competing
unproductively for nothing.  They could instead navigate out to where
the real opportunities are.

I think the separate thread &quot;Difference engine&quot; offers a good approach
to solving both the problem of commercial development, and the
integration of discussion media (a and b).  Please critique there, if
you see any faults in what is proposed.

Best regards,
