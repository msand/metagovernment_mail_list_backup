<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for the links and comments.

[a] I assume constitutional change, but I can't see how that could be a
popular constitutional change.  Obviously constitutional systems vary but
I'm not aware of any that has provisions for a participative system, or any
other popular input, to propose constitutional change, although I think that
popular ratification by referendum is sometimes required.

Therefore, current elected representatives would have to relinquish power to
a participative system, presumably with some degree of popular pressure to
overcome resistance by those elected representatives for their loss of
power/income.  A natural source for such pressure would be some kind of
'shadow' e-governance system, which growing up alongside existing political
structures would presumably have increasing influence on policy outcomes.
However, knowledge within society of participative alternatives, being used
in other organisational settings, could potentially be sufficient.

I suppose there might be possibilities for those in an open participative
system to take power for themselves somehow, but I'm not sure how the
mechanics of that would work and it doesn't seem in any way an appealing way
forward.


[b] As far as I can make out we're talking about fairly different things
here.  I think you are talking about creating a utopia blueprint using
e-governance type tools?  I'm thinking of something much less ambitious:
just thinking through, collectively, fairly specific moral issues (such as:
when is murder 'okay' (self-defence, mental illness, diminished
responsibility etc)) in an open 'moral' setting before worrying about
framing these into a practical legal setting.  These moral positions could
then tie in to a larger whole, which would constantly be evolving.  It would
also hopefully be possible to leave room for different groups
(geographical/religious etc etc) to take different approaches).  The idea
would be to provide solid moral roots/discussion for the 'higher-level' law
subsequently produced, and for moral and legal developments to move hand in
hand.  I think that from this perspective perhaps many of the deeper
philosophical considerations covered in the material in your link don't
arise, or if they do then are solved during the process I describe rather
than through philosophy.  I hold up my hand, though, and confess to almost
no philosophical background, so let me know if I have missed the point of
your material.

In terms of the nuts and bolts of how moral standpoints would evolve - I see
that happening using a more basic format than that for e-governance (legal
etc) principles.  Interested individuals/organisations would explore and
develop moral issues that one or more of their number had proposed and map
levels of support for different ideas.


[c] Again, apologies if I haven't got the full extent of what you are saying
here.  If I have, then I think that there are additional elements in what I
am saying.  These are: 1) a two stage process of voting; and (more
importantly) 2) delegation of voting power to someone else for a certain
policy area until further notice, for all votes within that area.

1) Two (or more) stage process of voting: The first stage would involve
proposals being worked up (using wiki/voting etc etc) by specialised
interested parties.  Their output then would be voted for ideally by the
whole electorate, directly or indirectly.  (If there were more stages of
voting, then proposals would be successively scrutinised by wider and wider
sub-communities of the overall electorate before final passing.)

2) Delegation of voting power has, therefore, to be structured to give the
idea of 'whole electorate voting' any sense of achievability.  Your cascade
ideas represent (and go far beyond) what I was envisaging in terms of
individual votes.  However, I was thinking of enabling people to assign
policy areas (of whatever size and nature they wanted (within the
capabilities of the system)) to someone else, until further notice, for all
votes within that area.  Without such a capability, each person would need
to participate in far too many votes, most of which they would have no
interest in and know nothing about.  That's the basic outline.  There's a
little more detail (such as an initial default to one's MP) in my original
Vilfredo post.
