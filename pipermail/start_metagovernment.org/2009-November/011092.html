<PRE>I don't think it's always true that someone doesn't care if they don't participate. 

Particularly in today's various systems, many people care - or would care - they just don't know anything about the issue, and don't know what to do for their caring to be effective (rather than devisive)

There are others who really do not care, even when informed and given the opportunity to have an effect. These, I would argue, are few and only for very particular issues.

There is a theory among the group that this is due to 'apathy', and that if you improve the system such that it (A) informs people to make a decision, and (B) empowers them so their decision is meaningful and useful, the only people who wouldn't participate are those who truly don't care.

But, reading Joshua's emails, it's obvious to me how idealistic this is. People who don't participate aren't necessarily people who don't care -- assuming this is just our way of honoring convenience -- they aren't even lazy. They are busy doing other things. Or they are preoccupied. And, when asked, they may care. If one doesn't ask one doesn't know.

My concern with polling the uninformed and/ the nonparticipants has been that the opinions of those not following an issue are typically open to the highest bidder -- at least in american politics where there is such an influence of ads and media in life. Death panels, government takeover, palin is a witch, etc etc. 

And most in market research know you can get whatever answer you want depending on how you prep the respondent and how you phrase the question.

I will look into details, to see how these issues are addressed. But ... as a group, I agree we need to address this issue of non-participants for any definition of 'consensus' to have teeth.

I'm not sure how I feel about this. I would avoid the term majority  
and say Democracy is the will of the people. But isn't it the will at  
this time? Not the will of the people after they have been coached and  
prodded.

If people don't care, they don't care. Their will is empty in that  
regard. Why should they have a substantive input into something they  
don't care about?

If other people think that more people should care about something...  
then use the other mechanisms of society to make your point. That is  
the whole idea behind issue advocacy groups (other than lobbying). Buy  
some TV time, or stage a protest or whatever.

&gt;<i> Those two are really different. And we should never forget it. This

But that's because people have no say in government. If people could  
actively participate in governance at any moment, they wouldn't have  
any right to complain about things they don't like. Instead, they  
could just jump in and fix it.

I also think that well-developed collaborative governance software  
will bring people into the deliberation process, instead of simply  
being a sounding board for whatever is on the top of their minds. And  
that is largely a function of clever website design. For example, look  
at how WhiteHouse 2 presents issues. I think it's a very good start  
for delving deeper.
