<PRE>I think Joshua is making some very interesting points that we should not
dismiss too rapidly.

FIrst of all, Joshua, please let me explain that our idea is that we should
start with small groups, where most people are participating. ANd then scale
up. The hope is that as the system gets refined more and more the percentage
of people participating does not drop too rapidly. As such we are dreaming
about a system where the population IS involved. A bit like in an ancient
village the population (unfortunately only male) would all join in the
center to discuss together.

Not everybody will participate in every decision, but it should be
considered part of the civic duties to participate in some decisions...

On the other hand, Matias, I think Joshua is making a very good point about
the self sampling of the population. In a democracy we are &quot;supposedly&quot;
going with the &quot;will of the majority&quot;. Not with the &quot;will of the majority
among those that care&quot;. Those two are really different. And we should never
forget it. This is why very often you find people going on the street asking
for change, and then when a referendum is done or some sort of big polling,
the people at large do not agree with that.

So what do we want?

I think the point of deliberative democracy is really good:
take people who do not care,
inform them
let them comment/make-the-decision

I wish there was a way to be able to get automatically, through the
internet, a sample of the population.
Sampled to reflect age, sex, education, wealth, work, and number of sexual
partners! ;-)
