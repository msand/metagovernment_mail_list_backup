  I know, sorry.  You missed my follow up.  It's the trailing periods
  in the URLs.  Below is Thomas's post, with the URLs corrected.

  I'll reply to the rest of your message soon. - M

Hello everybody,

Votorola is beginning with alpha-testing and we would like to invite you 
to play around with it. ;-)

Votorola is a combination of a poll-server (the vote-engine etc.) and a 
poll-wiki (the drafting medium).
I started a poll named &quot;Open Governance 2010&quot; which we could use, to 
plan the proposed conference.
I voted for Ed because I like the conference plan that he posted in the 
Metagov-wiki. But I thought it needed a few changes. So I posted this 
revised plan:

<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Open_Governance_2010">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Open_Governance_2010</A>

What do you think? If you agree, please vote for it here (Together we'll
convince Ed ;-) ) :

<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?p=MetaGov&amp;u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe">http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?p=MetaGov&amp;u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe</A>

Or you can vote directly for Ed. And maybe post a plan of your own,
like I did.

By clicking on a candidate in the poll-browser all his voters get shown. 
The link right in front of the candidates/voters name links to his 
position draft in the wiki.

If help is needed for the login or something else, there is a help page: 
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/Help:Contents">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/Help:Contents</A>

Have fun!

Best wishes,
Thomas

PS: To play around with the poll-browser the &quot;Mayor of Toronto&quot;-poll 
might be a better example, because there are more votes: 
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe&amp;p=m">http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?u=ThomasvonderElbe+GmxDe&amp;p=m</A>
