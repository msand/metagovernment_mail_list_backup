Which is precisely why I built the first component of the Indaba system 
as a tool that can support video contests, Oscar and EMMY awards, 
American Idol voting, and so on... anything with multi-candidate 
options. It seemed like a good strategy for getting attention so that I 
could find help in taking things to the next level. It hasn't worked 
yet, but there's always hope.

I presume the system I'm developing could potentially prove useful to 
the stratXML users who are concerned with settling on definitions of 
vision, mission, and values -- and even choosing a name -- since there 
are often multiple candidates floated in a vision/mission-defining 
process. But it's not clear to me that there's enough of a user base yet 
in that community that can prompt a big enough buzz that could in turn 
lead to support and funding. Am I wrong about that?
