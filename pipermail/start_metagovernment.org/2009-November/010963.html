<PRE>Tom, I've spawned this as a subthread.  It's still on a theme of
efficiency and morality, but I have a specific proposal.

Also, for the list: People will remember our earlier discussions about
inter-project cooperation (initiated by Thomas, this summer).  There
was much talk then of an open architecture (from me and others), but
nothing came of it.  It was just talk.  I hope this proposal can make
up for that.  I think it's something we can move on.  But it's still
just a sketch, and I'm interested in hearing alternatives.  (Note,
this is *not* part of Votorola.)

  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/de">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/de</A>

Does this make sense, Tom?  Here's a rough outline of the argument:

  1. Democracy depends on rational discussion.

  2. All rational discussion in democracy is grounded in differences
     of position.  Therefore:

  3. All rational discussion in *e-democracy* depends on the technical
     facility of linking particular discussions to particular
     differences of position.  Call this facility a &quot;difference
     engine&quot;.

  4. The difference engine can only be implemented efficiently within
     an open and rationalized architecture, one that binds together
     the separate, but logically related, facilities of voting,
     drafting, and discussion.

  5. An open and rationalized architecture demands, up-front, a
     minimum level of cooperation and coordination among the projects
     that implement these facilities.  They must share technical
     standards, for example.

     5a. However, rationalization is something you can never just have
         a little of.  Once a technical system is opened up and broken
         into its logical pieces, it just keeps getting more and more
         open.  So it follows:

  6. Before a technical project makes any progress in facilitating
     e-democracy, it will be fully engaged in *maximizing* its
     cooperation and coordination with other projects, in general.

In summary, if a project takes one step in the direction of enabling
an open society, the project itself will become open to that society.
The first step of a technical *enabling* of openess is - perforce - a
self-opening of the technology.  Do you agree, it must be so?

And ethically?  Ought technical projects to do their own thing without
regard for each other - without attempting to cooperate and
coordinate?  Is there a moral argument, one way or the other?  And if
(1-6) holds *and* it's the right thing, is it merely an accident that
ethical conduct is built into the social/technical fabric of society?

(My replies follow.  Apologies, because these are too heavy with
 theory.  Most of it's just an attempt to dovetail with the above
 argument.)

&gt;<i> [a] Transition to e-democracy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I still think that some element of transition might end up being highly
</I>&gt;<i> desirable and quite possibly inevitable.  I suppose that the key question
</I>&gt;<i> is: what legitimacy would current political representatives (and structures)
</I>&gt;<i> have when functioning alongside healthy, viable e-democracy?  The only
</I>&gt;<i> hypothetical source of legitimacy that I can think of is that they might be

</I>
Another is to do what the public tells them to do.  So they'd get
their legitimacy from the ultimate source.  This argument is based on
the rational structure of modern society - rational because it's
factored into specialized components.  Two of the components are:

  * Government (power structured)
  * Public sphere (communicatively structured)

Regardless of what other relations these two enter into, the
legitimacy of the government's power rests on the separate integrity
of the public sphere.  No other component can confer the needed
legitimacy.

We're aiming for a legitimate form of government.  We're therefore
also aiming for a strong and healthy public sphere.  Imagine we
achieve this aim with the help of e-dem tools.  The public is then
using these tools to &quot;stand up&quot; and &quot;speak&quot; for itself - to say what
it wants.  This in turn lays down a clear avenue for the legitimate
exercise of power - something no government can resist.  So this
result is probably stable.

If this argument is correct (and if modernity holds together) then
there'll be no more shades of grey.  The world will become a patchwork
of white and black.  Every separate people will either live in a true
democracy, or an undisguised tyranny.

&gt;<i>                   ...  But I do not think that this would end up
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding to reality.  I would have thought that their role would be
</I>&gt;<i> quickly superseded, in itself, although many current political figures would
</I>&gt;<i> presumably remain in the public eye and gather large numbers of default
</I>&gt;<i> delegated votes.  On a related question, there&#185;s the issue of the extent to
</I>&gt;<i> which existing institutions could compete with any fully-functioning system
</I>&gt;<i> of e-democracy.  E-democracy would have such strengths - flexibility,
</I>&gt;<i> participation, ability to tie in to other institions, etc etc &#173; that there&#185;s
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility that the e-democracy/conventional democracy relationship
</I>&gt;<i> could look a little like that between computers and abacuses, for example.
</I>
I guess this could affect only the institutions that sit in the grey
areas, between government and public.  If they are functionally
out-competed by the public's institutions (e-dem), then they might
dissolve.  So no more party system, for example.

Or, if the structure is constitutionally guaranteed (as with a
parliament), it might adapt to new functions.  A quasi-public
institution is naturally adaptable, anyway.  So maybe there's no
danger, here.

&gt;<i> Michael, I&#185;m not sure I have totally understood your description for how
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy would work in combination with current institutions.  I think
</I>&gt;<i> that you are saying that e-democracy would &#140;stand behind&#185; elected
</I>&gt;<i> representatives in the way that political parties do, so that they will be
</I>&gt;<i> aware of the voting preferences of their constituents before voting.  Thus
</I>&gt;<i> they will have pressure to vote along the lines that their constituents
</I>&gt;<i> would like, in the same way that elected representatives currently have
</I>&gt;<i> pressure from their political party to stick to the party line...
</I>
That's a good description for the electoral side of it.  No more
political parties (say), because they've vanished with the grey areas.
No longer are candidates members of a party and all that entails, but
self-professed members of a public.  No longer are they nominated in
party primaries, but rather in &quot;public primaries&quot;.  It's as though the
parties were filling in for the public, all this time.  Now we step
into their role.

&gt;<i> ... That&#185;s pretty different to my version above (the different
</I>&gt;<i> systems act essentially independently, and either the output of one
</I>&gt;<i> is fed to the other, or the outputs of both are combined somehow).
</I>&gt;<i> I think that my version has advantages in terms of enabling
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility and allowing, essentially, a different set of
</I>&gt;<i> representatives (with correspondingly more focussed expertise) to
</I>&gt;<i> take on each issue; indeed, one can even imagine one person being
</I>&gt;<i> delegated all votes on an issue.  But I can see it&#185;s not an open and
</I>&gt;<i> shut case.
</I>
I suspect you are grafting a voting system that's *par-excellent* a
public system (P2P, communicatively structured) onto an institution
that's very different in its internal structure (the assembly).  You
may thereby be hoping to *reform* the assembly into what, ostensibly,
it's supposed to be anyway - a tool of the public.  I'll argue that's
impossible, on grounds of a trend to rationalization.  This is not the
strongest argument:

The official legislators are in the grey area between government and
public.  Parliament is historically a space opened up in government
for the public.  If I stick to my argument of more and more
rationalization, then I say that the assembly must move in one
direction, or the other.  However, it cannot dissolve structurally
into the public sphere, because it's firmly anchored by the
constitution.  So it must drift functionally toward a purely
administrative role within government.

Again, all these years, the elected assemblies were only filling in
for the public.  Now, as far as the public moves into that space -
drafting candidate bills, and reaching consensus on them - the
assemblies will move aside and begin to specialize on the residual
administrative functions of shepherding legislation through
government: coordinating bureaucratic and judicial reviews,
rubberstamping, promulgation and internal enforcement.

Stronger arguments are that any attempt to grapple *directly* with an
institution of the system will backfire.  Money and power will flow
back through the lines of communication, and destroy the delicate
communicative structure of the public.  Also, there are huge technical
hurdles in bending the structure of a free and open communicative
system to the very different requirements of an administrative system.
Deadlines and other constraints are irrational in the context of the
public sphere, and will provoke irrational behaviour among the voters.

&gt;<i> In terms of respect for existing institutions, I think this is more from an
</I>&gt;<i> awareness that change brings real possibilities for harm as well as
</I>&gt;<i> improvement.  As for constitutional change, I think that one should not be
</I>&gt;<i> too pessimistic about possibilities for this.  If one imagines a situation
</I>&gt;<i> where e-democracy had proven its ability to function well on a nation-wide
</I>&gt;<i> scale (on a steadily growing &#140;shadow&#185; basis), and was functioning well as a
</I>&gt;<i> gatherer of opinion on that scale, then I think it&#185;s possible to see that
</I>&gt;<i> attempts by political parties/political elites to hold on to power by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining existing political structures could generate significant
</I>&gt;<i> tensions.  The most obvious parallel in terms of political elites trying to
</I>&gt;<i> resist greater political participation is possibly 1989: a situation
</I>&gt;<i> involving resistance by those with political power to the wider
</I>&gt;<i> dissemination of that power, as here.  Of course, the analogy should only be
</I>&gt;<i> taken so far.
</I>
(There isn't nearly enough discussion of this.)  From my perspective,
seeing the existing institutions have been around for a long time and
weathered crises, they appear to be structurally sound, safe things to
hold onto.  This is part of the basis of my own respect for them.  The
other part is perhaps their structural and functional efficiency.
Taking these as general patterns, I believe we can build equally
strong institutions in the public sphere.

&gt;<i> One final point &#173; my work on ethics in the economy has convinced me that
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy is the only way that ethics can be introduced to economic
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making on a widespread and meaningful basis, in the way that is
</I>&gt;<i> needed to address urgent environmental and social problems.  Thus there are
</I>&gt;<i> big incentives to achieving comprehensive, inclusive success for
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy, in the gradual, benefits-based way described.
</I>
That makes sense.  If the economy began with a ethical basis in
religion (as Max Weber says), then it's long since gone, rationalized
away.  It's now just a big machine, and it doesn't obey ethical rules.
Nor should it, we could argue, *in itself*.

Ordinarily, it's only the government (another big machine) that can
work the levers of the economy.  The government is not ethically
motivated, either.  But e-democracy will enable the public to try its
hands at the levers, and the public *is* ethically motivated.

Again, if this approach is correct, it's correct because 1) it clearly
separates society's rational components; and 2) it brings those
components into proper relations with each other, along narrow and
specialized lines of communication.

&gt;<i> [b]  Moral platform
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Much shorter comments, you&#185;ll be glad to hear:
</I>
(I've been getting even, at least in volume of words. ;)
 
&gt;<i> * Opening up the moral platform to a much wider set of themes is a great
</I>&gt;<i> idea.
</I>&gt;<i> * I&#185;m a little concerned about the use of the word &#140;utopia&#185;, because it&#185;s so
</I>&gt;<i> often used in a pejorative sense because there&#185;s insufficient regard for
</I>&gt;<i> achievability.  Maybe, though, that would only require a relatively little
</I>&gt;<i> re-branding, and maybe the usage of such a well-known term would be good...
</I>
There's a particular cultural form called &quot;utopian literature&quot;, and a
subcategory qualified as &quot;serious utopian literature&quot; (Howard Segal).
It's only a form.  The reality has other forms and other names.  Maybe
all of them eventually became pejorative, or at least anachronistic.
They seem to have found no place in modern society.  There's &quot;myth&quot;,
for example.  Myth once told us where we come from, and where we are
going.

(I confess this is my favourite topic.  It's hard to keep my
 speculations out of the project docs, though they don't belong
 there.)

&gt;<i> ... As long as the website was clearly for the mapping of current positions and
</I>&gt;<i> the realisation of achievable goals (giving that a totally open definition)
</I>&gt;<i> then I think would certainly be on board.
</I>
You should lead in this, then, since nobody else has taken that
particular initiative.  It's one entry point, anyway.  The website
always needs work.  It's just a copy of the project files, so it can
be modified through the revision control system:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/contributors.xht#revision-control-system">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/contributors.xht#revision-control-system</A>

More and more, we're moving documentation efforts into the pollwiki.
We have these project and domain-related polls:

  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/vop">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/vop</A>
  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/vohall">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/vohall</A>
  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/de">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/P/de</A>

The pollwiki has the advantage of allowing open collaboration.  We can
juxtapose different alternatives side-by-side, and cross-exchange the
best bits.  So if we created a theory poll (P/t?), then people could
put alternative theories side-by-side:

  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/t">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/t</A>
  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Tom-FoxlintonOrg/p/t">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Tom-FoxlintonOrg/p/t</A>

It's also a good way to get familiar with the tools, and spark new
ideas.  (But it's a lot of work, too.)

And ofc, we're open to collab with other projects/individuals.  We're
not going to be disconnected anymore, I hope.

&gt;<i> * I think your final point here about fitting in with existing practice ties
</I>&gt;<i> in here: it might be helpful to make the site more about plotting a course
</I>&gt;<i> from where we are than thinking abstractly about inventing a new world (or
</I>&gt;<i> possibly structuring the site so that that type of input doesn&#185;t dominate
</I>&gt;<i> (though I&#185;m not sure if one can do this in any way objectively to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> top-down influence)).  Linking the site to the legal one will draw in users.
</I>
We're open to any kind of testing intiative at the trial site.  Plus
anyone can set up a trial site in his home town, or wherever (there's
talk of that, but no action yet).  Right now, though, we're gearing up
now to go chasing after the users in their own particular spaces.  So
rather than attempting to transplant them to our site, we'll reach out
to them in discussion sites, and so forth, where they're already
active.  (We need the difference engine for this purpose, among
others.)

&gt;<i> [c]  (1) Thanks
</I>&gt;<i>       (2) And also for comments on auto-delegation and where it&#185;s at at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment.  Thanks for the ideas for the project to develop that, but I don&#185;t
</I>&gt;<i> imagine that my skills (or probably resources) are likely to be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine that social science-type contributions are all I&#185;m likely to be
</I>&gt;<i> good for.
</I>
Maybe that's exactly what we need.  There's lots of hands engaged in
the nuts and bolts of e-democracy, but very little understanding of
what those hands are doing.  And it's not just understanding, but
communication of what we know, or guess.  That's the hardest thing of
all.  (It takes me days sometimes, to write a single email.)
