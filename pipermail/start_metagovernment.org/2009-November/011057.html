<PRE>As you know, I recently gave a talk in Southampton.

One of the comments over there was really interesting, and I would like to
open up the venue for discussing it further. And I find it interesting that
the idea seem to appear now in different places.

The comment was from Seth Bullock (in CC).
Seth pretty much said:

&quot;The IPCC is the group of scientists from the UN who integrates the research
on climate change. For anything to appear on the IPCC document there have to
be a really strong majority of people that agree with it. Maybe around 90%
or similar. As a result the documents that come out do not correctly
represent the seriousness of the situation we are in. What Vilfredo could do
in such a situation would be to permit to people to vote different versions
of the same paragraph, and then just insert the voted pareto front. To show
the spectrum of what the people signing  the document think&quot;

We then kept on having a small discussion on how the various opinion should
be represented (different documents, one after the other, etc). Until we
reached a conclusion similar to the document I am accluding.

This is essentially using a table, with a row for each paragraph. If the
paragraph is not supported by everybody, the row will be divided into
different column, one for each different element of the pareto front.

I am including an rtf file with an example of what I mean. This is taken
from Ed's abstract for the government 2.0 conference.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>

If the list strips the attachment, the rtf can be found on:
<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/wiki%2Bvilfredo.rtf">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/wiki%2Bvilfredo.rtf</A>

It should be noted that the idea is already going around in different ways.
Already Manuel, Fabian &amp; C. at Candiwi have installed a system to comment at
each paragraph. And you can do something similar on the Mercurial tutorial
page.

Also at the wall of text page, someone suggested that each paragraph in a
vilfredo proposal should be voted by itself.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>
(first suggestion, current generation: 2)

And in the mailing list just today someone suggested that maybe vilfredo
could be integrated with wiki (sorry, can't find the email right now).

So in short I think that yes, we should consider having the possibility to
set up a Vilfredo system to vote for different paragraph in a common
document. But I also think we should have a different question being set up
for each paragraph, and this can only happen once Vilfredo is so smooth it
can be seamingless embedded.
Also you might want to do this only after the general structure of the
document have been decided.

Any suggestion would be VERY welcome.

Pietro
