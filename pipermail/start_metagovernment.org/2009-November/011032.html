I think it is safe to assume they do, since a large number of their  
speakers are from outside of Washington. Even the comparatively small  
Prague conference I went to paid my flight and apartment, so I can't  
imagine this conference would be so negligent.

Honestly, I don't think Tim O'Reilly likes me. Or at least, I haven't  
had much communication with him nor much luck presenting at any of his  
conferences. He did show a liking for WhiteHouse2, though. :) At least  
he favorably tweeted about it once, that I saw.

&gt;<i> Next thing we should apply is TED!
</I>
I looked at TED a while ago, and their process is very odd. They don't  
invite speakers as much as they provide Fellowships. The fellows then  
meet and talk together, and then some of the fellows are asked to  
present sometimes. Or that's what I gathered anyway.

I think it would be awesome for us to (eventually!) give a  
collaborative presentation to TED, but I don't know if they are set up  
for it.
