I found the information at that link very interesting, particularly the 
notion of a &quot;delegate cascade.&quot;  My own approach, called &quot;coalescent 
bubbling,&quot; might appeal to you. Or perhaps not, since my temperament is 
not Utopian, but Bettertopian.

In any case, there's a new ranked-choice voting demo up at WeVote, based 
on the Health Reform Video Challenge sponsored by BarackObama.com. You 
can compare the videos by clicking on the names inside the ballot tool.

It usually takes a few dozen ballots cast in a very competitive 
multi-candidate race to illustrate how coalescent bubbling plays out. So 
I hope that folks here will give it a try.
