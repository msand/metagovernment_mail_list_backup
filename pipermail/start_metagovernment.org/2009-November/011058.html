I was thinking along similar lines .. if people can build apps on
twitter, you can do it with email.

The presentation could be cleaned up by 'robots' in something like
wave, or 'plugins' in any of the various email clients out there, but
it doesn't have to be so ugly.

You could reply with a first line: Approve 1 4 5 6

But, regarding wave, .. no one can predict whether this will 'replace'
email, coexist with email and how long this transition might take.

It's a whole lot more likely to occur if there are applications to
make use of wave, and demonstrate potential.

But, the problem is the transition state -- any application that works
only on wave (and thus demonstrate its superiority) will by definition
not work on email.

So, imagine we built an application for wave that did X ... ?? It
can't *depend* on wave because otherwise the millions of email users
will be excluded.. so, wave can't be a solution to a problem like
this. It can only be a bonus (the same way you wouldn't support ONLY
login-via-facebook).

This is becoming a bit of a ramble, but I do think there is
opportunity here in the Wave-space to make a real impression ...
because :

1) There is interest in seeing Wave's potential
2) It will likely get a lot of press coverage -- tech blogs &amp; the like
will comment on implementations, etc.
3) Right now, there isn't much competition
4) New users (new invitees) who join wave will think .. &quot;what can I do
with this?&quot;. they won't have a lot of friends on wave yet, and so they
may begin to explore applications ..  if one of our apps is among the
5 listed, that gives us incredible exposure.

This could (stressing 'could' as opposed to 'will' ) very easily
become the next iPhone App store, where the early apps got a lot more
visibility than they would have if they had come late.
