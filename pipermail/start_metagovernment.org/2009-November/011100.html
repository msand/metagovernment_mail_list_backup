</I>Well, as a person who studies Taoist I came across the Taoist way of looking
at democracy:
&quot;an interesting experiment&quot;. You need to take a long view on things to
understand it.

Regarding using Vilfredo and some of those tools in a succession way, we
could consider:

a) a question is posed (and maybe something should preceed this to make sure
that the question is posed in a correct-neutral way that does not bias the
discussion in one way or another
b) through a Vilfredo-like system every person who is willing to participate
develop the pareto front of the possible answer.
If a complete consensus is reached the answer is taken as representative of
the whol society, and we move on to the next question
If instead after a &quot;reasonable&quot; number of generations we reach the
conclusion that no consensus can be found, the pareto front are taken as
alternatives.
c) through a deliberative process a sample of the population is informed
about the possibilities, and then learn from the experts they why and how of
each option.
and now here we have two possibilities:
d1) the sample of the popualtion vote on the possibilities. Possibly using a
Condorcet method  ( <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</A> ). The
winner is takes as representative of the society
OR (actually, XOR :-) )
d2) the sample of the population provide a comment for each possibility, and
then the population at large votes, again using a Condorcet method.


It looks like an interesting system.
Notice how, since a single person can avoid the group to reach consensus,
and can impose something in the pareto front, the result is that the system
is robust against a group of exerts who decide to hack the system at point
a-b. It is enough that one person realises what is the will of the majority,
and forces the system out of the consensus of experts. ANd then the
population at large (or a sample of it) can vote for what they really
believe.

FOr small system we could substitute points c and d, with taking the whole
population, and then applying c,d1 on this group.

There is still a weakness, as there is no control on how the questions are
asked. But I would say we have already gone a long way from the systems we
have at the moment.

P.S. someone, (i.e. a non programmer, or someone not involved in any
project) should take this whole thread and summarise it into a wiki page.
