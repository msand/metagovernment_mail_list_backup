<PRE>Dear Giovani,
dear Fabian,
it took us a long time to go open source, and we have looked at what the
various options were.

Google code supports mercurial, and it is going very well so far.

Our work is based on three things, there is the community that hopefully
will start to form around Vilfredo, there is the code, and there are the
ideas. The ideas are there on the open, to be taken. This is the spirit of
the academic research that I do, and I would not that to be different. If
anyone wants to take them and use them in their own program, more power to
them. If they refer to them in their research I would expect propoer
bibliographic references, but no control or payment whatsoever after that.

The code is the only thing that we are discussing here. I am happy if
someone wants to take my code, and use it however they see fit; but
understand: for a big corporation, the size of google, or microsoft, or
yahoo, it costs much less to rewrite the code, or pay me a few thousand
dollars as a consultant, than to take our code, and start from there. The
ideas are quite trivial, re-coding them would take a team of good
programmers a fraction of the time it took us. And then the code would be
precise, as the corporation needs it. With all the integration with the
other services they offer in place.

If instead someone were to take it, and set up a service that is in all
regards similar to mine. And they were not a big corporations, they would
have limited funds. Yes they can show the service without the code. But then
they would be competing with us, who have the same code, only our is open
source. Not good for them.

Add to all this, that all the work about being in another place would give
us a different copyright law. Well, copyright, in this world, is only as
good as the lawyer you are able to pay to uphold them. I don't have the time
nor the money to fight this kind of war. Not even if the FSF would back me
up, or metagovernment itself.

I am quite happy to produce code, develop ideas, let them up for grab, and
maybe develop a community. Or a metacommunity.

In other words, I would be quite happy to even let our code out with no
copyright at all. Look at delicious, the idea is trivial, the code is
trivial. But the community was worth 30 million dollars when yahoo bought
it.

On the other hand google code seem to be working alright. I don't have much
experience with the others, but users can submit issues, we can comment on
the changes in the code, directly from the website. The system automatically
generates different parallel heads, and merges them. So yet it is very
snappy, but this snappyness is making us code much much faster. And this is
important.

By the time someone realises we had a really good idea, we will already have
moved on, or have created a community. They can eat our dust.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that Google Code is really cute, snappy, friendly, etc... but...
</I>&gt;<i> I have just seen that you set Vilfredo's license to GPLv3 and not Affero
</I>&gt;<i> GPLv3. Google does not allow to set Affero GPLv3 license because it
</I>&gt;<i> threatens all their web-based software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if someone here already know the differences about the two licenses,
</I>&gt;<i> but I think it is important for all of us working of free software for the
</I>&gt;<i> web to use the right license, otherwise our efforts can backfire.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Affero GPLv3 was created by the FSF to fix a &quot;bug&quot; on the GPLv2. This bug
</I>&gt;<i> was inherited by the GPLv3 because there was no legal way of removing it
</I>&gt;<i> without making gpl2 and 3 incompatible. This bug is the fact that people
</I>&gt;<i> using the software via web (in fact via any remote connection - including
</I>&gt;<i> mobile) were not considered &quot;users&quot;, and therefore didn't have the right to
</I>&gt;<i> download the source code (and in fact you can't download gmail's source
</I>&gt;<i> code, even though it is based on GPL'ed software). It is called the &quot;ASP
</I>&gt;<i> Loophole&quot; (<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP_loophole">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP_loophole</A>). The fix avoids
</I>&gt;<i> proprietary business from providing ASP services based on Vilfredo (maybe
</I>&gt;<i> even improving its source code) and not releasing the modified version as it
</I>&gt;<i> would happen in normal GPL-licensed products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest the use of Sourceforge.
</I>&gt;<i> I know, it is less &quot;user-friendly&quot; and more &quot;coder-friendly&quot;... but trust
</I>&gt;<i> me, we shouldn't sacrifice our software's freedom.
</I>&gt;<i>
