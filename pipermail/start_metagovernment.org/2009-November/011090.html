<PRE>James Surowiecki has argued that for some kinds of decisions, contrary to
popular wisdom emphasizing cohesive teamwork, &quot;The best way for a group to
be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as
possible.&quot; <A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A> 

Presumably, well-designed collaborative polls avoid the perils of groupthink
-- <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink</A> -- and polls (deliberative and
otherwise) may serve useful purposes (ranging from pure entertainment, to
validating what we already believe, to leading us to believe someone else
may care what we think, to providing serious advice to those who will
actually be making decisions).

Again, however, I am more interested in what we ourselves (those who choose
to participate) can *do* (accomplish by working) together, rather than what
we (individually or collectively) might like to tell others to do.

I am among those who believe, as a matter of general principle, that
government should only do for others what they cannot do for themselves.
While there is much room for debate over what *should* be done for those who
cannot do for themselves, it seems to me that we let ourselves off the hook
far too easily for failing to do that which we could do for ourselves (if we
were not in the habit of expecting others to do it for us).

I'm not sure how I feel about this. I would avoid the term majority  
and say Democracy is the will of the people. But isn't it the will at  
this time? Not the will of the people after they have been coached and  
prodded.

If people don't care, they don't care. Their will is empty in that  
regard. Why should they have a substantive input into something they  
don't care about?

If other people think that more people should care about something...  
then use the other mechanisms of society to make your point. That is  
the whole idea behind issue advocacy groups (other than lobbying). Buy  
some TV time, or stage a protest or whatever.

&gt;<i> Those two are really different. And we should never forget it. This

</I>
But that's because people have no say in government. If people could  
actively participate in governance at any moment, they wouldn't have  
any right to complain about things they don't like. Instead, they  
could just jump in and fix it.

I also think that well-developed collaborative governance software  
will bring people into the deliberation process, instead of simply  
being a sounding board for whatever is on the top of their minds. And  
that is largely a function of clever website design. For example, look  
at how WhiteHouse 2 presents issues. I think it's a very good start  
for delving deeper.
