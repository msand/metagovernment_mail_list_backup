<PRE>Ed, isn't what you are suggesting pretty much what Pietro is now trying to
do with Vilfredo, i.e., use it to govern its own development?

Lack of ongoing commitment is not just a problem for &quot;governance software
projects&quot;; it is a problem for any collaborative endeavor (or, for that
matter, for any personal endeavor as well).  As a matter of general
principle, human attention spans seem to be pretty short and we seem to a
have a preference for dealing in abstractions rather than in practical
action whose results can be measured and made salient to stakeholders.

Taking into account that we each have differing motivations (goals and
objectives), it may be a matter of serendipity whenever anything actually
does get done collaboratively.  It still is not clear to me that any of the
metagov projects are addressing anything about which I truly care ... much
less that any of their developers care about something about which I care
deeply, i.e., the purposes of the emerging StratML standard:

BTW, if anyone is interested, some of David Allen's thoughts on getting
things done are discussed at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/done.pdf">http://ambur.net/done.pdf</A>

I think this speaks to a general problem among all governance software  
projects: how to get people coming back such that the process has  
enough participation and thought to be meaningful.

My feeling is that the only sure answer here is that the software has  
to be meaningful in itself. That is, it has to have real-world effects.

What is really needed is for an outside group to adopt one of our  
projects (or a combination of them) as their actual governance  
mechanism.

The only problem is that none of our projects is ready for that. Even  
White House 2, with its superb interface and thousands of users, has  
no internal mechanism for acting as an actual decision-maker. (Nor can  
it anyway, since its thousands of users come from it having a US-wide  
scope: a realm where it is not likely to become the dominant decision- 
making mechanism for quite a while.)

What projects need now is to be raised to a point of readiness where  
they can be adopted by very small organizations willing to be governed  
by software which admittedly will still be in beta.
