Then you won't be offended if I say your app is better than most, but
not ideal.

Actually, I tried it out when you introduced it earlier.  I remember
the voters use a graphical view of the results (a nice visual) to
adjust their votes from round to round.  I think this adjustment is
the &quot;bubbling&quot;.  So maybe this is an analogy with engineering
processes (bubble sorts).

I see another analogy: the graph functions as a kind of window onto
society.  It reveals information that is normally hidden from the
voter - at least in traditional elections, or one-shot polls.  It
invites the voter to enter into a kind of &quot;dialogue&quot; (action and
reaction) with her co-voters.  So this is an analogy with social
communicative processes.

But these are only analogies.  Although there's an instrumental,
machine-like aspect to it, it's properly social because there's people
involved; and although there's people involved, they are not
communicating in a properly social manner.  Here's one place where
it's less than ideal.  (Another: the UI is nicely polished, but the
monetization mars it.)

We welcome your feedback on our own app.  We introduced it here:

Ed, you should probably &quot;Unvote&quot;.  You're currently voting for an
alias of yourself.  You don't need to vote at all in order to
participate.  You're already the leading candidate.
