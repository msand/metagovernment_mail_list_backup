<PRE>I don't really care much about this &quot;debate&quot; per se.  However, I do care
about what we are actually trying to accomplish together.  Thus, the
passages of greatest interest to me are these:  

&quot;The goal of a project such as metagovernment is to design a bootstrapping
system that meets not the desires of society, per se, but the mechanisms in
which those desires can be best achieved. As such, its goal is to find a
commonly agreeable framework and standard about which every individual can
agree is fair and applicable to all.&quot;
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Healthy_society">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Healthy_society</A>

First of all, I don't believe &quot;society&quot; has &quot;desires&quot;; individual, human
beings do.  Nor do I believe that &quot;every individual&quot; will ever agree that
any particular &quot;framework&quot; or &quot;standard&quot; is &quot;fair and applicable to all.&quot;
(Perhaps the most cogent statement President Carter ever made was that life
is not fair. <A HREF="http://quotationsbook.com/quote/44426/">http://quotationsbook.com/quote/44426/</A>)

What I'd like to think we (the subscribers to the Metagov listserv) are
working toward is: 

1) a standard set of data elements (preferably an XML vocabulary and schema)
by which individuals can not only:

a) express degrees of support/opposition on &quot;propositions&quot; (e.g., goals and
objectives) anywhere on the Web and perhaps (optionally) provide very
*short* narrative feedback, if they choose, but also (and more importantly)

b) indicate their degrees of *commitment*, e.g., the time, money, and/or
other resources they *personally* are willing and able to allocate (toward
realization of the objective);

2) software programming code to facilitate the creation, aggregation, and
reporting of such &quot;data&quot;; and

3) Web-based services supporting such functions.

At this point, it does not seem to me that anyone else shares my interest in
those objectives, particularly the first one.  Thus, I am contemplating how
much longer I may wish to remain subscribed to the listserv.

Subject: [Start] Wiki home page edit war

Over the past week or so, there has been an argument over the addition  
of a link to the home page of the wiki. Coinciding with that is the  
rather lengthy discussion/dispute at the bottom of:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Main_Page</A>

I haven't had much spare time recently, but the debate seems to center  
around one user's addition of a link on the home page to this page:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Why_this_project_is_needed.">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Why_this_project_is_needed.</A>
And the other user saying that the link is not a consensus edit and/or  
that the above page is not well written.

I tend to side with the idea that the page is not really a good  
descriptor of the Metagovernment project as a whole, and I don't see a  
need for this link on the homepage. But I also certainly don't want to  
be some sort of edit-reverting overlord, so I am asking other members  
of this community to have a look and see what you think.
