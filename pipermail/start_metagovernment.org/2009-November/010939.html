</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I tried it out when you introduced it earlier.  I remember
</I>&gt;<i> the voters use a graphical view of the results (a nice visual) to
</I>&gt;<i> adjust their votes from round to round.  I think this adjustment is
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;bubbling&quot;.  So maybe this is an analogy with engineering
</I>&gt;<i> processes (bubble sorts).
</I>-- Actually, the &quot;runoff&quot; is instantaneous. That's the virtue of 
ranked-choice instant runoff voting. But WeVote explicitly allows 
participants to amend their ballots until voting closes. That approach 
is intended to facilitate the coalition-building and consensus-finding 
aspect of the application (Which is a lesson learned from Thomas 
Edison's work on electric voting tools, but that's another story).

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see another analogy: the graph functions as a kind of window onto
</I>&gt;<i> society.  It reveals information that is normally hidden from the
</I>&gt;<i> voter - at least in traditional elections, or one-shot polls.  It
</I>&gt;<i> invites the voter to enter into a kind of &quot;dialogue&quot; (action and
</I>&gt;<i> reaction) with her co-voters.  So this is an analogy with social
</I>&gt;<i> communicative processes.
</I>-- Very much so. It's a key virtue of using social authentication.

&gt;<i> But these are only analogies.  Although there's an instrumental,
</I>&gt;<i> machine-like aspect to it, it's properly social because there's people
</I>&gt;<i> involved; and although there's people involved, they are not
</I>&gt;<i> communicating in a properly social manner.  Here's one place where
</I>&gt;<i> it's less than ideal.
</I>-- How could it be made more &quot;properly social&quot; in your view? I'm not 
sure what you mean by that term. But I'll grant that the &quot;Discussion&quot; 
Tab, if better than nothing, is weak. A future version, if I get a 
chance to build it, would solicit tweet-length comments on ranks given. 
The challenge would then move to finding an elegant and useful way to 
display them.

   (Another: the UI is nicely polished, but the
&gt;<i> monetization mars it.)
</I>-- Continued lack of funding threatens to mar things even more.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We welcome your feedback on our own app.  We introduced it here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-October/002046.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-October/002046.html</A>
</I>-- I'm using Firefox 3.0.15 and the links are giving me &quot;Internal Error&quot; 
and &quot;Unrecognized Scheme, District or Poll&quot;
