Sure, but I'm talking about six months from now, in which time,  
several systems should be more like betas than alphas.

Also, while this is a mainstream conference, it is not huge. It  
doesn't get covered in mass media news broadcasts... in fact I think  
even the Washington Post newspaper only did a minor article on it in  
their online edition.

That's why I think this makes for a good venue for us: it isn't a mass  
market, but it does put us in front of a lot of thought leaders in  
fields neighboring ours.

Apart from attracting users, the more general PR need we have is  
getting the paradigm out there. Most times anything like our projects  
is mentioned, people immediately dismiss it with the old criticisms of  
direct democracy. We can help overcome these biases both by making  
usable software that speaks for itself and by presenting the ideas to  
targeted audiences. I see no conflict in pursuing both paths  
simultaneously. In fact, they should feed each other nicely.
