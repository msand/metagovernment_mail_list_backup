<PRE>Hi Tom,

I have critique of [a b], but I agree with [c].  I hope we can work
together.

&gt;<i> [a] I assume constitutional change, but I can't see how that could be a
</I>&gt;<i> popular constitutional change.  Obviously constitutional systems vary but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not aware of any that has provisions for a participative system, or any
</I>&gt;<i> other popular input, to propose constitutional change, although I think that
</I>&gt;<i> popular ratification by referendum is sometimes required.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, current elected representatives would have to relinquish power to
</I>&gt;<i> a participative system, presumably with some degree of popular pressure to
</I>&gt;<i> overcome resistance by those elected representatives for their loss of
</I>&gt;<i> power/income.  A natural source for such pressure would be some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> 'shadow' e-governance system, which growing up alongside existing political
</I>&gt;<i> structures would presumably have increasing influence on policy outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> However, knowledge within society of participative alternatives, being used
</I>&gt;<i> in other organisational settings, could potentially be sufficient.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose there might be possibilities for those in an open participative
</I>&gt;<i> system to take power for themselves somehow, but I'm not sure how the
</I>&gt;<i> mechanics of that would work and it doesn't seem in any way an appealing way
</I>&gt;<i> forward.
</I>
I agree with that.  I admire your respect for existing institutions.
But constitutional change is historically unlikely.  What about this
combination?

  1. Existing institutions (as they are)
  2. Open participative system (something new)

Both 1 and 2 are mutually independent and non-interfering.
Therefore no constitutional change is required to add 2.  Compare it
with the party system, which also arose extra-constitutionally.  It
dramatically changed the function of government without touching the
structure.

Consider also that the parties are nothing but primary electoral
systems.  So we make 2 a *better* primary electoral system, and we
enter by the same back door the parties did, 150 years ago.

It's more than that.  There are technical and social-theoretic reasons
why the combination (1 and 2) is stronger than 1 or 2 alone.  It's as
though society needed two legs to stand on.

&gt;<i> [b] As far as I can make out we're talking about fairly different things
</I>&gt;<i> here.  I think you are talking about creating a utopia blueprint using
</I>&gt;<i> e-governance type tools?  I'm thinking of something much less ambitious:
</I>&gt;<i> just thinking through, collectively, fairly specific moral issues (such as:
</I>&gt;<i> when is murder 'okay' (self-defence, mental illness, diminished
</I>&gt;<i> responsibility etc)) in an open 'moral' setting before worrying about
</I>&gt;<i> framing these into a practical legal setting.  These moral positions could
</I>&gt;<i> then tie in to a larger whole, which would constantly be evolving.  It would
</I>&gt;<i> also hopefully be possible to leave room for different groups
</I>&gt;<i> (geographical/religious etc etc) to take different approaches).  The idea
</I>&gt;<i> would be to provide solid moral roots/discussion for the 'higher-level' law
</I>&gt;<i> subsequently produced, and for moral and legal developments to move hand in
</I>&gt;<i> hand.  I think that from this perspective perhaps many of the deeper
</I>&gt;<i> philosophical considerations covered in the material in your link don't
</I>&gt;<i> arise, or if they do then are solved during the process I describe rather
</I>&gt;<i> than through philosophy.  I hold up my hand, though, and confess to almost
</I>&gt;<i> no philosophical background, so let me know if I have missed the point of
</I>&gt;<i> your material.
</I>
(Sorry, it's just rough notes.  It's not a philosophical method in
 itself.  That's just my attempt to understand it.)

The idea is that people try to agree on a common vision for the
future.  From the perspective of the users, they use the same e-dem
tools that allow them to reach consensus on laws, and so forth.  Only
they apply those tools to the cultural text of a utopion vision of the
good life - the best possible future.  The consensus and/or mutual
understanding that emerges from that effort would then serve as the
platform for the pursuit of narrower political aims - laws and so
forth - just as you say.

The vision would not be purely of morality, but much broader.  Utopian
literature natually combines all of the cultural spheres into which
modern society is fragmented - science, art, engineering, morality -
and binds them all together.  It's a wide and deep platform to build
upon.

&gt;<i> In terms of the nuts and bolts of how moral standpoints would evolve - I see
</I>&gt;<i> that happening using a more basic format than that for e-governance (legal
</I>&gt;<i> etc) principles.  Interested individuals/organisations would explore and
</I>&gt;<i> develop moral issues that one or more of their number had proposed and map
</I>&gt;<i> levels of support for different ideas.
</I>
The challenge is to fit the method with existing practice.  It's risky
to develop new tools for completely new purposes (morality building),
because you begin with no practical guidelines, and no user base.

Analogy: I think there's a place for formal argumentation in
discussion media, but it's a small place.  Most people prefer to talk
the old fashioned way.  The same may be true for the expression of
morality.  How was it expressed in the past?  Keep as close to that as
you can, because you know it works.

&gt;<i> [c] Again, apologies if I haven't got the full extent of what you are saying
</I>&gt;<i> here.  If I have, then I think that there are additional elements in what I
</I>&gt;<i> am saying.  These are: 1) a two stage process of voting; and (more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly) 2) delegation of voting power to someone else for a certain
</I>&gt;<i> policy area until further notice, for all votes within that area.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Two (or more) stage process of voting: The first stage would involve
</I>&gt;<i> proposals being worked up (using wiki/voting etc etc) by specialised
</I>&gt;<i> interested parties.  Their output then would be voted for ideally by the
</I>&gt;<i> whole electorate, directly or indirectly.  (If there were more stages of
</I>&gt;<i> voting, then proposals would be successively scrutinised by wider and wider
</I>&gt;<i> sub-communities of the overall electorate before final passing.)
</I>
I think that all such systems are staged, with the exception of
Votorola.  We distribute the drafting effort throughout the entire
delegation tree/forest.  It's the core of the invention.  (We're
working right now on improving the presentation of the ideas, but for
now all we have is this:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-norm">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-norm</A>

&gt;<i> 2) Delegation of voting power has, therefore, to be structured to give the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of 'whole electorate voting' any sense of achievability.  Your cascade
</I>&gt;<i> ideas represent (and go far beyond) what I was envisaging in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> individual votes.  However, I was thinking of enabling people to assign
</I>&gt;<i> policy areas (of whatever size and nature they wanted (within the
</I>&gt;<i> capabilities of the system)) to someone else, until further notice, for all
</I>&gt;<i> votes within that area.  Without such a capability, each person would need
</I>&gt;<i> to participate in far too many votes, most of which they would have no
</I>&gt;<i> interest in and know nothing about.  That's the basic outline.  There's a
</I>&gt;<i> little more detail (such as an initial default to one's MP) in my original
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo post.
</I>
We need such a facility for Votorola.  Other voting engines will need
it, too.  I think that Adhocracy already has some of that built into
it.  Friedrich has just released his &quot;beta 2&quot;: <A HREF="http://adhocracy.cc/">http://adhocracy.cc/</A>

We briefly talked (Friedrich, Thomas and I) about developing a shared
facility of auto-delegation - a common tool that the voters of all
engines could use.  But nobody's moved on it, yet.  It's wide open, if
you are interested.

There's other common e-dem facilities in the pipeline - just talk, at
the moment.  Eventually one of them is going to catch on.  Votorola
wants to be a part of that, when it happens.  We'll work with anyone
who feels the same.

Best,
