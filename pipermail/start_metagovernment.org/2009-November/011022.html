It is a large, very well-funded conference. The down-side is that it  
costs a small fortune to attend as a regular attendee (making it  
rather non-open, in that regard). The upside is that I believe they  
pay for speakers' travel costs. It is not specified on the Call, but  
given their level of funding, I would hope that they do. It is  
standard procedure for conferences of this size to pay not only travel  
costs but also an honorarium to speakers.

Just a reminder, the proposal deadline is December 8, and the draft  
proposal is here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>

Also, note that while I crafted my original proposal as a presentation  
by me and key members of Active Projects, there is nothing stopping  
other members of this project from joining the proposal. It would be  
supremely cool if a presentation on collaborative governance were done  
as a broad collaborative effort by a large group of people. I invite  
anyone who is interested in presenting to add yourself to the Draft  
list of speakers.
