Are you aware of <A HREF="http://www.kettering.org/">http://www.kettering.org/</A> and <A HREF="http://www.nifi.org/">http://www.nifi.org/</A> ?

It sounds like you are doing something similar.

What I like about random sampling is that you tend to get people who 
don't care about the issue in question. The opinion of the people who 
don't care is valuable because these people are potentially best able to 
determine with least bias what is the best solution for society as a 
whole.
