Maybe I'm missing something. It seems to me that the ultimate 
implication of your approach is the outright elimination of elections.

Can such facilitated panels contribute high quality information, and do 
they deserve more support and attention? Certainly. Are they the optimal 
way to generate such information? Hard to say. Do I think they should be 
anointed as the legitimate gatekeeper of policy choices? No.

As with any kind of power, in politics, when allocations of resources 
are at stake, much depends on who gets to be the gatekeeper. Thus, I'm a 
big fan of representative democracy under the 
separation-of-powers-styled systems that have become so prominent in the 
world. Despite the many flaws in the implementations of democracy, I 
don't consider universal suffrage to be a shortcoming at all.

As far as the Indaba system on which I've been working, at the current 
time lack of participation is a much greater problem than lack of random 
sampling. But I never set out to build a scientifically accurate polling 
system... the goal is a highly scalable consensus-building mechanism.
