<PRE>2009/11/10 Michael Allan &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mike at zelea.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Thank you! &#160;I forgot about that. &#160;I can edit someone else's proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> That's why it's like a wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If my editing causes friction with the original proposers, it's no
</I>&gt;<i> problem. &#160;I can simply copy the proposal (P) to a new proposal (Q),
</I>&gt;<i> and do my editing there. &#160;So if we *ignore* the edit/vote phasing, we
</I>&gt;<i> have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(P) &#160;(Q) &#160;(R)
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160;\ &#160; | &#160; /
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; \ &#160;| &#160;/ &#160; &#160;| &#160;change flow
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160;\ | / &#160; &#160; v
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; \|/
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; (A)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In this picture, we're editing a bunch of proposals (P, Q, R). &#160;We're
</I>&gt;<i> creating changesets in the process. &#160;These changesets either flow
</I>&gt;<i> downward into the act (A), or they do not. &#160;Is the above an accurate
</I>&gt;<i> picture?
</I>Yes but remember a proposal can affect more then one article.

&gt;<i> Suppose A is &quot;America's Healthy Future Act&quot;, which is currently before
</I>&gt;<i> the U.S. congress. &#160;Suppose it's not being decided by the senate, but
</I>&gt;<i> by the public via Candiwi. &#160;How many proposals (P,Q,..*) would you
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably expect?
</I>This depends highly on the community so a can only guess ...
I think not many because the voting will cause proposals to be
rejected if their is no consensus. Overtime they should naturally
converge into one that everyone agrees on and accepts.

&gt;<i> What is the maximum number of proposals (on average) that a new
</I>&gt;<i> participant could handle, and still make a useful contribution to the
</I>&gt;<i> process?
</I>I think people will specialise in their area of interest and rely on
&quot;experts&quot; in others. Adding tagging of proposals and articles as well as
rating of comments should improve this.

&gt;<i> Another thing: Your home page says &quot;Candiwi is like a wiki, but you
</I>&gt;<i> can't edit the articles directly.&quot; &#160;So A cannot be edited. &#160;In fact,
</I>&gt;<i> there's nothing we can do with A, in itself. &#160;So it really isn't a
</I>&gt;<i> part of the decision process. &#160;It might as well be a statute on the
</I>&gt;<i> books, right? &#160;It needn't actually be stored in Candiwi.
</I>Yes the articles in the main repository represent what the community
has achieved consensus on. This can be thought of as statute and since
we are building candiwi on a distributed version control system their is
nothing stopping you from cloning the main repository.

&gt;<i> If that's true, the only problem that remains is how to decide among
</I>&gt;<i> these proposals, each of which is an alternative *replacement* for A:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;(P) &#160;(Q) &#160;(R) &#160;... &#160;etc.
</I>As I stated above I think conflicting proposals will converge or be rejected.
The voting process can be thought of as a kind of natural selection that
favours consensus. We are thinking about a way to enable a choice between
several proposals but I have some concerns about it.
*  It will keep people on their side of the fence because they will
form opposing
   groups instead of collaborating.
*  I think editing and getting things done is more important then
voting or endless
   discussions because voting is meaningless if you cannot create that which is
   being voted on.
Also when I look at the Proposals that have been rejected so far most of them
get accepted later on after minor edits. I think this is because people will not
invest much time in work that they know conflicts with what most people want.
I see the voting process more as a way of preventing submission of premature
content.

&gt;<i> Why must these proposals be stored in Candiwi? &#160;Why not in various
</I>&gt;<i> other wikis, scattered over the Web?
</I>As soon as we add importing and exporting the content can be distributed
freely on the web and a candiwi instance is nothing more or less then a place
where a community is collaborating and trying to achieved consensus.
