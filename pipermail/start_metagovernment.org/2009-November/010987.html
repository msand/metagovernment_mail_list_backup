<PRE>Hmm, so I see the rooms have already started to create havoc.

Please let me clarify, Vilfredo now have rooms, this means that each
question is assigned (by the questioner) a room. If no room is assigned, the
question will be in the common room. All the others are only visible in
their own room.

This has been done to permit to people to set up private places to discuss
personal business, without having to set up complicated invitation lists.
You make the room, and then manage who is in, by deciding who you give the
url to.

The question &quot;wall of text&quot; is in the Vilfredo room. A room where we plan to
put all the questions that air to make Vilfredo a better program.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Vilfredo</A>

But fear not, you do not need to go to each single room to check if there
are new questions.
First of all each room will have a subscribe button, that let you receive an
email whenever a question is being posted there. While for questions you are
already involved in, there is a &quot;todo page&quot;.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?todo=">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?todo=</A>

The todo page is accessible from the header. Where it says: &quot;todo list&quot;.
There you will find ALL the questions you have either asked, or answered, or
voted, or subscribed to. It will be a sort of general control place.

I have weighted to move on the wall of text question a bit, because I wanted
to permit to the people who were at my talk to add their suggestions if they
had any. I will now move on that question, so we can vote.

Regards,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Some answers that I submitted to the &quot;wall of text&quot; question in Vilfredo,
</I>&gt;<i> now lost for some reason. Fortunately I did a backup, because I considered
</I>&gt;<i> some ideas interesting (the last one).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   An icon or an emphasized title/link for those proposals that can be read
</I>&gt;<i> within a minute or less at normal reading speed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Prizes or reputation points for the succinct writer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative resuming: you have a marker and want to read entirely that
</I>&gt;<i> long, long, proposal; using it you can point to others what was significant
</I>&gt;<i> to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Drawing the proposal whenever possible. &quot;A picture tells a thousand words.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remember that thing one never would use: yes, (Java) Universal Modeling
</I>&gt;<i> Language (UML). Maybe we can create something more useful, the Proposal
</I>&gt;<i> Modeling Language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shorter proposals appear in the first places of a ranking. There are two
</I>&gt;<i> new buttons: I understand, I don't understand. Negative understanding points
</I>&gt;<i> sink the proposal in that ranking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing an abstract of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
