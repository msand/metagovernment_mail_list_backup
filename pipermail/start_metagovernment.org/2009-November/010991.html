<PRE>Good observations, Ed.  I agree that a &quot;major conference&quot; at which a group
of people working toward a &quot;generally common end&quot; were to make
&quot;presentations&quot; could help to reduce some of the skepticism to some degree.


However, it seems to me that it would be even better (and potentially more
doable) to demonstrate how the technology is actually being used on an
ongoing basis by a group of people pursuing an explicitly agreed-upon and
clearly documented objective (if not necessarily a fully developed strategic
plan).  

Are there any such &quot;success stories&quot; that we might be able to cite?  Better
yet, is there any chance that we ourselves might be able to create one?

I'm trying to use the common definitions of the words (since common  
definitions are useful to common understanding), and as I see it:

E-government is about making government data and processes more  
accessible to citizens. And to a lesser extent, allowing for more two- 
way communication in government bureaucracy decision-making.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government</A>

E-democracy is about using internet technologies in various democratic  
processes.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy</A>

While our efforts can fit under the umbrella of the term &quot;e- 
democracy,&quot; I think it is an unsuitable word simply because it means  
so many other things as well. A politician sending e-mails to get  
people to vote for her counts as e-democracy, and certainly has very  
little to do with our aims.

In any event, I don't see any conflict in a group presentation to the  
Gov 2.0 Expo. It just seems like a way to get our idea out to a much  
broader audience.

When I went to a series of conferences in Washington earlier this  
year, I saw a lot of people starting to understand a glimmer of the  
promise of collaborative governance, but most of them didn't have any  
belief that it could actually be made a reality. If people see a group  
of people presenting at a major conference all working on different  
systems toward that generally common end, I think they might begin to  
see that this is a real possibility.
