I'm not sure how I feel about this. I would avoid the term majority  
and say Democracy is the will of the people. But isn't it the will at  
this time? Not the will of the people after they have been coached and  
prodded.

If people don't care, they don't care. Their will is empty in that  
regard. Why should they have a substantive input into something they  
don't care about?

If other people think that more people should care about something...  
then use the other mechanisms of society to make your point. That is  
the whole idea behind issue advocacy groups (other than lobbying). Buy  
some TV time, or stage a protest or whatever.

But that's because people have no say in government. If people could  
actively participate in governance at any moment, they wouldn't have  
any right to complain about things they don't like. Instead, they  
could just jump in and fix it.

I also think that well-developed collaborative governance software  
will bring people into the deliberation process, instead of simply  
being a sounding board for whatever is on the top of their minds. And  
that is largely a function of clever website design. For example, look  
at how WhiteHouse 2 presents issues. I think it's a very good start  
for delving deeper.
