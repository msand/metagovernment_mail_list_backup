<PRE>Thanks Jacki,
I thought about it, and I reached the conclusion that the way to use Vil in
this context would be to either ask a different question (what should we
write here....?, for example), or run Vilfredo only for one generation.
Think about it, Each generation gives you the pareto front of the answers.
SO you are getting a set of answers that represent the community. That is
what YOU wanted to know: where are you now.
Then the genetic algorithm part of Vilfredo, the fact of feeding the answers
back, and getting people to write more, and so on, is more the part of the
algorithm that is trying to find a workable middle ground. But your question
was not about the middle ground, you were really asking our opinions. Not a
compromised point of view.

And all this suggests that maybe Vilfredo should include the option to let
the questioner close an answer before we reach a consensus, and define
himself as satisfied with the answer he received.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The question is specifically asking for responses (which is like
</I>&gt;<i> the 'propose an answer' phase of Vilfredo)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. The ultimate goal would be to develop a wiki page that summarizes
</I>&gt;<i> (lists the individual) answers in a way that represents the diversity
</I>&gt;<i> of responses accurately (this will be like the 'choose from responses'
</I>&gt;<i> phase, where the minimum set of responses satisfying everyone's
</I>&gt;<i> positions are chosen)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I perhaps didn't make the ultimate goal (#2, above) as explicit as I
</I>&gt;<i> should have, but I didn't want the eventual goal of 'synthesis' or
</I>&gt;<i> 'summary' to cloud the accuracy of the set of first responses.
