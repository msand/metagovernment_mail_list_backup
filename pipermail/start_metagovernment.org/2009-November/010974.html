Thank you!  I forgot about that.  I can edit someone else's proposal.
That's why it's like a wiki.

If my editing causes friction with the original proposers, it's no
problem.  I can simply copy the proposal (P) to a new proposal (Q),
and do my editing there.  So if we *ignore* the edit/vote phasing, we
have:

  (P)  (Q)  (R)
    \   |   /
     \  |  /    |  change flow
      \ | /     v
       \|/
       (A)

In this picture, we're editing a bunch of proposals (P, Q, R).  We're
creating changesets in the process.  These changesets either flow
downward into the act (A), or they do not.  Is the above an accurate
picture?

  A = <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/mul84q">http://tinyurl.com/mul84q</A>

Suppose A is &quot;America's Healthy Future Act&quot;, which is currently before
the U.S. congress.  Suppose it's not being decided by the senate, but
by the public via Candiwi.  How many proposals (P,Q,..*) would you
reasonably expect?

  N(proposals) = 10, 100, 1000 or ?

What is the maximum number of proposals (on average) that a new
participant could handle, and still make a useful contribution to the
process?

Another thing: Your home page says &quot;Candiwi is like a wiki, but you
can't edit the articles directly.&quot;  So A cannot be edited.  In fact,
there's nothing we can do with A, in itself.  So it really isn't a
part of the decision process.  It might as well be a statute on the
books, right?  It needn't actually be stored in Candiwi.

If that's true, the only problem that remains is how to decide among
these proposals, each of which is an alternative *replacement* for A:

  (P)  (Q)  (R)  ...  etc.

Why must these proposals be stored in Candiwi?  Why not in various
other wikis, scattered over the Web?

More important, what new facility does Candiwi provide to help people
in choosing among these various proposals?  (You will want to mention
this, on your home page.)
