</I>So obvioulsy the academic conference and those large conferences are
different beasts.
But before putting myself into writing a paper, is there a way to get some
news from them?
Maybe we should email them, and ask them as participants from the
metagovernment.

I mean, I think we are the biggest open group with those ideas. Tim O'Reilly
knows us (from your relation on twitter). We should be able to pull
something off their hood.

If we get something going after the 25th, I should also be able to send them
a video of my talk, which should convince them that there is some beef under
the Vilfredo smoke ;-).

ANd then of course Jim is by now a superstar...
and you are officially signed as trying to become a Tribe leader, or similar


Next thing we should apply is TED!
