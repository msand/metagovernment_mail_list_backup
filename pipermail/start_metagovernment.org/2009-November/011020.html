<PRE>Hi Ed,
I am VERY interested to participate to this call with Vilfredo.

I am very much time pressed right now. Tomorrow I will meet Giovani to
complete the writing of the book about the FP7 project. So please bear with
me while I think out loud:

My problem has been time issues recently, mostly because I have been
presenting Vilfredo in Southampton, I will present a grant proposal for it
on the 15th of december, and I should give a talk about it on the 23rd.

Just today I finally had a chance to test candiwi, and I felt ashamed on how
late I was.

I am not really sure how we should do this, since I am in Europe and the
presentation is in the US.
Right now the university will NOT fund any more trips for me, and I don't
feel like self funding a trip to the US.
But maybe if I look early enough I can find some not so costly flights?
Would they accept a video?
Would they fund a trip?

Said all this I think it is a REALLY important avenue. I know that I should
present Vilfredo now to a wider audience. I need to have feedbacks.

And it looks like the US is so much more advanced than Europe on e-gov that
this is the natural place.

On the other hand if I am paying my self a full trip to the US just for this
I probably will try to go for a whole presentation by myself. It is not just
the problem with Vilfredo. I am uncovering mathemathical relations about the
pareto front that has never been found (that I know of). And this need time
to be explained. But maybe this is not the correct avenue to present all
this...

Also Vilfredo is still not good  enough in terms of people using it. We
still need an experiment where the same people sticked to that all the time.
I am considering walking into a class and offer chocolate bars to whoever
plays the game with one question, seriously from start to end.

By the way, I presented in Southampton, and the people liked it. Jason (the
lecturer who invited me) was keen on using it himself and asked me where he
could use it. My suggestion was to run the following question:
&quot;how should this class be graded?&quot; And ask it to his next class.
This is a question where people are going to participate...

I said I was going to think out loud, sorry :-)

...
Pietro

&gt;<i> The Call for Proposals is out for the Gov 2.0 Expo to be held in
</I>&gt;<i> Washington, DC in May 2010, with a deadline for submissions of December 8.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I submitted a proposal to this last year, and did not make it in. I would
</I>&gt;<i> be happy to submit another solo presentation proposal and imagine individual
</I>&gt;<i> projects might want present; but I figure we would have a stronger case (and
</I>&gt;<i> a better presentation) if we submitted a group presentation proposal. And it
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense that collaborative governance be presented by a collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> group. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am suggesting is a 50-minute panel presentation where I (or someone)
</I>&gt;<i> give a brief 5-10 minute introduction to the idea of collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance, then where a member of each active project gives a 5-7 minute
</I>&gt;<i> overview of how their project works and what stage it is at at that time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is a tight timeframe, but I think if we could present all of the active
</I>&gt;<i> projects (particularly several non-American ones), we could really wow this
</I>&gt;<i> audience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my (early!) draft presentation proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In addition to needing input from other projects; the proposal as a whole
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be more persuasive to the selection panel.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I *think* they pay travel expenses for presenters, if that helps your
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making process. :)
