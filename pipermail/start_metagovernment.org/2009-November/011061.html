What most projects here are considering is polling of absolutely  
everyone who wants to participate, and developing consensus out of an  
ensuing deliberative process, managed by software engineered for the  
task.

I also want to note here that Joshua is pointing out a possibility of  
confusion in the term Collaborative Governance. I hadn't thought of it  
when suggesting it in the Vilfredo process, but it turns out that  
collaborative governance generally refers to a much broader scope of  
possibilities than what we are using it to mean. See:
