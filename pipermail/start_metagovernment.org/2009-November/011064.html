<PRE>Believe it or not, having worked on Capitol Hill in 1975, I'd have said, no,
I am not familiar with the Public Affairs Act. (While I haven't kept it
up-to-date lately, a list of laws and policies of particular interest to me
is available at <A HREF="http://ambur.net/laws&amp;policies.htm">http://ambur.net/laws&amp;policies.htm</A>) 

However, the point of the article you cite is well-taken:  &quot;We have grown
used to cavalierly expressing 'non-attitudes' rather than thinking through
possible choices or imagining better alternatives.&quot;

The point about alternatives resonates with me since I am a &quot;fan&quot; of Robyn
Dawes' views on &quot;everyday irrationality&quot;:
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/irrationality.pdf">http://ambur.net/irrationality.pdf</A>  Gary Klein's views on decision-making in
naturalistic settings are also highly relevant: <A HREF="http://ambur.net/rpd.pdf">http://ambur.net/rpd.pdf</A> 

I have no doubt that deliberative polling produces much better results than
other types of &quot;polling.&quot;  However, I am still more interested in what we
can actually *do* by working directly together than in what we might wish to
force others to do, &quot;deliberatively&quot; or otherwise.  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/oz.pdf">http://ambur.net/oz.pdf</A>

There is polling where you call a bunch of people on the phone (or mail 
out surveys) and people respond off the top of their head without 
thinking about the issue deeply. Then there is deliberative polling 
where you select a random sample of more than 100 people, bring them 
together, deliberative on an issue with expert testimony, and come to 
some kind of conclusion. The two processes have some commonality in name 
(&quot;poll&quot;), but produce vastly different kinds of results.

You are all familiar with the Public Affairs Act of 1975, right?
