You've just hit on a major conundrum of political science: reconciling 
the simultaneous needs for the &quot;best solution&quot; and popular legitimacy. 
Ideally, they're congruent. In practice, until the chosen action has 
unfolded, we can never know whether the choices of dispassionate experts 
(or people presumably made expert by their dispassion) will overlap with 
what the citizenry might have expressly demanded if given the opportunity.

My own approach has been to develop a method that can:

1) Scale to help as many people participate as possible, recognizing 
that the passionately self-selected ones will of course be among the 
first to show up;

2) Channel participants into deliberative subgroups to ensure that 
everyone who has something to say will get vetted by a minimum number of 
peers in exchange for the responsibility of vetting others, and;

3) Advance the most popular and &quot;best&quot; ideas through a process of 
Coalescent Bubbling (So far I've only been able to build a primitive 
demo piece of the 3rd element, but I haven't given up).

Human culture embeds generations of trial and error. Politics is about 
managed competition, and rights emerge from recognition of demands and 
expectations.

Bias among political agents is at the core of the human of the human 
condition. Since we are and always will be political agents, we should 
thank our lucky stars for Montesquieu and the attention given to his 
writings on the separation of powers.
