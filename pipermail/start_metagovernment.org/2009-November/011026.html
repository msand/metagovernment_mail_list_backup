Hmm not really. In my experience the best way is to have a slow organic
growth, where you slowly adapt to the increased requests of the people.
Having  a huge publicity, before time can be counter productive, with people
coming, checking out the site, and then leaving dissatisfied. And then never
coming back again...

This is the reason why some people chose to avoid any publicity unless some
level of usage is possible.

Look at my next answer to Jacki for an example.

By May of next year, I think many of the Active projects will be at a level
&gt;<i> where they are ready to get this level of exposure. But... we have to have

</I>&gt;<i> there's nothing to lose by putting your name on the list of presenters. You

</I>You are welcome to present Vilfredo. I will give the presentation on the 25,
and make a video of my presentation. But I do ask you to look at my
presentation before enough to really understand the concept of pareto front
before describing the work.

Most people do not get it. But I made it really clear in the presentation.

We can also make a small video/screencast that you present there. Something
that only covers the time for Vilfredo as a project.

Also, is Jim happy to be presented among us? His work is much more
succesful, and I would expect him to present it in his own personal
presentation.
