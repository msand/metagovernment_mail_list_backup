I think this speaks to a general problem among all governance software  
projects: how to get people coming back such that the process has  
enough participation and thought to be meaningful.

My feeling is that the only sure answer here is that the software has  
to be meaningful in itself. That is, it has to have real-world effects.

What is really needed is for an outside group to adopt one of our  
projects (or a combination of them) as their actual governance  
mechanism.

The only problem is that none of our projects is ready for that. Even  
White House 2, with its superb interface and thousands of users, has  
no internal mechanism for acting as an actual decision-maker. (Nor can  
it anyway, since its thousands of users come from it having a US-wide  
scope: a realm where it is not likely to become the dominant decision- 
making mechanism for quite a while.)

What projects need now is to be raised to a point of readiness where  
they can be adopted by very small organizations willing to be governed  
by software which admittedly will still be in beta.
