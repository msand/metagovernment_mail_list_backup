<PRE>Thanks Jackie,
that looks like a great idea.

The problem I can see is that the proposals include some html, and we use a
table to divide the proposals.
But my understanding so we might still need the email client to be able to
read html.
Or the proposals might arrive as a mess.

In any case it is not really a problem. Looking at how the wall of text is
going, itr seem that the community is moving toward the idea to have an
abstract of a proposal. Maybe we can just have the abstract to be all in txt
format. And then we only send the abstract.

In any case I don't want to take away from you the pleasure to find
solutions to those little difficulties. I reserve only the right to raise an
alarm flag if the new part of the program risk to break up the math side of
the algorithm, or the privacy side of the system.

Also I would suggest that users might have to have to turn on the
possibility to vote via email. In this way they would get warned that it is
sperimental (at least until it IS sperimental :-)  ).

WOuld this be acceptable?

P.S. you are absolutely welcome to build a tool for wave using the pareto
front idea. But I would suggest to start with the email one.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, imagine we built an application for wave that did X ... ?? It

</I>&gt;<i> login-via-facebook).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is becoming a bit of a ramble, but I do think there is
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity here in the Wave-space to make a real impression ...
</I>&gt;<i> because :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) There is interest in seeing Wave's potential
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It will likely get a lot of press coverage -- tech blogs &amp; the like
</I>&gt;<i> will comment on implementations, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Right now, there isn't much competition
</I>&gt;<i> 4) New users (new invitees) who join wave will think .. &quot;what can I do
</I>&gt;<i> with this?&quot;. they won't have a lot of friends on wave yet, and so they
</I>&gt;<i> may begin to explore applications ..  if one of our apps is among the
</I>&gt;<i> 5 listed, that gives us incredible exposure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could (stressing 'could' as opposed to 'will' ) very easily
</I>&gt;<i> become the next iPhone App store, where the early apps got a lot more
