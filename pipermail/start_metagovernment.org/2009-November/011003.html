<PRE>There is no 'glimmer of the promise' without the work of academics and
engineers.
I see the aims of political &lt;-&gt; entrepreneurial as interdependent, but
both are dependent on the academic and the engineer.
That said, entrepreneurs can leverage the political motivations of the
masses to fund the work of academics and engineers.
Where all four exist, there is a confluence of interests and potential
for real positive feedback.
I would argue that these four interests are not *always* compatible.
But when they are, there's potential for real change.

But Michael's distinction leads to the question of whether Gov 2.0 is
the right forum for one/several of these interests -- looking at their
site, it's as much a forum for the engineer as for the politician.

Here's their pitch (<A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/cfp/82">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/cfp/82</A>) :

&gt;<i> If you&#8217;re passionate about the power of the Web and how it can be leveraged to create greater transparency, participation, and collaboration between government and citizenry, share your knowledge and insights with your peers at Gov 2.0 Expo.
</I>
&gt;<i> Our speakers reflect our audience, so we&#8217;re looking for independents, startups, enterprises, and everyone in between, in a wide variety of industries. We&#8217;re also looking for new thinking.
</I>
Metagov is relevant to two of their 6 major interests:
&quot;Government-Citizen Interactions&quot; and &quot;Small Entities as Laboratories&quot;

So, it seems applicable to me.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a political aim. &#160;You're looking for solidarity, where people

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can't fault you for expecting that others - entrepreneurs, academics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and engineers - ought to share that dream and pull together in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acheiving it. &#160;I can't fault you because I make the same mistake in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> regard to my own ambitions. &#160;I expect that politicians like you, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entrepreneurs (like Jim and Craig) and academics (like Pietro and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Giovanni) ought to lend a hand in developing an open technology.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still, I'm even more naive, because I see all this and here I am,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writing it down - that the politician dreams of building consensus,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the entrepreneur of building enterprise, the academic of career and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the engineer of machines - yet *still* I cannot see why these are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incompatible.'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, does this mean you are or are not interested in proposing a group
</I>&gt;<i> presentation? I guess you may be right that my aim in proposing it is
</I>&gt;<i> political: but a project which doesn't even try to interact with the outside
</I>&gt;<i> world is somewhat scary. At some point we need to invite the rest of the
</I>&gt;<i> world to play on our toys. I think Jim has a great point that building a
</I>&gt;<i> usability-oriented system is a great way to bring people in... but at some
</I>&gt;<i> point advertising (of whatever kind) is also necessary to enter the general
</I>&gt;<i> public consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I have to admit I'm a bit bemused at being called a politician. I guess
</I>&gt;<i> I get it; but that is exactly the group of people I want to make obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> (Or I guess you could put another way: I'd like to see everyone be able to
</I>&gt;<i> be a politician any time they want.)
