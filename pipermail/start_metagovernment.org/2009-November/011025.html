<PRE>I'm happy to be on the list as a collaborator, though at this point I think
it's unlikely I'll fly out to DC for the event.  While the publicity from
the conference could only be positive, my experience has been that the more
local someone is, and the more vested their interest, the more likely they
are to make a meaningful contribution to our effort.

I'm optimistic that we'll see further progress with our software in 2010,
though I agree with Jim that the biggest challenge is getting users.
 
I understand your and Jim's stance that making your systems very usable is a
great way to increase usership. But isn't publicity also a good way to get
more people involved?
 
That is one of my core motivations in proposing to the Gov2Expo. It isn't a
perfect venue for us, but it would put us in front of a wide variety of
people, many of whom are very active in the press and/or social media.
 
By May of next year, I think many of the Active projects will be at a level
where they are ready to get this level of exposure. But... we have to have
the proposal submitted by December 10. I am quite willing to lead the
proposal effort, and honestly even if I present alone, I am going to promote
each Active Project individually unless explicitly told not to. So...
there's nothing to lose by putting your name on the list of presenters. You
can always back out later if you don't like the way it is turning out.
