I understand your and Jim's stance that making your systems very  
usable is a great way to increase usership. But isn't publicity also a  
good way to get more people involved?

That is one of my core motivations in proposing to the Gov2Expo. It  
isn't a perfect venue for us, but it would put us in front of a wide  
variety of people, many of whom are very active in the press and/or  
social media.

By May of next year, I think many of the Active projects will be at a  
level where they are ready to get this level of exposure. But... we  
have to have the proposal submitted by December 10. I am quite willing  
to lead the proposal effort, and honestly even if I present alone, I  
am going to promote each Active Project individually unless explicitly  
told not to. So... there's nothing to lose by putting your name on the  
list of presenters. You can always back out later if you don't like  
the way it is turning out.
