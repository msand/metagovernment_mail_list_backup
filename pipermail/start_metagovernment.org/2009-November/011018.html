Note that Oregon is also the home of DemocracyLab, and that there is  
an active, state-wide instance there:

Though it is a commercial enterprise, you may be interested in looking  
at the format of DebateWise.
<A HREF="http://debatewise.com/">http://debatewise.com/</A>

It is an experts-debate system which uses a rather accessible format:  
arguments are broken down into major issues; then experts' views are  
presented next to each other on each issue. They don't attempt further  
complexity because... it's easier to read this way. People can vote on  
a 9-point sliding scale on each issue, indicating levels of dis/ 
agreement with both sides (though that leaves absolutely no room for  
synthesis).
