<PRE>The Call for Proposals is out for the Gov 2.0 Expo to be held in  
Washington, DC in May 2010, with a deadline for submissions of  
December 8.
<A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010</A>

I submitted a proposal to this last year, and did not make it in. I  
would be happy to submit another solo presentation proposal and  
imagine individual projects might want present; but I figure we would  
have a stronger case (and a better presentation) if we submitted a  
group presentation proposal. And it makes sense that collaborative  
governance be presented by a collaborative group. :)

What I am suggesting is a 50-minute panel presentation where I (or  
someone) give a brief 5-10 minute introduction to the idea of  
collaborative governance, then where a member of each active project  
gives a 5-7 minute overview of how their project works and what stage  
it is at at that time.

It is a tight timeframe, but I think if we could present all of the  
active projects (particularly several non-American ones), we could  
really wow this audience.

Here is my (early!) draft presentation proposal:

In addition to needing input from other projects; the proposal as a  
whole needs to be more persuasive to the selection panel.

What do you think?

P.S. I *think* they pay travel expenses for presenters, if that helps  
your decision-making process. :)
