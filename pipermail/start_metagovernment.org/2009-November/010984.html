I would disagree that e-dem and e-gov are in opposite domains, also with the notion that there isn't much hope or opportunity for collaboration.

E-gov will *never* and could never be effective in the aims it (at least within this group) currently has. Unless there is an engaged and participatory set of citizens, at least 30-80%.

E-gov does not aim (afaik) to move the existing system 'online', without changing it. I would argue that step 1 to e-gov IS e-dem. And, for myself, I remain very positive about the benefits of e-dem, as a potential to engage citizens.  But skeptical of the possibilities of e-gov mainly due to unlikely rates of participation and citizen engagement.

I also feel that, where e-dem effectively simulates an e-gov-like system, (analogous to the way WH2 says 'pretend you're in the white house, what would you do?'), it is more likely to engage citizens and promote responsible participation. Witness the flood (overload) of marijuana legalization supporters who basically drowned out any other voice during Obama's first open, online e-town hall meeting. Is this the way YOU would act if you were in the white house? And, if this were the way our system ACTUALLY governed itself, would not more people with a diversity of interests participate?

I think a premiss of e-gov advocates is that people will behave more responsibly &amp; perhaps consider broader public rather than personal good or special issues if they have more responsibility and ability to effect real change. It remains to be seen, but herein lies a potential overlap of goals, aims, and perhaps some genuine opportunities for collaboration, if not just learning from others's mistakes.

I'd be curious to know, does the current mission statement of Metagov favor e-gov to the exclusion of e-dem? I don't know about others on the list, but I would like to see metagov encompass both.

It finally occurs to me, we're in opposite domains.  There isn't much
hope of technical collaboration between e-dem and e-gov - not even a
grassroots e-gov. ;)

&gt;<i> Here is my (early!) draft presentation proposal:

</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
For my part, I think the goal is wrong.  It doesn't matter what
technical domain we're in.  We won't get a healthy society by &quot;bluring
or removing the distinction between citizens and officials&quot;.  People
ought to speak for and represent themselves - not as parts of an
all-encompassing bureaucracy - but as people.

Spare a thought too, for the bureaucracy. ;) At the end of the day, it
still has to *be* a bureaucracy.  It doesn't want us moving into its
offices, any more than we want it moving into our homes.
