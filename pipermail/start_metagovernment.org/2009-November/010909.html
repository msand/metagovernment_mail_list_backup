Ed, you're fired!  You're a terrible alpha tester. ;)  It took you 23
days to ask the first question, and Thomas had already answered it:

On October 2, Thomas von der Elbe wrote:

</I>
Admittedly the UI isn't quite self-explanatory.  We're still in alpha,
and it's pretty rough.

You're currently the leading candidate, with
all 3 votes.  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?p=MetaGov">http://t.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollspace/?p=MetaGov</A>

Pardon the general slowness.  We're just about to start optimizing.

Yes.  Thomas offered an alternate in his first post:
&gt;<i> I voted for Ed because I like the conference plan that he posted in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov-wiki. But I thought it needed a few changes. So I posted this 
</I>&gt;<i> revised plan:

</I>
For a list of all the variant proposals, see here:

You probably found it, by now.  Here it is:

While you're editing, recall that Thomas is asking for a postponement
of the conference date (see above).  If you don't see it immediately,
you'll understand what prompted us to look at text diffs.  Ideally I'd
just paste a URL here, showing the diff between his text and yours.
Then you'd know exactly what he and his voters (your voters) wanted.

&gt;<i> (And this is another reason why I think it would be great to have 
</I>&gt;<i> expositions on the Metagov list. We could all have a better idea of how to 
</I>&gt;<i> interact with each others' systems that way.)
</I>
I've proposed that we look for something of more permanence than
one-off events:  <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/MetaGov">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/MetaGov</A>
