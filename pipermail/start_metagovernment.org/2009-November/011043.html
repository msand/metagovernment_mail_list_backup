Pietro, I haven't had a chance to discuss your very interesting
project (I am published in Genetic Algorithms myself).  --but I
haven't the time or the proper forum in which to really speak with you
about it all.

That being said, that while I have myself considered the idea of
&quot;non-endorsement&quot; as sufficient for the evolution of good solutions
and just allow the endorsed proposals to advance forward (a sort of
nice, polite way to advance debate), I have since changed that view
and now see that allowing a (negative) vote *against* a proposal adds
a significant amount of information (in the Baysian, mathematical
sense) that is much more than merely &quot;not interested&quot;.  In other
words, there is a significant contribution in allowing the user to
express and disambiguate between a feeling of merely &quot;not interested&quot;
and an &quot;active DENIAL&quot;--three valued logic being more powerful for
quicker and more accurate convergence (partly also due to the greater
participation because individuals feel that they are able to express
their feelings more completely/accurately).

Anyway, I look forward to a thumbs-up/thumbs-down voting system that
allows drilling down into the fine-grains of an issue to express
arbitrary levels of precision within the system of feedback (part of
which I have added to the proposals in the Wall of Text question).
This also would address some of the concern that negative voting would
otherwise simply devolve into brutish mudslinging diatribes.  The
details of such a system I would love to dialog about, but email seems
to make way too cumbersome.  I believe this system could SO advance
and complete the whole wiki concept and would not be difficult to
integrate into the mediawiki software.  I feel this would be better
than developing a separate candiwi system....

(BTW, I would be interested in experimenting with Google Wave and
wonder if you guys have considered moving this list over to it....?)

Apologies also to everyone else on the list, as a I know I have barely
introduced myself while making a lot of additions to the wiki over the
past several months, but this issue of governance is important to me
and I have had a lot of stuff I needed to get out just in order to
function without getting into a serious hysterical  fit about it all.
It's crazy man....

Cheers!

marcos
