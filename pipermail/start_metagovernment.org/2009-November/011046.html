<PRE>Hi Marcos,
welcome to a fellow GA person.

Let me answer your points, one by one, inline:


Sent from Rome, RM, Italy

2009/11/20 Mark Janssen &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">stalkingtime at gmail.com</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> &gt; Right now I am travelling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In the next days I shall answer more thoroughly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The pareto front can be done with any type of ranking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Right now when you ignore something, that is in effect saying that you
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not accept that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each person has veto power, by ignoring a solution (and voting on at
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one of the other).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro, I haven't had a chance to discuss your very interesting
</I>&gt;<i> project (I am published in Genetic Algorithms myself).  --but I
</I>&gt;<i> haven't the time or the proper forum in which to really speak with you
</I>&gt;<i> about it all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That being said, that while I have myself considered the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;non-endorsement&quot; as sufficient for the evolution of good solutions
</I>&gt;<i> and just allow the endorsed proposals to advance forward (a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> nice, polite way to advance debate), I have since changed that view
</I>&gt;<i> and now see that allowing a (negative) vote *against* a proposal adds
</I>&gt;<i> a significant amount of information (in the Baysian, mathematical
</I>&gt;<i> sense) that is much more than merely &quot;not interested&quot;.
</I>

Marcos, the only thing that I need to know is how many dimension are the
informations from the voting.

If it is a one dimension, I would need to code a dominant function such that
endorse dominates ignore
ignore dominates oppose.

If this is the case, then yes, there is more information. But then why stop
at 3, move it to 4, move it to n, order them all (A, B, ..., N) (I rather
have this A, than B, B than ..., ... than N). You can even give to each a
continuous  value. Just let people move a sliding rule for each element, and
let them go with their gut feelings. All this works well in terms of pareto
front. And I do not exude to add it at some point. The only problem about
this is that the more valuse people have to chose from the more inconsistent
they will be in their choise. The more hard will be for the function to
converge. SO adding possibilities will not make them easier to converge, but
harder. As I said, I don't rule out the possibility to add this in future.
But I don't want to impose what mathematically I see as an inferior system
to anyone, so it will have to be a choise from the questioner.

A totally different idea is if the ignore, not ignore &amp; approve, not ignore
&amp; oppose possibilites represent elements in a 2 dimensional plane.

In this case I am not sure how would I have to set up the domination
function.

Sure thing
not ignore &amp; approve dominates not ignore &amp; oppose.
But how do those relate to the ignore part?

If you have two questions, and everybody approve the first, and you ignore
the second, does this mean that the first dominate the second, and the
second should be lost?
What if instead everybody opposes the first and ignores the second, whould
we now keep the second?

Because if both those are true, we are back at the unidimensional case, and
you can as well ask people to rate things with 1 star, 2 stars or 3 stars.

And if those are not true, I woudl like you to explicitly tell me how should
I handl those cases.

In maths,
Pietro




&gt;<i>  In other
</I>&gt;<i> words, there is a significant contribution in allowing the user to
</I>&gt;<i> express and disambiguate between a feeling of merely &quot;not interested&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and an &quot;active DENIAL&quot;--three valued logic being more powerful for
</I>&gt;<i> quicker and more accurate convergence (partly also due to the greater
</I>&gt;<i> participation because individuals feel that they are able to express
</I>&gt;<i> their feelings more completely/accurately).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>






&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I look forward to a thumbs-up/thumbs-down voting system that
</I>&gt;<i> allows drilling down into the fine-grains of an issue to express
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary levels of precision within the system of feedback (part of
</I>&gt;<i> which I have added to the proposals in the Wall of Text question).
</I>&gt;<i> This also would address some of the concern that negative voting would
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise simply devolve into brutish mudslinging diatribes.  The
</I>&gt;<i> details of such a system I would love to dialog about, but email seems
</I>&gt;<i> to make way too cumbersome.  I believe this system could SO advance
</I>&gt;<i> and complete the whole wiki concept and would not be difficult to
</I>&gt;<i> integrate into the mediawiki software.  I feel this would be better
</I>&gt;<i> than developing a separate candiwi system....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We have space for both.
Vilfredo needs its testing ground. When the tools developed from Vilfredo
will be tested enough, we might see them re-used in multiple sites.
And on the other side I prefer not to have the weight of being the main
developer of the official tool from metagovernment. This gives me some
freedom to make sure what we do is mathematically meaningful. I keep on
seeing site with math blunders in them, and it stops them from achieving
their full greatness. An example? delicious should use the symbols +,*, (,
), to permit union, and intersection of tags. With * being the intersection.
When I suggested it it was already too late.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (BTW, I would be interested in experimenting with Google Wave and
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if you guys have considered moving this list over to it....?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
we have a wiki wave on vilfredo, if you are interested in going there. tell
me your google wave account name.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apologies also to everyone else on the list, as a I know I have barely
</I>&gt;<i> introduced myself while making a lot of additions to the wiki over the
</I>&gt;<i> past several months, but this issue of governance is important to me
</I>&gt;<i> and I have had a lot of stuff I needed to get out just in order to
</I>&gt;<i> function without getting into a serious hysterical  fit about it all.
</I>&gt;<i> It's crazy man....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers!
</I>&gt;<i>
