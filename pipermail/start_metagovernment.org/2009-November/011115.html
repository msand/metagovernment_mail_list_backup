Yes, both you and Pietro are right that this particular question  
should be of particular interest to this community. What we are seeing  
here is (I believe) a reflection of two things...

First, this community is smaller than the number of members of the  
list server. Actual participation in any particular thread is usually  
by just a handful of people. Reaching critical mass with a group that  
small is somewhat difficult, especially when we are all essentially  
volunteers.

More significantly... people in general are much more passionate about  
things like football and celebrities than they are about more arcane  
subjects such as developing governance software. The simple fact is  
that almost everyone spends a lot more brain-time on subjects such as  
entertainment and hobbies than they do on &quot;important&quot; things.

Rather than trying to fight this trend, I think we could be better  
served by flowing with it: by getting one/some of out softwares  
implemented as the governance system (or a guidance tool for  
governance) of a celebrity fan club or a softball team or... something  
regular people actually spend a lot of time thinking about.
