It's not that simple. Many people won't care about an issue before they 
are selected for a deliberative poll. However, once selected, they will 
likely start to care about the issue due to being informed that what 
they will decide on the issue will have real consequences on political 
policy.

I am not convinced that your way of looking at things is accurate.

How so? For a credible deliberative poll, all interested stakeholders 
should have been given the opportunity to present their case to the 
randomly selected panel of citizens. Perhaps individual stakehodlers 
will be left out of the deliberations, but normally no serious position 
on the issue of question will be omitted.
