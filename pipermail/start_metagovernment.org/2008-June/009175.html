<PRE>At last, I finished! It took me time but I learned a lot. Before go on
I must anticipate something: the long of this mail! Although it's
worth reading since shows the particular point of view of someone who
revised the entire archive in a different temporal scale. This is what
I saw:

(Disclaimer: Here comes a critical review. Please don't take it bad,
it's constructive.)

Many ideas were discussed, I found them unconnected and I think this
is natural since there isn't team focus. Every one came with its very
own inquietudes, which indeed were discussed by almost all; in few
cases an implicit conclusion were produced and only in one an explicit
one (a resolution). The proposals without conclusions were left in the
way, so now they must be resuscitated.

We should try to stick to Ed's task list and delegate on him the
selection of discussion topics. I say this because I'm sure he has
been thinking in the project for &#8226;at least&#8226; one year, let's not
misheard him. We could call this way of debating &quot;Main Discussion
Mode&quot; &#8212;a way that will help us achieve one-direction aiming&#8212; and at
the same time give place to the &quot;Secondary Discussion Mode&quot;, where new
ideas are posted and briefly discussed, so they don't decay in
forgiveness while set aside to gain concentration in pertinent topics.
Note that Ed would be able to pick a topic from SDM to MDM if it gets
important, and viceversa. This organization may boost resolution
production.

Metagovernment is so vast that is hard to point where to start
working, we need a seed. (Another reason that explains the
unconnectness of ideas.) I've read this before but I'll recall it (the
dog food!): a program that resolves our small necessities &#8226;is a seed&#8226;
and a manageable subject for our ~10 people crew. There's no need to
invert time talking about land jurisdiction, &#8226;now&#8226;. Our high priority
issue? The wiki is open so new members are expected, the program will
have to permit 100 users (?) get along and take decisions. (Question
to Manuel and Aur: Is it this what you are developing?). Grow the seed
up and you will see a little tree pointing out a direction. Latter it
will show  its branches &#8212;more directions&#8212;... pruning is easier than
inventing them. At the meantime more and more people should be
participating, perfect for forming teams that follow branches; here
the one-direction mode is &quot;abandoned&quot;. One more thing to add here. I
believe in committee-design, how else would I contribute with
Metascore if I don't know programming?

I feel very comfortable with the mailing list (plus Gmail's tagging
and conversation merging), but for this project a forum would have
organized (and stored) our ideas better. For example, if I, a recent
member, want to say something about an old topic I should send a very
offtopic mail to the list. Since recently we've decided moving to a
forum I'd like to suggest &#8226;Vanilla&#8226; too. (Reasons: Aesthetic and
simplicity. Despite phpBB has over Vanilla image attachment. What do
you say Rob?)

Well... I'm over.

Amazing work has been done during the last 3 months, congratulations!
The archive is very valuable. Always there are things to improve, I
don't want to be rude with these recommendations.

I'll leave with some practical questions. How to adapt forum polls to
Apache-like scoring? May a user change his poll vote after discussion
evolves?

Saludos!
Mat&#237;as
