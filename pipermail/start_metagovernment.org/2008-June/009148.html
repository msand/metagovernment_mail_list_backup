<PRE>As was decided at the IRC meeting, I have made a page on the wiki  
describing the reasons for and issues around forming a nonprofit  
organization to handle some of the tasks of the Metagovernment and  
possibly Metascore projects:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>

Please review this page and add to it or reply here with comments. The  
most immediate issue (given that you think an organization is needed  
in the first place) is what nation to organize in, and as what kind of  
organization. If you have past experience with forming non- 
governmental organizations, please help here.

Also, could individuals please comment on your status in relationship  
to this project? Are you working on independent aspects of the  
project, or are you waiting for more input from the list, or are you  
simply too busy right now to do anything?

My status is that I am not currently traveling, but still have limited  
time for the next month. I am working on getting the wiki published  
(but really need other people to be active on it), and on forming the  
organization mentioned above.
