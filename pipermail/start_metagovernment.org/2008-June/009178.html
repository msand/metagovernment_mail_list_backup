I believe the best way to move forward with the ideas developed in the  
list server would be to start transcribing them into the wiki. I  
started with the Scoring system and Adhocracy articles, but have not  
had time to work on a few of the others I had intended.

I will add some more as I find time, but anyone can do it... Just look  
at an old thread, and make the most obvious 1-2 word page that  
describes one of the concepts there. (We can always move the page  
later if we want.) Some threads may result in multiple articles; other  
threads may simply contribute one section to an existing article.

When making an article, just be as &quot;encyclopedic&quot; as possible. That  
is, you can describe your own view, but should also include the views  
of others, as dispassionately as you can. This is what I was trying to  
do in this section, for example:
