<PRE>Greetings and welcome. A few to-the-point responses:

We have seeds. The mailing list with hand-implemented rules for
resolution, the wiki with same, the repo with the rules I give in my
design document... For v0, we can implement the &quot;mechanics&quot; of
discussion by hand, no need to write software to keep score.

Slowly we'll develop software to help with scorekeeping until it
becomes 100% implemented in software, and that's v1.
&gt;<i> I

</I>
You would offer suggestions and we'd consider them.

The bad property of committee design is divided authority, not divided
creativity.
