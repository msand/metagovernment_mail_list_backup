<PRE>&gt;<i> Manuel, I notice that you continue to develop your repository. Are you
</I>&gt;<i> getting and/or do you need more input from other members of the group?
</I>
It's basically a CRUD application at this point so it's not that
complicated, kinda boring though and I'm not a webdesigner, so it
doesn't look much at this point. Any help would be greatly
appreciated!

The current software stack I'm using is python + django + PosgreSQL
and of course xhtml + css, later probably javascript but not atm.

As far as specifications are concerned, I have a fairly good idea of
what the code could look like, but this is my first larger project
with django and python so I don't claim to know the best approach.

Here is a very rough (dated) outline of the system:
<A HREF="http://freehg.org/u/mbarkhau/metascore/file/527204955e70/prototypeA/doc/outline.txt">http://freehg.org/u/mbarkhau/metascore/file/527204955e70/prototypeA/doc/outline.txt</A>

I would love a more detailed discussion with about the architecture,
maybe we can flesh out a specification in that process. But as long as
the developers are in sync, I don't have a problem with an iterative
approach either.

&gt;<i> Personally, I think we need some more work on the concept of how
</I>&gt;<i> communities will interact with each other
</I>
Well I'm going one step at a time, the server focused approach isn't
ideal for multiple communities with their own installations of the
software. In each specific installation, there can be a group, which
is basically just a specific tag
for a member but thats about it. An interface between installations is
conceivable, but probably not trivial. In any case, a system with
absolutely no community functions would be useful for many people, so
I'm putting that off for the moment.

Ed, could we set up something on the metascore.org server? There isn't much
to show but it will eventually go up somewhere and they do say: &quot;release
early, release often&quot;.

ciao
Manuel
