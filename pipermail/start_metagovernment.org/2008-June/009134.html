<PRE>Draft minutes of Meeting 1 are posted on the wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1/Minutes">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/1/Minutes</A>
I still have some fleshing-out to do on it, but do not have time at  
the moment.

Some further points of discussion...

1. It was suggested that we move from the list server to the (or a)  
bulletin board, but not that we maintain both. Until such time as  
there is impetus to move to the BB, we should try to keep  
conversations here. But... is there now a general desire to move to  
the BB?

2. In any event, please use the wiki whenever possible, as it is the  
most collaborative mechanism we have. Specifically, Aur and Manuel,  
can you please post brief descriptions of your visions of Metascore on  
one or both of these pages?
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Repositories">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Repositories</A>
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Metascore</A>

3. I proposed starting a non-profit or other institution, but found  
little support in the meeting. So I am going to propose it on the wiki  
and then ask this list for their input on my proposal.

4. Next meeting. Despite only three people attending; I think we  
should have further meetings, perhaps once every month. Could we agree  
on a day of the week that tends to work for people? Was Saturday not a  
good choice?
