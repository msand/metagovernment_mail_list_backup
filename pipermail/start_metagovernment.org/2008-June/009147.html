<PRE>These are great Ed thanks.
I'll publish the complete list to a page on the wiki over the next few days and let everyone know where to find it.

I need a few more to get something moving.
All that is needed is a list of the key problems this project seeks to address, each expressed as a single sentence.
Note - a slight change of emphasis from &quot;problems you feel we currently face in achieving Government of, by, and for the people&quot; to &quot;problems in our current system which we intend will be addressed by us achieving our goal of Government of, by, and for the people&quot;.


As a side note, might I ask that you publish the current list on the wiki? That way others could look it over and add to it more readily.




Problems with representative democracy:
(particularly within the United States, as that is my largest area of familiarity)


- Citizens get no direct say on any particular issue, instead being forced to support a platform and/or candidate.


- People who may have a great idea for resolving an issue may not be willing/able to put in the tremendous effort needed to make their voice possibly be heard.


- Many (often critical) issues are completely ignored when candidates for an office do not disagree over them. The option of voting for one candidate or another does not provide any recourse for citizens wishing to address that issue.


- Participation is trivialized. Voting seems like a meaningless act, sometimes being at best the barest expression of a general sentiment summarized by exit polls. The word &quot;democracy&quot; does not seem to be fulfilled by that once-every-couple-years, ten-minute act of choosing from a handful of unfamiliar people (who then are granted sweeping power over your life).


- People who do have a say on any issue are not necessarily the best people for the job, and frequently are corrupt and/or are actively working for interests at odds with the rest of society.


- Since there are leaders who have power, there is always the threat of the leaders dispensing with the democracy.


- There are always artificial limits to participation. Often even in the most &quot;open&quot; democracies, defined groups (such as children, non-citizens, and criminals) are not given any voice.




Problems with direct democracy:


- There are simply too many issues on too many levels for everyone to be able to track and participate in them all.


- Giving everyone an equal say on everything can lead to mob rule. A seasoned expert on an issue has the same voice as someone completely ignorant on the issue. Since the latter will almost always outnumber the former, decisions are never intelligently made.




Problems with consensus decision making:


- It can be difficult to define a quorum (and thus to define a consensus) within an open community.


- It can be difficult to build a consensus on heated political issues.




Problems with current governmental structures:


- Multiple layers of government (community, township, city, county, metro, province, region, nation, multinational organization) sometimes can be overly burdensome and/or contradictory.


- All governments are focused on geography. As society moves further onto the internet, this becomes increasingly impractical. (As an important side-note, geographic governments also might be a necessary factor for war. If governments become more divorced from geography, they may find it unnecessary -- or even logistically impossible -- to conduct military actions against each other.)


- People who do not live within a particular region may nonetheless be severely impacted by actions taken within that region; yet they usually have absolutely no say in the law-making within that region because they are not residents there. (Their typical recourse, then, is war or terrorism.)


- All governments give power to specific individuals, all of whom are naturally tempted toward corruption.


- Frequently, governments see a need to hide their actions from the citizenry. At times, this may serve national interests, but it is also a wide gateway for corruption: allowing the leaders to take self-serving actions which may not be of benefit to the citizenry.
