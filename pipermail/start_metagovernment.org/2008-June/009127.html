<PRE>Thanks Manuel and Aur for your excellent responses.
I need a few more to get something moving.
All that is needed is a list of the key problems this project seeks to address, each expressed as a single sentence.
Note - a slight change of emphasis from &quot;problems you feel we currently face in achieving Government of, by, and for the people&quot; to &quot;problems in our current system which we intend will be addressed by us achieving our goal of Government of, by, and for the people&quot;.
Thanks,
Paul

Subject : [Start] What problems are we facing in achieving government of, by,and for the people? - response please


I come across many organisations who want to make improvements (at least they say they do) but for a number of reasons they can't, or don't, and I often have to help them.
A number of factors prevent them but I have found that throughout all of these, several things are common:

* there is not enough attention paid to understanding the problem that is being addressed (therefore any efforts to improve the situation are likely to miss the point, sometimes spectacularly)
* efforts are spread too thin by trying to tackle too may problems all at once instead of tackling our single biggest problem first, then the next etc
* there is not enough appreciation of the inter-relatedness of problems and social systems, so efforts are hampered by competing priorities and unexpected knock-on effects
* there is not enough attention paid to building a clear detailed vision of the future that is desirable for all 
* there is a lack of participation by key people and groups who will be expected to participate in making changes to bring about the desired improvements, therefore resistance to change is encountered

Therefore I propose that we do not fall into these traps. I suggest that the core problem which ultimately manifests itself as these 5 problems above is that &quot;we do not know of a process to improve which does things differently to how it's always been done&quot;. 

Therefore we need to put in place a process to define the most important problem needing our effort, define what we want the result of our effort to be, then (and only then) define what solutions and actions need put in place to achieve that vision.

That is the process which interests me, and my main reason for participation in this project.

I have been trialing variations of a process which does this with local government, central government (both in UK), small companies, large company departments, and recently with a band of volunteers and big picture thinkers to identify our modern civilisation's core problem (www.2020people.com). I'd like to attempt a similar thing for MG. But rather than take up your valuable time what I would like to try is to take soundings and inputs from each of us, then lock myself in a smoke-filled room until I've &quot;processed&quot; your inputs, then present them back to the group for validation and enhancement from you. Once validated we can move to the next stage in the process where again I will take a steer but do most of the heavy lifting myself for presentation back to you for your criticisms.

There are 3 phases to the process:
1. define the problems we are facing
2. define the vision of the future (without those problems)
3. define how we achieve that vision

All I need to get started is a list of the most important problems preventing us from reaching our goal of &quot;Government of, by, and for the people&quot; as defined on the <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/">http://www.metagovernment.org/</A> wiki page.

So please respond by circulating a list of as many problems you feel we currently face in achieving that goal as you wish. They must be current problems, each expressed as a single sentence if possible (otherwise I will summarise and abbreviate). Please feel free to discuss, criticise and support other people's contributions, suggesting alternative wording if appropriate.

Once I have a good number of contributions it will probably take me a couple of weeks to find the time to process them. I am suggesting this as a parallel process to be run in tandem with whatever else we are doing so it should not inconvenience you other than taking the time to make a list and review my output.

Thanks and regards,

Paul
