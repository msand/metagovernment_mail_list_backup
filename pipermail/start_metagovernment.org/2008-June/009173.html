<PRE>I strongly agree (+11) with the idea of  making a list of questions. In fact
I think we should do more. Each should add all the questions they think
should be adressed. And try to answer to any question they think they might
have a beginning of an answer. But also creates one of those mediawiki tags,
so that all the pages with questions end up appearing in a single self
generated page.

Anyone knows how to do it, out of the box.

If not I shall study mediawiki and find out ( but I an travelling too, right
now).

lso intend to start the page on tags pretty soon. with explenations on how
to use them, and math explenations clarifying (or obscuring :) ) them.
