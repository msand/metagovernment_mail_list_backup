A couple of days ago the server on which metagovernment.org is hosted was
repeatedly crashing, so I asked our host to move us to another server. It
is possible that your DNS still has the IP of the old server cached.

If you do a DNS lookup for metagovernment.org, you should get 64.22.96.22.
If you are seeing 207.210.105.94, then you still have the old IP cached.

This brings up a side issue. I would like to suggest that if the site ever
seems to go completely offline from hacking or other external forces, we
use #metascore IRC channel on irc.freenode.net as an emergency alternative.
