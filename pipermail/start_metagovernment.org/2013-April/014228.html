<PRE>Thanks Ned, I will read it thoroughly.
I will also finish translating the second part of the article.

Let me just clarify; the article title has been corrected into Shall we
Allow Delegated Voting in e-Democracy?
Apparently &quot;permit&quot; has a different meaning than in Italian. After so many
years I still make those errors!
I would appreciate if you could correct the title in your article so we do
not spread the grammatical error.

For the records I am right now writing a book about e-Democracy, and, with
your permission and citing the source, I might use some of your points
there. In fact I was waiting to have something to show before inviting
people in this community to come and comment on it. In any case those
articles on Delegated Voting will be included (although probably edited).

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Here is my response to Pietro's admirable article: Representation,
</I>&gt;<i> Delegation, Voting
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962">http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962</A>

</I>&gt;<i> My response is in a wiki page. Feel free to join the discussion by
</I>&gt;<i> adding/modifying text there, and/or by copy/pasting text into emails here
</I>&gt;<i> on the listserv, and/or any other way you wish. (As Alex says, all
</I>&gt;<i> available platforms for rational discourse suck, so pick the platform that
</I>&gt;<i> you think sucks least.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Mike, you asked on the &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Vanish&quot; thread:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Can anyone see a flaw? Please point to anything that seems doubtful.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's article, and my wiki response to his article, and my earlier wiki
</I>&gt;<i> response to your &quot;Validity Seeking&quot; and &quot;Legislative Action&quot; sections are
</I>&gt;<i> chock-a-block full of as yet unrebutted pointings to possible problems in
</I>&gt;<i> your program. (Ignoring such critiques does not make them go away, though
</I>&gt;<i> it does tend to make the people go away that offer them.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Here is the link to the earlier article:
</I>&gt;<i> Seeking Validity Seeking:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0">http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The ongoing discussion, &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Disappear&quot; is predicated
</I>&gt;<i> on the assumption that being governed by assemblies of elected
</I>&gt;<i> representatives is a good idea. (The discussants just don't want the
</I>&gt;<i> representatives to be elected through political parties.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro has advanced in his article what I take to be a devastating
</I>&gt;<i> critique of representative democracy. The political parties discussion is
</I>&gt;<i> moot if representative democracy is a bad idea. In that case, we should be
</I>&gt;<i> working to render representative democracy obsolete, not just working to
</I>&gt;<i> render political parties obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I take this discussion about political parties to be an example of a
</I>&gt;<i> problem facing the Metagovernment community: we listen to one another only
</I>&gt;<i> selectively, and engage one another only selectively, each sub-community
</I>&gt;<i> preferring instead to spend efforts &quot;preaching to its own choir&quot;. One
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of this is that the Metagovernment community as a whole
</I>&gt;<i> continues to not be a collaborating community, but merely a conversation
</I>&gt;<i> community (like a cocktail party).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rational discourse carried to conclusion is hard work. But it can produce
</I>&gt;<i> solid results, from the perspective of enabling productive collaboration.
</I>&gt;<i> If we wish to make significant progress within our lifetimes, we need to
</I>&gt;<i> work together.
