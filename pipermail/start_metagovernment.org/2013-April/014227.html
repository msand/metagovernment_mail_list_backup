<PRE>Pietro on his Blog has posted: Should we permit delegated voting in 
e-Democracy?
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/01/should-we-permit-delegated-voting-in-e-democracy/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/01/should-we-permit-delegated-voting-in-e-democracy/</A> 


Here is my response to Pietro's admirable article: Representation, 
Delegation, Voting
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962">http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962</A>

My response is in a wiki page. Feel free to join the discussion by 
adding/modifying text there, and/or by copy/pasting text into emails 
here on the listserv, and/or any other way you wish. (As Alex says, all 
available platforms for rational discourse suck, so pick the platform 
that you think sucks least.)

@Mike, you asked on the &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Vanish&quot; thread:
&quot;Can anyone see a flaw? Please point to anything that seems doubtful.&quot;

Pietro's article, and my wiki response to his article, and my earlier 
wiki response to your &quot;Validity Seeking&quot; and &quot;Legislative Action&quot; 
sections are chock-a-block full of as yet unrebutted pointings to 
possible problems in your program. (Ignoring such critiques does not 
make them go away, though it does tend to make the people go away that 
offer them.)

(Here is the link to the earlier article:
Seeking Validity Seeking:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0">http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0</A> )

The ongoing discussion, &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Disappear&quot; is 
predicated on the assumption that being governed by assemblies of 
elected representatives is a good idea. (The discussants just don't want 
the representatives to be elected through political parties.)

Pietro has advanced in his article what I take to be a devastating 
critique of representative democracy. The political parties discussion 
is moot if representative democracy is a bad idea. In that case, we 
should be working to render representative democracy obsolete, not just 
working to render political parties obsolete.

I take this discussion about political parties to be an example of a 
problem facing the Metagovernment community: we listen to one another 
only selectively, and engage one another only selectively, each 
sub-community preferring instead to spend efforts &quot;preaching to its own 
choir&quot;. One consequence of this is that the Metagovernment community as 
a whole continues to not be a collaborating community, but merely a 
conversation community (like a cocktail party).

Rational discourse carried to conclusion is hard work. But it can 
produce solid results, from the perspective of enabling productive 
collaboration. If we wish to make significant progress within our 
lifetimes, we need to work together.
