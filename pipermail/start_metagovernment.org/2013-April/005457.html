<PRE>I thought some might be interested in a few stats on this list server. It may surprise you to know how many people are lurking here...

At this writing, this list has 172 members (if you haven't introduced yourself, please consider doing so!).
(2 are robots placed by Michael, and another is for the Gmane archive.)

So far in April, 10 people have sent messages on this list. (That's a &lt;6% participation rate, folks. What are you up to?:)

82 members of this list have Gmail accounts.

Judging strictly by email address top-level domains, I see that members of this list are from:
Austria
Belgium
Canada
Finland
France
Germany
Iceland
Italy
Romania
Russia
Spain
Sweden

Again, that list is judging strictly by domain name, and thus excluding all .coms such as gmail. Some countries which we know participate but are not represented by country-specific domain are Argentina, Chile, Israel, United Kingdom, and United States. But I do find it notable how European this group is (and how Asia and Africa appear to be sorely under-represented here).

Volume-wise, the number of posts per month last quarter was:
January: 27
February: 38
March: 115
April (to date): 39
You can see the volume over time from the chart on the Gmane archive (dating back to when we were mirrored there):
<A HREF="http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment">http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment</A>

Again, just thought some people may find these stats interesting. Now back to the more interesting discussions...
