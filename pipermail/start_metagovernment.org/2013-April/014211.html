<PRE>Welcome Jarno,

&gt;<i> ... basically it can currently do two things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Polls/votes/elections (difference between those being mainly
</I>&gt;<i> whether the results are decisive or just informative).
</I>
I'm especially interested in the informative ones ...

&gt;<i> 2) Find which other users have voted similarly (to help decide who
</I>&gt;<i> to vote for in elections).
</I>&gt;<i> ... It also allows you to see how the opponents argue for their
</I>&gt;<i> stance, so you know which points you should argue if you wish to
</I>&gt;<i> make them change their minds.
</I>
... and their votes, too?  Or is each vote final?

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for checking it out. Yeah, basically it can currently do two things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Polls/votes/elections (difference between those being mainly

</I>&gt;<i> 2) Find which other users have voted similarly (to help decide who to
</I>&gt;<i> vote for in elections).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are some extra features in these, for example:
</I>&gt;<i> -You can add argument to your vote to explain why you voted the way
</I>&gt;<i> you did and these are displayed in the summary page (1), which might
</I>&gt;<i> convince others to vote the same way. It also allows you to see how the
</I>&gt;<i> opponents argue for their stance, so you know which points you should
</I>&gt;<i> argue if you wish to make them change their minds.
</I>&gt;<i> -While most of the votes are simply yes or no since the mathematics
</I>&gt;<i> gets pretty hairy as soon as there are more than two options to vote
</I>&gt;<i> for, in some things like elections it is inevitable so recently I
</I>&gt;<i> added the possibility to add multiple-choice questions (2). Since
</I>&gt;<i> there are several methods to handle multiple-choice voting, there is
</I>&gt;<i> an option to choose which method to use. Currently supports Instant
</I>&gt;<i> Runoff Voting, Range voting and Schultze method. Be warned though that
</I>&gt;<i> this is the most recent feature and probably pretty buggy. Also mostly
</I>&gt;<i> undocumented for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But still, those are the two things it does, nothing more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you plan to integrate means to reach consensus/overcome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conflicts or do you rely upon established institutions to track them?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probaby not at least in the near future. Apart from adding arguments
</I>&gt;<i> to votes there is a simple discussion forum, but nothing more
</I>&gt;<i> sophisticated than that so need to use other tools for these.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Public tracking and documentation of assent is in our interest in general,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially since technically separated communities cannot reach consensus at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all. (2) Do you have any ideas upon cooperation with other tools?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Haven't really thought about that until now, but that vote mirroring
</I>&gt;<i> is an interesting concept. I probably could at the minimum provide
</I>&gt;<i> some kind of API to read votes/questions by other voting systems,
</I>&gt;<i> that should not be too difficult to do.
