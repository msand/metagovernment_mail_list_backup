</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> want to vote for an open party.  The elector need not participate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in the primaries, of course, but open primaries are more
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> meaningful and interesting (c and d) than closed primaries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, but WHY should anyone become an elector who participates in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open primaries in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By &quot;elector&quot;, I mean someone who is eligible to vote on election day.
</I>&gt;<i> So most citizens of age are already electors.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But it no longer matters what party the elector votes for (open or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not).  The election results are more-or-less the same regardless
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (c).  (e) The mass media will inform people of this strange news.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> People will want to know what it means.  Journalists will explain:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;The parties are dying.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, i dont think so.  They only started to cover pirates, when they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had a lot of voters voting for them. Currently they dont cover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pirate stuff at all.  The media covers those things which have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impact to some degree and impact means, a lot of people are affected
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by something.  So if you have open primaries and two open paper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parties, that means, its still a lifeless construct.  Media will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cover it. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You missed point (c), Alex.  The open candidate list is largely
</I>&gt;<i> elected to the Bundestag even if nobody votes for an open party on
</I>&gt;<i> election day.  The votes could all go to the Union, SPD, etc. as
</I>&gt;<i> usual, and *still* the open list would be largely elected.  In that
</I>&gt;<i> sense, the open parties always win.  They are unbeatable.  That's food
</I>&gt;<i> for thought if it's true, and it's also newsworthy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think the motivation is (d).  Nowhere else can I (a German
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> citizen) discuss and vote on the membership of the Bundestag, the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> candidacy of the Chancellor, and the thousands of official
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> appointments (direct and indirect) of the Chancellor's office.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes you can.  join the pirates and you can discuss and vote on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> membership.  ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not for the government as whole, you can't.  The Pirate Party's
</I>&gt;<i> candidate list is not the assured membership of the entire Bundestag;
</I>&gt;<i> nor is the Pirate's leader the assured Chancellor; nor are any of the
</I>&gt;<i> other primary nominees of the party assured of appointment in the
</I>&gt;<i> government.  These assurances can be provided only by open electoral
</I>&gt;<i> primaries, and the Pirate Party is not hosting any (d).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So the way to move forward is to bring two toolsets together to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> eliminate the primary network effect (i.e. host an open primary).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> That's the fastest way I can see.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, but which two toolsets? I feel the community aspect should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> added.  In addition to what you've said, there should be communities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chosen for strategic reasons.  ...to make it even faster.  (That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will not prevent any other communities from using any one of the two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first toolsets, but at least it will make sure, that the communities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> targeted in the first place are huge, so the features are catered to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their needs)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, maybe a community can help in bringing two toolsets together.
</I>&gt;<i> This has been my hope for AG MFT and other Pirates.  It's worth a try.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But the Pirate Party has not adopted an open primary (d). ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> They have.  An open primary cannot be anonymous. People have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authenticate themselves in some way.  Pirates do not deny people to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> join in :-) You can participate in crafting the party program, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if you are not member of the pirates. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the primary votes of outsiders were counted equal to the member's
</I>&gt;<i> votes *and* could be cast on facilities beyond the control of the
</I>&gt;<i> Pirate Party (or any other organization), then that would be an open
</I>&gt;<i> *program* primary.  It would enable the German citizens to craft
</I>&gt;<i> consensus programs for the government as a whole.  Further, if it were
</I>&gt;<i> backed by open *electoral* primaries, then the consensus programs
</I>&gt;<i> would be assured of implementation.  But none of this is the case.
</I>&gt;<i> The Pirate Party does not (at least not yet) enable any of this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ... The same is true of the CDU/CSU Union and the SPD.  So the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pirate Party is not applying any pressure to these other parties
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in favour of open primaries.  (Conceivably it might by first
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> destroying itself, but I think that's too much to expect of any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> party organization.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The CDU/CSU and will never use digital tools in order to enable all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of their members to participate. ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It wouldn't help them to do so.  As noted previously (quoted below),
</I>&gt;<i> Union members will feel compelled to join in the open electoral
</I>&gt;<i> primaries *regardless* of what the Union does.  Open primaries are
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily beyond Union control.  So it no longer matters what kind
</I>&gt;<i> of tooling a party organization supports (or does not support); the
</I>&gt;<i> action occurs outside of the party organizations.  All of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No, I think the pressure is felt equally by all parties, and it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> falls mostly on the party supporters.  If SPD supporters do not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> participate (b) in the open electoral primaries, then SPD
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> candidates (a) will do poorly in the results.  The same applies to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Pirates.  They must participate in the open primary, or the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pirate candidates will fall behind in the results.  This is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> pressure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> YES, but this assumes, that the open primaries in itself are of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significance at all, which they are not, because initially, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> today, there are 0 participants in open primaries, thats why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> established parties do not notice and do not care.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We cannot have participants today, because we have no open primary for
</I>&gt;<i> them to participate in.  To have an open primary, we must eliminate
</I>&gt;<i> the primary network effect between at least two primary toolsets.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The rush to the open electoral primaries in order to save the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> party candidates is a rush *out* of the parties.  This is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crucial point.  It's inevitable and it happens fast.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, but only if the open primaries are of any significance. What
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are talking about is the network effect.  Once, the open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primaries gain serious traction and accumulate a critical mass of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants, then the network effect will force the established
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> parties to adopt it too to prevent further &quot;rush outs&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Technically it is not a network effect.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, I think the main attraction of an open electoral primary is that
</I>&gt;<i> it provides reliable information about the upcoming election (who
</I>&gt;<i> ought we to elect?) that is unavailable from any other source.  So
</I>&gt;<i> there's an outrush of members and other loyal supporters seeking that
</I>&gt;<i> information outside the parties and contributing to it.  The parties
</I>&gt;<i> cannot do anything to prevent this, neither by action nor inaction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;life blood&quot; will flow out of the parties, because all the value
</I>&gt;<i> is in the mixing of it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ... Why late 1800s?  isnt this an issue we have since the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> beginning of time? or at least throught the whole history of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> mankind? ...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I mean the network effect in *primary elections*.  Who ought to be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> elected?  Who ought to be on the ballot?  The system that answers
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> these questions for us dates from the late 1800s.  It's the modern
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> party system.  It's held together by the network effect in its
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> primary electoral facilities that forces the participants into the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> largest of the parties.  Eliminate that network effect by enabling
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them to range freely between two primary electoral facilities - no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> matter how small - and the entire party system falls to pieces on
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that ability.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Like if team blue and team red would both agree to use such a open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> primary toolset and do vote mirroring, problem would be solved,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right? ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No, I don't think that's the trigger.  Organized teams (parties) have
</I>&gt;<i> no enabling role.  Participation is an individual decision.  Crucially
</I>&gt;<i> the parties cannot prevent their own candidates from appearing in the
</I>&gt;<i> open primary and extending the choices, nor prevent their own members
</I>&gt;<i> from discussing and voting on those choices.  Whatever the parties do
</I>&gt;<i> - or fail to do - is pretty much without relevance.  The future is in
</I>&gt;<i> the hands of members and non-members who act outside of all party
</I>&gt;<i> control.  That is why the parties are finished.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The open primary is anchored in the unorganized part of society known
</I>&gt;<i> as the lifeworld.  It is (or will be) an institution of the lifeworld
</I>&gt;<i> as opposed to the administrative system (the other aspect of society).
</I>&gt;<i> At no point does the open primary depend on any particular
</I>&gt;<i> organization.  It is always free (born free), and it confers freedom
</I>&gt;<i> on those who use it.
