Thanks for checking it out. Yeah, basically it can currently do two things:
1) Polls/votes/elections (difference between those being mainly
whether the results are decisive or just informative).
2) Find which other users have voted similarly (to help decide who to
vote for in elections).

There are some extra features in these, for example:
-You can add argument to your vote to explain why you voted the way
you did and these are displayed in the summary page (1), which might
convince others to vote the same way. It also allows you to see how the
opponents argue for their stance, so you know which points you should
argue if you wish to make them change their minds.
-While most of the votes are simply yes or no since the mathematics
gets pretty hairy as soon as there are more than two options to vote
for, in some things like elections it is inevitable so recently I
added the possibility to add multiple-choice questions (2). Since
there are several methods to handle multiple-choice voting, there is
an option to choose which method to use. Currently supports Instant
Runoff Voting, Range voting and Schultze method. Be warned though that
this is the most recent feature and probably pretty buggy. Also mostly
undocumented for now.

But still, those are the two things it does, nothing more.

&gt;<i> Do you plan to integrate means to reach consensus/overcome
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts or do you rely upon established institutions to track them?
</I>
Probaby not at least in the near future. Apart from adding arguments
to votes there is a simple discussion forum, but nothing more
sophisticated than that so need to use other tools for these.

&gt;<i> Public tracking and documentation of assent is in our interest in general,
</I>&gt;<i> especially since technically separated communities cannot reach consensus at
</I>&gt;<i> all. (2) Do you have any ideas upon cooperation with other tools?
</I>
Haven't really thought about that until now, but that vote mirroring
is an interesting concept. I probably could at the minimum provide
some kind of API to read votes/questions by other voting systems,
that should not be too difficult to do.
