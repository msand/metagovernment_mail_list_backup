<PRE>------------------------------------------------------------------------

For reference, here is the Discourse Principle:

    (D) Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected
    persons could agree as participants in rational discourses. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

All modern Western style &quot;democracies&quot; are actually various flavors of 
polyarchy.

    Polyarchy is generally what British leaders mean when they speak of
    promoting 'democracy' abroad. This is a system in which a small
    group actually rules and mass participation is confined to choosing
    leaders in elections managed by competing elites. -- Mark Curtis 

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      ****** Argument That Polyarchy Is Invalid By (D) ******

One of the most fundamental norms necessary to ensure meaningful public 
autonomy is this:

    (P) Each individual must be free to participate through rational
    discourse on equal footing in the making of any public decision that
    the individual finds of interest. 


There are governance systems that fully guarantee this fundamental 
right. (Just to name one example, Blinap fully guarantees this 
fundamental right.)

Polyarchy systems flat-out deny this fundamental right.

Speaking as a &quot;possibly affected person&quot;, I cannot agree (&quot;as a 
participant in rational discourse&quot;) that any governance system that 
denies this fundamental right, necessary to meaningful public autonomy, 
is acceptable to me, given that there are alternatives available that do 
guarantee the right that are also better governance systems generally.

This means that, because:

    * I exist
    * I am affected
    * I do not agree
    * I have at least one valid reason for my objection

... therefore polyarchy is not valid by the Discourse Principle, at 
least until such time as I am persuaded through rational discourse to 
abandon my rational objection to it, and no one else has any unresolved 
rational objections to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Projects such as Votorola are attempting to &quot;democratize&quot; polyarchy. But 
those attempts to democratize are not sufficient to render polyarchy 
valid by (D), because after all of the democratization, polyarchy will 
still be flat-out denying the fundamental right (P).
