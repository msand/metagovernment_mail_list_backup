&gt;<i> @Mike, you asked on the &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Vanish&quot; thread:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's article, and my wiki response to his article, and my

</I>&gt;<i> Action&quot; sections are chock-a-block full of as yet unrebutted

Well, I did reply some months ago:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-February/005290.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-February/005290.html</A>
&gt;<i> &gt; If you still feel there's something wrong with this practice of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; validity seeking (as proposed), then please give an example of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bad thing that might happen in consequence. Please be specific.
</I>
Apparently you missed my request, so I repeated it:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-February/005298.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-February/005298.html</A>
&gt;<i> &gt; Please give an example of where the practice (validity seeking)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fails to serve its claimed purpose. I still think this is a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea, because otherwise you're in the awkward position of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elaborating a theory of how the practice is broken, when you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cannot imagine a single case in which it fails to guide the text
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; closer to validity, as claimed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/validity_seeking">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/validity_seeking</A>
</I>
I await your clarification.

&gt;<i> Pietro on his Blog has posted: Should we permit delegated voting in 
</I>&gt;<i> e-Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/01/should-we-permit-delegated-voting-in-e-democracy/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/01/should-we-permit-delegated-voting-in-e-democracy/</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is my response to Pietro's admirable article: Representation, 
</I>&gt;<i> Delegation, Voting
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962">http://www.wiser.org/article/01a06cb3cfe407785ab68db8f18ea962</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My response is in a wiki page. Feel free to join the discussion by 
</I>&gt;<i> adding/modifying text there, and/or by copy/pasting text into emails 
</I>&gt;<i> here on the listserv, and/or any other way you wish. (As Alex says, all 
</I>&gt;<i> available platforms for rational discourse suck, so pick the platform 
</I>&gt;<i> that you think sucks least.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> @Mike, you asked on the &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Vanish&quot; thread:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Can anyone see a flaw? Please point to anything that seems doubtful.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's article, and my wiki response to his article, and my earlier 
</I>&gt;<i> wiki response to your &quot;Validity Seeking&quot; and &quot;Legislative Action&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> sections are chock-a-block full of as yet unrebutted pointings to 
</I>&gt;<i> possible problems in your program. (Ignoring such critiques does not 
</I>&gt;<i> make them go away, though it does tend to make the people go away that 
</I>&gt;<i> offer them.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Here is the link to the earlier article:
</I>&gt;<i> Seeking Validity Seeking:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0">http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0</A> )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The ongoing discussion, &quot;Helping the Pirate Party Disappear&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> predicated on the assumption that being governed by assemblies of 
</I>&gt;<i> elected representatives is a good idea. (The discussants just don't want 
</I>&gt;<i> the representatives to be elected through political parties.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro has advanced in his article what I take to be a devastating 
</I>&gt;<i> critique of representative democracy. The political parties discussion 
</I>&gt;<i> is moot if representative democracy is a bad idea. In that case, we 
</I>&gt;<i> should be working to render representative democracy obsolete, not just 
</I>&gt;<i> working to render political parties obsolete.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I take this discussion about political parties to be an example of a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem facing the Metagovernment community: we listen to one another 
</I>&gt;<i> only selectively, and engage one another only selectively, each 
</I>&gt;<i> sub-community preferring instead to spend efforts &quot;preaching to its own 
</I>&gt;<i> choir&quot;. One consequence of this is that the Metagovernment community as 
</I>&gt;<i> a whole continues to not be a collaborating community, but merely a 
</I>&gt;<i> conversation community (like a cocktail party).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rational discourse carried to conclusion is hard work. But it can 
</I>&gt;<i> produce solid results, from the perspective of enabling productive 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration. If we wish to make significant progress within our 
</I>&gt;<i> lifetimes, we need to work together.
