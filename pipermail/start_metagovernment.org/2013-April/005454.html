    I propose a validation practice (validity seeking) based on D. You
    say the practice is itself invalid because it involves voting. But I
    think you stand on shaky ground here, for two reasons:

       1. Voting is the formalization of agreement
       2. D depends on agreement

    Therefore the formalization of D depends on voting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Ned] For reference, here is the Discourse Principle:

    D. Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected
    persons could agree as participants in rational discourses. 


Speaking as a &quot;possibly affected person&quot;, I do not agree to the use of 
voting  to formalize agreement. My view is that we should instead 
formalize agreement through rational discourse, without voting.

(To view an example system design that accomplishes this, see the Blinap 
flowchart:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/740569be35a413f95a6ee2b555b8834f">http://www.wiser.org/article/740569be35a413f95a6ee2b555b8834f</A> )

So, the stage is set: since all of us do not agree, those of us who 
value the Discourse Principle need to have a rational discourse to 
determine whether the norm of using voting to formalize agreement, and 
beyond that to formalize D, is itself a valid norm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      &quot;Voting is the Formalization of Agreement&quot;

[Ned] I would be willing to agree to the use of voting to formalize an 
agreement only in one very specific (and very rare) kind of circumstance:

    * All stakeholders are participating (directly) in the vote.
    * The vote decision rule specifies that 100% consensus is required.
    * All participants have agreed to use voting to formalize the agreement.

When any stakeholders are *not* participating directly, the practice of 
casting and counting votes becomes not &quot;just&quot; a formalization of 
agreement, but also in addition a &quot;power tool&quot;, that can be used (and in 
practice often is used) to make decisions that can be shown to be not 
valid by D, to the detriment of absentee stakeholders. (&quot;You Snooze, You 
Lose&quot;) (Example: ten BIS bankers vote unanimously to apply a sudden 
surprise one-off 10% &quot;tax&quot; to all bank deposits in Cyprus banks.)

When the decision rule is anything less than 100% consensus, again 
voting becomes not &quot;just&quot; a formalization of agreement, but also in 
addition a &quot;power tool&quot;, that can be used (and in practice often is 
used) to make decisions that can be shown to be not valid by D, to the 
detriment of voters in the minority and absentee stakeholders. (&quot;Might 
Makes Right&quot;) (Example: two wolves and a lamb vote on what to have for 
lunch.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      &quot;D depends on agreement&quot;

Actually, the principle says &quot;could agree&quot;. This is a much higher 
standard than &quot;do agree&quot;. It has the effect of inserting consideration 
of the interests of absentee stakeholders into the principle. This puts 
the Discourse Principle into the same league as two other well-known 
principles:

    G. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

    C. Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same
    time, will that it should become a universal law.

A better way to formalize agreement while honoring the &quot;could agree&quot; 
specification involves three arrangements, all features of Blinap.

    When a proposal is submitted, anyone can propose an objection to its
    being implemented, on the grounds that some specified set of
    stakeholders do not agree (or probably would not agree), for
    specified reasons. If the proposed objection is successfully
    defended through the course of the subsequent
    rational-discourse-through-proposing, the original proposal will not
    be implemented.

    The appraisal sub-system of Blinap provides a &quot;set and forget&quot;
    capability. By proposing proposal filters (that independent
    appraisers will then apply to all relevant subsequent proposals) the
    proposer of the proposal filters can effectively object to the
    subsequent proposals as the filters direct, without having to
    participate directly in each discourse. (Without this feature,
    honoring of the &quot;could agree&quot; specification would be much less
    reliable, dependent upon who happened to participate in any
    particular discourse.)

    If, after a proposal has been implemented, an absentee stakeholder
    finds out the hard way that it is not agreeable, the stakeholder (or
    someone else proposing on his/her/its behalf) can propose that the
    implementation be reversed if possible, and perhaps that reparations
    be paid. The original proposer, and perhaps also other decision
    participants, may be assessed to pay some or all of the reparations,
    if it can be successfully argued that the effects on the absentee
    stakeholder were foreseeable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      &quot;... as participants in rational discourses&quot;

The Discourse principle specifies that agreement be reached &quot;as 
participants in rational discourse&quot;.

The action of casting a vote has nothing to do with rational discourse. 
It is an action that is given meaning and effect by the algorithms of an 
impersonal vote-counting system.

(In contrast, Blinap is an example of a decision system in which there 
is no participation in decision making except through rational discourse.)

Use of the method of casting and counting votes to pick proposals 
enables the decision process to flow around and ignore the decision 
outcomes that rational discourse would have produced in the absence of 
voting. Each individual voter:

    * is free to vote irrationally (blind guess, intuition, etc.)
    * is free to vote in accord with zero-sum self interest
    * is free to vote in accord with patriotic duty or whatever
    * is free to ignore validity as a proposal selection criterion
    * is free to ignore any and all discourse outcomes produced through
      interactions with others prior to the vote

The vote that is cast cannot be challenged through rational discourse. 
The voter cannot be called upon to defend it through rational discourse. 
Casting the vote is an exercise of sovereign, non-rational, 
non-discursive political power.

This is the key difference between casting a vote and submitting a 
proposal. A proposal can be challenged through rational discourse, and 
will have effect (be implemented) only if it is successfully defended 
through rational discourse. A vote will always have its effect, 
irrespective of rationality or discourse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      &quot;Therefore the formalization of D depends on voting.&quot;

Until, through our rational discourse, we have all been persuaded to 
agree to the norm of using voting to formalize agreement, voting cannot 
be used to formalize D, because until then the norm of voting will not 
itself have been established to be valid by D.

Any claim that formalization of D depends on voting, on the grounds that 
there is no alternative to voting as a means through which to formalize 
D, is false. Blinap is an example of a &quot;decisive&quot; decision system that 
does not involve voting, and that is capable of formalizing D.
