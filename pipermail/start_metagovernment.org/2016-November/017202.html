Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. If it takes
technology to enable humans to make collective decisions in groups
larger than our built-in programming was designed to handle (around
30), that's what we'll have to use...

Adding the &quot;two thirds&quot; support requirement makes it a fundamentally
different process from what the IETF is using (&quot;absolute dictator&quot;
truly means &quot;absolute&quot; there, albeit with the possibility of appeal
and review at a later date).

&gt;<i> And people do not want to spend all day on decision queues.
</I>
Agreed, and with well designed decisionmaking software, they won't
have to! Having large numbers of people gather in a room to make
decisions, or indeed even disseminate information, is so 20th
century...

Thinking more about Pol.is and how it is actually used (especially
with vTaiwan) the fundamental limitation of its design is becoming
clear to me: It truly is just a polling tool because it is essentially
a one-way process. It is *not* being used to disseminate information
or encourage debate, but merely to collect existing or
spontaneously-formed opinion. If it was designed to disseminate
information and *facilitate* consensus forming the posts would contain
argument and fact, which near as I can tell they almost never do
(almost all are &quot;tweet&quot; sized, and we all know how Twitter has ruined
the process of debate: FaceBook is a veritable Disputation Arena by
comparison).
