<PRE>Been thinking about a quick fix for a metric of goodness on proposals. One
of the main fears of DD is that of tyranny of majority, subjugating
minority groups/individuals to measures they reject. The way to mitigate
this problem is to have a blanket rule that any proposal will have to apply
to everyone. Therefore any attempt to marginalise a group would need to
marginalise every group, thus making it less likely to pass. A group would
be defined as any race, country, religion or company (restrictions incurred
would need to apply to the industry as a whole). I assume there must be
faults in this type of thinking but as of yet, I can't come up with any
good examples. Prove me wrong.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sure they are different. Business is mostly Autocracy Ltd. with a direct

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is authoritarian/plutocratic with goals described by Parkinson's laws and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may be limited by elections.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd clarify that to specify that the executive branch is naturally
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchical and authoritarian, but that's not necessarily true of the
</I>&gt;<i> legislative branch, nor does the latter even need to be plutocratic.
</I>&gt;<i> Always consider the EEA when making statements about the natural state
</I>&gt;<i> of human &quot;government&quot;: A million years ago there were no &quot;plutocrats&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> because our social instincts prevented them from arising (indeed
</I>&gt;<i> acquiring too much power was liable to cause your murder). And
</I>&gt;<i> decisions involving the whole band were made collectively, with the
</I>&gt;<i> same people making the decisions being the ones who would have to
</I>&gt;<i> carry them out. Hierarchy did probably sometimes emerge at that point
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., when making war on the neighboring band, there were undoubtedly
</I>&gt;<i> leaders, although unlike our current concept of them leaders in the
</I>&gt;<i> EEA were out on the front lines too), but if we design our new system
</I>&gt;<i> properly, hierarchy and plutocracy won't have to be part of the
</I>&gt;<i> legislative/decisionmaking process. But we've got to understand and
</I>&gt;<i> account for our natural abilities to ensure that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they both should be focused on goodness and may be analogical in group
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision-making.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we do need to reform both, government and business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Business could certain stand a little &quot;optimization&quot; but I wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> even consider it to the scale of &quot;reform&quot;. Government, on the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, doesn't need &quot;reform&quot;, it needs a complete redesign. So that's
</I>&gt;<i> where IMHO we should concentrate *all* of our effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) Conflicting values makes it impossible to come up with a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; definition of &quot;good&quot;. Unlike business, where profitability is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; universal standard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yes, that is the usual approach, but not mine. The adjective is one:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;good&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that is what I like to measure. One man that says &quot;good&quot; about
</I>&gt;<i> decision1 +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one woman that says &quot;good&quot; about decision1 = two people that say &quot;good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; about decision1
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm. Sounds challenging. You certainly can't use the normal metrics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for measuring something like this because you've also got to develop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some sort of massive factor-analysis model to figure what &quot;good&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even measuring before you can even start comparing goodness of fit for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Say one system results in the passage of a law in Europe or the US
</I>&gt;<i> that puts all immigrants from the middle east or Africa out of work,
</I>&gt;<i> but compensates by ensuring full employment for white people, then
</I>&gt;<i> compare that with a system that passes a law that only slightly
</I>&gt;<i> increases employment rates of all groups. By your metrics the first
</I>&gt;<i> one could be selected as doing more &quot;good&quot; because all you're
</I>&gt;<i> proposing to do is poll the very voters who rendered the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted I don't propose to design a system that would naturally make
</I>&gt;<i> one of those laws more likely to be passed than the other, but my
</I>&gt;<i> proposal has two important differences:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I'm not going to be deluding myself or the population into saying
</I>&gt;<i> that we just used a &quot;good&quot; system to pass a &quot;good&quot; law: They're going
</I>&gt;<i> to have to keep their doubts and be prepared to reverse or alter the
</I>&gt;<i> decision at any time.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The design of the system must only ensure that the preferences of
</I>&gt;<i> those immigrants (and indeed every other marginalized group) would
</I>&gt;<i> have at least been considered and counted when making the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is, I don't plan to make any claims about objective &quot;goodness&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> which would require a very complicated analysis where the impact on
</I>&gt;<i> each individual affected by the decision would have to be assessed and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregated. Being truly representative is sufficient. Only in that
</I>&gt;<i> case can we ensure that the decision &quot;matches&quot; the Will of the People
</I>&gt;<i> and whether you or I, or indeed even the majority of the &quot;voters&quot; as
</I>&gt;<i> they are counted in misrepresentative democracy, would consider that
</I>&gt;<i> decision &quot;good&quot; is irrelevant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You know, Scott, there is a lot of ideological work and it is basically
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; incomparable ( based on different worldviews). You are asking us to do
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more ideological work, to believe unquestionably in direct democracy (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even in some very special form) and work. Heaven is close.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess at this point I shouldn't be surprised or disappointed when I
</I>&gt;<i> see someone on this list blindly accept elitism as not only the status
</I>&gt;<i> quo, but indeed a fundamental component of your ideology. Yet I am:
</I>&gt;<i> The idea that some new technology-enhanced oligarchy (which includes
</I>&gt;<i> every system discussed on this list with the possible exception of
</I>&gt;<i> AutoMatch) will be any improvement over our current misrepresentative
</I>&gt;<i> democracies is just delusional IMHO. It's like tweaking the equations
</I>&gt;<i> that predict how the sun goes around the earth, or how may grams of
</I>&gt;<i> phlogiston will be released when a piece of plastic burns. Even if you
</I>&gt;<i> don't end up believing in DD wholeheartedly, not taking the time to
</I>&gt;<i> research and understand the personality types that emerge as rulers in
</I>&gt;<i> oligarchies means your are simply wasting your time working on
</I>&gt;<i> anything that assumes that they'll behave any different than they do
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the other hand, we got here a method that may compare worldviews in
</I>&gt;<i> some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sense. Moreover, science seems to be more influential than ideology
</I>&gt;<i> today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LOL! You may have missed it, but the US just elected a climate-change
</I>&gt;<i> denier president!
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
