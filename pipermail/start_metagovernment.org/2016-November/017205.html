<PRE>Hi,

I have made some changes, see the link again please. Reading the abstract may be enough ( 80 words).

cheers

I dispute that, unless the &quot;minority&quot; you're referring to are the very 
elites who have taken control of our misrepresentative democracies. 
Sure, some people have been brainwashed into thinking that it's racial 
and religious minorities our misrepresentative democracies are 
protecting, but frankly I have to conclude that those people aren't 
even paying attention. Once they start to gain power and learn how to 
wield it this misplaced fear of DD will simply evaporate, at least for 
most of us... 

&gt;<i> The way to mitigate this problem

</I>&gt;<i> type of thinking but as of yet, I can't come up with any good examples. 
</I>&gt;<i> Prove me wrong. 
</I>
It kind of glosses over the issue of pre-existing conditions. For 
example, Boulder's new soda tax, passed by referendum (i.e., DD) has 
been called &quot;racist&quot; because it supposedly discriminates against the 
poor, who even here in lily-white Boulder are primarily non-white. 
Unless you somehow arrange to have more-or-less equal starting 
positions (something my matchism proposal attempts, but which is not a 
characteristic of any other proposal outside of science fiction), it's 
impossible to equalize the effects of the discrimination. 

But IMHO you're barking up the wrong tree: It's *exactly* the rich and 
powerful &quot;minority&quot; that The People will start to discriminate against 
when given the ability. Look to the various communist revolutions as 
examples. This is not necessarily a bad thing in itself, but 
safeguards (especially information dissemination about when to stop 
&quot;equalizing&quot;) need to be put into place to prevent a repeat of the 
communist fiascos... 
Regards, 
Scott
