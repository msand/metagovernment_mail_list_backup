<PRE>While I don't believe that the mantra &quot;you can't improve what you
don't measure&quot; is *complete* BS (e.g.,
<A HREF="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/02/10/if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it-is-bs/#9e22db33faed">http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/02/10/if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it-is-bs/#9e22db33faed</A>),
this seems to me to be not a productive path for research on
government for several reasons:

1) The timescale is too long: Unlike most organizations, especially
businesses, the timeframe for deciding whether a government decision
is &quot;good&quot;, at least if you're going to be assessing outcomes, takes
years to decades.

2) Conflicting values makes it impossible to come up with a single
definition of &quot;good&quot;. Unlike business, where profitability is a
universal standard.

3) We really don't have any choice: Existing government is so bad that
the next version is going to look completely different, rendering any
sort of A/B comparison irrelevant (e.g., do we really need to have a
&quot;science&quot; to decide whether communism or fascism results in more
&quot;good&quot; outcomes than misrepresentative democracy?)

Again, I think we should be comfortable using an instantaneous measure
of the &quot;fit&quot; to the Will of the People to determine whether a decision
is &quot;good&quot; or not. Sure, that's going to occasionally result in minor
fiascos like the passage of California's Proposition 8 and the
election of Trump, but as long as the system supports review and
correction, that's OK. And I don't even consider Prop 8 a good
example: My evaluation is that not only did that vote not reflect the
general Will of the People (but rather that of a small number of
religious &quot;Activerts&quot;), but the fact that it was overturned by the
courts basically wasted a &quot;teachable moment&quot;. If we really believe in
direct democracy we have to accept that sometimes people will make bad
decisions.That isn't a problem as long as they're allowed to review
and correct them. Which brings us to Trump: I have no idea whether
he'll make a good president or not. The main problem I see is that we
may end up having to suffer through at least 4 years of his rule, or
possibly even indefinitely, if he ends up behaving like most other
psychopathic leaders have...
