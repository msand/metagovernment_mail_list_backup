Having worked a lot with both, I've come to the conclusion that
business and government are two very different things and the methods
and even the metrics that work in one are just inappropriate for the
other. I don't discount the possibility that executive branch
functioning could be greatly improved via the adoption of business
methods/metrics, but my conclusion is that it's the legislative branch
that's really broken in our current systems. Meaning none of this
business decisionmaking stuff is even relevant.

&gt;<i> 2) Conflicting values makes it impossible to come up with a single

</I>&gt;<i> universal standard.

</I>&gt;<i> that is what I like to measure. One man that says &quot;good&quot; about decision1 +
</I>&gt;<i> one woman that says &quot;good&quot; about decision1 = two people that say &quot;good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> about decision1
</I>
Hmm. Sounds challenging. You certainly can't use the normal metrics
for measuring something like this because you've also got to develop
some sort of massive factor-analysis model to figure what &quot;good&quot; is
even measuring before you can even start comparing goodness of fit for
decisions...

&gt;<i> 3) We really don't have any choice: Existing government is so bad that
</I>&gt;<i> the next version is going to look completely different, rendering any
</I>&gt;<i> sort of A/B comparison irrelevant (e.g., do we really need to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;science&quot; to decide whether communism or fascism results in more
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;good&quot; outcomes than misrepresentative democracy?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I would like to compare meaningful stuff. E.g. Is
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> better than AllOurIdeas and in what
</I>&gt;<i> cases.
</I>&gt;<i> Or even how much better, so you may decide whether you would like to go
</I>&gt;<i> through the pain of discussion when deciding &quot;a color of the wall&quot;.
</I>
Toy apps solving toy problems. Again, comparing these things might be
useful if all you want to do is make product design or marketing
decisions, but the design of all these things (and this of course
includes Liquid Democracy and all the decisionmaking systems we've
evaluated on this list) simply won't scale to anywhere near the size
necessary to run even a local government, let alone a global one. Once
a viable *scalable* alternative is developed, there won't be any need
to compare it with any of these kinds of small-scale alternatives,
it'll take off by itself and there won't be any need, or indeed even
any ability, to compare it with alternatives (i.e., this is the way
communism and fascism and indeed misrepresentative democracy were
adopted, although hopefully the next time we'll achieve better
outcomes than at least the first two ;-)

&gt;<i> Again, I think we should be comfortable using an instantaneous measure
</I>&gt;<i> of the &quot;fit&quot; to the Will of the People to determine whether a decision
</I>&gt;<i> is &quot;good&quot; or not. Sure, that's going to occasionally result in minor
</I>&gt;<i> fiascos like the passage of California's Proposition 8 and the
</I>&gt;<i> election of Trump, but as long as the system supports review and
</I>&gt;<i> correction, that's OK. And I don't even consider Prop 8 a good
</I>&gt;<i> example: My evaluation is that not only did that vote not reflect the
</I>&gt;<i> general Will of the People (but rather that of a small number of
</I>&gt;<i> religious &quot;Activerts&quot;), but the fact that it was overturned by the
</I>&gt;<i> courts basically wasted a &quot;teachable moment&quot;. If we really believe in
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy we have to accept that sometimes people will make bad
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.That isn't a problem as long as they're allowed to review
</I>&gt;<i> and correct them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you believe it, go for it. I will have one more system to compare. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> that it will excel in many fields, maybe just in some.
</I>&gt;<i> Also we may like to compare some systems of direct democracy.
</I>
Again, I don't think that's necessary, or even useful: We're never
going to get the chance to do A/B testing on EDD systems. So instead
of developing a science for comparing possible alternative
decisionmaking systems, I'd recommend investing those resources in
figuring out what kinds of things will be requirements for the next
generation system so that we'll have anticipated most or all of the
serious problems *before* adoption takes off. So far I've seen very
little of that on this list. For example there's never been any
serious debate about how unbiased representatives can reliably be
selected, or about how to deal with the issue of open vs. secret
voting, or about methods for maintaining participation rates even in
the face of voter apathy, or even how to deal with antisocial behavior
(bullying/harassment/spamming/doxing/mob effects/etc). I do recall
Carlo calling for &quot;more moderators with more power!&quot; (as if that's
really a solution to anything), but where's the discussion about &quot;who
decides?&quot; when making a call on whether a particular action has
crossed some line, or indeed where that line should be in the first
place?
  Regards,
    Scott
