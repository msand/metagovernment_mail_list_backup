&gt;<i> The Waning of Humaneness by Konrad Lorenz. Some interesting &quot;clinations&quot; are

Finally got around to reading it, and his &quot;Civilized Man's Eight
Deadly Sins&quot;. They're from the 70s and 80s and so you can buy them
used from Amazon for about $4 (in the US anyway). I agree that it is
worth reading, although I found both of those to be a lot more
inconsistent than the other works on ethology and evolutionary
psychology I've read (his consist of a few flashes of brilliance
surrounded by a lot of stuff that's either dull, unintelligible, or
just plain weird).

&gt;<i> Book is short and worth reading.
</I>
The part that relates to Clinations is really just *too* short: What
he's got overlaps with my stab at it pretty well, but he leaves out
some of the most important of these built-in &quot;rules&quot; and doesn't even
address the issue of how these rules must be accounted for in any
social-engineering project (e.g., like trying to create a new form of
government or economics or religion): Unfortunately just recognizing
the problem is the easy part...

If you want to read more of this kind of stuff, I recommend the Helian
Unbound blog (e.g., put &quot;Lorenz&quot; in the search box):
