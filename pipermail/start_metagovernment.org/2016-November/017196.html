<PRE>We are still inside the &quot;goodness&quot; model. It is worth expecting that the decision property &quot;time available for decision&quot; will predict &quot;good&quot; decisions by elites.



There are some more civil cases of use of elites. Food production and fresh food transport, passengers transport, emergency services.



Cheers

That's the trick, though: *How* do you propose to limit their power? I

agree that elites (and even SDAPs) all have a role to play in

government and in society in general, even roles where they may wield

vast power over others on a regular basis (not just in emergencies).

Which is why I don't see the need to make major changes the executive

branch and certainly not to the capitalist system in general. Our

problem is merely our inability to *regulate* these powerful people

and organizations. Which is why I believe we must concentrate our

efforts on creating a robust, unbiased, and incorruptible legislative

branch (i.e., an EDD with as close to 100% participation rates as we

can possibly get), because that is the only thing I can think of that

is up to the task. Unfortunately everyone else on this list seems to

be perfectly happy to just cede power to whoever wants it and then

just wave their hands when it comes to dealing with the issues of

corruption and bias (self-serving, ideological, etc.). Certainly there

are no corrections for these things in Loomio or Vilfredo or Votorola

or any of the other systems we've discussed or used on this list.



Speaking of which, I found I needed to refresh my memory on what

projects the Metagovernment web site used to have information on (back

when it was functioning), and I just discovered that you can do basic

browsing of the site on:
