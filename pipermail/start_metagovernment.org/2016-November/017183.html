While I don't believe that the mantra &quot;you can't improve what you

don't measure&quot; is *complete* BS (e.g.,

<A HREF="http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/02/10/if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it-is-bs/#9e22db33faed">http://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/02/10/if-you-cant-measure-it-you-cant-manage-it-is-bs/#9e22db33faed</A>),

this seems to me to be not a productive path for research on

government for several reasons:





As for me, I like qualitative as well as quantitative methods.





1) The timescale is too long: Unlike most organizations, especially

businesses, the timeframe for deciding whether a government decision

is &quot;good&quot;, at least if you're going to be assessing outcomes, takes

years to decades.





yes, but we do not need to start with the most difficult stuff.

You may start a company and run it with your &quot;stable intermediate forms matryoshka&quot; right now and create some interesting data. So, others may know how to set the matryoshka when starting.

It may be the sixth discipline (see Peter Senge).



2) Conflicting values makes it impossible to come up with a single

definition of &quot;good&quot;. Unlike business, where profitability is a

universal standard.





Yes, that is the usual approach, but not mine. The adjective is one: &quot;good&quot;, that is what I like to measure. One man that says &quot;good&quot; about decision1 + one woman that says &quot;good&quot; about decision1 = two people that say &quot;good&quot; about decision1





3) We really don't have any choice: Existing government is so bad that

the next version is going to look completely different, rendering any

sort of A/B comparison irrelevant (e.g., do we really need to have a

&quot;science&quot; to decide whether communism or fascism results in more

&quot;good&quot; outcomes than misrepresentative democracy?)





Well, I would like to compare meaningful stuff. E.g. Is 

Loomiobetter than AllOurIdeas and in what 

cases.Or even how much better, so you may decide whether you would like to go through the pain of discussion when deciding &quot;a color of the wall&quot;.





Again, I think we should be comfortable using an instantaneous measure

of the &quot;fit&quot; to the Will of the People to determine whether a decision

is &quot;good&quot; or not. Sure, that's going to occasionally result in minor

fiascos like the passage of California's Proposition 8 and the

election of Trump, but as long as the system supports review and

correction, that's OK. And I don't even consider Prop 8 a good

example: My evaluation is that not only did that vote not reflect the

general Will of the People (but rather that of a small number of

religious &quot;Activerts&quot;), but the fact that it was overturned by the

courts basically wasted a &quot;teachable moment&quot;. If we really believe in

direct democracy we have to accept that sometimes people will make bad

decisions.That isn't a problem as long as they're allowed to review

and correct them.





If you believe it, go for it. I will have one more system to compare. Maybe that it will excel in many fields, maybe just in some.

Also we may like to compare some systems of direct democracy.





 Which brings us to Trump: I have no idea whether

he'll make a good president or not. The main problem I see is that we

may end up having to suffer through at least 4 years of his rule, or

possibly even indefinitely, if he ends up behaving like most other

psychopathic leaders have...

 Regards,

 Scott
