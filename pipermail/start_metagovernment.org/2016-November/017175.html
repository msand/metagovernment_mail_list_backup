Sounds like a tall order to me. We barely understand social
engineering well enough to even *create* these alternative systems,
let alone have any idea how to predict their mutability. I'd have to
recommend against even *trying* any of these things except for the
fact that I have no doubt that we could hardly do any worse that our
current systems (e.g., polls today show Trump and Clinton in a dead
heat and while it should be abundantly clear that neither one should
be president, the fact that 40%+ of the population would choose to put
an obvious psychopath in office could mean that we're all doomed
unless we do *something*).
  Regards,
     Scott
