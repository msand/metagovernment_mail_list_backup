Right up our alley, that!

Seems unlikely to me given what they've chosen to publish so far:
Massive amounts of gloom and doom followed with prescriptions for
thrashing around like chickens with their heads cut off. I've only
skimmed about half of them, but several site-specific google searches
leaves no doubt that there isn't a credible proposal on the entire
site (e.g., the phrase &quot;direct democracy&quot; only appears 6 times on the
entire site, none of which are in actual proposals, and the same goes
for &quot;decision-making&quot;, which of course IMHO is pretty much the *only*
problem we really need to solve). It's mostly more of the same leftist
gobbledygook about how &quot;if we all could just be nice and generous to
each other, all these problems will just magically disappear!&quot; Good
thing we've got Donald Trump working full time to distract all that
kind of left-wing authoritarian such that they'll waste all their time
rioting in the streets instead of getting their act together enough
that they could actually inflict any of their half-baked communistic
plans on us ;-)

Still, we should at least try to get them to shed a little light on
what the real problems *and solutions* are. I'll hack up something out
of matchism.org (which is about 10 times the size they want). Starting
from scratch their minimum of 5K words is probably a full week's work
in this field, but fortunately most of us probably already have stuff
we can use as scaffolding (and filler ;-) If anyone wants to
collaborate on something, or just trade editing work, count me in!
  Regards,
    Scott
