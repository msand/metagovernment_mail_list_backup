An interesting combination, but it does have that same HO+HC pairing
that others on this list have, and which is apparently not well
matched by any political party.

&gt;<i> 1) To answer agree/disagree question I would need to know where other people
</I>&gt;<i> I know are relative to me on this test. These numbers do feel like a

</I>
I'm still leaning toward doing the matches on the raw scores rather
than after they've been processed into a FFI (Five Factor Inventory).
It's more computation, but might capture more of the available
information. Since we're not planning to report FFI to anyone, bias
isn't actually a problem, especially if it's correlated with one or
more of the other dimensions. For example if high neurosis individuals
have a bias away from the scale extremes it will *still* be possible
to to match them to the appropriate other high-neurosis individuals
because a least squares match will automatically become more sensitive
to that reduced range.

&gt;<i> 2) I am not concerned. And I doubt these numbers reveal my political views.
</I>
Actually I don't care about your &quot;political views&quot;. The goal is to
match your voting record, not your ideology or political party
affiliation or whatever. As soon as people start thinking &quot;Hmm, I'm a
libertarian, how would a libertarian vote on this tax issue?&quot; it's
game over in terms of expecting a rational or even representative
vote. Maintaining your group membership actually requires compromising
on your preferences and so I consider this a design flaw in our
current systems. There were no political parties in the EEA and, like
other types of organizations (corporations, police, the military,
organized religions, and indeed hierarchical government itself) they
are things that we clearly lack the built-in internal programming to
properly regulate. Which is why we need to use technology to boost our
very limited natural abilities.

And despite your doubts there is very clear evidence that your FFI
scores *are* predictive of your ideology. I'm not sure whether to use
the delusion that they don't as a marketing tool, but in general am
inclined to try to educate rather than manipulate (this may be a HO+HC
inclination, but there it is).

&gt;<i> How about matching those numbers to preferences on specific issues?
</I>
More importantly, can you use them to predict voting on specific
*proposals* regarding specific issues. For example it may be that high
conscientious individuals will vote against a proposal with an obvious
flaw in it even if they agree with it in general. *That's* the kind of
subtlety that I'm hoping AutoMatch will capture. Using a Big 5
inventory is just a rough first attempt at assessing this. My
prediction is that it will be pretty close. Far closer than going
through an intermediate step like party affiliation anyway. But we
will of course refine the inventory once we get enough data on actual
voting records.

    Scott
