Fair enough.  But the physics silliness represents any uniformity
postulate.  I have not looked at Tavistock since the mkultra days but the
idea was flying squads of psych types to go into say Ferguson and put the
appearance of polity back into place.  You notice we have the flying squads
but not the polity.  Not that it does not weaponize pretty well if you add
big bucks.

I am not a big fan of rational.

As far as Paul and Burns I did not ask you to find someone else's compare
and contrast.  How was it that Burns quit after the amendment passed and
Paul went on into the 70's?  How can you get to deep questions about
yourself if everything is TL; DR while every interesting relationship you
have to policy is also a relationship to meaning and purpose. Now you see
the physics model I assign to you because every relationship to policy by
everyone is to be stripped of meaning and purpose.

Take Furgeson.  An important abstraction is the town is broke and the
police departmental is a major revenue source.  The racism and classism
then points the police to raise revenue from the 30% black population who
are powerless.  But all the sudden the blacks are 70% of the population.
Boom!  Simple enough public policy issue. On the other side is the social
goal of a kind of empowerment sanity on both sides where we do not push out
APCs routinely and also we do not end up needing to put federal troops in
M60 tanks on the street.  I do not see you as really interested in either
side because they are both insolvable in your terms.  In my terms as well
but still it moves.
