&gt;<i> This all sounds good to me too and the system ought to facilitate dynamic organization like this as much as possible (working groups, etc.).  Where we run into problems I think are with more permanent structures (like that nightmare degenerate of this process, &quot;representative government&quot; ;-)
</I>
I imagine keeping the system flexible and responsive enough to deal with potential &#8220;degeneration&#8221; is possible through &#8220;dynamic&#8221; self-organization. Programming into the system from the beginning&#8230;..the ability for a quick and creative response to this kind of *noise* is key. 

My sense is that developing a successful (tiered) scaling model is the biggest hurdle.  What is the maximum group size we can gather and still make timely and intelligent decisions together? Then scaling becomes simply a numbers game. Population / ideal group size = # of tiers.

In terms of actual &#8216;representation&#8217;&#8230;.what I&#8217;m imagining is a completely different animal than the beast we have before us today.

&gt;<i> Yeah, but it's hard to anticipate all the ways people might try to game the system.  Better to build a robust counter to this kind of chicanery into the decision rule itself (IMHO this means ensuring the broad middle of the distribution curve are actually running the show).
</I>
Yeah, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine all the creative ways neurotypicals would come up with to *game the gamers*. A &quot;robust counter&#8221; might simply be the advantage inherent in the percent difference in size between the 2 populations. Authoritarians aren&#8217;t any smarter, nor would they be any more committed to their &#8220;chicanery&#8221; than neurotypicals would be to keeping the system free of these isolated perturbations.

&gt;<i> No amount of technology or resources will be sufficient if authoritarians can find a way to restrict access to it by whatever out-group they're targeting any particular week.  It's not their fault, it's just what they are genetically programmed to do.  
</I>
Agreed. And this authoritarian programming lives in all of us&#8230;..to varying degrees, depending on the situation. It&#8217;s an archetypal construct that served us well in the past - to protect the tribe from invaders or other forms of danger.  In Jungian terms one could say it&#8217;s a 'warrior' archetype. If someone  endangers my family in some immediate and apparent manner, my &#8216;warrior' is going to come online real fast.  It just needs to be held in check by the other archetypes - (the &#8216;sovereign&#8217;, the &#8216;magician&#8217;, and the &#8216;lover&#8217;).  It&#8217;s not evil in and of itself&#8230;.just out of balance. 

In my mind, it&#8217;s simply a question of how to channel this &#8216;energy&#8217; (or those individuals with a lot of it showing up in their personal psyche) towards support of &#8216;the tribe&#8217;. This of course will need to run parallel with&#8230;...the tribe includes *everyone*.

&gt;<i> So instead of great leaps in the technology of *things* what we really need is a leap forward in the technology of human organization to compensate for these instinctive behaviors.
</I>
Agreed. That is the preponderant task at hand. What would you say is the next best step to take?
