<PRE>I am sure you are in the right place.

So the historical utility function says if the town leading citizen does a
horrible murder and you know it and you can arrest him maybe you should
frame this black transiet instead and conveniently let him get linched.
Assume the sheriff is smart fearless and incorruptable

As a classical utilitarian you do this with the utility function you
specified

If you do not know the arguments in this it would be good to do a little
Reading.

I treat meaning as arbitary.
