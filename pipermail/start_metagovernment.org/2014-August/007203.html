<PRE>- I like where you are going with this. Though not fond of &quot;make them in
the best interest of human happiness&quot;. Too illusive and anthropocentric for
me. I think you could get rid of that and just tag &quot;to be directly and
equally involved in the discussions and decisions that affect them most.&quot;
onto the previous sentence.

I try to make a sense of the purpose of living, in the italian constitution
we say in art.1 that the foundation of our republic is based on work.
Technology is removing work and the constitution sound outdated. Work mean
income, income mean dignity in survival. As work is disappearing the only
purpose that will make our survival meaningful and decent, personally I
believe, is happiness. Happiness can only be fulfilled in a good
environment where all species are respected and protected.

I do not consider the search for happiness anthropocentric, If you can help
me rephrase in a way that will not sound illusive rather than &quot;get rid&quot; I
will be very glad.

- I am comfortable with specifying utilitaranism. And what is your utility
function. And then you probably do not support justice. And I do not
necessarily support equal or direct myself. I would as a separate question
think multiple sets of purpose might be created.

Libert&#232;, Egalit&#232;, Fraternit&#232; means also Justice as a value. If you do not
support at least this 3 values where equal (egalit&#232;) and direct are
metaconnected then I suspect I am in the wrong place! The individual
function should be modeled by each and everyone inner competencies, The
education process should enhance and bring out this competencies enhancing
the freedom (libert&#232;) of expression of each individual. The personal
security is the guaranteed of a stress less life, fraternity should be the
value to drive each individual to do not make to other what you don't want
to be done to you and do to other the good things you would like to receive.

i did summarize this by - best interest of human happiness -
should we get rid or is better to rephrase?
peace
