<PRE>I like where this is going. 
I (think I) started gen 11 (in Vilfredo) this morning with a modification to the last line of 2819, &#8230;.maybe I was supposed to send out a notification (Pietro?). 

Wherever we head from here works for me.  If we leave Vilfredo now, it seems appropriate to leave some feedback (and maybe a little gratitude) for the Dr.  :) +++

&gt;<i> My 2 cents: We should separate considerations of principle from considerations of Home Page text changes. To me, the difference between &quot;Direct Democacy online&quot; versus &quot;goverance&quot; should be considered as a matter of principle, and not snuck in disguised as a simple text change.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We now have a &quot;least common denominator&quot; home page. In my view, to make substantive changes to the text going forward, we would be well advised to turn to proposing and agreeing upon fundamental principles and such (as Scott among others has been suggesting). As we reach agreement regarding a principle, we can then manifest that agreement in the form of additions/modifications to the Home Page text (as a separate step).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For reaching agreement regarding those text changes (as distinguished from reaching agreement on the principles that lead to the text changes), I am thinking that Vilfredo may not be the best tool. Maybe we should give Airesis a try, or some other tool with a more fine-grained text-oriented approach than Vilfredo takes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Just as I finish, Scott's response arrives, so now I echo him ...)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Comparing support for 2819 to 2808 we gained two supporters but lost Ned c who initialized the original question.  It took some small effort on my part to get this data and I would encourage the software to make this trivial.  I assume there is no way in the software to know why Ned c did  not aparently vote at all.  Knowing who is playing and not playing over time would also be good to know.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did this exercise because I thought 2819 could be improve able.  For instance Scott might be happier if we added at the end of 2819 the words:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> , for example, Online Direct Democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I wonder if something in that format would get support from Scott or Ned?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You notice that here I am trying to look for more consensus.  I do not know that this hypothetical proposal would be useful in that goal and Ed seems anxious to DO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is there anyone who would prefer to vote from this hypothetical in a gen 11 as opposed for 2819?  Speak quickly or enter it because Gen 11 may close in a few days.
