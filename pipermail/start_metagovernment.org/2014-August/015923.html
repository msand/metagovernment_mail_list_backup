</I>Looks like Enspiral understands the best use of the various technologies
pretty clearly.  And it looks like an interesting organization and I hope
we learn a lot from their success (or failure).

&gt;<i> They used the same model as was mentioned in the first group.&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> (I want to call it *tiered scaling*, though I suppose you and others
</I>would probably call it *representative democracy*). Either way, it worked
really well for a group that size. I would like to see a much larger group
and another tier added to the scaling process sometime.

This all sounds good to me too and the system ought to facilitate dynamic
organization like this as much as possible (working groups, etc.).  Where
we run into problems I think are with more permanent structures (like that
nightmare degenerate of this process, &quot;representative government&quot; ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> and also tactics where a small minority try to get something passed by
</I>deception or other tricks (the example in my book is authoritarians,
who make up roughly 25% of the general population yet are the source
of most of the prejudiced and unethical behavior, doing something like
holding a vote during a holiday or trying to hide something nasty in
an otherwise harmless-looking proposal).


&gt;<i> I can imagine having an agreement about not allowing either of those.
</I>
Yeah, but it's hard to anticipate all the ways people might try to game the
system.  Better to build a robust counter to this kind of chicanery into
the decision rule itself (IMHO this means ensuring the broad middle of the
distribution curve are actually running the show).

&gt;<i> I think it&#8217;s a different world we&#8217;re merging into. Novelty is on an
</I>exponential curve.

The problem being we've got a whole new world of technology and the same
primitive instinctive behaviors being displayed by us unevolving humans.  I
have to laugh now every time I see one of these futurists predicting the
end to war and poverty and unhappiness because of some new technology.
 They just don't get it: Our problems aren't with our technology or with
lack of resources, they're the result of flaws *inside* of us that we
haven't built social systems to compensate for.  No amount of technology or
resources will be sufficient if authoritarians can find a way to restrict
access to it by whatever out-group they're targeting any particular week.
 It's not their fault, it's just what they are genetically programmed to
do.  So instead of great leaps in the technology of *things* what we really
need is a leap forward in the technology of human organization to
compensate for these instinctive behaviors.
  Regards,
    Scott
