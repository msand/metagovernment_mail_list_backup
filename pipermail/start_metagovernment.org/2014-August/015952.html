<PRE>Explained in this manner, &quot;Disputation Arena&quot; take a really interesting
twist. Given in the same spot, could result in a very lively discussion
area, you make me feel like posting this in the Airesis  Public Area.
I do believe that at least 75% of the issues 1,2,3,4, can be resolved by
finding a practical solution to 1, we are very far away from finding a
solution.

I do believe that this could also be used as a valid tool to scientifically
resolve major scandals, imagine the question &quot;911 Scientific Truth Finding
Commission&quot; At the end shouldn't be a valid answer to every question given
the minimum requirement  to be?, and if proven and found a responsible
entity, shouldn't be prosecuted and given a fair conviction? Here we answer
another maxim, the truth will set you free, one of Jesus best answers.
Good Night
J

Thank you for the pearl!

PS LOOKING FOR OBJECTIVE EDITORS!!!!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have just triggered the move from voting to proposing. A proposal that

</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, I'm thinking these intervals are a little short: I had intended
</I>&gt;<i> to do a proposal mutation this round but by the time it bubbled up in
</I>&gt;<i> my queue the proposal phase had ended (24 hours?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I've done a proposal I found something else I believe needs
</I>&gt;<i> work in Vilfredo, the tracking of comments/questions.  One of the
</I>&gt;<i> things I was looking forward to seeing were comments on my (defeated)
</I>&gt;<i> proposal but I don't see any way to go back and see them.  Seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> there should be a button on the page created for each proposal that
</I>&gt;<i> shows all of the comments/questions for that proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My 2 cents on &quot;Disputation Arenas&quot; to maybe head off use of that link
</I>&gt;<i> in future proposals.  There are many good ideas and suggestions on
</I>&gt;<i> that page (<A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>), but
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally it seems to me to rely on a faulty understanding of what
</I>&gt;<i> the problems really are.  Take some of the major issues in the news
</I>&gt;<i> today that presumably would be grist for this mill:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Is wealth inequality a problem or not, and if so what should we do
</I>&gt;<i> about it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Jobs and economic growth, or preservation of the environment and
</I>&gt;<i> quality of life?  (e.g., regarding fracking which is a pretty huge
</I>&gt;<i> issue here in Boulder County)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Do we send those Central American kids back, or let them stay?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) What do we do about Boko Haram (Nigeria), ISIS (Iraq), Palestinians
</I>&gt;<i> vs Israel, and Putin?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main thing that characterizes all of these is that there is simply
</I>&gt;<i> insufficient information about each of them that would allow us to
</I>&gt;<i> make completely rational decisions (we don't understand the economy or
</I>&gt;<i> political economy well enough to make predictions on #1, don't even
</I>&gt;<i> know our relative priorities on #2 because we've never systematically
</I>&gt;<i> surveyed The People on these issues, and both of the above apply to #3
</I>&gt;<i> and #4).  Secondly even if we did have the information to answer them,
</I>&gt;<i> there are a significant minority of the population that would simply
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to take any action that goes against their prejudices (e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> the solution to #4 requires taking steps against religion and
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarianism in general, which I say 25% of the population will
</I>&gt;<i> simply try to obstruct because that's what their instincts tell them
</I>&gt;<i> to do and no amount of rational discourse will change their minds
</I>&gt;<i> because they're not using their minds to render the decision!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But a Disputation Arena seems to assume everything is a philosophical
</I>&gt;<i> question and that rational inquiry and debate will lead us to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;right&quot; answer.  This is simply a naive view of the way decisions on
</I>&gt;<i> these issues need to be made.  Sure there are good ideas in there
</I>&gt;<i> about how to organize the &quot;battle&quot; between opposing forces, but that's
</I>&gt;<i> simply what democracy is, and rather than fart around debating
</I>&gt;<i> philosophical issues where the end result really doesn't matter, these
</I>&gt;<i> techniques must be integrated into a law-making platform where the end
</I>&gt;<i> result is not &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot;, but
</I>&gt;<i> merely the passage of a law or policy that addresses the issue in as
</I>&gt;<i> optimal a manner as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for 2790 and 2799, they both seem pretty watered down to me, but
</I>&gt;<i> maybe that's just what the end result of this process is destined to
</I>&gt;<i> be.  Seems to me what we really need is to take polls on the
</I>&gt;<i> individual philosophical elements so that we can at least get *some*
</I>&gt;<i> of them onto that page (i.e., against representative democracy, for
</I>&gt;<i> proxies/delegates and radical transparency).
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
