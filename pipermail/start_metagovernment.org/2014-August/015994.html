<PRE>I see here a very distinctive evolution, I may agree with some of your
objection, but coming from &quot;old&quot; Europe from the 70's generation there are
some point where I will remain in disagreement.

Discussing principles in an Airesis proposal sound interesting, the ML is
really the wrong place it may work for more logistic or short discussion
but to follow an interesting discussion like this one, is definitely not!

I'll try to answer shortly to some of the issue arise here:
Work
work as we knew about is disappearing. Making something is not work, make
something to get paid for is work and going to be harder and harder and
either we share the remaining load or a lot of people will be standing.
Tecnology, automation, are going to kill many work that exist today, self
driving car will send million of driver to unemployment, 3d printing in
it's many form &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_metal_laser_sintering</A>&gt;
will put many manufacture in crisis. Is not far away the day where we will
be able to print a complete engine in a single shot and why not a gun if
necessary!
Surely some one will still serve you a coffee in a Starbucks cafe!

I can live with &quot;Humane Happiness&quot; and &quot;freedom to live their lives as they
choose&quot;, I like the first but the concept is very hard to keep short and
include in it common sense. Regarding the Utilitarian concept I personally
oppose such scenario if you can push under a trolley a pedestrian you
can definitely trow yourself and in many case this as happened. Utilitarian
concept may be acceptable if and when will not contrasted with the
fraternity concept and freedom concept.  Utilitarian as in sacrifice one
for the many sound to me the perfect mix to start a war! Sacrifice many for
the myriad! Ouch! Give me some soma please!

I did not read the full text of the American Constitution but the fact that
there is the happiness concept, sound interesting and I am glad to know.
Defining the concept... by the standard on wich should be based... like
Steve suggested... freedom, clean air and water, a pervasive connection
with the whole of life I will add repudiation of  war, free education, free
health care, free soma etc etc may become a long list, very long list and
we may never find an agreement! Not even in Airesis! :-) Looking forward to
see this exercise, I will be very glad if Ned take the lead by opening the
proposal when the times come, let's complete the Vilfredo, for this session
I voted mine but I hope to see a mutation, if not I will cease voting for
my own and go with the flow....

Peace

</I>&gt;<i> little of that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so we may just have to go with something like &quot;freedom to live their

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes!  As long as they&#8217;re not there dumping their garbage in the creek.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for utilitarianism, it's not *horrible*, but again, something I
</I>&gt;<i> believe is fundamentally incompatible with our natures.  The classic
</I>&gt;<i> example is the trolley thought experiment (i.e., do you push an
</I>&gt;<i> innocent bystander in front of a runaway trolley car to stop it and
</I>&gt;<i> save the 5 people on it?)  Utilitarian philosophy says you sacrifice
</I>&gt;<i> the one for the many.  Our instinctive moral code says you don't.  I
</I>&gt;<i> find this example particularly illuminating because as it turns out
</I>&gt;<i> autistics and sociopaths usually get this one wrong because they are
</I>&gt;<i> highly rule-based and rational beings.  They may very well be our
</I>&gt;<i> evolutionary future, but for now our policy making systems need to
</I>&gt;<i> work with instinctive moral codes as much as possible, which rules out
</I>&gt;<i> utilitarianism, at least in its most extreme forms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I also vote we quit dicking around with
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo until we're ready to take on the question of common guiding
</I>&gt;<i> principles&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not set that up on Airesis?  I think we could finish out 'the home
</I>&gt;<i> page intro' with Vifredo and see if there are any *principles* we might
</I>&gt;<i> agree on with Airesis.   I would be happy with that!  + + +  :)
