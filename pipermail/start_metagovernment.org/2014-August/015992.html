Discussing the objections to the Vilfredo proposals on the mailing
list?  What a concept!

</I>&gt;<i> believe, is happiness. Happiness can only be fulfilled in a good environment
</I>&gt;<i> where all species are respected and protected.
</I>
I disagree.  With two things.  First, &quot;work&quot; is not going to disappear
because requiring people to work (i.e., punishment of free-riders) is
one of our very strongest instinctive drives (even stronger than
tribalism) and simply not practical to try to override.  If we don't
need people to manufacture things, more of them will just have to be
artists (or whatever).  They *have* to do *something*!

Secondly, taking a more philosophical point of view, happiness is
hardly appropriate as the ultimate goal of humanity.  Lots of people
live good and worthwhile lives who aren't happy (those suffering for
their art being a good example ;-)  Plus, we can't have consensus on
this anyway, so I'd oppose it being in any statement of principles.

&gt;<i> I do not consider the search for happiness anthropocentric, If you can help
</I>&gt;<i> me rephrase in a way that will not sound illusive rather than &quot;get rid&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> will be very glad.
</I>
I don't know of any reliable substitute (even the the Declaration of
Indipendence phrasing &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; I think doesn't work), so
we may just have to go with something like &quot;freedom to live their
lives as they choose&quot;.

&gt;<i> - I am comfortable with specifying utilitaranism. And what is your utility
</I>&gt;<i> function. And then you probably do not support justice. And I do not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily support equal or direct myself. I would as a separate question
</I>&gt;<i> think multiple sets of purpose might be created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Libert&#232;, Egalit&#232;, Fraternit&#232; means also Justice as a value. If you do not
</I>&gt;<i> support at least this 3 values where equal (egalit&#232;) and direct are
</I>&gt;<i> metaconnected then I suspect I am in the wrong place!
</I>
I've no problem with the first two, but the last one is out because
it's incompatible with the second: &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (besides being
sexist) is directly contradictory with egalitarianism because it
implies that there is an out-group who are not in that category.

As for utilitarianism, it's not *horrible*, but again, something I
believe is fundamentally incompatible with our natures.  The classic
example is the trolley thought experiment (i.e., do you push an
innocent bystander in front of a runaway trolley car to stop it and
save the 5 people on it?)  Utilitarian philosophy says you sacrifice
the one for the many.  Our instinctive moral code says you don't.  I
find this example particularly illuminating because as it turns out
autistics and sociopaths usually get this one wrong because they are
highly rule-based and rational beings.  They may very well be our
evolutionary future, but for now our policy making systems need to
work with instinctive moral codes as much as possible, which rules out
utilitarianism, at least in its most extreme forms.

&gt;<i> The individual
</I>&gt;<i> function should be modeled by each and everyone inner competencies, The
</I>&gt;<i> education process should enhance and bring out this competencies enhancing
</I>&gt;<i> the freedom (libert&#232;) of expression of each individual. The personal
</I>&gt;<i> security is the guaranteed of a stress less life, fraternity should be the
</I>&gt;<i> value to drive each individual to do not make to other what you don't want
</I>&gt;<i> to be done to you and do to other the good things you would like to receive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i did summarize this by - best interest of human happiness -
</I>&gt;<i> should we get rid or is better to rephrase?
</I>
I vote we get rid of it.  And I also vote we quit dicking around with
Vilfredo until we're ready to take on the question of common guiding
principles...
  Regards,
    Scott
