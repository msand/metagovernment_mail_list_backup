<PRE>The remark that &quot;it can not not be&quot; is pleasing.  It reminds me of the
quasi sciencism:

the theory will be so obvious that everyone will say:

Oh, of course, how could it have been otherwise?

</I>&gt;<i> My belief is that collaboration isn't necessary or indeed probably

</I>&gt;<i> (though some of those actors may be other special interest groups
</I>&gt;<i> composed of multiple individuals).  And that you *have* to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> that's the way things will get started because these special interest
</I>&gt;<i> groups are where all the energy required to shape a proposal will be
</I>&gt;<i> found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was involved with the Anti Nuke movement in the early 80&#8217;s (Diablo
</I>&gt;<i> Canyon). I was a part of an affinity group called the &#8220;guides collective&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> We kept watch on the plant for several months prior to the Blockade and
</I>&gt;<i> then during the action we led *affinity groups* through the canyon to the
</I>&gt;<i> back gate of the nuke. We would send a representative to the Spokes Council
</I>&gt;<i> where decisions were made for the *Abalone Alliance* (the group at large).
</I>&gt;<i>  Very similar to #Occupy&#8230;..though the group dynamics were a little less
</I>&gt;<i> refined back then. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the 90&#8217;s I was with a group from Salt Lake that was protesting nuke
</I>&gt;<i> testing in Nevada. One of the actions I attended began early on a Saturday
</I>&gt;<i> afternoon in a large conference hall in Vegas. Around 250 people gathered
</I>&gt;<i> in the room early in the afternoon to come up with an action plan for the
</I>&gt;<i> next day. It was a fairly typical cross-section of *anywhere* America
</I>&gt;<i> (doctors, lawyers, housewives, hippies, ranchers, children, and so on). The
</I>&gt;<i> conflict at times was a bit intense. One group wanted to burn the flag as a
</I>&gt;<i> symbolic protest. Another wanted to be able to hop the fence and run amok
</I>&gt;<i> on the test site. It was a little crazy for awhile. The facilitation was
</I>&gt;<i> amazing though&#8230;.and by the end of the afternoon, all 250 people walked out
</I>&gt;<i> of the room all-lined-up for the next days action. It was one of the
</I>&gt;<i> coolest things I&#8217;ve experienced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They used the same model as was mentioned in the first group.&#8230;(I want to
</I>&gt;<i> call it *tiered scaling*, though I suppose you and others would probably
</I>&gt;<i> call it *representative democracy*). Either way, it worked really well for
</I>&gt;<i> a group that size. I would like to see a much larger group and another tier
</I>&gt;<i> added to the scaling process sometime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, the group in Nevada was deeply *synergized*. And that kind of
</I>&gt;<i> empowerment has created many significant changes in the past. We arrived
</I>&gt;<i> committed to something that held deep meaning&#8230;.and left in a deep
</I>&gt;<i> *coherence*. It was powerful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  And that can go either way&#8230;..  That's why we need to have a check on the
</I>&gt;<i> influence of the *authoritarian* complex (as you&#8217;re good at reminding us
</I>&gt;<i> about).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least 25% of the registered voters have to vote yes.  This weeds
</I>&gt;<i> out proposals that a large majority just don't see the need to even
</I>&gt;<i> inform themselves on (and so couldn't cast an informed vote on)...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if it gets that complicated or apathetic we need to scale down in
</I>&gt;<i> some major way. Humans need to have a life as well. If we create a system
</I>&gt;<i> that has that kind of vibe to it, I think it&#8217;s probably doomed to fail.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually we don&#8217;t have to create that&#8230;.we have it now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and also tactics where a small minority try to get something passed by
</I>&gt;<i> deception or other tricks (the example in my book is authoritarians,
</I>&gt;<i> who make up roughly 25% of the general population yet are the source
</I>&gt;<i> of most of the prejudiced and unethical behavior, doing something like
</I>&gt;<i> holding a vote during a holiday or trying to hide something nasty in
</I>&gt;<i> an otherwise harmless-looking proposal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can imagine having an agreement about not allowing either of those.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the evolving part, but we need to help that along by
</I>&gt;<i> creating systems that *support* this evolved conception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8230;.and we are doing just that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for whether consensus is a reasonable goal, you've got your food coop,
</I>&gt;<i> I've got a list of HOA Board failures a mile long (some of which have
</I>&gt;<i> cost me personally a lot of time and money).  HOAs IMHO being a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more representative of how the general population behaves than more
</I>&gt;<i> specialized organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think it&#8217;s a different world we&#8217;re merging into. Novelty is on an
</I>&gt;<i> exponential curve.  Anywhere you look genetics, space, robotics, clean
</I>&gt;<i> energy tech, nano tech, communication tech, and on and on&#8230;.  Why wouldn&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> it be the same for how society organizes itself?   It can&#8217;t *not *be.
</I>&gt;<i>  There are currently way too many stressors and other influences for the
</I>&gt;<i> systems of organization to *not* to change as well&#8230;.and radically.  And
</I>&gt;<i> what&#8217;s emerging in that realm&#8230;.. is emerging here.  We are at the point of
</I>&gt;<i> possibility.  No, we *are* the point of possibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the
</I>&gt;<i> membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit their
</I>&gt;<i> abuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This kind of thing is difficult to structure legally, however,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if there are financial interests involved (i.e., you have
</I>&gt;<i> to have a well structured way to buy out the offenders, since you
</I>&gt;<i> can't just deprive them of the ability to perform their fiduciary duty
</I>&gt;<i> to their investments).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that is the rub on that one isn&#8217;t it.
</I>&gt;<i> Max mentioned this earlier and he pretty much sometimes seems to know what
</I>&gt;<i> he&#8217;s talking about&#8230;.(that is, when I can understand him). :)
</I>&gt;<i> Oops&#8230;..he just snuck one in ahead of me.   Oh did he just flipflop?
</I>&gt;<i>  Maybe. huh?  (see what I mean).  :)
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m going to ponder, while  you two 'wrasle&#8217; this for a bit.
