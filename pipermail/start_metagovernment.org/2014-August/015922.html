<PRE>Here&#8217;s a cool trailer for the (Google) Lunar X-prise competition.
<A HREF="http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/education/domeshow">http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/education/domeshow</A>

Then you have this 21 year old who&#8217;s started China&#8217;s first private rocket firm.

And then, of course you have Elon (building rocket engine parts on a 3d printer) and his firm Space X going to Mars sometime (soon).

Space travel is undergoing a huge transformation.  Indeed, everywhere one looks, innovation is happening at blinding speed&#8230;.except, of course, in how we govern ourselves as a society.

I think what&#8217;s missing in this regard is a vehicle of empowerment. Cynicism, apathy, and pessimism run rampant because it&#8217;s so clear the old system is fucked&#8230;..and yet there are no viable alternatives (yet) to take it&#8217;s place. 

Imagine a scalable, crowd sourced, self-organizing global network, using various DD software systems, to develop proposals for X-prize like projects&#8230;.that are crowd funded by the Network.

Projects like:
Carbon sequestration research enterprises.
Global Banking Cooperatives (owned by the network).
A Big Sister coalition to keep an eye on Big Brother.
International permaculture research stations.
A climate change refugee arbitration and amelioration council.
Boycott - naming the corporations and their products/practices most responsible for perpetuating the shitty mess we are in.
Citizen alliances to clean and protect all water ways and bodies.
Global teams focussed on replanting forests lost to clear cutting.
And so on&#8230;..

If people discovered they had a voice that wasn&#8217;t going to get stepped on by some vested interest&#8230;..that they could contribute to a global mechanism that was actually accomplishing some really amazing things.  It could be pretty awesome.   And it could have a really big footprint.  Big enough to step on the momentum of the current bottom-line-rape-and-pillage paradigm.
I think it&#8217;s inevitable that something like this will surface soon. All the parts and pieces are already emergent. I just want to gather them up and plug them in....to each other.
