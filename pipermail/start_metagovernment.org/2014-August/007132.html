</I>
I was involved with the Anti Nuke movement in the early 80&#8217;s (Diablo Canyon). I was a part of an affinity group called the &#8220;guides collective&quot;. We kept watch on the plant for several months prior to the Blockade and then during the action we led *affinity groups* through the canyon to the back gate of the nuke. We would send a representative to the Spokes Council where decisions were made for the *Abalone Alliance* (the group at large).  Very similar to #Occupy&#8230;..though the group dynamics were a little less refined back then. :)

In the 90&#8217;s I was with a group from Salt Lake that was protesting nuke testing in Nevada. One of the actions I attended began early on a Saturday afternoon in a large conference hall in Vegas. Around 250 people gathered in the room early in the afternoon to come up with an action plan for the next day. It was a fairly typical cross-section of *anywhere* America (doctors, lawyers, housewives, hippies, ranchers, children, and so on). The conflict at times was a bit intense. One group wanted to burn the flag as a symbolic protest. Another wanted to be able to hop the fence and run amok on the test site. It was a little crazy for awhile. The facilitation was amazing though&#8230;.and by the end of the afternoon, all 250 people walked out of the room all-lined-up for the next days action. It was one of the coolest things I&#8217;ve experienced. 

They used the same model as was mentioned in the first group.&#8230;(I want to call it *tiered scaling*, though I suppose you and others would probably call it *representative democracy*). Either way, it worked really well for a group that size. I would like to see a much larger group and another tier added to the scaling process sometime.

In my mind, the group in Nevada was deeply *synergized*. And that kind of empowerment has created many significant changes in the past. We arrived committed to something that held deep meaning&#8230;.and left in a deep *coherence*. It was powerful.

 And that can go either way&#8230;..  That's why we need to have a check on the influence of the *authoritarian* complex (as you&#8217;re good at reminding us about).

&gt;<i> At least 25% of the registered voters have to vote yes.  This weeds
</I>&gt;<i> out proposals that a large majority just don't see the need to even
</I>&gt;<i> inform themselves on (and so couldn't cast an informed vote on)...
</I>
I think if it gets that complicated or apathetic we need to scale down in some major way. Humans need to have a life as well. If we create a system that has that kind of vibe to it, I think it&#8217;s probably doomed to fail. Actually we don&#8217;t have to create that&#8230;.we have it now.

&gt;<i> and also tactics where a small minority try to get something passed by
</I>&gt;<i> deception or other tricks (the example in my book is authoritarians,
</I>&gt;<i> who make up roughly 25% of the general population yet are the source
</I>&gt;<i> of most of the prejudiced and unethical behavior, doing something like
</I>&gt;<i> holding a vote during a holiday or trying to hide something nasty in
</I>&gt;<i> an otherwise harmless-looking proposal).
</I>
I can imagine having an agreement about not allowing either of those. 

&gt;<i> I agree with the evolving part, but we need to help that along by
</I>&gt;<i> creating systems that *support* this evolved conception.  
</I>
&#8230;.and we are doing just that.  

&gt;<i> As for whether consensus is a reasonable goal, you've got your food coop,
</I>&gt;<i> I've got a list of HOA Board failures a mile long (some of which have
</I>&gt;<i> cost me personally a lot of time and money).  HOAs IMHO being a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more representative of how the general population behaves than more
</I>&gt;<i> specialized organizations.
</I>
I think it&#8217;s a different world we&#8217;re merging into. Novelty is on an exponential curve.  Anywhere you look genetics, space, robotics, clean energy tech, nano tech, communication tech, and on and on&#8230;.  Why wouldn&#8217;t it be the same for how society organizes itself?   It can&#8217;t not be.  There are currently way too many stressors and other influences for the systems of organization to not to change as well&#8230;.and radically.  And what&#8217;s emerging in that realm&#8230;.. is emerging here.  We are at the point of possibility.  No, we are the point of possibility.

&gt;&gt;<i> My thinking is that allowing &#8220;blocks&#8221;...along side the ability of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> membership to expel someone who uses them irresponsibly should limit their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abuse.
</I>
&gt;<i> This kind of thing is difficult to structure legally, however,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if there are financial interests involved (i.e., you have
</I>&gt;<i> to have a well structured way to buy out the offenders, since you
</I>&gt;<i> can't just deprive them of the ability to perform their fiduciary duty
</I>&gt;<i> to their investments).
</I>
Yes, that is the rub on that one isn&#8217;t it.
Max mentioned this earlier and he pretty much sometimes seems to know what he&#8217;s talking about&#8230;.(that is, when I can understand him). :)
Oops&#8230;..he just snuck one in ahead of me.   Oh did he just flipflop?  Maybe. huh?  (see what I mean).  :)
I&#8217;m going to ponder, while  you two 'wrasle&#8217; this for a bit.
