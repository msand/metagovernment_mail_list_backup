<PRE>Props to Doctor+

We have been reasonable rats for demoing some behaviors visibly yet getting
this close to agreement.  Thus I see wins all around.

</I>&gt;<i> We now have a &quot;least common denominator&quot; home page. In my view, to make

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For reaching agreement regarding those text changes (as distinguished from

</I>&gt;<i> I did this exercise because I thought 2819 could be improve able.  For

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if something in that format would get support from Scott or Ned?
