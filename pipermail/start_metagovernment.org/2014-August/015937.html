I'm thinking this either a missing part of the instructions for
Vilfredo, or indeed a design flaw: How are we to distinguish
&quot;consensus&quot; from just having the majority burn out on the issue and
deciding that it's just not worth the trouble anymore?  In which case
it is not &quot;consensus&quot; that has been achieved, but simply a &quot;last man
standing&quot; decision rule...

Seems to me the only solution to this problem is for everyone to vote
*every time*, even if it's just to not change any of the thumbs from
their default &quot;up&quot; orientation and hit submit.  Other options would be
to allow (require) delegating proxies once you see that all the
options are acceptable, or to simply set an automated vote of &quot;any of
these, but nothing new&quot; for all the proposals in a given round that
would carry forward to every subsequent round.

</I>&gt;<i> millions or countless are not substantial. In a way I wish and I work for

</I>
I've no problem with this part: In any real-world decision there will
be far more simple voters than proposers.  I do feel that if you vote
against something that you provide the reason, which is something
Vilfredo does nicely ensure.

&gt;<i> The proposal you put on loomio what number have?, I just visited the page
</I>&gt;<i> and see only 4 versions, 2766, 2767, 2769, 2790 available for mutation.
</I>&gt;<i> Related to the &quot;issues part&quot; I do not believe that should be placed in the

</I>&gt;<i> in the participation rather than explaining concept that can be explored.
</I>&gt;<i> Again is not important to the point of making me disagree!
</I>
I think it doesn't have a number yet.  That will presumably be
generated automatically at the start of the second (voting) phase.  I
see it in my screen at the bottom of things I have proposed.  Not sure
if the design should be changed so that these new proposals are
visible to other proposers: On the one hand it would make the process
more efficient because it might prevent duplicate entries (which if we
were using the system right and evaluating individual statements would
be a big problem), but on the other hand might suppress the best
options because proposers might just accept what others have written
as &quot;close enough&quot; and not even take the time to propose their own
(which might be better in some small way).

    Scott
