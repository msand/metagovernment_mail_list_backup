<PRE>Comparing support for 2819 to 2808 we gained two supporters but lost Ned c
who initialized the original question.  It took some small effort on my
part to get this data and I would encourage the software to make this
trivial.  I assume there is no way in the software to know why Ned c did
not aparently vote at all.  Knowing who is playing and not playing over
time would also be good to know.

I did this exercise because I thought 2819 could be improve able.  For
instance Scott might be happier if we added at the end of 2819 the words:

, for example, Online Direct Democracy.

I wonder if something in that format would get support from Scott or Ned?

You notice that here I am trying to look for more consensus.  I do not know
that this hypothetical proposal would be useful in that goal and Ed seems
anxious to DO.

Is there anyone who would prefer to vote from this hypothetical in a gen 11
as opposed for 2819?  Speak quickly or enter it because Gen 11 may close in
a few days.
