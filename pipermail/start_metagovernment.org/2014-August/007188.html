<PRE>One proposal has won the Vilfredo voting in generation 10. I am copying it below.

I propose that we make that the home page. By the currently-standing rules, this proposal should pass if people vote for it by a margin of 2-to-1 in the next week.

In addition to voting for or against this proposal, you can also make new proposals on Vilfredo:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

As an interim measure, I am changing the home page to this version now. If anyone disagrees with this interim change, feel free to revert my change immediately; no discussion required.

Here is the Gen 10 draft:

A myriad of public decisions are made each year that affect the quality of our lives, the health of our biosphere, and the welfare of future generations. Regrettably, these decisions are often made without our participation.

Metagovernment is a community of people who are exploring and developing various technologies that would allow citizens to be directly involved in the discussions and decisions that affect them most.

We explore, challenge, and collaborate with each other in the development of various ideas and technologies for these new governance systems.

Our forum is uniquely neutral ground. We enjoy an abundance of visions which often makes for very lively discussions.

Please join our community and help us to develop these next iterations of governance.
