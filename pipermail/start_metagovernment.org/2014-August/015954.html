That, IMHO, is because there isn't one!  These are philosophical
discussions where people will always feel free to go with their
instincts and prejudices and to ignore rational arguments.  I think
our only hope is to actually present them with a simple decision, like
&quot;should we raise the estate tax to 80% &quot; and then present a simple
list of pros (e.g., that's what it was in 1950s and 1960s, an
unequaled era of prosperity) and cons (Walmart would have to change
management style from their current, obviously effective, system),
with no philosophy whatsoever allowed.  My prediction is that you'll
get a decision, and more likely the right decision, than anything a
philosophical debate like a &quot;DA&quot; would provide us.

&gt;<i> I do believe that this could also be used as a valid tool to scientifically

</I>
I have these kinds of debates with my family all the time, and
generally end up taking the position that &quot;Truth&quot;, at least in these
arenas, is subjective.  The way forward is to concentrate on &quot;facts&quot;
and do our work trying to ensure that the decisions are based on those
facts rather than trying to get to the &quot;Truth&quot; first and work our way
back to the decisions.  Sure, the set of facts we have access to
changes from day to day (unlike the &quot;Truth&quot;, which by its very nature
should be a constant) and so the decisions may have to be redone as a
result.  But that's simply better than our current mode of &quot;no truth,
no decision!&quot;

    Scott
