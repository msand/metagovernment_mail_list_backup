I think you have it backwards: I'm the one claiming they're
irrational, and in many cases driven primarily by selfishness,
tribalism, and other instinctive behaviors rather than some internal
goodness and cooperative spirit that the &quot;consensus&quot; proponents hope
to be able to tap into.  I think we should be working to develop
systems that work *in spite of* these flaws rather than fantasizing
that some miracle of technology will peel all of that away and tap
into some well of rationality (and the apparently required wellspring
of time and effort that I also doubt exists).

&gt;<i> Yah I know but I do think of you sometimes as having come out of Tavistock

</I>
Sorry, all I find on this are a bunch of conspiracy-theory sites...

&gt;<i> If you need to change the world you may wish to compare and contrast Alice
</I>&gt;<i> Paul and Lucy Burns.  Burns bitterly burned brightly.
</I>
Again, I get nothing on this.  They were friends and worked in the
same organization (for women's suffrage) and I find little to compare
or contrast...

But these are my positions, and I haven't seen yours.  What are they?
  Regards,
    Scott
