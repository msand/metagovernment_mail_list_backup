<PRE>On Tue, Aug 26, 2014 at 11:44 PM, Jacopo Tolja &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">jacopo.tolja at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I see here a very distinctive evolution, I may agree with some of your

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Discussing principles in an Airesis proposal sound interesting, the ML is

</I>&gt;<i> to follow an interesting discussion like this one, is definitely not!
</I>
Guess I'm an even more &quot;old fogey&quot; than you, then.  I actually prefer
threaded conversations in email where *I* have the copies of
everything that's been said and can refer back to them.  All these
newfangled discussion-management systems just don't seem like a big
improvement to me...

&gt;<i> I'll try to answer shortly to some of the issue arise here:
</I>&gt;<i> Work
</I>&gt;<i> work as we knew about is disappearing. Making something is not work, make
</I>&gt;<i> something to get paid for is work and going to be harder and harder and
</I>&gt;<i> either we share the remaining load or a lot of people will be standing.
</I>&gt;<i> Tecnology, automation, are going to kill many work that exist today, self
</I>&gt;<i> driving car will send million of driver to unemployment, 3d printing in it's
</I>&gt;<i> many form will put many manufacture in crisis. Is not far away the day where
</I>&gt;<i> we will be able to print a complete engine in a single shot and why not a
</I>&gt;<i> gun if necessary!
</I>&gt;<i> Surely some one will still serve you a coffee in a Starbucks cafe!
</I>
I'm happy to have a machine serve me coffee or even fast food, and I
think you'll get used to it too.  I'm not in any position to predict
*what* all these unemployed drivers and service-industry workers will
be doing, I just know that they'll have to be doing *something* or the
rest of the population will find a way to punish them, because that is
just our instinctive nature.  I'm hoping that it will be something
that improves the world aesthetically (art, music, drama, gardening,
etc), because the most likely alternative to that is setting them to
work building pyramids ;-)

&gt;<i> I can live with &quot;Humane Happiness&quot; and &quot;freedom to live their lives as they
</I>&gt;<i> choose&quot;, I like the first but the concept is very hard to keep short and
</I>&gt;<i> include in it common sense. Regarding the Utilitarian concept I personally
</I>&gt;<i> oppose such scenario if you can push under a trolley a pedestrian you can
</I>&gt;<i> definitely trow yourself and in many case this as happened. Utilitarian
</I>&gt;<i> concept may be acceptable if and when will not contrasted with the
</I>&gt;<i> fraternity concept and freedom concept.  Utilitarian as in sacrifice one for
</I>&gt;<i> the many sound to me the perfect mix to start a war! Sacrifice many for the
</I>&gt;<i> myriad! Ouch! Give me some soma please!
</I>
Utilitarianism does have a big problem with altruism, both in
requiring it and predicting and accounting for it when it occurs
naturally.  It also has a lot of trouble incorporating other
instinctive behavior.  The standard handwaving response is that these
things are all to be incorporated into the utility function, but
without any explicit instructions how to get the data or how to
incorporate it into the decision-making process. These are issues I'm
currently trying to reconcile in my Plan.

&gt;<i> I did not read the full text of the American Constitution but the fact that
</I>&gt;<i> there is the happiness concept, sound interesting and I am glad to know.
</I>
There are actually two documents I recommend reading, the Declaration
of Independence (announcing the break from our English overlords) and
the actual Constitution.  They're both relatively short and inform not
only because there are some good ideas in them, but also because you
can see a lot of ways they failed to deliver on their promises.  I
also recommend reading the USSR constitution(s) which superficially
closely resemble the US constitution but if you can read carefully
you'll see how they turned the whole thing upside down by putting in
just a few sentences about how the Party is the ultimate authority on
*everything* (and of course there is no carefully laid out description
of how the Party actually works).

&gt;<i> Defining the concept... by the standard on wich should be based... like
</I>&gt;<i> Steve suggested... freedom, clean air and water, a pervasive connection with
</I>&gt;<i> the whole of life I will add repudiation of  war, free education, free
</I>&gt;<i> health care, free soma etc etc may become a long list, very long list and we
</I>&gt;<i> may never find an agreement! Not even in Airesis! :-)
</I>
A long list should be fine as long as we have an efficient tool for
prioritizing it (them) and making the cutoff for what's on the home
page.

&gt;<i>  Looking forward to see
</I>&gt;<i> this exercise, I will be very glad if Ned take the lead by opening the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal when the times come, let's complete the Vilfredo, for this session
</I>&gt;<i> I voted mine but I hope to see a mutation, if not I will cease voting for my
</I>&gt;<i> own and go with the flow....
</I>
I keep saying, It's Done!  Let's move on (so I don't have to keep
checking it to make sure nobody tries to sneak something in..)
  Scott

&gt;<i> Peace
</I>&gt;<i> j
