<PRE>Ok, let's try Vilfredo for lists:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Steve,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no there is no need to send out a notification. Vilfredo should do it by
</I>&gt;<i> itself if it moves into a Voting phase again. Which will happen if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> wrote a new proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am happy you all liked Vilfredo. I did not expect it to reach a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus at all in this question, so I was particularly surprised. It was
</I>&gt;<i> also quite funny having Ned in an email accusing me of not respecting
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo's wisdom. We all had to give in, to reach a consensus. SO yes,
</I>&gt;<i> this is some basic statement we all seem to agree.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How shall we proceed from here?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are several options. Jacopo have been asking several times to have
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis been tested. And I think it would be fair to give to it a chance. I
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure if it would be better to use it for a refinement of the
</I>&gt;<i> homepage or for another page all together. In any case it must be an
</I>&gt;<i> important page, as we know eDemocracy needs participation, and people only
</I>&gt;<i> participate when something real is at stake.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo could be used further (Steve has just wrote a new proposal, I
</I>&gt;<i> gather). But it can also be used in several different ways. We could use it
</I>&gt;<i> to write a page, as we did now. But this time we could ask a question on
</I>&gt;<i> the structure of the page (I am speaking here about a more complex page).
</I>&gt;<i> And then opening a different question (all in parallel) for each section or
</I>&gt;<i> paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When Vilfredo was written the first time, we started using it right
</I>&gt;<i> away. And soon we were using it with many questions. And it worked in a
</I>&gt;<i> very interesting way, some questions were on the left (writing phase), some
</I>&gt;<i> on the right (voting phase). And the two sides of the page would
</I>&gt;<i> alternatively go up and down, like piston in a car mulching the questions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't remember what happened at the time, why people stopped using it.
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo was not ready, and I did not understand the maths well enough to
</I>&gt;<i> bring it further, but felt, intuitively, that I only wanted to improve it
</I>&gt;<i> on well thought out grounds.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you like Vilfredo, and if you think it has options, then open
</I>&gt;<i> questions, and invite people to use it. Not people in general, but specific
</I>&gt;<i> people you want to discuss those questions with. We have been finding
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to write the homepage because we seem to disagree on some of the
</I>&gt;<i> core values in metagovernment. Now Vilfredo is not a tool for closed
</I>&gt;<i> questions ( like &quot;are we trying to reach a direct democracy?&quot;). But each of
</I>&gt;<i> those values could be opened as a question in Vilfredo. In parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> Something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and Direct Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and Representative
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and ...?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And if you do not know how to ask a question, the metaquestions have
</I>&gt;<i> always worked very well in V.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Example: What question should we ask about MG and Direct Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To which the answer will have a question format. And that then goes into
</I>&gt;<i> a new V question.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, although Vilfredo cannot be used for all questions, it is quite
</I>&gt;<i> flexible in its uses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Still, please, test Airesis too. I think different tools should be used
</I>&gt;<i> in parallel in different contexts, and I am very much supporting an ecology
</I>&gt;<i> of interactive eDemocracy tools that ping pong questions between them
</I>&gt;<i> depending what phase of the issue are they in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have a lot of things to add, but I will cut it short as this email is
</I>&gt;<i> already too long.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One important thing, as Steve suggested, I need to gather the feedback
</I>&gt;<i> about this question. I might run a Vilfredo question to decide what
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback to ask. Now you all know how to do it, so it should go like a
</I>&gt;<i> breeze. The feedback is very important as it might be used to design V2.0.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also this question would be a &quot;list&quot;. I said before that V is not good
</I>&gt;<i> for lists, but I have an intuition on how it should be phrased to that IT
</I>&gt;<i> MIGHT work ;-). It's an eDem experiment :-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks again,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
