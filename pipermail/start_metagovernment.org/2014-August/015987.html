<PRE>Thanks Pietro&#8230;.well written, and helpful.
I&#8217;m very much appreciating the chance to test out Vilfredo and am looking forward to V2.0.
Seems like it was a good run and I have some feedback items&#8230;.waiting.
All the best,
S

&gt;<i> Hi Steve,
</I>&gt;<i> no there is no need to send out a notification. Vilfredo should do it by itself if it moves into a Voting phase again. Which will happen if anyone wrote a new proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am happy you all liked Vilfredo. I did not expect it to reach a consensus at all in this question, so I was particularly surprised. It was also quite funny having Ned in an email accusing me of not respecting Vilfredo's wisdom. We all had to give in, to reach a consensus. SO yes, this is some basic statement we all seem to agree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How shall we proceed from here?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are several options. Jacopo have been asking several times to have Airesis been tested. And I think it would be fair to give to it a chance. I am not sure if it would be better to use it for a refinement of the homepage or for another page all together. In any case it must be an important page, as we know eDemocracy needs participation, and people only participate when something real is at stake.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo could be used further (Steve has just wrote a new proposal, I gather). But it can also be used in several different ways. We could use it to write a page, as we did now. But this time we could ask a question on the structure of the page (I am speaking here about a more complex page). And then opening a different question (all in parallel) for each section or paragraph.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When Vilfredo was written the first time, we started using it right away. And soon we were using it with many questions. And it worked in a very interesting way, some questions were on the left (writing phase), some on the right (voting phase). And the two sides of the page would alternatively go up and down, like piston in a car mulching the questions. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't remember what happened at the time, why people stopped using it. Vilfredo was not ready, and I did not understand the maths well enough to bring it further, but felt, intuitively, that I only wanted to improve it on well thought out grounds.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you like Vilfredo, and if you think it has options, then open questions, and invite people to use it. Not people in general, but specific people you want to discuss those questions with. We have been finding difficult to write the homepage because we seem to disagree on some of the core values in metagovernment. Now Vilfredo is not a tool for closed questions ( like &quot;are we trying to reach a direct democracy?&quot;). But each of those values could be opened as a question in Vilfredo. In parallel. Something like: 
</I>&gt;<i> -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and Direct Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and Representative Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> -what should be the relation between Metagovernment and ...?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And if you do not know how to ask a question, the metaquestions have always worked very well in V.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Example: What question should we ask about MG and Direct Democracy?
</I>&gt;<i> To which the answer will have a question format. And that then goes into a new V question.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, although Vilfredo cannot be used for all questions, it is quite flexible in its uses.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Still, please, test Airesis too. I think different tools should be used in parallel in different contexts, and I am very much supporting an ecology of interactive eDemocracy tools that ping pong questions between them depending what phase of the issue are they in. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have a lot of things to add, but I will cut it short as this email is already too long. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One important thing, as Steve suggested, I need to gather the feedback about this question. I might run a Vilfredo question to decide what Feedback to ask. Now you all know how to do it, so it should go like a breeze. The feedback is very important as it might be used to design V2.0.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also this question would be a &quot;list&quot;. I said before that V is not good for lists, but I have an intuition on how it should be phrased to that IT MIGHT work ;-). It's an eDem experiment :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
