Again, I mainly object to the number of rules he proposes rather than
the underlying concepts.  And would agree that this mailing list is a
more appropriate thing to transition to a &quot;DA&quot; than the government
systems we're working on themselves, mainly because philosophical
debates *are* appropriate here whereas they're not in systems that are
designed to render a decision in an as efficient manner as possible.

&gt;<i> I may be able to make time this coming weekend to respond to your start (I
</I>&gt;<i> hope). In the interim, I would be very interested to read what others might
</I>&gt;<i> have to say about the topic.
</I>
On another topic, I was trying to provide a link to your Blinap
documents to a new member of this group (that we'll hopefully start
hearing from soon), but see that they're gone from the old site.  Is
there a replacement?  If so, please send us that link.  If not, please
get after it!
  Regards,
    Scott
