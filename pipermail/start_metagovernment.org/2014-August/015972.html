<PRE>Well, the rule as it currently stands basically translates to: if everyone participating on this list says we should change the home page, then seven days later, if nobody has yet objected, we should change it.

That&#8217;s an approximation. I guess technically it&#8217;s not &#8220;everyone&#8221; it&#8217;s 2/3:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

The wait-time is in case someone has missed out and wants to break the consensus (or technically the supermajority). And again the venue is this list, not Vilfredo.

Vilfredo has helped us reach a consensus. I am absolutely impressed by how well we have come together. But the group is still defined as this list, so here is where the discussion happens.

We could be a little more progressive and change the home-page to the currently-winning Vilfredo proposal right now, with the caveat that if anybody objects, they can simply revert it back to the current nearly-blank page at will. That could be a pro tem measure to give us something on the homepage until such time as we have satisfied the rules&#8230; while simultaneously honoring the spirit of the rule that someone can come in late and break consensus.

Round 10 on Vilfredo appears to be bring forward a new candidate. I say if that one wins, then someone should change the homepage to it unless someone objects here. And if anyone objects after the fact, then either object here and someone should revert it; or just go ahead and revert it yourself. Deal?

Since there is an implication that as a motion everyone is okay with this except maybe me then this is a nice test of the implication.  I am actually curious what happens.
