I'm impressed for the former reason, although in part this unexpected
result could have been because I missed the 24 hour window for doing a
&quot;mutated&quot; proposal of my own.  I'm *not* impressed by the resulting
text, which is about as washed out as it could be and still contain
any content at all.  Still, at least it is accurate and so a big
improvement over the old version, so I recommend we install it ASAP.

But I also think we should restart the process. The MG Home Page is
our primary marketing tool.  It has to say something that grabs a
potential member and says &quot;Hey, this is something I could support&quot; or
at least &quot;Hmm, this sounds sounds promising, I'll hang around long
enough to see if they get anywhere or maybe it goes down in flames&quot;.
This new page is unlikely to do that IMHO because it simply reeks of
compromise.  Which brings me to my second criticism of approaches that
emphasize collaboration and especially consensus (the first being that
for any real-world problem facing a heterogeneous population the most
common result will be &quot;no decision&quot;): The resulting laws/policies will
most likely simply be ineffective because they don't make any
significant change to the status quo.

The process of governing involves meeting two potentially incompatible
requirements:
1) The laws have to be effective (or why make them?)
2) The laws have to be fair and enforceable

&quot;Consensus&quot; greatly helps with #2 (if they voted for it, they're a lot
more likely to follow it), but reduces the odds #1 will be met.  A
simple majority rule, or at least the exploitation of that rule to
produce laws that are maximally invasive, greatly improve the odds of
#1 at the expense of #2.  I don't know how we incorporate this dynamic
in our systems, but do know that &quot;simple majority&quot; and &quot;consensus&quot; are
out as decision rules.

&gt;<i> I then tried to go to Gen 10 and tweak it.  (s/Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;<i> online/goverance).  Still on my cell and still think I failed.
</I>
OK, so you're proposing to water it down to take the last remaining
bit of useful content out?  It'll be practically homeopathic at that
point!

&gt;<i> As a minor matter the intro was general and the last three words got very
</I>&gt;<i> narrow.  I do not necessarily support Direct Democracy nor Democracy nor
</I>&gt;<i> online.  And in any case if someone demos global Vulcan mind meld I may not
</I>&gt;<i> want to tell her to go away.
</I>
If you don't support Direct Democracy, I have to ask, what are you
here for?  I would have thought that at least that would be at the top
of the list of principles we all share a belief in.  Speaking of
which, I still believe the path forward is to generate a list of
principles and use some system to rank-order them and pick the top few
to include on the Home page.  Ned tried to do this in some of his
proposals but I think went a little overboard on the list of potential
principles while he lacked sufficient data to make a good list of
those we share. I've posted my &quot;guiding principles&quot; (several times, it
seems), but we've yet to hear from anyone else on theirs.  Let's see
them!
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: Just to summarize mine (again):
1) Representative democracy is inherently corrupt, direct democracy
being the best option
2) Social dominators and authoritarians are the biggest problem and
must be constrained
3) Radical transparency enables #1 and #2
4) Delegation and technology provides efficiency needed to implement #1
