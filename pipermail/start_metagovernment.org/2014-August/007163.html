Hmm, I'm thinking these intervals are a little short: I had intended
to do a proposal mutation this round but by the time it bubbled up in
my queue the proposal phase had ended (24 hours?)

Now that I've done a proposal I found something else I believe needs
work in Vilfredo, the tracking of comments/questions.  One of the
things I was looking forward to seeing were comments on my (defeated)
proposal but I don't see any way to go back and see them.  Seems to me
there should be a button on the page created for each proposal that
shows all of the comments/questions for that proposal.

My 2 cents on &quot;Disputation Arenas&quot; to maybe head off use of that link
in future proposals.  There are many good ideas and suggestions on
that page (<A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>), but
fundamentally it seems to me to rely on a faulty understanding of what
the problems really are.  Take some of the major issues in the news
today that presumably would be grist for this mill:

1) Is wealth inequality a problem or not, and if so what should we do about it?

2) Jobs and economic growth, or preservation of the environment and
quality of life?  (e.g., regarding fracking which is a pretty huge
issue here in Boulder County)

3) Do we send those Central American kids back, or let them stay?

4) What do we do about Boko Haram (Nigeria), ISIS (Iraq), Palestinians
vs Israel, and Putin?

The main thing that characterizes all of these is that there is simply
insufficient information about each of them that would allow us to
make completely rational decisions (we don't understand the economy or
political economy well enough to make predictions on #1, don't even
know our relative priorities on #2 because we've never systematically
surveyed The People on these issues, and both of the above apply to #3
and #4).  Secondly even if we did have the information to answer them,
there are a significant minority of the population that would simply
refuse to take any action that goes against their prejudices (e.g.,
the solution to #4 requires taking steps against religion and
authoritarianism in general, which I say 25% of the population will
simply try to obstruct because that's what their instincts tell them
to do and no amount of rational discourse will change their minds
because they're not using their minds to render the decision!).

But a Disputation Arena seems to assume everything is a philosophical
question and that rational inquiry and debate will lead us to the
&quot;right&quot; answer.  This is simply a naive view of the way decisions on
these issues need to be made.  Sure there are good ideas in there
about how to organize the &quot;battle&quot; between opposing forces, but that's
simply what democracy is, and rather than fart around debating
philosophical issues where the end result really doesn't matter, these
techniques must be integrated into a law-making platform where the end
result is not &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;understanding&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot;, but
merely the passage of a law or policy that addresses the issue in as
optimal a manner as possible.

As for 2790 and 2799, they both seem pretty watered down to me, but
maybe that's just what the end result of this process is destined to
be.  Seems to me what we really need is to take polls on the
individual philosophical elements so that we can at least get *some*
of them onto that page (i.e., against representative democracy, for
proxies/delegates and radical transparency).
  Regards,
    Scott
