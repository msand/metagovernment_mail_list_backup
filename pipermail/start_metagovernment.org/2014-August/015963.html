<PRE>I would like to support Max here. As I understand metagovernment.org, at 
least the initial page should stay more above or beyond (meta) the 
concrete projects. The related projects page is the best example of it 
and I think it is one of the best pages in metagovernment. Maybe it 
should be mentioned at the first page (not just in the main menu :))
Similarly the Resources page needs more attention. I am sure we can 
easily fill it with useful links and make it one of metagovernment best 
pages.

Regards
Michael

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am impressed.  Not because the participants got to agreement but because I

</I>&gt;<i> I'm impressed for the former reason, although in part this unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> result could have been because I missed the 24 hour window for doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mutated&quot; proposal of my own.  I'm *not* impressed by the resulting
</I>&gt;<i> text, which is about as washed out as it could be and still contain
</I>&gt;<i> any content at all.  Still, at least it is accurate and so a big
</I>&gt;<i> improvement over the old version, so I recommend we install it ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I also think we should restart the process. The MG Home Page is
</I>&gt;<i> our primary marketing tool.  It has to say something that grabs a
</I>&gt;<i> potential member and says &quot;Hey, this is something I could support&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> at least &quot;Hmm, this sounds sounds promising, I'll hang around long
</I>&gt;<i> enough to see if they get anywhere or maybe it goes down in flames&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This new page is unlikely to do that IMHO because it simply reeks of
</I>&gt;<i> compromise.  Which brings me to my second criticism of approaches that
</I>&gt;<i> emphasize collaboration and especially consensus (the first being that
</I>&gt;<i> for any real-world problem facing a heterogeneous population the most
</I>&gt;<i> common result will be &quot;no decision&quot;): The resulting laws/policies will
</I>&gt;<i> most likely simply be ineffective because they don't make any
</I>&gt;<i> significant change to the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The process of governing involves meeting two potentially incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The laws have to be effective (or why make them?)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The laws have to be fair and enforceable
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Consensus&quot; greatly helps with #2 (if they voted for it, they're a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to follow it), but reduces the odds #1 will be met.  A
</I>&gt;<i> simple majority rule, or at least the exploitation of that rule to
</I>&gt;<i> produce laws that are maximally invasive, greatly improve the odds of
</I>&gt;<i> #1 at the expense of #2.  I don't know how we incorporate this dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> in our systems, but do know that &quot;simple majority&quot; and &quot;consensus&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> out as decision rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I then tried to go to Gen 10 and tweak it.  (s/Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online/goverance).  Still on my cell and still think I failed.
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so you're proposing to water it down to take the last remaining
</I>&gt;<i> bit of useful content out?  It'll be practically homeopathic at that
</I>&gt;<i> point!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a minor matter the intro was general and the last three words got very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> narrow.  I do not necessarily support Direct Democracy nor Democracy nor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> online.  And in any case if someone demos global Vulcan mind meld I may not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to tell her to go away.
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't support Direct Democracy, I have to ask, what are you
</I>&gt;<i> here for?  I would have thought that at least that would be at the top
</I>&gt;<i> of the list of principles we all share a belief in.  Speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> which, I still believe the path forward is to generate a list of
</I>&gt;<i> principles and use some system to rank-order them and pick the top few
</I>&gt;<i> to include on the Home page.  Ned tried to do this in some of his
</I>&gt;<i> proposals but I think went a little overboard on the list of potential
</I>&gt;<i> principles while he lacked sufficient data to make a good list of
</I>&gt;<i> those we share. I've posted my &quot;guiding principles&quot; (several times, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems), but we've yet to hear from anyone else on theirs.  Let's see
</I>&gt;<i> them!
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: Just to summarize mine (again):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Representative democracy is inherently corrupt, direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> being the best option
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Social dominators and authoritarians are the biggest problem and
</I>&gt;<i> must be constrained
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Radical transparency enables #1 and #2
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Delegation and technology provides efficiency needed to implement #1
