&gt;<i> Discussing the objections to the Vilfredo proposals on the mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list?  What a concept!
</I>
:<i>)  + + +
</I>
&gt;<i> Secondly, taking a more philosophical point of view, happiness is
</I>&gt;<i> hardly appropriate as the ultimate goal of humanity.  Lots of people
</I>&gt;<i> live good and worthwhile lives who aren't happy (those suffering for
</I>&gt;<i> their art being a good example ;-) 
</I>
Well said.  It&#8217;s a little too generic for me.   Like smiley faces&#8230;everywhere. 

&gt;&gt;<i> I do not consider the search for happiness anthropocentric, If you can help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me rephrase in a way that will not sound illusive rather than &quot;get rid&quot; I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be very glad.
</I>
I believe it was &#8220;human happiness&#8221; in the proposal, which seems incomplete to me. 
I would try to describe the conditions that engender happiness&#8230;.like freedom, clean air and water, a pervasive connection with the whole of life&#8230;.  :)
Or maybe you could just say &#8220;humane happiness&#8221;.     We could use a little of that.

&gt;<i> so we may just have to go with something like &quot;freedom to live their
</I>&gt;<i> lives as they choose&#8221;.
</I>
Yes!  As long as they&#8217;re not there dumping their garbage in the creek.

&gt;<i> As for utilitarianism, it's not *horrible*, but again, something I
</I>&gt;<i> believe is fundamentally incompatible with our natures.  The classic
</I>&gt;<i> example is the trolley thought experiment (i.e., do you push an
</I>&gt;<i> innocent bystander in front of a runaway trolley car to stop it and
</I>&gt;<i> save the 5 people on it?)  Utilitarian philosophy says you sacrifice
</I>&gt;<i> the one for the many.  Our instinctive moral code says you don't.  I
</I>&gt;<i> find this example particularly illuminating because as it turns out
</I>&gt;<i> autistics and sociopaths usually get this one wrong because they are
</I>&gt;<i> highly rule-based and rational beings.  They may very well be our
</I>&gt;<i> evolutionary future, but for now our policy making systems need to
</I>&gt;<i> work with instinctive moral codes as much as possible, which rules out
</I>&gt;<i> utilitarianism, at least in its most extreme forms.
</I>
:<i>)  + + +
</I>

&gt;<i> And I also vote we quit dicking around with
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo until we're ready to take on the question of common guiding
</I>&gt;<i> principles&#8230;
</I>
Why not set that up on Airesis?  I think we could finish out 'the home page intro' with Vifredo and see if there are any *principles* we might agree on with Airesis.   I would be happy with that!  + + +  :)

&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
