<PRE>You live where all the humans are perfect spheres of a mole of water in a
frictionless environment.

Yah I know but I do think of you sometimes as having come out of Tavistock
and the flying squad governance scheme and then noticing that this did not
work.

If you need to change the world you may wish to compare and contrast Alice
Paul and Lucy Burns.  Burns bitterly burned brightly.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am impressed.  Not because the participants got to agreement but
</I>&gt;<i> because I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thought the agreed on text was close to something that *I* liked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm impressed for the former reason, although in part this unexpected
</I>&gt;<i> result could have been because I missed the 24 hour window for doing a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;mutated&quot; proposal of my own.  I'm *not* impressed by the resulting
</I>&gt;<i> text, which is about as washed out as it could be and still contain
</I>&gt;<i> any content at all.  Still, at least it is accurate and so a big
</I>&gt;<i> improvement over the old version, so I recommend we install it ASAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I also think we should restart the process. The MG Home Page is
</I>&gt;<i> our primary marketing tool.  It has to say something that grabs a
</I>&gt;<i> potential member and says &quot;Hey, this is something I could support&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> at least &quot;Hmm, this sounds sounds promising, I'll hang around long
</I>&gt;<i> enough to see if they get anywhere or maybe it goes down in flames&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> This new page is unlikely to do that IMHO because it simply reeks of
</I>&gt;<i> compromise.  Which brings me to my second criticism of approaches that
</I>&gt;<i> emphasize collaboration and especially consensus (the first being that
</I>&gt;<i> for any real-world problem facing a heterogeneous population the most
</I>&gt;<i> common result will be &quot;no decision&quot;): The resulting laws/policies will
</I>&gt;<i> most likely simply be ineffective because they don't make any
</I>&gt;<i> significant change to the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The process of governing involves meeting two potentially incompatible
</I>&gt;<i> requirements:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The laws have to be effective (or why make them?)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The laws have to be fair and enforceable
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Consensus&quot; greatly helps with #2 (if they voted for it, they're a lot
</I>&gt;<i> more likely to follow it), but reduces the odds #1 will be met.  A
</I>&gt;<i> simple majority rule, or at least the exploitation of that rule to
</I>&gt;<i> produce laws that are maximally invasive, greatly improve the odds of
</I>&gt;<i> #1 at the expense of #2.  I don't know how we incorporate this dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> in our systems, but do know that &quot;simple majority&quot; and &quot;consensus&quot; are
</I>&gt;<i> out as decision rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I then tried to go to Gen 10 and tweak it.  (s/Direct Democracy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online/goverance).  Still on my cell and still think I failed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so you're proposing to water it down to take the last remaining
</I>&gt;<i> bit of useful content out?  It'll be practically homeopathic at that
</I>&gt;<i> point!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a minor matter the intro was general and the last three words got very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; narrow.  I do not necessarily support Direct Democracy nor Democracy nor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online.  And in any case if someone demos global Vulcan mind meld I may
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to tell her to go away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't support Direct Democracy, I have to ask, what are you
</I>&gt;<i> here for?  I would have thought that at least that would be at the top
</I>&gt;<i> of the list of principles we all share a belief in.  Speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> which, I still believe the path forward is to generate a list of
</I>&gt;<i> principles and use some system to rank-order them and pick the top few
</I>&gt;<i> to include on the Home page.  Ned tried to do this in some of his
</I>&gt;<i> proposals but I think went a little overboard on the list of potential
</I>&gt;<i> principles while he lacked sufficient data to make a good list of
</I>&gt;<i> those we share. I've posted my &quot;guiding principles&quot; (several times, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems), but we've yet to hear from anyone else on theirs.  Let's see
</I>&gt;<i> them!
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: Just to summarize mine (again):
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Representative democracy is inherently corrupt, direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> being the best option
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Social dominators and authoritarians are the biggest problem and
</I>&gt;<i> must be constrained
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Radical transparency enables #1 and #2
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Delegation and technology provides efficiency needed to implement #1
