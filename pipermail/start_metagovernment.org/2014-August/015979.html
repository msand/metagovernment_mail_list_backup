<PRE>My 2 cents: We should separate considerations of principle from 
considerations of Home Page text changes. To me, the difference between 
&quot;Direct Democacy online&quot; versus &quot;goverance&quot; should be considered as a 
matter of principle, and not snuck in disguised as a simple text change.

We now have a &quot;least common denominator&quot; home page. In my view, to make 
substantive changes to the text going forward, we would be well advised 
to turn to proposing and agreeing upon fundamental principles and such 
(as Scott among others has been suggesting). As we reach agreement 
regarding a principle, we can then manifest that agreement in the form 
of additions/modifications to the Home Page text (as a separate step).

For reaching agreement regarding those text changes (as distinguished 
from reaching agreement on the principles that lead to the text 
changes), I am thinking that Vilfredo may not be the best tool. Maybe we 
should give Airesis a try, or some other tool with a more fine-grained 
text-oriented approach than Vilfredo takes.

(Just as I finish, Scott's response arrives, so now I echo him ...)
