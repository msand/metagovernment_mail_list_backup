<PRE>Unless someone asks for delay before the 24-hour timer times out, I am 
going to roll us over to the vote phase of Generation 5 as soon as it 
does. We now have 10 proposals to look at (including 5 new ones), and I 
am very curious to see what's in the new ones.

I will then leave the vote-window open for the full two days, hoping 
that even the very busy will have a chance to vote.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In hindsight, when Pietro suggested that we try to reduce the size of 
the Pareto Front, I see that he put me into a &quot;be more selective&quot; 
mindset. That then led me to think this:

    If you are going to be proposing a new version of an existing
    proposal in the next generation, it would be appropriate to vote
    against the existing version (since you no longer prefer it,
    compared to your new version). If that removes the existing version
    from the Pareto Front, so much the better, since the old version
    will not then show up in the next generation to compete against your
    new version. (I am trusting Pietro to correct me if I am wrong,
    again ...)

Pietro then did correct me:

    Maybe Ned.

    Vilfredo works by asking everybody to accept everything as long as
    it is slightly acceptable. It will never reach a consensus if people
    all only accept their best and only. Basically the idea is: if
    everybody is as open as they can be (but not more) then a consensus
    can be found.

    Notice in this how the comments are becoming more precise. Before we
    would vote down something for big things. Now a wrong word can be
    enough to strike down a proposal.

    I wonder how Vilfredo would vote if we require people to vote up at
    least n proposals. With n that is 1 at the first generation. 2 at
    the second generation, ...

    If you strike down a proposal because you want to rewrite it, you
    are being very selective. Also in theory people should use the
    proposals in the Pareto Front as guidelines. So everybody knows what
    are the ingredients, and the Pareto Front represents the Community.
    So personally I would try to get the proposal I want to rewrite in
    the Pareto Front, and then rewrite it. If not someone could just
    vote down my proposal because it is a rewrite of something we
    already decided as a community to vote against.

    I think we should accept that minor correction, like small grammar
    correction can be done after a consensus is found.

    In fact, as I explained here:
    <A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-multiple-point-of-views/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-multiple-point-of-views/</A>
    it would be interesting to integrate Vilfredo with a wiki. So you
    use the normal wiki procedures in general. And Vilfredo when a flame
    war raises.

I am beginning to appreciate that in Vilfredo, a vote does not mean what 
it means in an ordinary count-votes system. (Steve in an earlier email 
mentioned that he saw only 1 proposal in the final Pareto Front of 
Generation 4, when in fact there are 5. I suspect that he was noticing 
that 2712 had more votes than the others, and took that to mean that it 
was therefore the single winner.)
