<PRE>Sigh.  Some are in love to with the LAW.  Sort of a 1820 positivism thing
where law could be an infallible science if everyone just got the axioms
right.  I think that was Yale.

The wording &quot;inherently better&quot; are interesting.

So judges cannot do equity.  The jury cannot do nullification.  And no one
gets to interposition, especially if it counts.  If you go for Shar'ia
then  pick the Wahhabi version and burn the Sufi shrines.  Damn innovators.

Here is an idea i had a million years ago When AI Was Going To Be Real Soon
now.  Let us force the legislators to write the law in COBOL.  We get less
law for  starters.  And you do not really need lawyers or judges in many
cases. This idea can be expanded for much hilarity.

&gt;<i> A good description of the issues, but it doesn't mention another
</I>&gt;<i> possible solution: Simply omit the &quot;inspiration&quot; from the recording of
</I>&gt;<i> the law/rule.  When we try to include these justifications in the
</I>&gt;<i> rules themselves it makes the process of creating them vastly more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated, Exhibit A being this MG Home Page project, albeit that
</I>&gt;<i> being almost exclusively &quot;inspiration&quot; with very little in the way of
</I>&gt;<i> actual &quot;rules&quot;.  Another example is the second amendment of the US
</I>&gt;<i> constitution, that pesky &quot;a well-regulated militia&quot; clause which
</I>&gt;<i> renders the rule subject to interpretation, and is a design flaw
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., that justification should have either been part of the rule
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., &quot;if you serve in the militia you have the right to keep arms&quot;),
</I>&gt;<i> or simply omitted).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This allows (actually requires) that the justifications be recorded
</I>&gt;<i> *separately* from the rules themselves, and everyone can have their
</I>&gt;<i> own set of these.  They'll surely trot their preferred set out when it
</I>&gt;<i> comes time to debate changing the rule at some point in the future,
</I>&gt;<i> but because the justification is not part of the rule itself in the
</I>&gt;<i> end people will vote on the inherent merit of the rule rather than
</I>&gt;<i> confounding that with requiring agreement on the justification for the
</I>&gt;<i> rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are two side effects of this design:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Because the rule-enforcers (i.e., judges) won't have this
</I>&gt;<i> additional information to guide their own interpretations, the rules
</I>&gt;<i> themselves need to be more explicit.  This is a good thing, since that
</I>&gt;<i> way rule enforcement is far more likely to comply with the wishes of
</I>&gt;<i> the the rule-makers rather than the whims of whatever judge happens to
</I>&gt;<i> be hearing a case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This also implies a civil law vs a common law system (as is used in
</I>&gt;<i> the US and Commonwealth countries).  I go into more detail on this
</I>&gt;<i> issue and why civil law is an inherently better system than common law
</I>&gt;<i> in my book, but to summarize see my point #1: If a decision hinges on
</I>&gt;<i> precedent or a judges interpretation of the *intent* of the
</I>&gt;<i> rule-makers, it is far more likely that corruption or other
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable factors will unduly influence the ultimate decision.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is a problem set that need a little extra.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For some historical affinities some now more that 200 years ago it
</I>&gt;<i> happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that two different religions wanted to merge circa 1950.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The bigger was certainly non creed and humanistic atheist pretty much.
</I>&gt;<i>  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other was Christian and real about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The story goes that they set up two conventions side by side.  Now the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sticking point was a set of principles to guide the marriage and the
</I>&gt;<i> future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One side really needed a reference to their deity in the principles and
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other side really did not.  Thing got very difficult.  Both conventions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wanted to quit and go home.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some genius split the issue into principles to guide us and historical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sources of wisdom and inspiration.  (Take care about the wording I used)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Current psych research says why that should work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here how do you get the software to support that smoothly? I can do this
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; RRO.  I can also do this in some sort of covenant relationship but it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hard to do  a covenant without the agreement on how we will chose to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; covenant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can see some effort in MG that is a bit like that story.  I can see
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem clearly in words like &quot;quality&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the post script the joining I believe got better than 90% agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This represents quite an outlier.  Software tends to orient toward common
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situations.
