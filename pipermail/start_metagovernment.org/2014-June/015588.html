<PRE>Dang! Things went from simple to complicated in a big hurry!

It looks to me like we have plenty of proposing work to do at this 
point, so when the 24-hour timer times out 2 hours from now, I will push 
us into the Propose Phase of Generation 5.

In The News: Mike (up to this point) has wanted the Home Page to contain 
a short poem (or a picture of me -- I'm blushing ...). Some don't want 
negativity or combative language, some don't want long sentences, some 
want the reader to be grabbed, some want short and interesting rather 
than long and boring, some want the door left open for Representative 
Democracy, some want agreements and not disagreements, some don't want 
obvious.

In Other News, the following wordings have been challenged in the 
comments: &quot;bickering&quot;, &quot;every day&quot;, &quot;coheres&quot;, &quot;new forms of 
governance&quot;, &quot;governance&quot;, &quot;having society work together&quot;, &quot;tens of 
millions&quot;, &quot;we want&quot;, &quot;health of our biosphere&quot;.

The question was asked whether I agree with the Vision expressed on the 
wiki Vision page. The answer is: not at all. At some point, we will need 
to tackle the Vision issue directly. (My guess is that we will find that 
we have lots of different visions among us.)

One comment had this to say: &quot;We need to think directly about what a 
home page does and how to get there.&quot; Composing proposals is where the 
rubber meets that road. As we compose our proposals, those seem wise 
words to heed.
