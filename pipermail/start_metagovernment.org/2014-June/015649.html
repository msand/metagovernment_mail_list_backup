<PRE>Very early on, we had the choice to either try to get to agreement on 
the full home page through one question, or to create a set of 
sub-questions to reach agreement on the parts (Introduction, Vision(s), 
Issues, whatever), and then return to the main question to assemble the 
parts.

I have greatly appreciated this opportunity to get a deeper &quot;feel&quot; for 
how Vilfredo works in practice. And now (at this point) my feeling is 
that multi-part answers cannot be effectively and efficiently produced 
through asking a single question. From my perspective, Mike and Ed have 
been working on the Introduction, and that work definitely needs to be 
done. But the successful result of that work will be just the 
Introduction, not the whole page. (Pietro is right that the target that 
votes are aiming at has been changing, and this is a main reason for 
that. In the past I have voted &quot;yes&quot; to 2712 for example, but the &quot;yes&quot; 
actually meant &quot;this is acceptable as the Introduction&quot;, and did not 
mean &quot;this is acceptable as the whole page&quot;. If I had consistently voted 
the latter, that would have given me no voice in how the introduction 
reads -- I would have voted &quot;no&quot; to all introductions.)

If at this point we were to declare this first question to pertain only 
to the introduction, then I could vote &quot;No&quot; to 2710 and 2741 and 
concentrate on helping get us to agreement on the Introduction.
