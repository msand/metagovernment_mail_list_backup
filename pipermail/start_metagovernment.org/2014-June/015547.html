<PRE>yes, we are speaking single winner, of course.

Plurality practically never reaches the Condorcet winner. Not even if you
go through several rounds.
Plurality can be gamed easily with strategic voting.
Plurality is very weak against cloning.

The only reason why plurality is good is because it is the most anonymous
form of voting. And it is good for people who want to keep the status quo
by making fake elections.

I have no idea how you can find plurality to be ideal.

And I really do not see how this would be different for straw polls

In fact intuitively I would expect a continuous system which is weak
against strategic voting to have the effect to polarise the community into
two groups that hate each other. Like on Amazon reviews tend to get more
and more extreme for the same book (there was a paper on this, sorry I do
not have the reference).

Right now I realise: if you see our democracies as a continuos, several
years long straw poll, the result is indeed this polarisation.
