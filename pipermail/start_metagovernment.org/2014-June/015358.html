<PRE>I apologize I have not had time to properly investigate Airesis, Jacopo. Can you link to the proposal you reference? I signed up, went to the Metagov group, but the only proposal I see is on another topic:
<A HREF="http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals">http://www.airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment/proposals</A>
Sorry, I may not have time to participate beyond this for a few days, but hopefully a link will help.

Concerning which method we should use to make decisions, I think it is vital that we do not choose just one. Say we decide on Loomio for all our decisions. Then none of us ever look at Airesis or Vilfredo, etc. Plus we implicitly say as a group that all other systems are substandard. It would be much better for us to switch platforms to suit the need of the proposal. Hopefully eventually we will find that we are always using one system (and hopefully that system will be a hybrid of several currently-extant ones). In that case we&#8217;ll know we&#8217;ve found the truly best.

This was Mike&#8217;s idea for a plug-in framework:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Plug-in_framework">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Plug-in_framework</A>
(allowing people to use whatever platform they please), but it did not get much traction. I would love to see us try it again.

&gt;<i> Hi everyone
</I>&gt;<i> I vote

</I>&gt;<i> Because I want to respect others will to improve but also because I am very upset that the proposal I open on Airesis regarding the same subject that is there ready to be discussed, edited collaboratively with a proven system and finally voted with a proven system lay abandoned.
</I>&gt;<i> Participation equal to 0 mean no participation.
</I>&gt;<i> Seem to me like there is a struggle by not having clear a method. The instruments are there but there is no....... I really don't know how to define it but lately I find that playing with my kids is giving me much pleasure than talking about democracy. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> When the method is found and agreed upon I will give it a try.
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis, Loomio, Vilfredo, Zalea etcetc......... dividi et impera.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore the first question is which method we plan to use?

</I>&gt;<i> It looks like this thread had incorrect rules listed. The rules should probably be left out of the proposal thread or  a link to the rules as Ed did.
</I>&gt;<i> There are also multiple points in the email. The initial email in a proposal thread should have just the proposal in it.
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal does not have a number on it for tracking as suggested earlier. Although not a rule it's a good idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Do we need to propose to use a system for a proposal or did we &quot;decide&quot; the proposer can choose the system and they should just say int the proposal email what system they are using and provide a link?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest for clarity new proposals be made on a different thread (Like Ed's discussion or proposal which I believe has been made previously)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest we all vote against this proposal thread. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess the current rules never allow for a proposal to be closed except for approval which makes maintaining a list of current proposals long and difficult.

</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with the format of the debate, as it is not what we have already agreed upon. We can't change the rules without following the rules for changing the rules. Otherwise, we are just anarchy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The current rules are not that we have two weeks of discussion and then vote (and if so, what defines a winning vote), but rather (roughly) that we vote continually and when there is a supermajority, then it must hold for a full week before it passes. Again, they are stated here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And just to be clear:
</I>&gt;<i> -1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I tried joining the Loomio metagov board, and I had to ask for permission. I don't understand how a system can be democratic if some authoritarian (someone with authority) gets to decide who may participate. Now that I have been deemed worthy of participating in the board, I only see up/down style voting. How does that build consensus? If someone disagrees with a word, how is the proposal refined? If someone has a counter-proposal, how is it compared to the original? I am not seeing how Loomio is supposed to be more than a simple replication of the problems/limitations of the status quo. Systems like Vilfredo and Votorola appear to be vastly more sophisticated at consensus-building, even if they don't have quite as pretty of a front-end (which truly is the worst standard: otherwise, let's just use Facebook for decision-making).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To Michael's point, I do agree that we should be discussing what we are doing here. So... does everyone agree with the mission, vision, and common principles stated here?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If so, that sounds like a great starting point. And the mission statement sounds like a good first sentence for the home page, right? (Which is pretty much what it was before it got blanked.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, disagree (-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not clear what problem we're trying to solve with this proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I feel it's especially confusing to mix issues (home page, decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making, testing new platforms).  If the home page is a concern, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let's start by talking about what the problem is.  We're not doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.  It makes no sense to discuss solutions (e.g. particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content) when we've no idea what the basic problem is.  E.g. maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; home page is missing some important information?  What kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information would be important on a home page?  Anybody know?  (Don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer here please, I'm just explaining what I mean.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or if decision making is a concern, then what is the problem with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current decision-making process?  Again (don't answer here), it makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no sense to decide on a solution (Loomio) when we haven't talked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem it's supposed to solve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or if some people want to test different platforms and think maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be a purpose for this group, then I guess we should clarify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our purpose.  Do we have a purpose?  Do we want a purpose?  What kind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of purpose do we want?  (Again, don't answer here.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So maybe we have lots of different problems, or maybe none at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But please let's take them one at time, or it's too confusing.
