<PRE>I think I noticed Mike citing to not rational structures and I appreciate
that.  One of my threads is the jung Erickson cambell bateson etc
sequence.  And somehow I spent the day looking at stories and meanings
about non creed creeds and some unfamiliar Abrahamic stories.  I was
looking for consensus stories.

I observe these stories to be powerful and compelling.  Notice that Scott
gets edgy here I expect.  After all we find a non creed statement by
anticreed types tends to go creed after you put enough blood and treasure
and tears into it.  So if it is a non creed moral statement that people die
to defend then it ends up looking like a religious moral creed even if the
idea of a creed is against the non creed and most of the adherents moral
code.  Nothing is easy for the mechanical social engineer.

But it brings to mind a possible decision process.

Here it might look like:

My neighbor has a lot of weeds in his front yard.  I do not like that.
What should i do?

Now we crowd source stories about what to do.

My neighbor was that way.  She was a frail 75 year old female widow.  I
offered to take care of the lawn for her and she was glad for the offer.
The lawn bother her also. I paid my kid to do it as if he was a
contractor.  The kid got some business experience and the lawn looked great
within 6 weeks.  The woman was very greatful.  That winter she passed.  The
house sold quickly and the nice front yard I am sure helped.  The new
owners are a nice couple with a daughter my son's age.  My boy is thinking
about offering his services around the neighborhood.

And many more stories.  Some involved bank ownership.  Meth houses. Rentals
that were not fit for human habitation.

So we do some ranking.  Some  pattern matching.  When the question is asked
live then up comes a response and maybe a community interested in helping.
Dear abby design pattern.

If we need to go to public policy issues we might try running the stories
through a reification process and mashing them so that we have in fact code
that represents the crowd wisdom which then generates a statute.  Then
rework the generated text.
