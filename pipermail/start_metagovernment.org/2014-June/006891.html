<PRE>Muriel and Martin, (cc Metagov)

Muriel said:
&gt;<i> I think the mailing list itself is working well, although the group
</I>&gt;<i> it's very new and there's not many people yet (about 13 members)...
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of people showed interest in the topic at the live meeting
</I>&gt;<i> and, since it seemed a lot of people was working on these topics all
</I>&gt;<i> over the place, this list was intended to unite all those scattered
</I>&gt;<i> efforts internationally.
</I>
Thanks, Muriel.  I just joined liquid-democracy-international.

&gt;<i> I am excited to hear that you wrote somthing up and I am looking
</I>&gt;<i> forward to study it over the coming weeks as I find time. - However
</I>&gt;<i> I can't seem to find it, can you provide a link?
</I>
There's been some initial talk in the Metagov list.  That's where I
first posted about the idea of comparing these step-wise plans.  That
was just before I posted it to you, Martin.  Here's the thread:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006807.html</A>

(so I cc them, also because I moot the idea of using their wiki)

The basic idea of comparing overplans (if that's a good name for them)
is itself a kind of overplan.  I drafted it up and posted it to the
Metagov wiki: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>

That's mostly what the above thread is about.

&gt;<i> ... I think my [specific] proposal and also yours Mike is in essence
</I>&gt;<i> really a bit away from the other approaches ...
</I>
I also wrote up a full, specific overplan (my own), which shows what
one might look like: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>

That's a lot more than the single step (DvI) that I first suggested to
you, Martin.  If anyone wants to discuss it, then it would probably be
a topic for a separate thread.  Here I hope we can talk about the much
simpler, basic idea of &quot;one step at a time&quot; (as Martin puts it), and
the idea of comparing the various step-wise plans that would emerge.

&gt;<i> ... and during many recent Brunch and Lunch discussions I found that
</I>&gt;<i> it is really hard to drive the idea of trustless architecture
</I>&gt;<i> home. Never mind opinion aggregation, as far as I understood it, as
</I>&gt;<i> it is less applicable outside of a narrow scope.
</I>
Driving ideas...  I've been involved in attempts to drive the idea of
something or other into someone or other in this field for 7 years
with little to show for it.  We made progress as a small team.  We
spawned several good inventions in tight discussions by Skype or
email.  But we never made much progress communicating with rival
teams, or with a general audience, or uncommitted individuals (as in
lists), despite huge efforts.  Often the idea we wanted to communicate
was nothing but, &quot;Hey, let's cooperate on something (anything) at a
minimal level, and mature this field a little.&quot; *

So... One thing to like about this approach of comparing overplans (or
whatever we call them) is it seems to be unstoppable.  We don't really
need to convince anyone of the approach up front, or even explain it
(though probably we should try).  Instead it'll be enough to start
doing it.  Others will get sucked in willee nillee, because there's
just no reasonable alternative.  Or am I wrong?  Is there a reasonable
alternative to the steps below?

   CoP    Compare the overplans (or whatever we call them)
    |
   SoP    Select the best overplan
    |
   ToP    Track discussion of the overplan
    |
   XoP    Execute the overplan


Another thing to like about this approach is that you can never get
seriously stuck or lost.  You just keep following the steps of your
chosen overplan.  At worst, you'll have to cycle back to earlier steps
(like SoP) more often than you hoped.  But eventually you'll succeed,
guaranteed.  Or again, am I wrong?


 * One exception is Metagov where we hammered away for over 5 years.
   They were always a very open, democratic community, but now they're
   a neutral one, too.  They take no sides.  (I imagine that's partly
   because of Thomas and me, and our efforts there.)  So I figure the
   Metagov wiki is a good place to start posting overplans.

Mike
