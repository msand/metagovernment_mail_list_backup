<PRE>Max said:
&gt;<i> I found this hubristic.  ...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you're *not* an abstract thinker, but more of a practical hand,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then you'll nevertheless appreciate how the problem that prompted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the formation of this list (which is basically the problem of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; modernity) is now solved.  We know precisely how to &quot;start&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can never again become lost, or stuck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... So I gave you a story.
</I>
You're right, I speak with too much confidence about the solution.
Although I *feel* confident, someone might easily find a fault in it.
What I'm *most* confident about (but not 100%) are the first steps:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>

   CoP    (CoP) Compare the overplans
    |
   SoP    (SoP) Select the best overplan
    |
   ToP    (ToP) Track discussion of the overplan
    |
   XoP    (XoP) Execute the overplan
    .                               
    .

I admit that I could be wrong here.  But can anyone show that I
actually am?  Given that an overplan is &quot;a comprehensive plan for the
future of humanity&quot;, can anyone see a reasonable way to proceed into
that future *other* than by following the steps above?

Or can anyone see how we might follow those steps faithfully, yet
*still* become lost or stuck, e.g. as in the past?

Mike
