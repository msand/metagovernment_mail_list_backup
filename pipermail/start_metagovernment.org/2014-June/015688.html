<PRE>Mike, I think, whats wrong with the overplan approach is the same thing
that is wrong with a waterfall project management.

1. Waterfall project management is bullshit, but in theory it makes sense,
only in practice it doesnt, because the actual PROCESS of how things get
done in reality is different.
All the phases of project management happen in parallel or if you want...
all the phases are re-iterated again and again. So i think the approach is
wrong.

2. For what to put on the metagovernment.org website, ...we blanked it and
now try to collaboratively make up the content.
What about those &quot;overplan process&quot;, what about u suggest one element of
the process and then the next and we find out what this process should look
like through discussing it instead of you doing upfront everything :-)

Because you have thought about it already, you probably could easily
explain all the phases and why they are necessary or what would happen if
we for example would drop &quot;Underplanning&quot; and would directly jump to phase
3?

&gt;<i> You make two bold claims here, Scott.  I think they're both *too* bold

</I>&gt;<i> (To the group: In this discussion with Scott, I hope to demonstrate a
</I>&gt;<i> larger point about overplanning.  See bottom.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Other than a desire for &quot;good government&quot; I don't [think] any of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us are in a position to specify what it should even look like or how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to achieve it at the level of an &quot;overplan&quot;.  ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's your first claim.  But if your thinking is correct here, then
</I>&gt;<i> there must be something wrong with this overplan:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you actually *see* what is wrong with it?  I challenge you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...  Although I do give a basic structural outline of how the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; government itself should be organized in my book... and some key
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; points about the structure of The System... I'd rather do without an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;overplan&quot; in favor of designing a working decision-making system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; first and then seeing where that leads us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's your second claim, that we can design good systems with no idea
</I>&gt;<i> of how they could become useful to anyone.  But are you being sincere
</I>&gt;<i> here?  Are you really *unable* to conceive of any possible sequence of
</I>&gt;<i> events by which a new design for a decision system might prove useful
</I>&gt;<i> in structuring a good government?  Or in furthering some other good
</I>&gt;<i> cause?  None whatsoever?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Maybe I'm wrong, but I think Scott is now stuck.  There's no way to
</I>&gt;<i> dismiss overplans *in general* without abandoning reason.  If instead
</I>&gt;<i> you stand and confront them reasonably, as Scott is attempting to do,
</I>&gt;<i> then you're drawn into the practice of overplanning *whether you like
</I>&gt;<i> it or not*.  So it appears to be a sure-fire start technique.)
