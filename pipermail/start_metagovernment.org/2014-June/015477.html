&gt;<i> Not true. Take for example the &quot;government&quot; of this project. If you start another project using your decision rule and get more people to join it, you make us irrelevant. This project's rules just don't matter to the new project, and we fade away while your project transforms the world without us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Kind of puts the newcomer at a huge disadvantage, doesn't it?  You
pretty much have to create the *entire* new system before it can be
claimed that the old one is irrelevant.  It'll probably never happen
in any real-world sized project.  Much better (faster, more efficient
with resources, actually possible, etc.) to just have a coup and
replace the faulty components (leadership, decision rule, etc.)...

&gt;&gt;<i>   Too bad
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for us: That means to implement a direct democracy we have to go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> through every state legislature and have them vote themselves out of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> job...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of the United States, I am pretty sure that everywhere where a legislature has the authority to do something, that can also be done by a referendum. Referenda are horrible tools normally... but if everybody wants to get rid of the legislature (by means of changing the constitution), they can do so through referenda.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Two points on that:
1) Looks to me like you just conceded my point: A referendum would be
a single vote with a simple majority decision rule.  The only
discrepancy being that majority rule is apparently adequate in your
opinion to replace the US government, but not to make any changes to
the way Metagovernment is run ;-)

2) You're mistaken about using a referendum to do this anyway.  The US
constitution doesn't allow it, and there are a lot of states where it
wouldn't be possible even if the US constitution did allow it:
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiatives_and_referendums_in_the_United_States">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiatives_and_referendums_in_the_United_States</A>

&gt;<i> This is not a simple-majority-rule community and it never has been. Additionally, that vote did not sustain consensus for a week.
</I>
The term &quot;sustain consensus&quot; reflects your bias toward process over
result, and explains why *only* Vilfredo can be used to make decisions
for the group since that is the only system were &quot;sustaining
consensus&quot; is a characteristic of the design.  I, on the other hand,
object to the &quot;consensus&quot; requirement (or even goal), and consider
&quot;sustaining&quot; to be of no value since I'd rather just redo the vote if
the decision is suboptimal for any reason.  I'd also submit that
psychologically and philosophically &quot;sustaining consensus&quot; is just an
inappropriate design goal because what it says to me is &quot;burn out
interest in the issue to the extent that no one wants to deal with it
anymore&quot;.  By consuming all the resources (time, interest, etc.) by
design, what you're really doing is *ensuring* that a suboptimal
decision is reached and yet won't ever be revisited because of the
burnout.

&gt;<i> If the majority of this group wants to operate under a different decision rule, then I invite that majority to go form another group. I believe you will find that you are the only one going to that group, however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The majority does want that, and you alone are holding them hostage.
As I said in my original post to this group, this group exists and
occupies mindshare which has value and cannot be replaced.  This
morally obligates it (us) to make efficient use of that resource,
which IMHO is something that it has failed to do.  You're treating
this like your own pet project and I would again recommend you step
back and evaluate whether sacrificing our best route to direct
democracy on the alter of your fantasy about &quot;consensus
decisionmaking&quot; being the only way to achieve it.

&gt;<i> Who else is supporting you at this time? The only other input I have seen on this thread is others disagreeing with you.
</I>
Look at the Loomio votes to see what people want.  I don't see people
disagreeing with me.  What I do see is a whole lot of deference toward
you as &quot;fearless leader&quot;, a deference that IMHO is clearly misplaced.
The whole charter of this group is *AGAINST* that type of mentality,
and yet here you (and they) are embracing it!

&gt;<i> Apart from the process not following the standing rules, there is your own argument that something merely following the rules shouldn't be forced on the people. Ask this group if they agree with you now: I suspect you will get little (or likely no) support. So at this point, you are advocating tyranny, not me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Tyranny of the majority, perhaps.  But again, look at the Loomio vote
on decision rule.  Yours has been replaced, and I've seen no credible
argument against the validity of that vote other than your insistence
that the decision rule can't be changed except by following the old
decision rule.
  Regards,
    Scott
