&gt;<i> ... this thread mentions Vilfredo in the subject, but I don't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to understand how is it related. Just wanted to let you know in case
</I>&gt;<i> there was a hidden message. It's not arriving :-)
</I>
For me, it arrives in what Scott says:
&gt;<i> ... another possible solution: Simply omit the &quot;inspiration&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i> the recording of the law/rule.  When we try to include these
</I>&gt;<i> justifications in the rules themselves it makes the process of
</I>&gt;<i> creating them vastly more complicated, Exhibit A being this MG Home
</I>&gt;<i> Page project, albeit that being almost exclusively &quot;inspiration&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> with very little in the way of actual &quot;rules&quot;.  ...
</I>
I'd immediately agree to a home page that sticks to the dull facts.
Only when motivation enters do I get critical about the aesthetics of
the message, because then it must be communicated by aesthetic means,
i.e. by a competent effort at sincerity, as from an artist.

We needn't be sincere to state the dull facts, only correct.

I didn't get much opportunity to talk about my preferences and the
reasons behind them.  That's partly because everyone's tired of the
whole issue and wants to avoid sinking more effort into it.  But it's
also partly because Vilfredo hasn't encouraged or supported this kind
of talk, except tangentially, as we see in this thread.
