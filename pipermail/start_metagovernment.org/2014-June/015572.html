And yet, that is what all the big sites do.  There are specific hacks
that can be added at various places to get around these problems
conditionally and you'll see them if you do &quot;view source&quot; from a web
page (although, sometimes they are hidden in &quot;include&quot; files that
you'll then have to go out and fetch manually).  I'm always surprised
to see that IE is the default browser on the CU Boulder systems, and
although they also have Chrome and Firefox installed, neither of those
is set up to take you directly to the library catalog.

But this kind of crap is yet another reason why my first prototypes
will be released as apps rather than as a web site (the main reason of
course being that I'll be an order of magnitude more productive that
way).

    Scott
