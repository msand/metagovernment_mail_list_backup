<PRE>Pietro, there's a formatting error in Bentley's text; an unnecessary
abstract that misrepresents the text.  I mutated it last time to
remove the error: <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2690">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2690</A>

Now it's the next generation and my mutation is gone from the choices.
That makes no sense.  Why would anyone vote for the disfigured version
and downvote the corrected version?

&gt;<i> And yes, now we have only 2 versions in the Pareto Front.

One of them is disfigured, which is clearly unfair.  It might get
eliminated for no other reason.  I'll try again to prevent that by
re-mutating it.

I wish my input wasn't removed like this.  I know you don't intend it,
but it's a form of suppression.  I'm stating my preference.  Maybe it
doesn't get on the Pareto front, but that doesn't mean it's worthless
and can be thrown away.  It's still my preference till someone changes
my mind.

Mike
