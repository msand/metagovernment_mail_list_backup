</I>
Oooh, a debate!  I've been waiting for one of these...

&gt;<i> (To the group: In this discussion with Scott, I hope to demonstrate a
</I>&gt;<i> larger point about overplanning.  See bottom.)
</I>
No need to be shy: As I said from my first post I see the primary
roles of this list to allow each of us to polish up our presentations
via having other interested parties criticize them...

&gt;<i> Scott said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Other than a desire for &quot;good government&quot; I don't [think] any of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us are in a position to specify what it should even look like or how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to achieve it at the level of an &quot;overplan&quot;.  ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's your first claim.  But if your thinking is correct here, then
</I>&gt;<i> there must be something wrong with this overplan:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you actually *see* what is wrong with it?  I challenge you.
</I>
I can't even make it past the first paragraph.  The axioms seem
well-enough stated, but I see no evidence presented that either of the
two proposed systems are uniquely effective methods of achieving the
stated goals.  Being a psychologist I find the second particularly
problematic: There are a *lot* more effective ways to do social
engineering than via myth building (reinforcement-based conditioning
being the most obvious of these).

&gt;&gt;<i> ...  Although I do give a basic structural outline of how the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government itself should be organized in my book... and some key
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> points about the structure of The System... I'd rather do without an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;overplan&quot; in favor of designing a working decision-making system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first and then seeing where that leads us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's your second claim, that we can design good systems with no idea
</I>&gt;<i> of how they could become useful to anyone.  But are you being sincere
</I>&gt;<i> here?  Are you really *unable* to conceive of any possible sequence of
</I>&gt;<i> events by which a new design for a decision system might prove useful
</I>&gt;<i> in structuring a good government?  Or in furthering some other good
</I>&gt;<i> cause?  None whatsoever?
</I>
That's the problem: I can probably think of a dozen paths, and have
insufficient skill and information to choose among them.  Furthermore
I am quite sure that no one else can do this either other than the
inevitable Hitler/Stalin/Mao types who don't have to live within the
constraints I would impose on the process (i.e., we have to implement
the new system without killing millions of people).

&gt;<i> (Maybe I'm wrong, but I think Scott is now stuck.  There's no way to
</I>&gt;<i> dismiss overplans *in general* without abandoning reason.  If instead
</I>&gt;<i> you stand and confront them reasonably, as Scott is attempting to do,
</I>&gt;<i> then you're drawn into the practice of overplanning *whether you like
</I>&gt;<i> it or not*.  So it appears to be a sure-fire start technique.)
</I>
Again, I've no problem with setting Goals.  In fact there's a section
in my book on this, including some things a lot more specific than
&quot;good government&quot; that for some inexplicable reason we allow current
governments to simply skate on.  But what you're proposing I believe
requires a level of understanding that no one has.  This itself may be
amenable to research, but we're decades or maybe centuries away from
the day when social engineering is as mature a field as, e.g.,
structural engineering.  Until we get a lot closer to that point, you
might as well be proposing we build a bridge across the East River
with popsicle sticks for all we know.  My approach is different: We
start building bridges over ditches and smaller streams, learn what
works (and what doesn't) with the eventual goal of taking on these
bigger projects using what we've learned rather than starting off
making the unfounded assumption that we have any idea what we're
doing.
  Regards,
    Scott
