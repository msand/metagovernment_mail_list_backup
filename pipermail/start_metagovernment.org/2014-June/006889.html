<PRE>Saw this on Slashdot.  Here's the news report:
<A HREF="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28055678">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28055678</A>

I read most of the government report (In Norwegian via
Google-translate, ~150 pages, Argh).  A few key observations:

1) Only 19% of voters were primarily concerned about vote secrecy
(those would be mostly the authoritarians, for those who are following
along).  They tended to be the oldest and/or the least educated
voters.

2) There was (of course) no evidence of corruption (vote buying, etc.)
in the Internet voters.

3) The report itself *DOES NOT* support the parliament's decision to
halt the &quot;experiment&quot;.  Near as I can tell, the main reason they
discontinued it was merely because somehow they made approval
conditional on internet voting increasing voter participation rates
and it didn't.  Which is not at all surprising to me: They only did it
two times, so the vast majority of voters probably didn't even
consider participating in this &quot;experiment&quot;.  Switch *everyone* to
internet voting and I'm quite sure you'd see a completely different
result.

But in summary, this is for elections of a representative government,
which as we all know is just a fundamentally flawed system (is this on
the new Home page?) and so doesn't mean much for us other than as more
evidence that those people are part of the problem and we need to do
away with all of them.
  Regards,
    Scott
