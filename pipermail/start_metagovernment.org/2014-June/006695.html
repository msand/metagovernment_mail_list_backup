<PRE>Sorry if I change the subject, but I think the voting should have its own
thread, not confused with the discussion thread.



&gt;<i> I would prefer that the home page not change with each generation. Can we
</I>&gt;<i> change this proposal to be just that the final Vilfredo result will be the
</I>&gt;<i> MG home page at that time? Otherwise I imagine the proper process would be
</I>&gt;<i> to take the Vilfredo result to the list as a simple proposal for approval.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not easily, in the sense that Vilfredo does not always  reach an end
result. It does if there is a full consensus. But it is enough that one
person makes sure to vote against any popular proposal (remember any person
can change their vote) that a full consensus is not reached.

Basically in the years we observed Vilfredo reach one of 3 possible results.
1) full consensus, everybody is happy.
2) full consensus except for one person, who generation after generation
will keep voting for a proposal that the others do not like, often written
by him. (Manuel has the long standing record here of holding his ground for
17 generations)
3) a real unreconciliable polarity. With some people reaching a partial
consensus over one proposal, other people reaching their consensus over the
other proposal, and nearly no one voting for both.

In case 2 and 3, eventually people start to drop out because they get
bored, or have no ideas anymore, and the &quot;theoretical win&quot; goes to the
person more resilient (which actually is often what happens in the ling
night meetings of the UN, I heard).

In all this deciding to &quot;use the result&quot; is not such an easy claim. Except
in case 1 (which we are not going to get, since Michael have already
claimed that he will &quot;block&quot; the process -his words-) what is the result?

Also consider that the length of a question is not decided at the
beginning. It is a recursive process, and it continues until people reach a
consensus, or keep adding ideas. It can reach a consensus in 1 generation
or in 20 (usually 3-4 are enough).

My idea &quot;

------------------------------------------------------------
that at the end of each generation we change the homepage using the
proposals that are in the Pareto Front AND have the maximum of the votes.

When this is more than one proposal, they should be represented side by
side (until the next generation when the situation would be solved).
------------------------------------------------------------

made sure that we had always something on the homepage, not a blank
homepage. Whatever we had was quite supported.  And it would become stable
only when the Vilfredo process became stable.

Maybe is not the best solution, but if you want to use the final Vilfredo
result, you need to first define what &quot;final&quot; and &quot;result&quot; is. The system
tend to get stable, but not in a way you can easily predict.

In any case I am happy to go a few other generations, so you and Scott and
Steve and Max get more and idea of how it works, and maybe you can present
your own proposal.


Cheers,
Pietro
