<PRE>Michael,

Can you do me a favour and stop changing the e-mail subject line when it's
the same proposal? it breaks the flow in my email reader and makes it
appear a new thread.

Thanks,
Jo

&gt;<i> Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> I made a proposal to use Vilfredo for the homepage. No one opposed it. The
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio proposal was dropped by the author, and Ed sayd how Vilfredo was so
</I>&gt;<i> much better than Loomio (surprising me). As we were discussing it (Steve
</I>&gt;<i> asking how to proceed) Ned started the question. We all rushed there, and
</I>&gt;<i> started using it. This is as much as a voting to reach a consensus over the
</I>&gt;<i> home page, as it is a tutorial moment (both Steve and Bentley wanting to
</I>&gt;<i> try Vilfredo out and you recognising that &quot;Vilfredo has improved
</I>&gt;<i> considerably since I last used it.&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Steve wanted to use this more, and Bentley was trying to get his head
</I>&gt;<i> around the, not simple, concepts of Vilfredo you just took a snippet out of
</I>&gt;<i> it, and wrote a proposal. Somehow everything else we did is not valid. My
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is not valid. The process we are going through is not valid. And
</I>&gt;<i> the only thing that seem to be valid are proposal written in your specific
</I>&gt;<i> way, by you, who also arrogate to you the right to decide for people who
</I>&gt;<i> have not voted, how you expect them to vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I feel you are trying to cheat us. Not so much in having your
</I>&gt;<i> homepage, but in wanting the process your way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was a time when Vilfredo was at the center of Metagovernment. So
</I>&gt;<i> much that I was writing most of the posts, and the list was quite silent.
</I>&gt;<i> As I did not want that I went silent, so other project could raise and
</I>&gt;<i> share the space. I do not want Vilfredo to be the only project, but I also
</I>&gt;<i> do not want Vilfredo to be so much in the periphery that new members do not
</I>&gt;<i> even know that is there.
</I>&gt;<i> You think Vilfredo is good as a &quot;brainstorming tool&quot;. I disagree, Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> is much more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This decision, right now, is being taken using Vilfredo. Or at least Ned
</I>&gt;<i> is asking it, and I am helping along, hoping to show how far can Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> go. Of course if you do not play along we cannot have a full consensus. And
</I>&gt;<i> not always appear a consensus. But the aim of Vilfredo is not just to reach
</I>&gt;<i> consensus but to expose the hidden polarity so that after you can vote on
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please, have patience, and if you cannot please at least do not vote for
</I>&gt;<i> other people.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Michael, please do not do this kind of things. This is very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; incorrect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So you feel that we must now use Vilfredo for deciding the content of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the home page.  Maybe you agree with Ned that our majority decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rule is wrong and ought to be replaced by unanimity.  But shouldn't we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have agreed to that, first?  Wouldn't that be more correct?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I added your No vote, Pietro.  But I have questions for you and Ned:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How can we put content on the home page if it's now &quot;very incorrect&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to propose content here in the list?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What'll you do if you eventually reach consensus in Vilfredo?  Just go
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and force a change to our home page?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And what if the Loomio group meantime reaches a separate consensus?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do they get to force the home page, too?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    PROPOSAL 3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    ----------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        choose between the lesser of a few evils.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        society work together.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        governments and societies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    -------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        For: Bentley, Mike
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Against: Ned, Pietro
