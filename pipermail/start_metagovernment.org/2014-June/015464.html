I actually thought this was a good idea and would have done it myself
had I thought of it.  I just dumped all 5 of mine in one long proposal
which doesn't work so well because all you see is the summary for
that.  This sort of issue is actually pretty common in &quot;real life&quot;
where bills (particularly budgets) have many semi-independent clauses
that people need to be able act on (rate, comment on, etc.)
separately, so the system needs to handle this kind of thing
efficiently.

My original plan was to have a separate system for dealing with
budgets where people would actually drag and drop to set the
priorities of individual items, but now I'm thinking more along the
lines of having just a single rating/comment system, but allow it to
work on individual clauses in the proposal.  This would mean using
maybe a 10-star system instead of just 5 (to allow finer tuning), but
the proposer would still get the feedback they need to tweak the
proposal to improve the overall rating (e.g., by dropping highly
unpopular clauses).

This experience has also reinforced my belief that there needs to be a
single individual responsible for proposals, however: Forking should
be allow, but must be made far more expensive than &quot;Mutate&quot; in
Valfredo: We've only got half a dozen people active and yet there are
30 proposals to read in this second round.  Imagine what would happen
with a million (or a billion) active participants...
  Regards,
    Scott

PS: My vote is for continuing with Vilfredo until it runs its course
on this issue and I don't support any shenanigans like boycotts or
whatever.  Signing up for that system (or Loomio) is NOT an
unnecessary burden and furthermore if anyone refuses to do that I'm
perfectly comfortable with classifying them as not an active member of
the group.

PPS: I also had a rather devious/paranoid thought about why there are
a dozen active members and over a hundred lurkers (a high ratio in my
experience with running mailing lists): Probably all the non-active
members are Secret Police for various governments (e.g., the NSA) and
are merely watching us as a threat assessment ;-)
