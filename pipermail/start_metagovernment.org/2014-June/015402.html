<PRE>Hi Bentley,
thank you very much for this message.

I have to admit I understand Jacopo's position when he says that 2650 is
too general. It is more like an introductions. So I am very happy for it to
be in the Pareto Front, so it will be an important ingredient in the next
generation. But not the sole winner.

Similarly what I miss in 2649 a paragraph that clearly states that we are
working on different projects, and links to the list, dividing between
projects represented (someone from that project came here once), and &quot;in
house&quot; projects (someone is constantly here and we are following the
development quite close).

2651 has such a paragraph. So I don't think I will change my vote, instead
as soon as the voting phase is over I am planning to do a bit of paragraph
shopping, and mix up a few ideas.

I am quite happy that we do not reach a consensus at this generation, as I
feel no proposal is complete enough.

Pietro

P.S. it's the first time that a person discusses in public the ins and outs
of some proposals, speaking directly to the key players, very interesting
twist.
