&gt;<i> Honestly, not one time did you accept Vilfredo suggestion on what to

</I>
I thought I was playing fair.  I rewrote several proposals including
one of Ned's.  Never once did I propose anything of my own (except
throwing tomatoes at Ned).  Instead I championed other proposals,
including two of Ned's.  I reproposed them because they were the best
proposals by far (in my opinion) and almost reached total consensus.

Please continue without me for a while, and I'll try to rejoin in a
few generations.  Let's see how it works without a stubborn eccentric
like me getting in the way.  Please don't waste the opportunity.

If instead you and Ned prefer to call a majority vote immediately,
then I'll vote for just about anything that doesn't contain mistruths
or misleading statements.  So I'd probably vote for Ed's latest
proposal (or rewrite), the one that nearly had consensus last round.
It's good enough (if I recall) for a temporary home page.

To be sure (though probably you already know), if we call a majority
vote on multiple choices, then we must explain clearly that people are
always free to vote &quot;none of the above&quot;.  Otherwise the result would
be invalid, of course.  I recommend instead just putting the strongest
text to a simple yes/no vote.

Peace,

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> in this experiment you have been a key player nearly generation except one.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 1 you were a key player for proposal 2651;
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 2 you were a key player for proposal 2678 and 2679;
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 3 there were no key players;
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 4 you were a key player for proposal 2677 and 2710;
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 5 you are a key player for proposal 2739 and 2741.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Each time Vilfredo sent you an email asking you to rewrite the proposal for
</I>&gt;<i> which you were a keyplayer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 2, you did not write anything (despite being invited to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite 2651).
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 3, you rewrote proposal 2656 (which you already liked) and
</I>&gt;<i> ignored Vilfredo request to rewrite instead proposal 2678 and/or 2679
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 4 you had no requests, changed a proposal and represented
</I>&gt;<i> proposal 2650 (which was in any case present in the Pareto Front).
</I>&gt;<i> On generation 5 you again presented another copy of 2650, while ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> the request from Vilfredo to rewrite proposal 2677 and/or 2710.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly, not one time did you accept Vilfredo suggestion on what to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite to bring the community nearer to an agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And now you tell us:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; This time Ned and Michael are key players. And should probably write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; their own version of the proposal they did not like trying to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the information from the comments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ned doesn't actually agree with his own proposals, as he explained.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; He has a much longer text in mind.  It won't help if *I* re-write his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals; he himself must do that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Ned, like all of us, votes also for proposals that are not perfect for him.
</I>&gt;<i> In generation 1 he voted for all proposals except for 1. IN generation 2 he
</I>&gt;<i> voted for all proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> After he only voted for 2 proposals, but he also explained that that was
</I>&gt;<i> because he thought in this way he was making the Pareto Front smaller (I
</I>&gt;<i> clarified with him that this is not how the Pareto Front works
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006865.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006865.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure if you try to follow Vilfredo invitation, he will consider your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal without discarding it, a priori. But you need to do your part. Not
</I>&gt;<i> just repeating what you think is the best, or walk away.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo does not always reach a consensus. Sometimes (in fact most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; of the time), it just reaches a very clear, unsolvable, polarity. Or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; a three poles polarity (does that have a specific name?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I prefer a text we can all agree to, even if it's short to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You and Ned prefer a long text to begin with (300 words minimum), even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it divides us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was not serious when I spoke about the 300 words, as I was not serious
</I>&gt;<i> when, in the same phrase, I spoke about closing you and Ed in a room
</I>&gt;<i> together. What I said, and I kept repeating, is that you cannot use
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo to develop different parts of a question in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is Votorola approach, I gather. And generally the wiki approach. This
</I>&gt;<i> does not work in this way, which is why I shoot them down. Because once we
</I>&gt;<i> reach a consensus the question ends and I don't want to reach a Game Over
</I>&gt;<i> with a partial answer (imprecise yes, partial no).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The remaining 5 or 6 Vilfredo users seem caught in between, proposing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; medium-short texts of 4-10 sentences.  If I withdraw temporarily from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo and stop making objections, then maybe they'll re-focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; long texts as you and Ned wish.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> You can withdraw, or you can give it a try to actually follow what Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> suggests you, and really see how this software works. In the past several
</I>&gt;<i> questions reached a consensus once someone rewrote what Vilfredo suggested
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; If we do not reach a consensus on the next proposal I will suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to just pick whatever are the proposal in the Pareto front and Vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with Majority Judgment on them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please don't quit on my account.  After all, it's only an experiment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Allow it to run its course.  I'll withdraw temporarily to watch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me it has run its course:
</I>&gt;<i> reaching a consensus among less people is less valid that recognising a
</I>&gt;<i> polarity in the group. But it would be even better if we could try to reach
</I>&gt;<i> a consensus. But for that you need to stop reproposing the same proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> and accept to rewrite proposal you do not like, adapting them to be
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable for you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This generation Vilfredo invited you to rewrite proposals 2739 and 2741.
</I>&gt;<i> Why not giving it a try?
