<PRE>Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> Michael, please do not do this kind of things. This is very
</I>&gt;<i> incorrect.
</I>
So you feel that we must now use Vilfredo for deciding the content of
the home page.  Maybe you agree with Ned that our majority decision
rule is wrong and ought to be replaced by unanimity.  But shouldn't we
have agreed to that, first?  Wouldn't that be more correct?

I added your No vote, Pietro.  But I have questions for you and Ned:
How can we put content on the home page if it's now &quot;very incorrect&quot;
to propose content here in the list?

What'll you do if you eventually reach consensus in Vilfredo?  Just go
and force a change to our home page?

And what if the Loomio group meantime reaches a separate consensus?
Do they get to force the home page, too?

Mike


   PROPOSAL 3
   ----------
   Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:

       OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

       Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
       re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
       choose between the lesser of a few evils.                      

       We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
       to use technology to work on these issues together when it is  
       convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having    
       society work together.

       Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
       and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
       governments and societies.                                     

   Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.
