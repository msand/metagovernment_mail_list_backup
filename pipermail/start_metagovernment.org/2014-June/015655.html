<PRE>Pietro said:
&gt;<i> This time Ned and Michael are key players. And should probably write
</I>&gt;<i> their own version of the proposal they did not like trying to use
</I>&gt;<i> the information from the comments.
</I>
Ned doesn't actually agree with his own proposals, as he explained.
He has a much longer text in mind.  It won't help if *I* re-write his
proposals; he himself must do that.

&gt;<i> Vilfredo does not always reach a consensus. Sometimes (in fact most
</I>&gt;<i> of the time), it just reaches a very clear, unsolvable, polarity. Or
</I>&gt;<i> a three poles polarity (does that have a specific name?).
</I>
I prefer a text we can all agree to, even if it's short to begin with.
You and Ned prefer a long text to begin with (300 words minimum), even
if it divides us.

The remaining 5 or 6 Vilfredo users seem caught in between, proposing
medium-short texts of 4-10 sentences.  If I withdraw temporarily from
Vilfredo and stop making objections, then maybe they'll re-focus on
long texts as you and Ned wish.

&gt;<i> If we do not reach a consensus on the next proposal I will suggest
</I>&gt;<i> to just pick whatever are the proposal in the Pareto front and Vote
</I>&gt;<i> with Majority Judgment on them.
</I>
Please don't quit on my account.  After all, it's only an experiment.
Allow it to run its course.  I'll withdraw temporarily to watch.

Mike
