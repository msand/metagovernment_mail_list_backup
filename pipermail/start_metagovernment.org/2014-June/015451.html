<PRE>Mike,

You bring up some interesting points about participation by people not in
the system being used. We do need to decide if to make a decision official
it also has to go to a vote in the email list or if the rule of the system
being used are sufficient. I'm equally torn. People should not be forced to
us a system they don't like but also using these system,s is a core of
MetaGovernment.

 I think everyone is open to other decisions being made in other systems or
the email list. The concern is making two very similar systems in two
different systems in a similar time period.

I disagree with your proposal specifically because the text is not
complete. Not because of the system being used. I voted for it in Vilfredo
because I was learning how it works. I'm a little disappointing that I can
only vote up or down on an item. I would refer a ranking. I imagine that
would make the math exponentially harder. I voted for the best several
proposals so they would move to the next round but I do not think any are
done. I have proposed a new version with text taken from other items and
some items removed. I would prefer to not see this old text on the home
page now even though it is better than a blank page. I would prefer to not
have the page change then change again so quickly. I don't think I will
agree to a proposal on the home page until I can drink up the other ideas
and build an informed opinion.

In my experience Home Pages are one of the most contentious issues in group
governance. If we can make it through this we will be in a good place.

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro, cc Ned, Bentley  (a request at bottom)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you felt that Vilfredo was not part of the decision process. But
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was some type of &quot;brainstorming&quot;. While me, Ned and Bentley felt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this was the actual decision going on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I'm happy to have Vilfredo as *part* of the decision process.
</I>&gt;<i> What I didn't realize was that it would now be the *entire* process,
</I>&gt;<i> and non-users of Vilfredo would no longer have a say in the home page.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you made a proposal which from your point of view was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; independent, while for us it was trying to shortcut a decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system that was being implemented. When we voted against it (and in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a way you did not expect) you felt that your proposal was unjustly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struck down. and this felt that we were &quot;forcing on you&quot; Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Weren't you?  You agreed with the proposal when it was in Vilfredo,
</I>&gt;<i> but then down-voted it when it was taken outside.  Then you called me
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;cheat&quot; for making it.  So naturally I felt that I (and everyone
</I>&gt;<i> else) was being forced to use Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So they key element is that according to you Vilfredo is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brainstorming method while according to me, and Ned and Bentley is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an actual decision mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fair enough, I promise never to call Vilfredo a &quot;brainstorming&quot; tool
</I>&gt;<i> again.  If I forget, you can call Votorola a &quot;decision mechanism&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> I will stifle my shouts of protest. ;^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seriously, I already agree that Vilfredo is a useful tool for
</I>&gt;<i> small-scale decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And the other key element is that we did not &quot;vote on what system to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use&quot;.  I made an official proposal to use Vilfredo. Steve asked how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to proceed, and Ned did not wait for the voting process, but simply
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; started.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If this proposal to use Vilfredo was gone through the vote (so a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote on the voting system, a meta-vote), then we would be ok in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using Vilfredo, and you would not feel forced anymore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the group agrees to use Vilfredo alone and to exclude non-Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> users from participating in decisions, then OK.  Then you can rightly
</I>&gt;<i> call me a &quot;cheat&quot; if ever again I use Metagov's old decision process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meantime, please you, Ned and Bentley remove your 'no' votes from this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.  None of you disagree with the proposal itself, instead you
</I>&gt;<i> were trying to block the decision process and force changes through
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo.  That's not fair.
