<PRE>Here is a problem set that need a little extra.

For some historical affinities some now more that 200 years ago it happens
that two different religions wanted to merge circa 1950.

The bigger was certainly non creed and humanistic atheist pretty much.  The
other was Christian and real about it.

The story goes that they set up two conventions side by side.  Now the
sticking point was a set of principles to guide the marriage and the
future.

One side really needed a reference to their deity in the principles and the
other side really did not.  Thing got very difficult.  Both conventions
wanted to quit and go home.

Some genius split the issue into principles to guide us and historical
sources of wisdom and inspiration.  (Take care about the wording I used)

Current psych research says why that should work.

Here how do you get the software to support that smoothly? I can do this in
RRO.  I can also do this in some sort of covenant relationship but it is
hard to do  a covenant without the agreement on how we will chose to
covenant.

You can see some effort in MG that is a bit like that story.  I can see the
problem clearly in words like &quot;quality&quot;.

On the post script the joining I believe got better than 90% agreement.

This represents quite an outlier.  Software tends to orient toward common
situations.
