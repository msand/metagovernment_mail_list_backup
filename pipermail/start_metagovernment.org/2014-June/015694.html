Hopefully this will continue to be the case when you get my full list ;-)

&gt;<i>  I agree that inheritance issues are very
</I>&gt;<i> important, but I don't believe that your criticism of my book on this matter
</I>&gt;<i> is well placed. Inheritance issues are typically addressed via policies of
</I>&gt;<i> federal and state governments and such policies are outside the domain of my
</I>&gt;<i> book.  Rather, the book focuses only on concepts and mechanics of a LEDDA
</I>&gt;<i> (Local Economic Direct Democracy Association).
</I>
I'm not buying it: The single largest reason we need something like
LEDDAs (or some other form of major economic reform) is *because* of
the inequality that inheritance causes.  Eliminate inheritance and
we've just saved ourselves a whole lot of trouble implementing
workarounds for the damage it causes.  I'm also quite sure that it
would also be a hell of a lot easier to get this implemented than
Piketty's &quot;wealth tax&quot; or LEDDAs.  All we need is a mythology (or
propaganda!) to convince the masses to take the wool off of their eyes
and see this.  I think we have some expertise in this area on this
list, perhaps one of them will come up with the magic incantation...
  Regards,
    Scott
