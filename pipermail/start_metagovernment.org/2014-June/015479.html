<PRE>Finally I get a clue on the Front.  Impressive.

I think I am more/less comfortable with  chaos than the revolutionary
Scott.  A paradox.

Having been hopeful in the past I will get a login and look around.  I
would rather not but wtf.

Here follow my improvement thoughts.  Understand I mainly bother because I
can here represent the outside view.

Tutorials and doc big.

Window into live ops from outside big.

License is always a hot item for me and the my current preceived
considerations are exactly opposite Scott's.  And license is?

Whatever on cycle times on home page but whenever you want to go to
implement then deal with what constitutes approval by going to a vote of
entire mailing list on a customary scheme.

On this side of the pond some of us like multiple parallel sign off modes.
We also like to cheat.

&gt;<i> Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Scott,
</I>&gt;<i> hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bentley:
</I>&gt;<i> every generation some proposals of the previous generation go to the next
</I>&gt;<i> generation. From a mathematical point of view, those are the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal that are not-dominated by any other proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In our case only 4 proposals were in the Pareto Front. We then wrote 21
</I>&gt;<i> (twentyone!!!) new proposals :-), and so one we have to evaluate each of
</I>&gt;<i>  those 21+4=25 proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen that someone (Ned, I gather) have started writing proposals
</I>&gt;<i> expressing parts of the homepage. Unfortunately Vilfredo does not work in
</I>&gt;<i> this way. Basically the domination system that makes sure that one proposal
</I>&gt;<i> dominates another under certain conditions makes only sense if the two
</I>&gt;<i> proposals are trying to answer the same question. Semantically speaking. So
</I>&gt;<i> you can substitute one proposal for the other. When this is not the case,
</I>&gt;<i> the result is much less meaningful. You might end up finding a full
</I>&gt;<i> consensus over a small part of what you are working on. This is the reason
</I>&gt;<i> why I explained at the beginning that Vilfredo works well for &quot;how shall
</I>&gt;<i> we&quot; kind of question. In other words question where we are looking for a
</I>&gt;<i> single answer (maybe complex). But not a list of elements more or less
</I>&gt;<i> independently structure. If we want to use Vilfredo in this way, we should
</I>&gt;<i> open a separate question for each element. For example if we agree to have
</I>&gt;<i> a specific structure made of &quot;mission, vision, projects, ... &quot; then for
</I>&gt;<i> each of them we can ask: &quot;what is the mission of Vilfredo to insert in the
</I>&gt;<i> homepage?&quot;. (which is not a how, but it is still a question where you are
</I>&gt;<i> looking for a single winning proposal).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott:
</I>&gt;<i> There were some suggestions from you (Scott), to evaluate the proposals
</I>&gt;<i> with a 10 star system. It is interesting, but first you would need to
</I>&gt;<i> understand the way Vilfredo works. What you are suggesting is something
</I>&gt;<i> similar to Range Voting. A slightly better version of that would be
</I>&gt;<i> Majority Judgment. But regardless, Vilfredo uses a completely different
</I>&gt;<i> method. We DO NOT sum the votes. Instead we declare that a proposal A
</I>&gt;<i> dominates a proposal B iff (if and only if) the set of people that vote for
</I>&gt;<i> B is a subset of the people that vote for A. So it is not just that A has
</I>&gt;<i> more support, but it is also supported by the same people. So each person
</I>&gt;<i> that like B will also be happy if we pass A. Then the Pareto Front is the
</I>&gt;<i> set of the non-dominated proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> In this way you can be sure that whoever votes in Vilfredo, will find at
</I>&gt;<i> least one of the proposals he voted for in the Pareto Front. Because if you
</I>&gt;<i> voted for B, and A dominates B, so that A is in the Pareto Front. Then you
</I>&gt;<i> MUST have also voted for A, so you are still represented in the Pareto
</I>&gt;<i> Front. For this reason you can say that the Pareto Front represents the
</I>&gt;<i> community :-).
</I>&gt;<i> The next version of Vilfredo will use a mixed system. People will vote on
</I>&gt;<i> an inverted triangle to say how much they like and they understand a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. Then a first approximation will be used to find the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> And in situations where several proposals are competing (especially if no
</I>&gt;<i> one is presenting new ideas) the actual position in the triangle will be
</I>&gt;<i> used. It is much more complex, which is why its development is so slow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally consider looking at the Pareto Front, looking at how you vote, and
</I>&gt;<i> how by changing your vote you can slightly change the Pareto Front. We are
</I>&gt;<i> releasing this information (the graph, how other people votes) specifically
</I>&gt;<i> so that people can change their vote and look for a specific consensus.

</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I wrote a proposal suggesting that this Vilfredo consultation was the
</I>&gt;<i> official way for Metagovernment to decide the homepage.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this proposal reaches enough support then maybe we can reach an
</I>&gt;<i> agreement inside the community with the people (i.,e. Michael Allen) who
</I>&gt;<i> feel we are excluding by using Vilfredo without going through a formal vote
</I>&gt;<i> before. Please take your time to vote.
