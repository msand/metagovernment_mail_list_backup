<PRE>Sorry, disagree (-).

It's not clear what problem we're trying to solve with this proposal.
I feel it's especially confusing to mix issues (home page, decision
making, testing new platforms).  If the home page is a concern, then
let's start by talking about what the problem is.  We're not doing
that.  It makes no sense to discuss solutions (e.g. particular
content) when we've no idea what the basic problem is.  E.g. maybe the
home page is missing some important information?  What kind of
information would be important on a home page?  Anybody know?  (Don't
answer here please, I'm just explaining what I mean.)

Or if decision making is a concern, then what is the problem with the
current decision-making process?  Again (don't answer here), it makes
no sense to decide on a solution (Loomio) when we haven't talked about
the problem it's supposed to solve.

Or if some people want to test different platforms and think maybe
that could be a purpose for this group, then I guess we should clarify
our purpose.  Do we have a purpose?  Do we want a purpose?  What kind
of purpose do we want?  (Again, don't answer here.)

So maybe we have lots of different problems, or maybe none at all.
But please let's take them one at time, or it's too confusing.
