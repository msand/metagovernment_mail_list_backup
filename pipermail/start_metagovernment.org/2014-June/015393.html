So you're saying that a simple majority (or whatever supermajority)
vote by the population is not sufficient and that bombs and guns are
required to achieve the replacement?

&gt;<i>  Unless of course there were a
</I>&gt;<i> *ruling* to change the *rule*&#8230;which I imagine would be unlikely.
</I>
All the governing documents I've looked at (dozens) include some
facility for amending them.  Most of them require quorums or
supermajorities that are so large as to make changes extremely
difficult if not impossible (try changing the governing documents of
an HOA, for example: It's a practical impossibility for most of them).
Which is why I consider this issue of &quot;what makes a revolution
legitimate&quot; such an important one.  This is actually an issue I'd like
to see the Metagovernment project take on when we get done with this
home page project.  It would seem to me that establishing and then
proselytizing a &quot;peaceful revolution rule&quot; is something we ought to be
doing as part of the process of building better governing systems.

&gt;<i> I skimmed the introduction to *The Plan* to find what % of the general
</I>&gt;<i> population SD&amp;A&#8217;s (in theory) account for and couldn't find the actual
</I>&gt;<i> number in a quick glance.  If I remember correctly, your *simple majority*
</I>&gt;<i> endorsement is based on that metric. Is that accurate? If so, what is the
</I>&gt;<i> (stated) % of the general population that exhibit those (two) tendencies?
</I>
Authoritarianism is a continuum and so it depends on where you draw
the line (it's much like autism in that respect, and actually in
several other respects as well).  I've gone round and round on this
with various people (including Altemeyer himself) and really REALLY
wish it was a bimodal distribution which would make drawing that line
a lot easier.  As it is, not only is where you draw the line a
difficult thing to establish, but it's also subject to a host of
outside influences.  For example, having people just read a paragraph
about how some group they belong to is under some kind of threat
significantly increases everyone's scores on Altemeyer's RWA test,
with the effect being much larger the higher the individual's baseline
score would be.  This gets back to the issue of how Hitler got
&quot;elected&quot; dictator and why I believe that that sort of thing will
happen again once resource shortages start reappearing.  I've actually
be working on the book more lately to integrate a refutation of the
thesis in Pinker's tome &quot;The Better Angels of Our Nature&quot;.  I think
his theory that democracy and sharing of information is inexorably
decreasing violence in the world is wrong, and actually dangerously
naive, because he doesn't even *mention* authoritarianism as a factor
and for the most part engages in pathetic hand waving when it comes to
the issue of resource scarcity as a cause of violence.

&gt;<i> It seems to me, if research proves that % (metric) to be accurate, then an
</I>&gt;<i> effectual decision rule should reflect that number in some relative and
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful way.
</I>
Right, which is where my 1/3 rule came from.  That's the highest
percentage I've seen anyone else draw the line, and should be
sufficient in all but the most threatening situations (any higher than
that and civilization is probably already breaking down and no
legitimate vote is even possible anyway).
  Regards,
    Scott
