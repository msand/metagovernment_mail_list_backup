I believe Jefferson recommended periodic revolution to keep a democracy on it&#8217;s toes.  :-)

It seems to me there will always be the possibility of a certain tyranny in a system governed by consensus. Particularly, if consensus it requisite to change the system&#8230;.how is it possible to keep the system from turning towards stagnation?   There will always be the possibility of a single individual (or a relatively small number of people) hanging on to the *refresh* button when their fear of change is greater than their desire to collaborate.  Then of course the are the Dick Cheney&#8217;s of the world who have no qualms about *ruling* for their own best interest.

Whereas with a simple majority rule, it&#8217;s seems that every individual is always facing the possibility of being *easily ruled out* and is therefore less likely to participate when their views are perceived to be those of the minority.

On the one hand, the majority fears the power of the individual to hold things up, or manipulate the system in their favor. 

On the other, the individual fears the power of the majority to overlook their individual views and concerns and moves towards isolation and apathy.

In my mind, neither one is optimal.
