<PRE>Well spoken, Bentley.  I doubt anyone else will vote for this proposal
now that you've withdrawn your own approval; it would be too strange.
I was happy to use Vilfredo myself till I learned it was being forced
on me: either accept Vilfredo's rules, or forget about the home page.
Now I have to choose.


   PROPOSAL 3
   ----------
   Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:

       OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

       Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
       re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
       choose between the lesser of a few evils.

       We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
       to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
       convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
       society work together.

       Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
       and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
       governments and societies.

   Then leave the door open to further proposals and content.

&gt;<i> Thank you for appreciating the text. Sorry I've been so quiet on this
</I>&gt;<i> thread. I wanted to see where it would go.  I don't believe all the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals so far have followed the rules specifically and some proposals
</I>&gt;<i> were to change the rules so I'm not sure where that leaves us. The rules
</I>&gt;<i> have a few holes in them in defining the participants and I don't believe
</I>&gt;<i> it specifies a system. I don't see anyone cheating or manipulating the
</I>&gt;<i> system. This seems to be a result of different interpretations and
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding which tends to happen. We'll sort it out in time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My priority right now is experimenting with systems and it would be nice to
</I>&gt;<i> say we made the decision using a system. My preference would be to wait on
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo although I don't have a great justification.
