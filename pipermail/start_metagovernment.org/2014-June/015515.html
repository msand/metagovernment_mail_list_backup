<PRE>I don't think this is a group decision, Jacopo; it's an individual
decision.  Anyone who wishes to use Airesis is immediately free to,
and anyone who doesn't can't be forced.  A group decision (one way or
the other) won't change that.

Likewise each person is free to use Vilfredo, or not.  There was no
group decision to use it.  Some started using it, while others didn't.
It's an experimental tool with a unique design for consensus making,
which makes it interesting.  I think that's why people are trying it.

Unless I'm wrong (please correct me), Airesis isn't so much a tool as
a place to live.  It's a group-hosting platform with built-in tools.
Most of us aren't looking for that because we already have the best
mailing list software (arguably better than your forums, though some
may disagree), the best wiki software (almost certainly better than
your document storage), plus whatever other tools we choose to add to
the mix in the future.  For a tech-savvy group like us, we already
have pretty much the best living space that's available.  I think that
explains why we're less interested in Airesis.

(To be clear, I'm not voting in this proposal.)

&gt;<i> I would like to invite everyone, once the Vilfredo decisional process, that
</I>&gt;<i> I like very much, is completed, to start a new proposal in Airesis and test
</I>&gt;<i> properly the platform.
</I>&gt;<i> With Real Participation!
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe that for building the text of a home page, the Airesis
</I>&gt;<i> platform may actually works better. I will be not starting it because my
</I>&gt;<i> english is not good enough and I am not the most indicated person to do it,
</I>&gt;<i> but I think that everyone will be impressed by the flexibility of the
</I>&gt;<i> system. I will participate with my creativity...
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo Tolja
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PS as it may result in the proposal of different texts for each potential
</I>&gt;<i> page that may be proposed in that case, will be selected automatically the
</I>&gt;<i> Schulze method.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we can work at a single text collaboratively than will be only use the
</I>&gt;<i> majority  method.
