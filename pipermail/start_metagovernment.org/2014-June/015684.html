<PRE>Dear All,
The Vilfredo question has now ended. It has not &quot;formally&quot; ended because
the system recognises only consensus as a possible outcome. But basically a
whole &quot;max time&quot; (2 days) has passed without anyone feeling the need to add
anything. So whatever we have reached, this should be seen as representing
the community.
You can see the whole history of what happened here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164</A> also if you are not logged in.
And what we have now are 4 alternative, mutually exclusive proposals:

In order of appearance they are:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 1:

Countless public decisions are made each year by communities, cities,
nations, and many other kinds of organizations. Those decisions affect the
quality of our lives, the health of our biosphere, and the welfare of
future generations.

Metagovernment is the community of people who are working:

   - to make those decisions be of the highest quality.
   - to give everyone the option of being directly involved in making those
   decisions.
   - to use technology to work on issues together when it is convenient for
   us.
   - to explore new ways of organizing society and working together.

We discuss and work on ideas and technologies for new governance systems
that will achieve these goals.

Join our community &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A>&gt; and start
to claim control of the important decisions affecting your future.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 2

Better Lives Through Better Decisions
Globally, at least tens of millions of public-matter decisions are made
each year. Those decisions affect the quality of our lives, the health of
our biosphere, and the welfare of future generations.

The mission that brings the Metagovernment group together is to find/create
better tools and systems through which to make those decisions.


   - We wish the decisions to be of the highest quality.
   - We wish to have the option of being directly involved in making them.
   - We wish to use technology to work on issues together when it is
   convenient for us.
   - We wish to explore new ways of organizing society.


Visions
Metagovernment is uniquely neutral ground. Most other groups, tool makers,
projects, companies and organizations are more-or-less locked into
particular visions. We are not: we enjoy an abundance of visions. There are
almost as many different visions represented in the group as there are
individuals in the group. (That often makes for very lively discussions
...)

Issues
In addition to directly discussing software, individuals of the group also
frequently discuss fundamental &quot;metagovernment&quot; issues that are ultimately
deeply relevant to software specification and design. A few such issues
have been settled (at least for now). Numerous other such issues have not
yet been settled.

Settled Issues
Here is a short list of settled issues:

*Empirical Approach*

We share a common understanding that empirical questions need empirical
answers.

For example, the question &quot;Does majority rule produce 'better' outcomes
than super-majority rule?&quot; is an empirical question. As such, the question
cannot be answered simply through discussion, nor can it be answered by
polling the relative popularity of the two concepts prior to actually
measuring and comparing the results produced by using the two rules.

We frequently experiment with new ways to make group-matter decisions.

Designs and discussions are empirically driven rather than (for example)
ideologically driven.


*Radical Transparency*

We are all agreed that all aspects of public-matter decision making should
be as open as possible. In particular, all software should be free and open
source, and all systems data should be freely available online. [*Are we
all agreed on that? To my knowledge, it has never been proposed ...* ]


Unsettled Issues
There are many more unsettled issues than there are settled issues. This
list is just a sampling:


   - Power Over Others: Concentrated or Distributed?
   - What Metrics Measure Power Distribution?
   - Democracy: Direct or Representative?
   - What Metrics Measure Degree of Democracy?
   - Decision Matters: Personal, Private, Public?
   - What criteria distinguish among decision matters?
   - Decision Methods: Count Votes or Resolve Objections?
   - What Metrics Measure Public-Matter Decision Quality?
   - Harnessing Creativity: Prizes or Profits?
   - What Metrics Measure Harnessed Creativity?
   - Strategies for Change: Work Within or Render Obsolete?
   - What Metrics Measure Change-Strategy Success?
   - Jurisdictions: Nested or Global Only?
   - Property Ownership: Private or Public?
   - Workforce Organization: Partnerships or Employers/Employees?
   - Organization of Work: Vested Hierarchies or Contracted Projects?


Finding/creating full solutions requires being open to considering all
potentially relevant factors and perspectives. We try to live that here.

Proposal 3:

Revert to the original that got deleted.  Note that this is an action
rather than a text though the text is implied.

I think proposal 3 can be seen as the &quot;none of the above Michael asked for
(is it?). And in which case I would suggest to go forward with a voting
among those 4 proposals.

Now, it is important to vote in  a way that similar proposals are not
disadvantaged.
So I would suggest that we vote using Majority Voting. This means each of
us will rate each proposal with a value:
terrible, bad, ok, good, great.

And then we assign to each proposal the mediane of the votes. And we
compare those medianes. The good thing about this way of voting is that it
is quite strong against strategic voting.

What do you think?

(Michael, can we consider proposal 3 as the &quot;none of the above&quot; proposal?
Is that ok for you?)


Something else, I would appreciate if I could get some feedback from all
the people that used Vilfredo. Especially the ones that used it for the
first time, or that have not used it in some time, so found it changed.
This could be done here, but to be really useful the best would be to have
a short skype interview with each of you. Is that possible? My skype name
is &quot;pietrosperoni&quot;.

Thanks,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in this experiment you have been a key player nearly generation except
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 1 you were a key player for proposal 2651;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 2 you were a key player for proposal 2678 and 2679;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 3 there were no key players;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 4 you were a key player for proposal 2677 and 2710;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 5 you are a key player for proposal 2739 and 2741.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each time Vilfredo sent you an email asking you to rewrite the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which you were a keyplayer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 2, you did not write anything (despite being invited to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rewrite 2651).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 3, you rewrote proposal 2656 (which you already liked) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignored Vilfredo request to rewrite instead proposal 2678 and/or 2679
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 4 you had no requests, changed a proposal and represented
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal 2650 (which was in any case present in the Pareto Front).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On generation 5 you again presented another copy of 2650, while ignoring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the request from Vilfredo to rewrite proposal 2677 and/or 2710.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Honestly, not one time did you accept Vilfredo suggestion on what to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rewrite to bring the community nearer to an agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And now you tell us:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Pietro said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; This time Ned and Michael are key players. And should probably write
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; their own version of the proposal they did not like trying to use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; the information from the comments.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Ned doesn't actually agree with his own proposals, as he explained.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; He has a much longer text in mind.  It won't help if *I* re-write his
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; proposals; he himself must do that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ned, like all of us, votes also for proposals that are not perfect for
</I>&gt;<i> him.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In generation 1 he voted for all proposals except for 1. IN generation 2
</I>&gt;<i> he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voted for all proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After he only voted for 2 proposals, but he also explained that that was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because he thought in this way he was making the Pareto Front smaller (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clarified with him that this is not how the Pareto Front works
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006865.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-June/006865.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am sure if you try to follow Vilfredo invitation, he will consider your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal without discarding it, a priori. But you need to do your part.
</I>&gt;<i> Not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just repeating what you think is the best, or walk away.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Vilfredo does not always reach a consensus. Sometimes (in fact most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; of the time), it just reaches a very clear, unsolvable, polarity. Or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; a three poles polarity (does that have a specific name?).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I prefer a text we can all agree to, even if it's short to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; You and Ned prefer a long text to begin with (300 words minimum), even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; if it divides us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I was not serious when I spoke about the 300 words, as I was not serious
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when, in the same phrase, I spoke about closing you and Ed in a room
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together. What I said, and I kept repeating, is that you cannot use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo to develop different parts of a question in parallel.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That is Votorola approach, I gather. And generally the wiki approach.
</I>&gt;<i> This
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not work in this way, which is why I shoot them down. Because once
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reach a consensus the question ends and I don't want to reach a Game Over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with a partial answer (imprecise yes, partial no).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The remaining 5 or 6 Vilfredo users seem caught in between, proposing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; medium-short texts of 4-10 sentences.  If I withdraw temporarily from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Vilfredo and stop making objections, then maybe they'll re-focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; long texts as you and Ned wish.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You can withdraw, or you can give it a try to actually follow what
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; suggests you, and really see how this software works. In the past several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; questions reached a consensus once someone rewrote what Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> suggested
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; If we do not reach a consensus on the next proposal I will suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; to just pick whatever are the proposal in the Pareto front and Vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; with Majority Judgment on them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Please don't quit on my account.  After all, it's only an experiment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Allow it to run its course.  I'll withdraw temporarily to watch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For me it has run its course:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reaching a consensus among less people is less valid that recognising a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; polarity in the group. But it would be even better if we could try to
</I>&gt;<i> reach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a consensus. But for that you need to stop reproposing the same proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and accept to rewrite proposal you do not like, adapting them to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; acceptable for you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This generation Vilfredo invited you to rewrite proposals 2739 and 2741.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Why not giving it a try?
