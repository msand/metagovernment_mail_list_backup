<PRE>It looks like we already have a consensus on an abstract plan.  It's
not a complete plan, of course, but neither is it empty.  Crucially we
can't think of a single reason why anyone would have to reject it:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom</A>

Ned and Pietro think the Vilfredo effort will finish soon and give us
some concrete content.  The only other content we'd need is resource
links, title and such.  We can work on those now (normally we would,
but home pages can get boring after a while) or wait till later.
We've already contributed something useful and permanent without too
much effort.  So it seems to me, anyway.

Meanwhile Alex suggests that the terminology in the plan might be
improved, so I've created an editorial group to work on that.  Is this
worded correctly, Alex?  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1140-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1140-ZeleaCom</A>
You can edit that group draft directly if you like.  (Normally you'd
work instead from your own personal draft - 'My draft' link.  But it's
only a prototype, so expect to get stuck if you do.  I'd help.)

Alexander Praetorius said:
&gt;<i> I thought again.
</I>&gt;<i> I oppose the draft as is and make an alternative proposal instead...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *PROPOSAL:*
</I>&gt;<i> If i think of the Front Page or about Metagovernment as &quot;One Node in a
</I>&gt;<i> Network&quot;, then those Sections make sense.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Framing&quot; is the way of PRESENTATION (includes themes, styling, layout, ...
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Body&quot; is the CONTENT of the Node in the Network
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Linkage&quot; is about all the CONNECTIONS the Node makes to any others in the
</I>&gt;<i> Network
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Administration&quot; is about the collaborative GOVERNANCE, thus how the
</I>&gt;<i> CONTENT, PRESENTATION and CONNECTIONS of that node we are talking about can
</I>&gt;<i> be changed by people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So i would stay with those 4, but i would rename them to:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Presentation, Content, Connections, Governance&quot;
</I>
