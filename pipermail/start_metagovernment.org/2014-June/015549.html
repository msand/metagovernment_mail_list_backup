<PRE>Curious.  These should have been important people for me also.  I hear
Xanadu was just released and think this is a potential discussion software
element.

&gt;<i> Mike, I'm reasonably familiar with the arguments over counting methods.

</I>&gt;<i> and tabulation system, but how to build a system that bakes in tendencies
</I>&gt;<i> toward productive rational discourse. That's why I've been putting more
</I>&gt;<i> attention into branding and channeling. Condorcet, Borda, Arrow and the
</I>&gt;<i> rest are important intellectual guides for me, but the most enlightening
</I>&gt;<i> ones are Marshall McLuhan, Doug Engelbart, and Ted Nelson.

</I>&gt;<i> Craig Simon said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Nothing is up at sygnol.com (or its planned sister sites) just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yet. I'm early in the development process, building a body of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; explanatory content for potential partners.  I'm putting minimal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; energy into maintaining the older sites, other than converting the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; datasets and using what's there for the occasional demo and video
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I might offer to help, Craig, if it were pitched more to the electors
</I>&gt;<i> and candidates.  I bet that's the only approach that has legs for the
</I>&gt;<i> long haul, and I'd like to make a career of it.  Parties etc. have
</I>&gt;<i> money, but surely there are other sources?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The big gamble for Sygnol is to attract an audience. If just a small
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but measurable percentage of voters check it out prior to an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; election, candidates are likely to be attentive to it...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely!  Everyone will be attentive.  It'll be big news.  I'd sure
</I>&gt;<i> like to be part of it when it takes off.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...especially during a fractured multicandidate election in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relatively small state where 100 vote margins could be make or break
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for a candidate's viability going into the next primary or caucus.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't said much yet about my approach for convening useful
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; candidate/voter discussions, but I'm certainly not ignorant of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; natural fears and antagonisms in that space For now I'll cite
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Politics 101... Politics is managed competition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think electors and candidates are naturally on the same side, and
</I>&gt;<i> both against the party machines.  I bet the candidates would love to
</I>&gt;<i> become independent, if only they could.  Straw polls (when designed
</I>&gt;<i> properly) would give them that independence.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it requires discussion facilities.  There's enough out
</I>&gt;<i> there already, and no need for tight integration.  A voting service is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much all that's needed.  It can be deployed stand-alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The earlier projects allowed for resubmission of ranks until the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; official close of voting, and the planned systems will as well. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; presume that's what you mean by continuous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, changeable ballots.  But then there's probably no need for
</I>&gt;<i> ranked choice or other complicated methods.  A changeable ballot
</I>&gt;<i> basically means a continuous runoff.  The best method is arguably the
</I>&gt;<i> simplest: plurality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggested that in the thread below.  It's a list of voting reform
</I>&gt;<i> lobbyists, though, so naturally they're unreceptive to the idea.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I CC you to punch a hole in my spam filter, Craig.  If you're moveable
</I>&gt;<i> on where the funding comes from, please ping me.  I'd love to talk
</I>&gt;<i> about the design aspects.
