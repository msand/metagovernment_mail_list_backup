<PRE>The earlier&#160;projects allowed for resubmission of ranks until the official close of voting, and the planned systems will as well. I presume that's&#160;what you mean by continuous.&#160;

Nothing is up at sygnol.com (or its planned sister sites) just yet. I'm early in the development process, building a body of explanatory content for potential partners.&#160;&#160;I'm putting minimal energy into maintaining the older sites, other than converting the datasets and using&#160;what's&#160;there&#160;for the occasional demo and video project.

The big gamble for Sygnol is to attract an audience. If just&#160;a small but measurable percentage of voters check it out prior to an election, candidates are likely to&#160;be attentive to it... especially during a fractured multicandidate election in a relatively small state where 100 vote margins&#160;could be&#160;make or break for a candidate's viability going into the next primary or caucus.&#160; I haven't said much yet about my&#160;approach for convening useful candidate/voter discussions, but I'm certainly not ignorant of the natural fears and antagonisms in that space&#160; For now I'll cite Politics 101... Politics is managed competition.

Thanks for sharing, Craig.

Straw polling is the crucial facility, I agree.&#160; Are your polls
continuous, with shiftable votes?

I doubt Sygnol's design can work for *both* campaign managers and
voters as the video implies.&#160; They're almost perfect antagonists in
the election; what's good for one is bad for the other.

Is there a home URL for Sygnol?&#160; Is Sygnol the successor to We-Vote?

&gt;<i> Hello folks,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the process of refactoring and re-branding&#160;the ranked choice straw poll application that I've been operating under the aegis of the Indaba Application Network. I value the conversations that I've been monitoring here on the Metagovernment list, and I presume&#160;some of you&#160;might be interested in what I'm doing now.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My goal is to use the analytic portion of the system for straight up political polling in places like Iowa and New Hampshire (where the US presidential primary season begins) and to&#160;pursue other revenue-building ideas. All of this aims at helping fund creation of a full-fledged liquid democracy platform that includes a fairly robust proxy-voting mechanism. That part's not available for demonstration yet, but I'm stepping up my efforts to explain the ranked choice tabulation portion, while&#160;simultaneously working on revamping&#160;the data schema and creating a new API.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've created a video channel called Sygnol&#160;to introduce aspects of the project. The first video is at
