Ha!  It's true, Ed and I turn out to be polar opposites on this issue.
Suppose we aim for a temporary truce on a very short text - just one
sentence for our first attempt - that states the bare fact of what
Metagov is.  Example:

   Metagovernment is [a few words here].

Here I don't care about the wording, only the truth of it.  If we
reach consensus on that (should be relatively easy) and aren't too
hungry yet, then we might try adding another sentence or two before we
put it to a vote in the list.  In any case, it would be only a
temporary home page for the purpose of salvaging our dignity; I mean,
at least we'd have agreed to *something*.  Then we could all have
breakfast and relax for a while (maybe take a holiday) before
revisiting the issue.

Would this be a good approach?

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> leaving the louder voices to decide for everybody.
