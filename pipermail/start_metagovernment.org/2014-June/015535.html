Good question.
Completely finished no.

But right now the PHP version is very badly constructed from a code point
of view. Probably unsecure also. SO I don't think it makes sense to invest
on that.

The Python version, on the other side is not yet working. So at least we
need to reach a stable python version.

Also I must make a plan of the future release. Right now it is starting to
become clear the various elements we want to introduce, and how each build
on the previous.

There is also another element. Although in the past Vilfredo was at times
used, right now nearly no one uses it. As such it is the perfect moment to
bring the code on. I am scared of making some code, making it usable, have
people using it, and then just take their toy away, as we move to the next
version.

Giovani Spagnolo ( a member of this community, who has followed Vilfredo
for a long time, as it was developed while working with him) suggested that
I use Jira agile technology to map the future development. And then once
this map is completed start to consider what should be the release, and if
it is the case to invest in some of those.

All this suggests the need for an entrepreneurial spirit which is very
different from mine, but which is probably needed at this point if we want
to move Vilfredo from an &quot;interesting&quot; tool to a product groups of people
around the world can use.

At this point suggestions from people who successfully managed to make this
step are welcome  :-).

Cheers,
Pietro
