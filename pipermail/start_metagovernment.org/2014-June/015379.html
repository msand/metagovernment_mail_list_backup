</I>A generation has two phases: propose, and vote. (You can make multiple 
proposals, as I have done.)

I set the phase timer to at least 1 day, at most 2 days for each phase. 
Tomorrow the timer for phase=1 of generation=1 will reach 1 day, and I 
will manually trigger the move to phase=2 of generation=1. (If I don't 
trigger the move manually, it will happen automatically at the end of 2 
days.)

At the point that we have moved to phase=2, you should receive a 
notification email (if you are subscribed to the question), and then you 
can follow the link in the email to the page, where you will see all of 
the proposals and can vote on them.

The idea is that you vote for all of the proposals that you find 
acceptable to appear on the Home Page. I suggest that we start with 
individual-sentence proposals, and then as we see which sentences are 
acceptable to everyone, we clump those individual bits into larger bits 
(paragraphs, sections), until we arrive at a single proposal that 
contains all of the acceptable bits.

The voting for Generation=1 will remain open for at least 1 day, at most 
2 days, and then Generation=2 will begin with its phase=1: another 
opportunity to propose.

(I am trusting that Pietro will correct any errors in the above ...)
