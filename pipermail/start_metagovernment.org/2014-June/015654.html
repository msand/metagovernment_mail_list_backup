I have been thinking about a text only internet.

&gt;<i> I'm watching old propaganda films from WWII.  Here's one that fits
</I>&gt;<i> Max's volunteer story.  It also ends with Lincoln's &quot;by the people,
</I>&gt;<i> for the people&quot;.  It's part of a deliberate effort at myth making .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://www.nfb.ca/film/call_for_volunteers">http://www.nfb.ca/film/call_for_volunteers</A>  (1941)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've watched about 100 of these wartime films.  I wasn't too surprised
</I>&gt;<i> at first to notice a socialist tilt; Canada and other countries were
</I>&gt;<i> being pulled to the left by a combination of the depression and the
</I>&gt;<i> war effort, as I knew.  But I soon noticed more than just a tilt here,
</I>&gt;<i> and I couldn't explain it.  These films from the 1940s were painting a
</I>&gt;<i> picture of a society more caring than the one I grew up with in the
</I>&gt;<i> 1970s.  I felt recharged watching them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Later I learned about the film pioneer who ran the propaganda effort
</I>&gt;<i> during the war, a Scotsman by the name of John Grierson.  Once you get
</I>&gt;<i> past the hammed-up intro by Lorne Greene, this is a fascinating film:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://www.nfb.ca/film/grierson">https://www.nfb.ca/film/grierson</A>  (1973)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I figured Grierson must be part of the answer.  But only yesterday
</I>&gt;<i> did I realize he's the *whole* answer.  I was re-watching some of the
</I>&gt;<i> wartime films and thinking about myth making, when it dawned on me:
</I>&gt;<i> this Scotsman created the myth of Canada that I live by today, and he
</I>&gt;<i> did it deliberately.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="https://www.nfb.ca/film/shameless_propaganda">https://www.nfb.ca/film/shameless_propaganda</A>  (2013)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just found the film above, which confirms the theory.  But it was a
</I>&gt;<i> wonderful experience discovering it on my own.  I watched over 1,000
</I>&gt;<i> NFB films from 1939 to 2010.  Only slowly did the message of a caring
</I>&gt;<i> society fade from the picture (I now recall), to be replaced by that
</I>&gt;<i> of the critical film maker, objective and alienated.  The message was
</I>&gt;<i> still there on the day I was born, when this film was shot:

</I>&gt;<i> (You should be able to stream these films for free.  Please let me
</I>&gt;<i> know if they charge you money, or anything.)

</I>&gt;<i> max stalnaker said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think I noticed Mike citing to not rational structures and I appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.  One of my threads is the jung Erickson cambell bateson etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sequence.  And somehow I spent the day looking at stories and meanings
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about non creed creeds and some unfamiliar Abrahamic stories.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; looking for consensus stories.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I observe these stories to be powerful and compelling.  Notice that Scott
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gets edgy here I expect.  After all we find a non creed statement by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anticreed types tends to go creed after you put enough blood and treasure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and tears into it.  So if it is a non creed moral statement that people
</I>&gt;<i> die
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to defend then it ends up looking like a religious moral creed even if
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; idea of a creed is against the non creed and most of the adherents moral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code.  Nothing is easy for the mechanical social engineer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But it brings to mind a possible decision process.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here it might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My neighbor has a lot of weeds in his front yard.  I do not like that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What should i do?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now we crowd source stories about what to do.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My neighbor was that way.  She was a frail 75 year old female widow.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; offered to take care of the lawn for her and she was glad for the offer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The lawn bother her also. I paid my kid to do it as if he was a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contractor.  The kid got some business experience and the lawn looked
</I>&gt;<i> great
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; within 6 weeks.  The woman was very greatful.  That winter she passed.
</I>&gt;<i>  The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; house sold quickly and the nice front yard I am sure helped.  The new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; owners are a nice couple with a daughter my son's age.  My boy is
</I>&gt;<i> thinking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about offering his services around the neighborhood.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And many more stories.  Some involved bank ownership.  Meth houses.
</I>&gt;<i> Rentals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that were not fit for human habitation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So we do some ranking.  Some  pattern matching.  When the question is
</I>&gt;<i> asked
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; live then up comes a response and maybe a community interested in
</I>&gt;<i> helping.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Dear abby design pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we need to go to public policy issues we might try running the stories
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; through a reification process and mashing them so that we have in fact
</I>&gt;<i> code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that represents the crowd wisdom which then generates a statute.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rework the generated text.
