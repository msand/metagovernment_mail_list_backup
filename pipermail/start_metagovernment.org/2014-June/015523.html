<PRE>Dear Mike
No one want to enforce the use of Airesis, is just part of the mission of
metagovernment, (but if you believe you have the best than we should
rewrite the mission). Vilfredo is doing a good job here, so far, i believe.
But I also believe that for building a home page is not the best tool,
please read me well, I say for that specific tasks.

About Airesis:
Is a place where you find diverse tool in order to be flexible and create
social bonding around ideas. The calendar and the forum where requested by
the community but &quot;our&quot; main tool is to build collaboratively a proposal by
mean of a set of rules ( each group can set their ones, in the
metagovernment group are perfectly horizontal) and the interpretation of
one or more relater.

While in vilfredo you have to work on one single proposal all the time end
every time you  give approval to the whole, in Airesis you can work
on paragraphs and/or a multiple solution and have voting range on multiple
solution. Is designed for larger groups and managed and interpreted
proposals This is a strength and can be a weakness depending on the
relater/s, personally my interest is to have a test performed by the
largest number of active member of the metagovernment group while selecting
the best copywriter to be the relater. The better the group collaborate the
list amount of solutions will be the outcome, in the best scenario one
single text should be the outcome, and if so the final vote too. In case we
have multiple solution Schulze voting should give the most widely accepted
home page. So please forghet about the living space and just evaluate the
proposal tool
Kind Regards
Jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like very much, is completed, to start a new proposal in Airesis and
</I>&gt;<i> test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; properly the platform.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With Real Participation!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do believe that for building the text of a home page, the Airesis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform may actually works better. I will be not starting it because my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; english is not good enough and I am not the most indicated person to do
</I>&gt;<i> it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I think that everyone will be impressed by the flexibility of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system. I will participate with my creativity...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS as it may result in the proposal of different texts for each potential
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; page that may be proposed in that case, will be selected automatically
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Schulze method.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we can work at a single text collaboratively than will be only use the
