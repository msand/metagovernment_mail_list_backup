<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Would anyone be interested in working with me on a quick prototyping
system.  It seems like we tend to debate if a set of features would work
when an experiment would settle the debate quickly and accurately. It would
allow a semi technical person to create new features and systems through
tools and scripting. I find it would be nice even as a developer to have a
place where I can quickly try a new feature or set of features.

If you know of a system like this already please let me know.

I imagine it would start out with a few basic features that could be built
upon

   - Registration and identity
   - Ability to add new objects with standard input fields (text boxes and
   buttons)
   - Ability to script object functionality
   - A storage system for these objects (database)
   - History of all changes
   - Change are propagated to other users that are on the system at the
   same time
   - Email notifications
   - All data and scripting would be downloadable.
