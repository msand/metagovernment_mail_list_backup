<PRE>I love the quality and quantity of discussion on this list now, but&#8230; there are two big issues I have currently.

1. The flood of emails. They&#8217;re great, but extremely difficult to follow unless I have an hour a day to commit (which unfortunately I do not). I also put forth that many others likewise do not have that time, and so we see a core community in the discussion and lurkers rarely dipping their toes into the water. I had suggested a solution for this a while ago: that some people volunteer to keep a running summary of important topics:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006386.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006386.html</A>

Makes a lot of sense now, doesn&#8217;t it? At the very least, could someone (or several people?) try to add some color to the Proposals page? It doesn&#8217;t have to be just a list of proposals with no depth. It could list what the current status of the debate is. Perhaps each proposal could have some bullet points added with dates. For example:
* June 18, 2014 - Pietro pointed out that X.
Can anyone help with that, for the sake of the less-time-endowed?

2. The flood of Vilfredo timing. It sounds sensible to have a 1-2 day turn on the Vilfredo proposal in order to cycle quickly toward a consensus. But this is not good decision-making practice. A 10-day turn sounds much more reasonable. It may sound agonizingly long to some, but it allows for rich conversation while simultaneously allowing for more constrained schedules. A lot of people go on vacation/holiday for one, two, or more weeks. Ten days is actually a quick turn considering that. 1-2 days is ridiculous. It disenfranchises all but the most dedicated (of eleven participants, only six people voted in round 3). I am one of them: I am voting in this, but I am not following the discussion, so my votes are ill-informed.
