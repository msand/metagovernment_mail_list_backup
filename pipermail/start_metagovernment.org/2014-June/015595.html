<PRE>Dear Ed
I have exactly the same problem... it seem to me that there is too much
noise and the flood of email became a reason to hate the idea to open the
mail program.

I suggest to have one hangout meeting with all the participating member of
the group and use for ones the old proven method to talk....

If we cannot I will still try to follow the vilfredo proposal and the
votorola but to follow all this English multiple threads is becoming hard
and I may give a sloppy participation.

&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> I also am loving how the list has recently come back to life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And we should remember that those discussion software (mailing lists,
</I>&gt;<i> discussion groups, I am not sure about wiki), tend to self manage respect
</I>&gt;<i> to the size. When too many people are using a channel it makes it easier
</I>&gt;<i> for everybody to hear, and as a result some people walk out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This could probably be a good reason why we could move to a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> group. Where at least when some people want to discuss something, they can
</I>&gt;<i> open another space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can for sure mirror my explanations and the questions I receive about
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo in the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo does not have a good tutorial in English (we have it in Italian),
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> In fact I think I should even go back in the list, and recover my past
</I>&gt;<i> explanations from this month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Speaking about Vilfredo Timing,*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to admit I am really impressed how Ned is managing the question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My philosophy of 1 week per phase is absolutely unable to keep so many
</I>&gt;<i> people participating. I usually had to send several emails to some people
</I>&gt;<i> asking them to participate. What I have observed is that people tend to
</I>&gt;<i> participate *en mass* on the first day. There are some, but very very
</I>&gt;<i> few, that participate in the next days. On the other side, when you wait
</I>&gt;<i> for them, you pay a huge price from a social point of view: people tend to
</I>&gt;<i> forget. And as a result the participation drops.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is basically better (I found) to have a faster turnaround, with some
</I>&gt;<i> people that miss a turn and regret it, then to wait for everybody and bore
</I>&gt;<i> the people who are actually not missing a turn, and participating actively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And part of the problem is also that Vilfredo is trying to really plug
</I>&gt;<i> each other brain together into a superbrain. And this simply cannot be done
</I>&gt;<i> if some people are really eager to participate, and want to do it fast,
</I>&gt;<i> while others prefer or can only do a very slow speed participation.  Either
</I>&gt;<i> you warm up some or cool down the others. It's like playing chess online.
</I>&gt;<i> You need to find a speed that fits all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If some people are on vacation, then it is probably not the right time to
</I>&gt;<i> ask a Vilfredo question. Or we must have a much better mobile version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I wonder if we could design a system where it is not the person who
</I>&gt;<i> started the question that moves it on. But the community itself.* So it
</I>&gt;<i> could cool down at times, and speed up at others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example we could start by letting people say how they feel respect to
</I>&gt;<i> moving on.
</I>&gt;<i> For example you could chose between:
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] wait for me
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] do not wait for me
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] I voted but I can wait
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] I voted but I want to see how others vote and maybe change my vote
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] ok you can move on
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] wait for ...
</I>&gt;<i> [ ] MOVE ON. It has been ages now!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would not move on the question automatically. But it would give some
</I>&gt;<i> good information to Ned or whoever is asking the question. And to move from
</I>&gt;<i> this to an AI that moves the question on should not be that hard :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each person could start a question by signing up to it and say if they are
</I>&gt;<i> aiming to participate at every turn (wait for me), or they will just be
</I>&gt;<i> participate if they can (do not wait for me). And maybe give their favorite
</I>&gt;<i> speed. Then the system could take the mediane of the speed, and use that as
</I>&gt;<i> a first guideline.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll add it to the list of things that should be considered on Trello.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I love the quality and quantity of discussion on this list now, but&#8230;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are two big issues I have currently.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *1. The flood of emails*. They&#8217;re great, but extremely difficult to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> follow unless I have an hour a day to commit (which unfortunately I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not). I also put forth that many others likewise do not have that time, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so we see a core community in the discussion and lurkers rarely dipping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their toes into the water. I had suggested a solution for this a while ago:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that some people volunteer to keep a running summary of important topics:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Makes a lot of sense now, doesn&#8217;t it? At the very least, could someone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or several people?) try to add some color to the Proposals page? It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doesn&#8217;t have to be just a list of proposals with no depth. It could list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the current status of the debate is. Perhaps each proposal could have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some bullet points added with dates. For example:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * June 18, 2014 - Pietro pointed out that X.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can anyone help with that, for the sake of the less-time-endowed?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *2. The flood of Vilfredo timing*. It sounds sensible to have a 1-2 day
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> turn on the Vilfredo proposal in order to cycle quickly toward a consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But this is not good decision-making practice. A 10-day turn sounds much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more reasonable. It may sound agonizingly long to some, but it allows for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rich conversation while simultaneously allowing for more constrained
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> schedules. A lot of people go on vacation/holiday for one, two, or more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weeks. Ten days is actually a quick turn considering that. 1-2 days is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ridiculous. It disenfranchises all but the most dedicated (of eleven
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants, only six people voted in round 3). I am one of them: I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting in this, but I am not following the discussion, so my votes are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ill-informed.
