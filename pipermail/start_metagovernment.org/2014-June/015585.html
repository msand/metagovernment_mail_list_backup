<PRE>Hi Ed,
I also am loving how the list has recently come back to life.

And we should remember that those discussion software (mailing lists,
discussion groups, I am not sure about wiki), tend to self manage respect
to the size. When too many people are using a channel it makes it easier
for everybody to hear, and as a result some people walk out.

This could probably be a good reason why we could move to a discussion
group. Where at least when some people want to discuss something, they can
open another space.

I can for sure mirror my explanations and the questions I receive about
Vilfredo in the wiki.
Vilfredo does not have a good tutorial in English (we have it in Italian),
so
In fact I think I should even go back in the list, and recover my past
explanations from this month.

*Speaking about Vilfredo Timing,*

I have to admit I am really impressed how Ned is managing the question.

My philosophy of 1 week per phase is absolutely unable to keep so many
people participating. I usually had to send several emails to some people
asking them to participate. What I have observed is that people tend to
participate *en mass* on the first day. There are some, but very very few,
that participate in the next days. On the other side, when you wait for
them, you pay a huge price from a social point of view: people tend to
forget. And as a result the participation drops.

It is basically better (I found) to have a faster turnaround, with some
people that miss a turn and regret it, then to wait for everybody and bore
the people who are actually not missing a turn, and participating actively.

And part of the problem is also that Vilfredo is trying to really plug each
other brain together into a superbrain. And this simply cannot be done if
some people are really eager to participate, and want to do it fast, while
others prefer or can only do a very slow speed participation.  Either you
warm up some or cool down the others. It's like playing chess online. You
need to find a speed that fits all.

If some people are on vacation, then it is probably not the right time to
ask a Vilfredo question. Or we must have a much better mobile version.

*I wonder if we could design a system where it is not the person who
started the question that moves it on. But the community itself.* So it
could cool down at times, and speed up at others.

For example we could start by letting people say how they feel respect to
moving on.
For example you could chose between:
[ ] wait for me
[ ] do not wait for me
[ ] I voted but I can wait
[ ] I voted but I want to see how others vote and maybe change my vote
[ ] ok you can move on
[ ] wait for ...
[ ] MOVE ON. It has been ages now!

This would not move on the question automatically. But it would give some
good information to Ned or whoever is asking the question. And to move from
this to an AI that moves the question on should not be that hard :-).

Each person could start a question by signing up to it and say if they are
aiming to participate at every turn (wait for me), or they will just be
participate if they can (do not wait for me). And maybe give their favorite
speed. Then the system could take the mediane of the speed, and use that as
a first guideline.

I'll add it to the list of things that should be considered on Trello.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Makes a lot of sense now, doesn&#8217;t it? At the very least, could someone (or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * June 18, 2014 - Pietro pointed out that X.

</I>&gt;<i> Can anyone help with that, for the sake of the less-time-endowed?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2. The flood of Vilfredo timing*. It sounds sensible to have a 1-2 day
</I>&gt;<i> turn on the Vilfredo proposal in order to cycle quickly toward a consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is not good decision-making practice. A 10-day turn sounds much

</I>&gt;<i> weeks. Ten days is actually a quick turn considering that. 1-2 days is
</I>&gt;<i> ridiculous. It disenfranchises all but the most dedicated (of eleven
</I>&gt;<i> participants, only six people voted in round 3). I am one of them: I am
