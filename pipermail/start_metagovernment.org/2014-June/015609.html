<PRE>Hi Michael,

I welcome a critique on the diagram, but hadn't included it for that
purpose.
<A HREF="http://democracylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ProcessDiag_Behavior_0.png">http://democracylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ProcessDiag_Behavior_0.png</A>
I thought rather that it might provide a useful framing to help
differentiate the purpose and capabilities of the various tools being used
or proposed for use on the list.

Like Metagovernment, DemocracyLab is in the midst of reworking its home
page, and an interactive version of the diagram will be the central
storytelling feature.  The basic message is that civic tech applications
are those that address at least one phase of the problem lifecycle
described.  Visitors will then self-identify into one of three roles -
developer, participant or supporter, and click through to a page presenting
information on civic tech applications tailored to their perspective.  The
goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem, where collaboration among
developers is facilitated, civic tech users can find applications
addressing issues that are important to them, and potential funders can
easily research and perform due diligence on projects of interest.  As some
of you may remember, DemocracyLab is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
based in the U.S. (Seattle, more precisely).  Like many of you, this isn't
my full-time job, so progress is slower than I would like, but I'll keep
the group informed as we move forward.

Concerning my critique of this discussion and process, I'm in the same boat
as many in that I'm not able to effectively keep up with all facets of the
discussion.  I was initially a bit taken aback by blanking the homepage,
but in hindsight it appears to have been a good decision because it has
spurred the group into more meaningful discussion than at any point in my
memory.  I suppose what feedback I have is that the &quot;deliberation&quot; about
what should go on the home page, and the &quot;decision&quot; to approve it might be
thought of as distinct steps.  Collaborative writing tools might be
effective for deliberation, while an app designed to make it easy to decide
among well-drafted discrete choices could work for decision. I think a
small number of group members are going to be able to participate fully in
the writing and deliberation, but that a much larger group would be willing
to participate in a decision process that was well defined and relatively
easy.  Having more group members participate in a final decision will add
legitimacy to the outcome and cause more members feel invested in the
organization going forward.

Warm regards,
Mark-

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this diagram may provide an interesting anchor for discussion:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It identifies the stages in the lifecycle of a problem.  The tools that
</I>&gt;<i> are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed at each stage are quite different.  It may be helpful for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; developers of the various tools being proposed for use to think about

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together we consider a sequencing of usage that would allow us to
