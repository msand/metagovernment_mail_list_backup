I've read the book and will address my criticisms (of which there are
many) directly to the author.  Except for this one: It still amazes me
that people like Piketty and Boik, who are proposing radical changes
to our economic systems, are so incredibly timid about talking about
the elephant in the room: Inheritance.  According to Piketty's data,
50% of *all* capital in Europe is being passed to people who have no
inherent right to it.  It's fundamentally unfair, and IMHO immoral, to
allow this archaic practice to continue.  It's the
slavery/feudalism/women's suffrage issue of this century and a couple
of hundred years from now people will look back and wonder how we
could possibly be so blind that we don't see this.

As for how the book relates to this list, he does refer to the
Metagovernment Project, and his &quot;Collaborative Governance System&quot;
(read Chapter 9) bears some resemblance to Vilfredo (to the extent I
understand either system, anyway ;-)  He calls it &quot;crowdsolving&quot; and
although I'm as big a fan of the emergent properties of collective
action as anyone, I think this experiment with rewriting the
Metagovernment Home Page using Vilfredo has shown us that you can't
just throw the ideas of dozens (let alone millions) of people into a
system that's the social-engineering equivalent of a blender and
expect to get anything elegant out of it.  The math part of Vilfredo I
think can be usefully applied when building a tool that will help
crowds evaluate multiple competing proposals, but I still retain my
belief that the proposals themselves will be written and modified by
people with some particular talent or training in this domain.
  Regards,
     Scott
