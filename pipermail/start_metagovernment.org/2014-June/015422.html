<PRE>Hi Michael, in those years we have tried several strategies to try to
promote Vilfredo. And for most of it it was quite transparent and possible
to even write and vote without being registered (Vilfredo would then record
it as an Anonymous vote). Now we closed that off, as there were several
problems and it was quite common that people would write a long answer just
to see it deleted because they forgot to login. So we wanted an easy way to
make sure that would not happen. At least while we wrote Vilfredo2.0

But regardless of this, there is a deeper lesson we got. We do NOT want
random people coming and voting. Vilfredo is not a poll system. It is a
recurrent process where the same people go through a process to find a
consensus between them. Which is not directly representative of what
happens outside. While it is very rare but possible that a person might
just stumble upon a question and participate to the end, it is much more
common that someone that no one knows who is, votes in a random way, and
changes the Pareto Front slowing down the process for everybody.

So the next Vilfredo will not be organised in rooms, but in a more
traditional way. And it will be possible to set up questions where only
some people are allowed to vote or to propose, or to do both.

But we are thinking of ways to make an automatic animation out of a
question. So everybody can get up to speed on what has happened. And this
could also be used to promote it.
