<PRE>Scott,

I had not seen livecode yet. It looks great. I was looking for something a
little more casual. I was thinking of an online web based system so it does
not need to be downloaded for development, deployed or an app installed for
people to play with it. I left the post open to see what other suggestions
would come up and I learned something new. There are lots of tools to use
and I have used many. I do full stack web and desktop development but it
still takes an hour to put up a website to show a simple CRUD form and then
the other person needs to have my skills and source to modify it. That is a
lot of coordination for quick functional thoughts. A hosted web version of
livecode would be great. Are you aware of any prototyping tools or systems
with this features set that does not require downloading or deloyment?

Regards,
Bentley
