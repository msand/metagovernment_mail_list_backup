</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as we move from platform, we need a consistent way for the casual

</I>&gt;<i> more than one platform at any time.

</I>&gt;<i> Seems like you&#8217;re making a bit of an assumption here Ed. I&#8217;d like to hear
</I>&gt;<i> from Alex what his point was&#8230;.'specifically'.

</I>&gt;<i> I seek not to lock us into one platform
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except maybe e-mail and the wiki?  I&#8217;m merely suggesting that we try out

</I>&gt;<i> e-mails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (which is not even a participant in our group),

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it really matter whether *they* are a participant in *our* group.
</I>&gt;<i> Their group is open to everyone&#8230;.as is ours. We are all in this together.
</I>&gt;<i> Lot&#8217;s of room for cross pollination I would say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but to experiment, try out different platforms, explore flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio has a great-looking interface, but it is rigid and inflexible in
</I>&gt;<i> some of its underpinnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe they would wholeheartedly agree with you. They are just getting
</I>&gt;<i> started&#8230;.you of all people should know these things take time. If there is
</I>&gt;<i> any inflexibility on this issue, I would say it has found a very
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable home on this list.    ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other platforms have strengths that it does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And vice versa. Let&#8217;s try it out and help them to make *their* platform
</I>&gt;<i> better.  Really though, at some point we must examine the glaring irony of
</I>&gt;<i> a group that's all about designing systems for global democracy&#8230;.but is
</I>&gt;<i> mostly unwilling to consider collaborating with *another* group.  Aren&#8217;t we
</I>&gt;<i> all in this together?  It seems to me that the people on *our* [MG] list
</I>&gt;<i> would have a lot to offer *those* people developing Loomio.   The
</I>&gt;<i> resistance to doing so is highly suspect&#8230;.in my mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this group to know when a proposal is being presented, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast technology (i.e., this email list), not a destination where
</I>&gt;<i> people must check periodically. My primary objective is to give us some
</I>&gt;<i> uniformity so that the casual observer can tell when a new proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> presented, and when people are replying to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get an email every time a new discussion thread begins in any Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> group I am a part of&#8230;.or when a proposal has been made&#8230;.or when a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is about to close.  You would too if you signed up.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The wiki is not perfect, but we have to sacrifice some perfection for
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed (on the wiki not being perfect).  In my mind, being flexible would
</I>&gt;<i> look like being open to trying something new&#8230;..maybe even helping *them*
</I>&gt;<i> out a bit as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t get the resistance on this list to using Loomio for a while (or
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis, or Vilfredo, or Blinap, or whatever). Is it an ego thing (&#8220;my
</I>&gt;<i> system is different, better, or more uniquely special&#8221;), or a proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> thing (&#8220;I can&#8217;t make any money helping someone else with *their*
</I>&gt;<i> platform&#8221;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The planet is on it&#8217;s way to becoming a piece of toast. E democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the only hope for creating the kind of culture that can turn that
</I>&gt;<i> around. E democracy is all about developing means of collaboration&#8230;.coming
</I>&gt;<i> up with solutions *together*. And we&#8217;re still talking about us and
</I>&gt;<i> them&#8230;.&#8221;ours&quot; and &#8220;theirs&#8221;.   I suppose one might find this humorous, if it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn&#8217;t so fucking perplexing.
