<PRE>Steve, I think Alexander&#8217;s point was not specifically to get answers to those questions, but to point out that Loomio has downsides as well. 

I seek not to lock us into one platform (which is not even a participant in our group), but to experiment, try out different platforms, explore flexibility. Loomio has a great-looking interface, but it is rigid and inflexible in some of its underpinnings. Other platforms have strengths that it does not.

For this group to know when a proposal is being presented, we need a broadcast technology (i.e., this email list), not a destination where people must check periodically. My primary objective is to give us some uniformity so that the casual observer can tell when a new proposal is presented, and when people are replying to it.

The wiki is not perfect, but we have to sacrifice some perfection for flexibility. I have added some additional instructions to the wiki article.

It really isn&#8217;t hard. And it&#8217;s a wiki&#8230; the beautiful thing about wikis is that you don&#8217;t have to do a good job. Just do anything, and others can improve it. In fact, if you want to add a proposal and can&#8217;t figure out how to add it to the wiki, just follow the format &#8220;PROPOSAL 2: topic of proposal&#8221; and ask someone else to add it to the wiki.

</I>&gt;<i> Actually, you could ask them if you&#8217;re really interested in those kind of details. You&#8217;re way more familiar with the language than I am. Or, explain (to me) what you want in layman&#8217;s terms and I&#8217;ll see what I can find out. I don&#8217;t want to be asking questions about details I know little to nothing about.  :-)
