</I>
Yes.  It was just a mutual misunderstanding, as you suspect.  It now
appears to be cleared up.

&gt;<i> Same for proposal 3 (the &quot;stifled&quot; text). I very much don't like
</I>&gt;<i> that the home page is blank. But Mike, you brought that about by
</I>&gt;<i> following the rules. Those rules continue to apply. We can't just
</I>&gt;<i> insert some temporary text to tide us over, can we? That seems like
</I>&gt;<i> an end-run around the rules currently in effect.
</I>
Sure we can.  We agreed to blank the old home page because it &quot;solves
the problem of false and misleading information, while leaving the
door open to further proposals and content.&quot;
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006490.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006490.html</A>

We didn't impose any restriction on further proposals, nor on the
content we can add.  Presumeably we won't repeat the mistake of adding
&quot;false and misleading&quot; content, that's all.

To be sure, that old content was nobody's fault.  It was the result of
an early experiment with a half-finished consensus tool, which (to
make matters worse) was misused as a decision tool.  It left us stuck
with a monster of a home page.  Now if we repeat the mistake and again
force a decision through an experimental tool, then we risk another
Frankenstein monster.  *That* would be like an end-run around the
blanking decision.

We should experiment, but should also protect the integrity of the
decision process... which we're doing.  So there's no problem here.

No longer blocking,

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> The decision rule of the group is still that a decision must maintain a consensus for a week in order to become valid. If Vilfredo is used to build a consensus among a subset, it still must achieve consensus here, in the full community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In that way, I don't see the need for blocking the Vilfredo question. Isn't it just a way of helping produce a proposal that might find consensus here?
