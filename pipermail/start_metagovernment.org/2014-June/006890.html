<PRE>Here is a story about the limits of rationality and reason.

I have odd sets of goals.  Here is a simplified goal.

Maximize potential human population.

Without a mechanism to limit actual human population this goal is a kind of
ponzi scheme.  From that you can see that what I am trying for is not
simple to think about.

Further there are interesting issues around cosmological manifestations.
Translating a bit, think contraceptive issues and the Roman Catholic Church
as another oversimplification.

I do not believe you can properly treat this as an issue of science nor of
rationality.  The maximization of potential population is best seen by me
as involving a chaotic manifestation and a risk of zero population
potential.  On the other hand the best traditional ways to keep actual
population below potential are unpleasant and these days also have a
distinct possibility of zero population potential.  The newish ones are
strange.

Personally I think there are easy and obvious technical responses but
technical is only a minor component in a complexity that reaches every part
of existence.

Thus if you wanted a decision process that actually worked as a over plan
goal then I might suggest a mission/vision that used my problem statement
as a vision for a proxy on a fully successful process.

And here is the point at the very end. Vitfredo envisions some sort of
compromise among competing interesting.  I think an interest needs explicit
and somewhat transparent principles in order to play usefully in a public
discussion.

In a manifestation terminology you seem to seek a principle based covenant
for allies, adversaries and even enemies to be implemented in software   At
the far end you are looking at Nash optimization and possible zero sum.
Good luck on that.
