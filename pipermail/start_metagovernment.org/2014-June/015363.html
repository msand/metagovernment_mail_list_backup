<PRE>On Sat, Jun 7, 2014 at 8:43 AM, Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> I disagree with the format of the debate, as it is not what we have already agreed upon. We can't change the rules without following the rules for changing the rules. Otherwise, we are just anarchy.
</I>
I disagree: If you impose a rule that is simply impractical it is the
right of the governed to simply ignore it and do whatever they feel is
appropriate in the *current* situation.  We see this kind of
dysfunction constantly in the US legislature where rules for (e.g.,)
filibuster, amendments, and when something can/must be brought to a
floor vote.  The ability to impose unreasonable rules is just a way to
enforce the status quo and that sort of gridlock only serves to
preserve the positions of those in power at the expense of the
governed.

This is actually an issue near and dear to my heart and is a key
component of The Plan as discussed in my book: By your logic to
implement a direct democracy we'd have to have all the US state
legislatures vote on an amendment to abolish the US constitution
because that's the current rule.  Which is pure bullshit.  When a
simple majority of the people want to just replace the current
government with a new system, they have the right to do so whenever
they damn well please.  We just need to make sure the new system is
*better* than the old one (e.g., 88% of the German people *voted* to
make Hitler dictator which although it was their right to do so, it
didn't turn out the way they expected.  And they should have been able
to predict this).

&gt;<i> The current rules are not that we have two weeks of discussion and then vote (and if so, what defines a winning vote), but rather (roughly) that we vote continually and when there is a supermajority, then it must hold for a full week before it passes. Again, they are stated here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>
We have a new decision rule, the one I proposed and that passed on
Loomio: the lesser of 1/3 of the population and a simple majority.  I
claim that that rule supersedes the one on the metagovernment site.
As I've expressed before I'm not completely comfortable with the fact
that there are 100+ people on the list a whole 9 of whom have bothered
to sign up for Loomio, but if they're not even interested in
*experimenting* with Loomio, I'm satisfied that they're not
sufficiently engaged to be considered part of the &quot;group&quot;.  I don't
have a problem with including any votes cast on this mailing list by
people who for some reason *can't* sign up for Loomio, but I haven't
seen any evidence that this has actually happened.

&gt;<i> And just to be clear:
</I>&gt;<i> -1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I tried joining the Loomio metagov board, and I had to ask for permission. I don't understand how a system can be democratic if some authoritarian (someone with authority) gets to decide who may participate.
</I>
Yeah, this isn't one of my favorite features either.  My system won't
have this, or even any restriction on browsing proposals without a
login.  I *do* understand the need for a system of authentication at
some point to prevent people from screwing the system up by creating
bogus accounts, but it shouldn't be turned on by default.

&gt;<i> Now that I have been deemed worthy of participating in the board, I only see up/down style voting. How does that build consensus?
</I>
Ironic, isn't it?  But I see you're still holding on to that
word/concept even though I haven't seen any convincing rebuttal to my
claim that it's simply unworkable...

&gt;<i>  If someone disagrees with a word, how is the proposal refined? If someone has a counter-proposal, how is it compared to the original? I am not seeing how Loomio is supposed to be more than a simple replication of the problems/limitations of the status quo. Systems like Vilfredo and Votorola appear to be vastly more sophisticated at consensus-building, even if they don't have quite as pretty of a front-end (which truly is the worst standard: otherwise, let's just use Facebook for decision-making).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're not going to get any strong defense of the Loomio design from
me, but it *is* possible to do those things you want via the comment
system and the ability for anyone to make alternative proposals.  It
just requires the proposers pay attention to the comments and modify
their proposals, and for all the voters to scan all the proposals
before casting their votes.

&gt;<i> To Michael's point, I do agree that we should be discussing what we are doing here. So... does everyone agree with the mission, vision, and common principles stated here?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, that sounds like a great starting point. And the mission statement sounds like a good first sentence for the home page, right? (Which is pretty much what it was before it got blanked.)
</I>
And as I've said (many times ;-) before, you don't have consensus on
the use of the word consensus.  You also don't have consensus on the
interoperability requirement.  As I've been hammering home on the
auxlang mailing list over the last couple of weeks, we need to
understand that the &quot;Highlander Rule&quot; applies to governments just as
much as it does to International Auxiliary Languages: &quot;There can be
only one!&quot;.  Any candidate system that is not that One must die or be
actively killed off as part of the process.
  Regards,
    Scott
