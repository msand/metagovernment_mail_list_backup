<PRE>Sorry I have little time to reply. I think you may have misinterpreted my meaning. 

We *should* use Loomio. And every other platform (including using multiple platforms at once). 

But as we move from platform, we need a consistent way for the casual observer to follow where the latest proposals are. Especially if we are in more than one platform at any time. 

The email/wiki solution is just for the bare minimum of keeping everyone in the loop regardless of what is going on elsewhere.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think Alexander&#8217;s point was not specifically to get answers to those questions, but to point out that Loomio has downsides as well. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like you&#8217;re making a bit of an assumption here Ed. I&#8217;d like to hear from Alex what his point was&#8230;.'specifically'.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I seek not to lock us into one platform
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Except maybe e-mail and the wiki?  I&#8217;m merely suggesting that we try out each available platform for a given period of time. Move around a bit&#8230;.test, suggest, collaborate. Perhaps you missed that in my other e-mails.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which is not even a participant in our group),
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Does it really matter whether *they* are a participant in *our* group. Their group is open to everyone&#8230;.as is ours. We are all in this together. Lot&#8217;s of room for cross pollination I would say.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but to experiment, try out different platforms, explore flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Loomio has a great-looking interface, but it is rigid and inflexible in some of its underpinnings. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe they would wholeheartedly agree with you. They are just getting started&#8230;.you of all people should know these things take time. If there is any inflexibility on this issue, I would say it has found a very comfortable home on this list.    ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Other platforms have strengths that it does not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And vice versa. Let&#8217;s try it out and help them to make *their* platform better.  Really though, at some point we must examine the glaring irony of a group that's all about designing systems for global democracy&#8230;.but is mostly unwilling to consider collaborating with *another* group.  Aren&#8217;t we all in this together?  It seems to me that the people on *our* [MG] list would have a lot to offer *those* people developing Loomio.   The resistance to doing so is highly suspect&#8230;.in my mind.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For this group to know when a proposal is being presented, we need a broadcast technology (i.e., this email list), not a destination where people must check periodically. My primary objective is to give us some uniformity so that the casual observer can tell when a new proposal is presented, and when people are replying to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I get an email every time a new discussion thread begins in any Loomio group I am a part of&#8230;.or when a proposal has been made&#8230;.or when a proposal is about to close.  You would too if you signed up.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The wiki is not perfect, but we have to sacrifice some perfection for flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed (on the wiki not being perfect).  In my mind, being flexible would look like being open to trying something new&#8230;..maybe even helping *them* out a bit as well.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t get the resistance on this list to using Loomio for a while (or Airesis, or Vilfredo, or Blinap, or whatever). Is it an ego thing (&#8220;my system is different, better, or more uniquely special&#8221;), or a proprietary thing (&#8220;I can&#8217;t make any money helping someone else with their platform&#8221;)? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The planet is on it&#8217;s way to becoming a piece of toast. E democracy is perhaps the only hope for creating the kind of culture that can turn that around. E democracy is all about developing means of collaboration&#8230;.coming up with solutions *together*. And we&#8217;re still talking about us and them&#8230;.&#8221;ours&quot; and &#8220;theirs&#8221;.   I suppose one might find this humorous, if it wasn&#8217;t so fucking perplexing.
