</I>
The way Votorola works (or at least the way it has been used here) is in conjunction with a wiki. People use wiki articles to create proposals, then those can be compared to each other, sections can easily be copied from one to another, and votes can hop between competing proposals as they develop. It is exactly built for proposal generation and consensus-building, and it works now and it does not rely on any authority (no single person moderates the proposal). Vilfredo works completely differently, has no wiki, and yet also is extremely adept at proposal generation combined with consensus building. It too runs right now and requires no authority. SettleIt looks like it too, working in yet another completely different way, is built for consensus-building and proposal generation. Loomio is so primitive in comparison, that I don't know why it is even being discussed here.

I did not impose that rule. It was unanimously adopted by the participating members of this group. Included in the decision-rule was a method for how the rule itself should be changed. That is a community charter, and to throw it away destroys our community.

&gt;<i> [snip] We have a new decision rule, the one I proposed and that passed on
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio: the lesser of 1/3 of the population and a simple majority.  I
</I>&gt;<i> claim that that rule supersedes the one on the metagovernment site.
</I>
See above. You say imposed rules should be ignored, and now you're trying to impose a rule. 

I now see the proposal you reference on Loomio. I was busy then and could not participate. It got 57% of the vote. By the standing decision rule, (which to change the decision rule requires 100% for that many participants; or a minimum of 80% for large populations) it failed. few
Saying it passed on its own rule is a tautology. Otherwise: I propose that the new decision rule is that whatever I say goes and the vote shall be decided only by me and I vote yes, so that's the new decision rule. In other words... you can't impose a new decision rule before changing the decision rule.

&gt;<i> As I've expressed before I'm not completely comfortable with the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that there are 100+ people on the list a whole 9 of whom have bothered
</I>&gt;<i> to sign up for Loomio, but if they're not even interested in
</I>&gt;<i> *experimenting* with Loomio, I'm satisfied that they're not
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently engaged to be considered part of the &quot;group&quot;.
</I>
How does this follow, when there are many systems participating here, Loomio is not even one of them, and you apparently are not willing to try out these other systems. Have you looked at Vilfredo? It is fantastic at building consensus, and lightyears ahead of loomio in architecture.

&gt;<i>  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> have a problem with including any votes cast on this mailing list by
</I>&gt;<i> people who for some reason *can't* sign up for Loomio, but I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> seen any evidence that this has actually happened.
</I>
Again, why Loomio? It is the least sophisticated system that has been presented here, it has barriers to participation, and it has no representation in this community. It should be the last choice for any decision, not some sort of gold standard, which I continue to fail to comprehend.
