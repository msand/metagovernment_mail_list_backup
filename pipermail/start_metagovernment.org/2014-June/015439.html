</I>
Hmm, looks like Ed can't take a little teasing.  You had time to
respond to the previous post, and had time to respond to this one.
But, curiously, neither post addresses the question I asked: Can a
government be replaced with a simple majority vote, or is something
more complicated required depending on the existing governing
documents?  Explain why.

&gt;<i> As for comparing me to Adolf Hitler (quite likely the most evil person of the recent era if not ever... thanks again for the implied insult?), your comparison contains the answer: Hitler had tanks and I have nothing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The comparison wasn't you and Hitler, it was merely the Germans and
us: Just like the Germans in 1939 we seem to be stuck with a decision
rule that is preventing us from making what should be a relatively
simple change to the Metagovernment Home page.  What happens when
something really contentious comes up?  E.g., never mind immigration
and gun control, let's try to define what is a legitimate revolution!

&gt;<i> I have no authority over you, and you can do whatever you want. I am not Hitler imposing myself on you; nor is any other member of this group. The group is the community of people who are generally agreeing on some basic things, and communities are defined by their history as well as their membership. Our beginning premise and our continuing tradition is one of consensus and almost always of unanimity among current participants on our email list server. If you think there should be a community that works on minority rule on Loomio, then that is another group: go start it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, I'm no big fan of Loomio, but see that it works (we actually
made decisions!)  I'm enjoying this Vilfredo trial as well, but I'm
still not really understanding how the process works and so remain
skeptical that it will be usable by an average person.

&gt;<i> And therein lies the rest of the answer to your question above. Replacing the status quo is about starting a new system and getting people to join until it becomes the prevalent system. There is no need to abide by the rules of the status quo: we will just make it irrelevant. Back when we had a home page, this was described in the Transition section:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's not specific, though: Where exactly is the threshold where the
actual transition occurs?  Is there some event to mark that
transition?

&gt;<i> So if you wish to change the rules of this group, then please do the same thing: start a better group and MAKE US IRRELEVANT. But please don't say that the new rule is minority-rule and a minority is in favor that rule so it is now the law of this whole community. That is much more tyrannical than anything any of us have proposed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's not exactly minority rule, it's minority gridlock: By setting the
decision rule too high (i.e., consensus) you've essentially proven my
point because there still is no home page, nor apparently even
&quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule even though a majority of the active
participants in the group approved my &quot;1/3 or majority&quot; rule.  Again,
after we get the home page situation sorted, we really need to get
back to the issue of decision rules, especially as they apply to
changing governing documents.  Taking a month to change a Home page is
one thing, how long do you think it would take to e.g., reform the
prison or school system at this rate?
  Regards,
    Scott
