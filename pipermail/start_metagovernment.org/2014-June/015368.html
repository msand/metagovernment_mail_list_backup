&gt;<i>  Loomio is so primitive in comparison, that I don't know why it is even being discussed here.
</I>
One metric you&#8217;re leaving out is *usability*. I don&#8217;t know much about Vilfredo or SettleIt because I&#8217;ve never had the opportunity to use them, but Votorola was beyond my ability to apprehend a couple of years ago when I was working with Michael to introduce it to #Occupy. (Maybe it&#8217;s better now&#8230;..hopefully so.)  I say this with all due respect to Michael as think a lot of him and I really enjoyed working with him during that period of time.

In spite of, or maybe because of, it&#8217;s &#8220;primitive&#8221; simplicity, Loomio is actually being used by a large number of people.  But I will say it again, let&#8217;s use Votorola, and  Vilfredo, and SettleIt, and Blinap, and Discourse, etc..  Let&#8217;s use them to discuss *The Plan*. Or let&#8217;s use them to reframe the homepage to better suit the current [MG] community,. (It seems like there is some interest in doing that.) The effort could be worthwhile on a number of different fronts.

&gt;<i>  Have you looked at Vilfredo? It is fantastic at building consensus, and lightyears ahead of loomio in architecture.
</I>
Then let&#8217;s use it.

&gt;<i> Again, why Loomio? &#8230;...it has barriers to participation,
</I>
I think those barriers exist only in your own mind. You can set a group up various ways (see below). It can be public or private.  I don&#8217;t know why it was set up the way it was. In that moment I imagine it made sense to the person who took the time to set it up for us.  Let&#8217;s use it to vote on whether to make it public. 

&gt;<i> and it has no representation in this community.
</I>
What would that look like...and why does that even matter? I&#8217;m a member of the *Loomio Community* and I&#8217;m a member of [MG]. I would like for this group, (at some point in time) to give it a go. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s on the table. Is there some *rule of representation* that would prevent us from testing it out for a bit? And then maybe offering them some constructive feedback?

&gt;<i> It should be the last choice for any decision, not some sort of gold standard, which I continue to fail to comprehend.
</I>

I think you&#8217;re being a bit defensive. No one has suggested that it be held up as &quot;some sort of gold standard&#8221;.  Certainly not me.  (Though I do like the UI ).  ;-)

Your resistance to using Loomio is loud and clear. What&#8217;s not so clear to me is why you want to continue using our current platform. I mean, what could be more &quot;primitive&quot; than e-mail?
