<PRE>Perhaps the ROR question is if it a  good system for running an email
meeting.  Or if it was our authority and that authority allows us to
customize the authority are we then likely to be blessed to actually
customize.

I am okay waiting for a century for a decision in a talk mode.  We run wars
for longer to try to get to a decision.

My cursory analysis is the email list here is not the best email approach
from a ROR point of view.

</I>&gt;<i> because of the whole &quot;herding cats&quot; feel it has to it.  To some extent
</I>&gt;<i> that's to be expected when you get a bunch of visionaries and
</I>&gt;<i> technocrats together and expect them to function as an organization,
</I>&gt;<i> but it's also pretty ironic that a group set up to design and
</I>&gt;<i> implement new governing systems can't even govern themselves or even
</I>&gt;<i> make the fundamental decisions required to provide some structure to
</I>&gt;<i> the process (decision rule, choice of tool that's to be used at any
</I>&gt;<i> given time or for any particular type of decision, even apparently any
</I>&gt;<i> recognition that *some* decision is always better than no decision).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for Vilfredo, the graphs are just beautiful.  And yet I still don't
</I>&gt;<i> understand how they help us reach a decision, and I have this strong
</I>&gt;<i> feeling of being left out of the loop (e.g., I'm not getting any
</I>&gt;<i> emails even though I subscribed to them (and yes, I checked my spam
</I>&gt;<i> folder), and when I look at the page now I have no idea what to do).
</I>&gt;<i> Looking back at previous decisions on Vilfredo,  it seems to me the
</I>&gt;<i> way Bentley's intro proposal has received endorsements on this mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list (outside of Vilfredo) is the way these &quot;unanimous&quot; decisions have
</I>&gt;<i> been reached in the past: At some point people just get tired of
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with it and either take the vote outside the system, or just
</I>&gt;<i> settle for whatever the current (albeit suboptimal) proposal is rather
</I>&gt;<i> than drag everyone through another round of revisions.  I think I
</I>&gt;<i> finally understand Ed's fascination with it over Loomio though: He's
</I>&gt;<i> simply more interested in &quot;process&quot; than in &quot;results&quot;.  Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> provides a lush (and apparently never-ending) process, which I find
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat annoying because I usually don't give a damn about process
</I>&gt;<i> and just want to see the results.  Which is one thing Loomio provides
</I>&gt;<i> with 100% reliability (i.e., once the vote is closed, it's done!)  If
</I>&gt;<i> we end up with no decision, or Bentley's nice but incomplete proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> I recommend we try again on Loomio.
