<PRE>Pietro,

I checked my spam folder  and I checked my setting in Vilfredo and
everything looks set up correctly but I am not receiving emails from
Vilfredo. I went to the feedback age but that is a public feedback forum so
I didn't think it was appropriate for an specific issue like this.

Can someone forward me the email so I can see it? I would like to see how
the process works regardless on my general understanding or technical
issues.

&gt;<i> Hi Steve, hi All.
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like Ned has started a question on Vilfredo for the homepage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> As you never participated in a question before, it is possible that you
</I>&gt;<i> might not have received the invitation. Also please (THIS FOR ALL) consider
</I>&gt;<i> checking in your spam filter to make sure that any email from Vilfredo does
</I>&gt;<i> not go there. Vilfredo relies on those emails to tell you all what is the
</I>&gt;<i> next step, so it is important that your email service provider does not
</I>&gt;<i> catalog them as Spam.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo explains step by step what you are supposed to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Generally in Vilfredo we have a writing phase and a voting phase, followed
</I>&gt;<i> by another writing phase, and another voting phase... and so on. (In the
</I>&gt;<i> next version of Vilfredo we might have found a way to have only one phase,
</I>&gt;<i> with great happiness of some of the older members who have asked it about 4
</I>&gt;<i> years ago. Sorry I needed to clarify the math). The person who started it
</I>&gt;<i> decides how long each phase lasts (also this is non democratic, I know).
</I>&gt;<i> Ned has chosen that each phase will take a minimum of 24 hours and a
</I>&gt;<i> maximum of 48 hours. This means that he will not be allowed to move on the
</I>&gt;<i> question before the first day. But after 2 days the question will move on
</I>&gt;<i> automatically if he still has not done it (and if there are at least 2
</I>&gt;<i> proposals/2 voters).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if you think you know how Vilfredo works, you should pay attention as
</I>&gt;<i> there are many changes that have been made (and even more we are planning
</I>&gt;<i> and testing and designing right now). Differences respect to previous
</I>&gt;<i> versions: now you can say if you do not understand a proposal. Now if a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal cannot be deleted because of you (and only of you) you will get
</I>&gt;<i> alerted, and a request to consider changing your mind. And we have a nice
</I>&gt;<i> video explaining how graph work, and what is represented there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am very happy people are using Vilfredo again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please let me know how I can be of help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
