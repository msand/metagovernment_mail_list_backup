I have no problem with Robert's Rules.  It's a good system for running
meetings.  I hate meetings, though, and generally consider them an
obsolete method for reaching a decision (i.e., even Loomio, with all
its many limitations, is a much better system than RONR).

I find this whole process very interesting and enlightening, mostly
because of the whole &quot;herding cats&quot; feel it has to it.  To some extent
that's to be expected when you get a bunch of visionaries and
technocrats together and expect them to function as an organization,
but it's also pretty ironic that a group set up to design and
implement new governing systems can't even govern themselves or even
make the fundamental decisions required to provide some structure to
the process (decision rule, choice of tool that's to be used at any
given time or for any particular type of decision, even apparently any
recognition that *some* decision is always better than no decision).

As for Vilfredo, the graphs are just beautiful.  And yet I still don't
understand how they help us reach a decision, and I have this strong
feeling of being left out of the loop (e.g., I'm not getting any
emails even though I subscribed to them (and yes, I checked my spam
folder), and when I look at the page now I have no idea what to do).
Looking back at previous decisions on Vilfredo,  it seems to me the
way Bentley's intro proposal has received endorsements on this mailing
list (outside of Vilfredo) is the way these &quot;unanimous&quot; decisions have
been reached in the past: At some point people just get tired of
dealing with it and either take the vote outside the system, or just
settle for whatever the current (albeit suboptimal) proposal is rather
than drag everyone through another round of revisions.  I think I
finally understand Ed's fascination with it over Loomio though: He's
simply more interested in &quot;process&quot; than in &quot;results&quot;.  Vilfredo
provides a lush (and apparently never-ending) process, which I find
somewhat annoying because I usually don't give a damn about process
and just want to see the results.  Which is one thing Loomio provides
with 100% reliability (i.e., once the vote is closed, it's done!)  If
we end up with no decision, or Bentley's nice but incomplete proposal,
I recommend we try again on Loomio.
  Regards,
    Scott
