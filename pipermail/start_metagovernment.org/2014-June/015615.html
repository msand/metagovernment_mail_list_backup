<PRE>Hi Mark,

&gt;<i> ...  I suppose what feedback I have is that the &quot;deliberation&quot; about
</I>&gt;<i> what should go on the home page, and the &quot;decision&quot; to approve it
</I>&gt;<i> might be thought of as distinct steps. ...
</I>
Generally we're deliberating on the home page.  In this thread, we're
seeking feedback on a deliberative process as structured by Votorola.
But it appears people are temporarily exhausted by the issue, because
deliberation is dying down everywhere.

&gt;<i> I welcome a critique on the diagram...
</I>
I agree that *decisions* can be formalized as distinct steps, but not
deliberations.  Deliberations are unconstrained (if valid) and cannot
easily be turned on and off.  They tend to have a life of their own.

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I welcome a critique on the diagram, but hadn't included it for that
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://democracylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ProcessDiag_Behavior_0.png">http://democracylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ProcessDiag_Behavior_0.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought rather that it might provide a useful framing to help
</I>&gt;<i> differentiate the purpose and capabilities of the various tools being used
</I>&gt;<i> or proposed for use on the list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like Metagovernment, DemocracyLab is in the midst of reworking its home
</I>&gt;<i> page, and an interactive version of the diagram will be the central
</I>&gt;<i> storytelling feature.  The basic message is that civic tech applications
</I>&gt;<i> are those that address at least one phase of the problem lifecycle
</I>&gt;<i> described.  Visitors will then self-identify into one of three roles -
</I>&gt;<i> developer, participant or supporter, and click through to a page presenting
</I>&gt;<i> information on civic tech applications tailored to their perspective.  The
</I>&gt;<i> goal is to create a sustainable ecosystem, where collaboration among
</I>&gt;<i> developers is facilitated, civic tech users can find applications
</I>&gt;<i> addressing issues that are important to them, and potential funders can
</I>&gt;<i> easily research and perform due diligence on projects of interest.  As some
</I>&gt;<i> of you may remember, DemocracyLab is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
</I>&gt;<i> based in the U.S. (Seattle, more precisely).  Like many of you, this isn't
</I>&gt;<i> my full-time job, so progress is slower than I would like, but I'll keep
</I>&gt;<i> the group informed as we move forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning my critique of this discussion and process, I'm in the same boat
</I>&gt;<i> as many in that I'm not able to effectively keep up with all facets of the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion.  I was initially a bit taken aback by blanking the homepage,
</I>&gt;<i> but in hindsight it appears to have been a good decision because it has
</I>&gt;<i> spurred the group into more meaningful discussion than at any point in my
</I>&gt;<i> memory.  I suppose what feedback I have is that the &quot;deliberation&quot; about
</I>&gt;<i> what should go on the home page, and the &quot;decision&quot; to approve it might be
</I>&gt;<i> thought of as distinct steps.  Collaborative writing tools might be
</I>&gt;<i> effective for deliberation, while an app designed to make it easy to decide
</I>&gt;<i> among well-drafted discrete choices could work for decision. I think a
</I>&gt;<i> small number of group members are going to be able to participate fully in
</I>&gt;<i> the writing and deliberation, but that a much larger group would be willing
</I>&gt;<i> to participate in a decision process that was well defined and relatively
</I>&gt;<i> easy.  Having more group members participate in a final decision will add
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy to the outcome and cause more members feel invested in the
</I>&gt;<i> organization going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Warm regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Mark-
</I>
