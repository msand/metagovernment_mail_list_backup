<PRE>Dear all,
as we just moved on to the end of the second generation, into the third
generation, I think it is the time that I introduce you to the remaining
instruments inside Vilfredo.

If you go to the question page,
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

Just after the question, in yellow, you will see a button (in green) which
says &quot;Show Voting History Table&quot;. If you click on it it will open up a
table the summarises what has happened in the question so far. Often
looking at this table is the easiest way to get an idea about what is going
on inside a question.

Some time ago I produced a video explaining the table: you can find it here
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYNGW04GmVw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYNGW04GmVw</A>

In the table, above you will see a series of links. First of all there is a
link to the question page
row 1: question 164
Then on row 2 there is a link to the history page and the page where each
generation is explained:
History, Generation 1, Generation 2

And then it enters into the various proposals, that will be explained in
the video.

The history page is a page where everything that has happened in the
question so far can be seen. All the proposals are written in full, as well
as who wrote for them, and who voted for them. The page in our case is
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164</A>

Then there is a generation page for each generation. So far we have gone
through 2 generations, so we have two of those generations:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1</A>
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2</A>

Each of those pages goes into great detail into the analysis over what has
happened in that generation. Not just who voted for what and who wrote
what, but also what was the effect of each person participating, how each
person participating have at least one proposal in the pareto front, and
which participants are key players for which proposals.

And this brings us to the last element.

As we have finished the second generation and we enter into the third
generation everyone can write their own new proposals. The idea is that
although you are free to write and mutate and proposal you like, Vilfredo
eventually will hint what proposal you seem to be in a better position to
work on.

In particular, just looking at the graph,
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/map/adf634f317072279c333f429c0064bc6.svg">http://vilfredo.org/map/adf634f317072279c333f429c0064bc6.svg</A>
(this image will only be available for some days, apologise if you are
reading this after)
we can see that there are 3 key players: Michael, Steve and Ed.

Michael Allan did not support 2678 , but IF she or he did, then the Pareto
Front would have be simpler.
We say that Michael Allan is a Key Player for this proposal for Generation
2.
We emailed Michael Allan asking him or her to rewrite 2678 in a format
acceptable to him or her.

Michael Allan did not support 2679 , but IF she or he did, then the Pareto
Front would have be simpler.
We say that Michael Allan is a Key Player for this proposal for Generation
2.
We emailed Michael Allan asking him or her to rewrite 2679 in a format
acceptable to him or her.

SteveCoffman did not support 2678 , but IF she or he did, then the Pareto
Front would have be simpler.
We say that SteveCoffman is a Key Player for this proposal for Generation
2.
We emailed SteveCoffman asking him or her to rewrite 2678 in a format
acceptable to him or her.

Ed Pastore did not support 2679 , but IF she or he did, then the Pareto
Front would have be simpler.
We say that Ed Pastore is a Key Player for this proposal for Generation 2.
We emailed Ed Pastore asking him or her to rewrite 2679 in a format
acceptable to him or her.

And Vilfredo has already emailed them (please let me know if the email did
not went through).

But what should the other participant work on? If you are not a key player
and you have 2 or more proposal in the Pareto Front you should try to merge
those proposals.

If you are the author of a proposal in the previous generation, and someone
did not understand something, you should try to rewrite that proposal
clarifying what was unclear.

And then of course you are free to add any new idea you might have, or work
on anything you want.

As I said, eventually Vilfredo should develop into a full AI moderator that
analysing who voted for what, suggests who should work on what,
collaborating with whom.

And with this explanation I think we have pretty much covered all of
Vilfredo as it is now. I might still comment on some small elements, but by
now you have all the tools in hand to use Vilfredo fully.

I hope you enjoyed the show.

&gt;<i> As this experience with Vilfredo is progressing, let me add another layer
</I>&gt;<i> of complexity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a normal election, when you are trying to elect one candidate out of a
</I>&gt;<i> n, there are basically n possible results. And usually m people voting,
</I>&gt;<i> with m much bigger than n. The result is that no person can singularly
</I>&gt;<i> change the result of the election.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Vilfredo we are not looking for a single winner, but for a set of
</I>&gt;<i> winners (the famous Pareto Front). And if we have n candidates, the number
</I>&gt;<i> of possible Pareto Front that can be extracted is 2^n (two elevated to n),
</I>&gt;<i> which is usually a big number, often much bigger than m, even when m is
</I>&gt;<i> much bigger then n. So 2^n &gt; m &gt; n. So each person by changing their vote
</I>&gt;<i> can change the result. It will not able to control fully the result. It
</I>&gt;<i> will always be some change among the possibles. But no person can say that
</I>&gt;<i> his vote did not matter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let us make an example. In our case we are having 7 person participating.
</I>&gt;<i> 25 proposals. In our case the number of voters is even smaller than the
</I>&gt;<i> number of proposals, so each of us have a direct effect on the result. But
</I>&gt;<i> it is even more so considering that the number of possible results is 2^25=
</I>&gt;<i> 33,554,432 (thirty-three million five hundred fifty-four thousands four
</I>&gt;<i> hundred thirty-two - spelled out sounds even bigger :-) )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inevitably the vote of each of us has a huge effect on the result. And
</I>&gt;<i> since we have such a huge result, and since it is all math base, we can
</I>&gt;<i> measure it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After each generation there is a page that is produced automatically that
</I>&gt;<i> summarises what has happened in that generation. I have not introduced it
</I>&gt;<i> before because I did not want to flood you with information. But the page
</I>&gt;<i> for the first generation was <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1</A> (I will
</I>&gt;<i> show you where the link is, in an email soon).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we look at that first generation, there were 11 proposals, 7
</I>&gt;<i> participants, 2^11= 2048 possible results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each participant effect can be seen here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1#Effect">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1#Effect</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words here we can read how would the result have changed if each
</I>&gt;<i> of us has not voted. Some people did not change the Pareto Front (Ned and
</I>&gt;<i> Steve), but everybody else did. For example Bentley added the proposal 2649
</I>&gt;<i> with his vote. And also Ned and Steve &quot;could&quot; have changed the Pareto Front
</I>&gt;<i> if they voted differently. For example Steve voted on that generation for
</I>&gt;<i> every proposal. If you vote for every proposal you are sure not to affect
</I>&gt;<i> the result.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason it is important in Vilfredo to consider your vote, and
</I>&gt;<i> consider not just what you like, but how by voting differently you can
</I>&gt;<i> change the Pareto Front. Not all changes are possible. But among the
</I>&gt;<i> changes that you can reach, is the actual result the one you like most.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If everybody does this, the result will be among the thousands (or
</I>&gt;<i> millions) of possible results THE Nash equilibrium of the community. Not a
</I>&gt;<i> bad result indeed :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Soon (in less than 1 hour) we are going to move to the third generation.
</I>&gt;<i> This will happen, independently of Ned, as we have reached the maximum time
</I>&gt;<i> that Ned established at the beginning, when he posed the question. Can you
</I>&gt;<i> guess once we open the generation page for the second generation, was the
</I>&gt;<i> effect of your vote was? How did you change the result?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Scott,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Bentley:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> every generation some proposals of the previous generation go to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> next generation. From a mathematical point of view, those are the Pareto
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Front. The proposal that are not-dominated by any other proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In our case only 4 proposals were in the Pareto Front. We then wrote 21
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (twentyone!!!) new proposals :-), and so one we have to evaluate each of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  those 21+4=25 proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have seen that someone (Ned, I gather) have started writing proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expressing parts of the homepage. Unfortunately Vilfredo does not work in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this way. Basically the domination system that makes sure that one proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dominates another under certain conditions makes only sense if the two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposals are trying to answer the same question. Semantically speaking. So
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you can substitute one proposal for the other. When this is not the case,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the result is much less meaningful. You might end up finding a full
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus over a small part of what you are working on. This is the reason
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> why I explained at the beginning that Vilfredo works well for &quot;how shall
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we&quot; kind of question. In other words question where we are looking for a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> single answer (maybe complex). But not a list of elements more or less
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> independently structure. If we want to use Vilfredo in this way, we should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> open a separate question for each element. For example if we agree to have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a specific structure made of &quot;mission, vision, projects, ... &quot; then for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each of them we can ask: &quot;what is the mission of Vilfredo to insert in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> homepage?&quot;. (which is not a how, but it is still a question where you are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> looking for a single winning proposal).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Scott:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There were some suggestions from you (Scott), to evaluate the proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a 10 star system. It is interesting, but first you would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand the way Vilfredo works. What you are suggesting is something
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> similar to Range Voting. A slightly better version of that would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Majority Judgment. But regardless, Vilfredo uses a completely different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> method. We DO NOT sum the votes. Instead we declare that a proposal A
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dominates a proposal B iff (if and only if) the set of people that vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> B is a subset of the people that vote for A. So it is not just that A has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more support, but it is also supported by the same people. So each person
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that like B will also be happy if we pass A. Then the Pareto Front is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> set of the non-dominated proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In this way you can be sure that whoever votes in Vilfredo, will find
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> at least one of the proposals he voted for in the Pareto Front. Because if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you voted for B, and A dominates B, so that A is in the Pareto Front. Then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you MUST have also voted for A, so you are still represented in the Pareto
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Front. For this reason you can say that the Pareto Front represents the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> community :-).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The next version of Vilfredo will use a mixed system. People will vote
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on an inverted triangle to say how much they like and they understand a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. Then a first approximation will be used to find the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And in situations where several proposals are competing (especially if no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one is presenting new ideas) the actual position in the triangle will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used. It is much more complex, which is why its development is so slow.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Finally consider looking at the Pareto Front, looking at how you vote,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and how by changing your vote you can slightly change the Pareto Front. We
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are releasing this information (the graph, how other people votes)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specifically so that people can change their vote and look for a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. I wrote a proposal suggesting that this Vilfredo consultation was

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If this proposal reaches enough support then maybe we can reach an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> agreement inside the community with the people (i.,e. Michael Allen) who
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> feel we are excluding by using Vilfredo without going through a formal vote
