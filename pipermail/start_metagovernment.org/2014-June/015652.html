<PRE>Ned, I would like to correct something you wrote some time ago, that went
unnoticed.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In hindsight, when Pietro suggested that we try to reduce the size of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the Pareto Front, I see that he put me into a &quot;be more selective&quot; mindset.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>If you want to reduce the Pareto Front you do not want to be more selective
but less selective. The more proposta you vote for, the more proposal you
are saying to the algorithm that are ok for you. The easier it is for the
algorithm to find a consensus, or a minimum set. If you vote for all the
proposal  your vote will not affect the result at all, and you will never
be a key player.

There is an exception: if a group of proposal are all voted exactly by the
same people and they are all inside the pareto front, then if a person (any
person of that group or outside that group), votes for 1 of those proposal,
that proposal will dominate the others. and the PF will become smaller. It
is quite a peculiar case, but it is important. If you notice how I voted in
the past, you will see that sometimes I voted for a proposal not so much
because I liked that, but because I liked it &quot;more&quot; than the others, and I
did not want so many proposals to all reach the PF.
For example in the last generation Michael voted for 2714, 2737, 2650, and
2712. No one has voted for any of them. So all 4 of them were going to go
to the PF. I then voted for 2712, breaking the symmetry, and making sure
that only one of them would reach the PF.

But apart for that case, in all other the more selective you are the more
you expand the PF.

Voting in Vilfredo is &quot;just different&quot; ;-)
