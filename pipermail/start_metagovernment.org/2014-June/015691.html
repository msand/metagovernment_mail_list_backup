</I>&gt;<i> I think overplanning is not a belief system, Alex, but a technical

</I>&gt;<i> technical practice, per se), then that's natural.  Only two people are
</I>&gt;<i> currently attempting it (if we include Scott), and we can show no

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like i imagine a &quot;fish swarm&quot; does not have an overplan. its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; behavior emerges from all the single fishes following their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; neighbors ...somehow...  and patterns emerge and evolve through
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feedback over time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that fish can't have overplans.  But fish can't think clearly,
</I>&gt;<i> if they can think at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I believe that fish have some mechanisms in their head by which they act
and build some kind of &quot;swarm intelligence&quot;.
Birds show similar behavior.
Humans are more complex, but if some super human being (like the Q from
enterprise) would observe humans, they would be quite predictable. they
eat, sleep, work, move, take time to aquire certain skills, and die.
you could put human lives into numbers and describe it somehow ... good
enough to anticipate their behavior to to whatever you want, ...if you were
a Q :-)
Same is true for humans when they want to do whatever they want with fish
:<i>-)
</I>
yes, we might call it thinking and its more advanced then what fish do, but
in the end, there is mass psychology and humans are limited by they
abilities and knowledge.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think it might be possible that something like an &quot;overplan&quot; will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emerge, but it is not necessary and might also depends on peoples
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; values in general and what kind of life they would like to live or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; however that evolves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense.  I think overplans in modern society can only
</I>&gt;<i> emerge; they can never be imposed top down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

ok, then we have similar believes here :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we're actually starting to emerge them right now, here in
</I>&gt;<i> Metagov.  It's hard to imagine anything more interesting to agree on
</I>&gt;<i> than the future of humanity in an executable form.  And if there's no
</I>&gt;<i> other way forward (as I claim everywhere in this thread) then any
</I>&gt;<i> progress we make here is necessarily historic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What you describe is some kind of &quot;waterfall&quot; planning model, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under incomplete information which is the common case, everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; has to change frequently and often... so even that kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vocabulary and top-down approach you are introducing leads easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into the wrong kind of thoughts i would imagine. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's something new and poorly described, so you've formed an
</I>&gt;<i> incomplete impression at first.  Really it's the exact *opposite* of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;top-down&quot;, and the exact opposite of &quot;waterfall&quot; (linear).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
ok, so then it was my poor perception of what you describe as overplanning
:<i>-)
</I>totally possible



&gt;<i> Every overplan is top-*level* (biggest scope), but a modern overplan
</I>&gt;<i> (what we're talking about) is never top-*down* (imposed by force).
</I>&gt;<i> The individual freely chooses and executes the overplan.  It's always
</I>&gt;<i> a *selective* overplan: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>
</I>

ok, still confusing what exactly a &quot;selective overplan&quot; should be...
...



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And a selective overplan is never linear, but always cyclic.  That's
</I>&gt;<i> why we can never get lost or stuck in it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Reading it feels like some kind of universal truth approach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something... ...which might actually evolve or not but its actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not important if it does or not.  My perspective is, that it is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary to anticipate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it's not necessary to anticipate the future, but only because
</I>&gt;<i> it's not necessary (absolutely necessary) for us to exist.  This is a
</I>&gt;<i> big issue though, so, if anyone is doubtful of the argument, then we
</I>&gt;<i> should probably discuss it separately.  I'll open a thread shortly
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;eliminating existential risk&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I cannot really express how i see stuff, but speaking more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;analogy/pattern/feeling&quot; like, i imagine that we come up with some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;micro mechanisms&quot; roughly in the sense that fish swarms orient, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these &quot;micro patterns&quot; are crafted so carefully, so that bigger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organizational patterns emerge from that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One of those mechanisms which exists today, is money and every day
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transactions in which all the people participate all the time...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given all the rules and mechanics that apply to those micro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transactions, there are bigger patterns which emerge from that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because the &quot;micro rules&quot; are like they are.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so i do not really see the need for BIG UPFRONT PLANNING, but more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to apply stuff to some kind of micro environment but with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scalability in mind :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think what you're outlining there is an overplan by definition.  I
</I>&gt;<i> won't try to pin you to it.  I don't think you're attacking the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of overplans, just sincerely expressing your initial feelings, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> But generally I think it's like what Max said in another thread:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Max in 'Myths' said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... After all we find a non creed statement by anticreed types tends
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to go creed after you put enough blood and treasure and tears into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.  So if it is a non creed moral statement that people die to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defend then it ends up looking like a religious moral creed even if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the idea of a creed is against the non creed and most of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adherents moral code.  ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that's part of the reason why there's no way to put the &quot;genie&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> of overplanning back in the bottle.  Once we start talking about
</I>&gt;<i> overplans, they become inescapable.  We can employ this &quot;magical&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> technique in any forum, any time we like.
