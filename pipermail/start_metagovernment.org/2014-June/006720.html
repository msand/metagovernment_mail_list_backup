<PRE>I would like to invite everyone, once the Vilfredo decisional process, that
I like very much, is completed, to start a new proposal in Airesis and test
properly the platform.
With Real Participation!
I do believe that for building the text of a home page, the Airesis
platform may actually works better. I will be not starting it because my
english is not good enough and I am not the most indicated person to do it,
but I think that everyone will be impressed by the flexibility of the
system. I will participate with my creativity...
Best Regards
Jacopo Tolja

PS as it may result in the proposal of different texts for each potential
page that may be proposed in that case, will be selected automatically the
Schulze method.

If we can work at a single text collaboratively than will be only use the
majority  method.
