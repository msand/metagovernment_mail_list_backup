<PRE>Hi Pietro (and Everyone),
My apologies for not responding to your earlier offer. I got caught up in the flurry of my own proposal to use Loomio which I&#8217;m very happy to drop at this point given the resistance it has encountered. I'm signed up now on Vilfredo and am excited to try it out. Thanks for the reminder. 
In your earlier e-mail you said:
&gt;<i> For example we could use it now to decide the homepage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this way, one week to propose what should be written,
</I>&gt;<i> one week to vote.
</I>&gt;<i> If we reach consensus we write what is in the consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> If we do not reach consensus, we give the alternative versions, of all the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals in the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime, in the background we keep on running Vilfredo as a slow
</I>&gt;<i> buring, while trying to find a consensus.
</I>I&#8217;m not sure how to proceed at this point. There is currently some question about how we make decisions effecting this community. Should we table the homepage proposal/discussion and go straight to the decision rule? (It seems that we are likely to wind up there at some point anyway.) Or should we tackle something perhaps a little easier (like the homepage)?
What do y&#8217;all think?
