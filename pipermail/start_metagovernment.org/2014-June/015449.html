<PRE>Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> While we are clarifying with Michael Allen, Vilfredo is going on.
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately Vilfredo cannot really be stopped. At maximum Ned can wait
</I>&gt;<i> for the maximum time (2 days instead of 1) to move on the question.
</I>
I never asked you to stop Vilfredo, Pietro.  I asked you and Ned to
stop blocking the Metagov decision process *outside of Vilfredo*.

&gt;<i> So my suggestion is that we keep on working with Vilfredo and use
</I>&gt;<i> this as a case study. A tutorial. Then maybe we run an official
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to see if there is a wide enough majority to implement the
</I>&gt;<i> result on the homepage.
</I>
I thought that was the original plan till I learned you and Ned wanted
to block the usual decision process and force a Vilfredo decision on
the group, giving non-users of Vilfredo *no say* in the content of the
home page.

&gt;<i> The alternative seem to me would be not to use it anymore for this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, but this would throw away all the work done.
</I>
Nobody ever suggested trashing it, Pietro.  It's you and Ned who've
done the trashing.  You down-voted a proposal just because it was made
outside of Vilfredo, and then called me a &quot;cheat&quot; for making it.

Please remove your blocking votes from proposal 3.  You don't disagree
with it, you're just trying to force us to use Vilfredo.  (No need to
apologize for the insults, I'll get over it.)

Mike
