&gt;<i> Hi, Scott. I won't answer you inline because you are repeating yourself: I have already answered all of your questions and you are ignoring my answers.

Not intentionally.  I just don't see them as &quot;answers&quot;...

&gt;<i> I have answered you as to how a government can be replaced: by making the old one irrelevant. I also invited you to make this group irrelevant. But you cannot assert a minority decision-rule on a community that has never used that and which does not generally accept that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
OK, so this is part of an answer: Your position is that no revolution
is possible even if the majority of the population want it if the OLD
decision rule requires a supermajority (or even unanimity) because
that is what what would be required to make it &quot;irrelevant&quot;.   Too bad
for us: That means to implement a direct democracy we have to go
through every state legislature and have them vote themselves out of a
job...

&gt;<i> Deciding what's on our home page is NOT a minor decision: it is a defining moment of this community. Michael has brought us to a point where we must examine who we are and how we present ourselves to the world. Coming up with a fast-but-wrong answer to this question would be the worst possible outcome. Just like most minority decisions. They get the job done... but they do it wrong. What value is that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm going to take issue with the expression &quot;minority decision&quot;.  For
example, the *majority* of active participants in this group voted
*for* using Loomio and *for* my new decision rule.  And you now claim
that because the old rule required some other stuff, that these
*MAJORITY* opinions can simply be disregarded.  Right?

And again, an imperfect decision is better than no decision.  At least
with an imperfect decision you've got something in place while you go
back and do it again better.  With no decision, you've got a blank
Home page...

&gt;<i> If instead we accept your premise that the decision-rule can be changed in the same moment that it is proposed, then remember that I proposed a one-vote-rule which makes me absolute dictator of this group: whatever I say goes. So if your claim is valid, then so is mine and I thus revert us back to our original decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is silly: The Loomio votes took a full week.  If you can announce
a vote on this list and then don't get anyone to respond but yourself
in a week, more power to you.  Otherwise, you're being a dictator who
is *imposing* your preferences on the rest of us.  In which case I'd
recommend you step back from this issue (i.e., it was you who
sabotaged the Loomio process, so the onus is therefore on you to
either resurrect it or see to it that some other process (perhaps
Vilfredo, but I'm kind of doubting it) finishes the job).

&gt;<i> And thus again, I demonstrate the failure of fast-but-wrong decisions. I would much rather that we take our time and come up with a great homepage than that we put up some junk that doesn't represent the community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I've no problem with the time frame per se, but it's been 2 weeks now
and I don't see us coming any closer to any decisions.  We have the
raw material for someone to make a specific comprehensive proposal,
but no one has done even that...
  Regards,
    Scott
