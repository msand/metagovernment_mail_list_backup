<PRE>Dear all,

I am looking at people voting in Vilfredo, and I see many people who voted
against a proposal because &quot;another is better&quot; or &quot;I prefer this other
one&quot;, and so on.

Please, a gentle reminder that Vilfredo works if (and only if ! ) everybody
votes for everything that is acceptable to them.Then through some
iterations we find a proposal that is &quot;acceptable&quot; to everybody.

In the next version of Vilfredo we ask people to evaluate proposals in a
continuous scale, so this problem will hopefully go away.

Oh, something else. Unfortunately the php version of Vilfredo in which the
comments are detached from the voting, is not happening. We thought it was
just a small debugging, but it turned out we needed to rewrite a big part
of javascript and ajax. And considering we are abandoning the php version
anyway, it is really not worth.

As such we decided to just move on with the next python version which have
the comments separated from voting, and divided between pro, against,
questions, already in place.

Cheers,
Pietro
