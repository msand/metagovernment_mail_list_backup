I see you're not one of them, but there are 10 people in the Metagov
group on Loomio, all of whom came from this list, and 9 of whom voted
on the new decision rule.  This is more than the number who voted on
the old 80% rule (that one was only 6 IIRC).  So, it looks to me like
you've joining Ed in being wrong, democratically speaking ;-)

Perhaps you will be braver than he and address the issue of the
&quot;election&quot; of Hitler as dictator, or the question about how the US (or
any country) gets from its current system to a direct democracy.  Do
the people have to follow the rules of their current government to
replace it, or can it be done with a simple majority vote?

    Scott
