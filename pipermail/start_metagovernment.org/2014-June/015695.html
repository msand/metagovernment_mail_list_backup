&gt;<i> ... I think, whats wrong with the overplan approach is the same

</I>
(We cover this in another post, Alex, and I think you now see that I
mean a cyclic process.)

&gt;<i> 2. For what to put on the metagovernment.org website, ...we blanked
</I>&gt;<i> it and now try to collaboratively make up the content.  What about
</I>&gt;<i> those &quot;overplan process&quot;, what about u suggest one element of the
</I>&gt;<i> process and then the next and we find out what this process should
</I>&gt;<i> look like through discussing it instead of you doing upfront
</I>&gt;<i> everything :-)
</I>
An overplan isn't like the home page, though.  To explain: there's no
need for anyone to agree with it up front, except the people who are
actually executing it.  That big overplan you're thinking of (NxRO)
took two people at times and seven years to design, and the theory
behind it dates back to 1988 in parts.  It's too much for this thread.

This thread is really only about a simple, abstract overplan that has
just four steps: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>

&gt;<i> Because you have thought about it already, you probably could easily
</I>&gt;<i> explain all the phases and why they are necessary or what would
</I>&gt;<i> happen if we for example would drop &quot;Underplanning&quot; and would
</I>&gt;<i> directly jump to phase 3?
</I>
Here I think I can explain to folks why these four steps are needed.
That's really all I've been hoping to do in *this* thread, lately.

Here's my explanation: given that an overplan is &quot;a comprehensive plan
for the future of humanity&quot;, there is no reasonable way to proceed
into that future other than by following these steps:

   CoP    (CoP) Compare the overplans
    |
   SoP    (SoP) Select the best overplan
    |
   ToP    (ToP) Track discussion of the overplan
    |
   XoP    (XoP) Execute the overplan
    .                               
    .

So, for any rational person who's stuck and feels confused about to do
in order to help humanity along (which I think means nearly everyone),
then it's because he's *not* following these steps.  (So I claim.)
Because if he *were* following them, then he'd always know *exactly*
what to do: he'd follow them until he got stuck, then he'd cycle back.

If these claims are correct, then we could press the argument more
widely and &quot;force&quot; humanity onto a utopian track.  Reason has that
power over people *in general* (at least in modern societies, where
free speech is respected) that it cannot be resisted.  So there's
endless possibilities, and lots of depth, in just these four steps.

Mike
