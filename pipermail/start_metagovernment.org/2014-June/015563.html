<PRE>Hi Bentley,
why didn't you vote in the last generation? We missed you :-).

Your proposal with no abstract was number 2660. Let's make a bit of
analysis on this. In the previous email, yesterday I explained how to
access the history page and the generation page. I will be using those
pages:

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164</A>
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1</A>
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2</A>
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=3">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=3</A>

On the histoy page we can find the proposals you wrote. The one without
abstract is 2660. It was presented in the second generation, but did not
make it into the third generation.
So let's go to the second generation page to understand better (we could
actually do a lot more in the history, but the generation page is more
clear)

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2</A>

2660 was supported on generation 2 by you, Ned and Reid.

I don't think it was voted against because it had no abstract. In fact we
can see the comments that it did generate, by slicking on &quot;repropose or
mutate&quot; button.

which leads us to:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/npv.php?p=2660&amp;submit=Repropose+or+Mutate">http://vilfredo.org/npv.php?p=2660&amp;submit=Repropose+or+Mutate</A>

The comments it got were:

&gt;<i>This language is too negative. We should excite people about what we're
</I>doing, not complain about how bad things are.
(by 2 users)

The Vilfredo group (Ned, Pietro, Bentley) is blocking Metagov's normal
decision process (proposal 3). They want to force everyone to use Vilfredo
instead, leaving non-users without a say in the home page. Please ask them
to stop blocking our process. Until they do, we will block theirs.
by 1 user (we know this is Mike as he has said he will do this in the
mailing list)

And two other user wrote: &quot;same&quot; and &quot;nope&quot;. I suspect Same means that he
agrees with the excite comment. No one said anything about the abstract.

As this was voted by you Ned and Reid. But then all three of you voted also
for: 2659 2666 2669 2670 2672 2673 2674 2675 2676 2677 2678 2679. And in
each of those proposal there were other people who voted for them too. So
2660 was dominated by them. Eventually all those proposal were dominated by
proposals 2677, 2678 and 2679. Which made it to the next generation.

You can see the graph of domination in the page of the proposal:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2660">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2660</A>

Again Vilfredo asks you to support everything which is acceptable. But if
you are upset by what is in the Pareto Front, then you should revote before
the end of the generation to make sure the Pareto Front is more similar to
your wishes.  This is how you submit include inside Vilfredo the little
differences like: &quot;I like both those proposals, but this one I like more so
if this is not included I am not going to be happy&quot;.

As I said in the previous email, this does not work if people try to
exaggerate their influence, but I know this is not a risk with you. :-)

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Now it's the next generation and my mutation is gone from the choices.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That makes no sense.  Why would anyone vote for the disfigured version
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and downvote the corrected version?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Pietro said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; And yes, now we have only 2 versions in the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One of them is disfigured, which is clearly unfair.  It might get
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; eliminated for no other reason.  I'll try again to prevent that by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; re-mutating it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I wish my input wasn't removed like this.  I know you don't intend it,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; but it's a form of suppression.  I'm stating my preference.  Maybe it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; doesn't get on the Pareto front, but that doesn't mean it's worthless
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and can be thrown away.  It's still my preference till someone changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; my mind.
