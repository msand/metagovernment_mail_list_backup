<PRE>Hi Bentley,
if you are a simple participant (not the person who started the question)
Vilfredo will contact you in the following situations (I hope I remember
well :-) ):

1) someone started a question and have invited you. People can only invite
you if you have worked in a room together before, so if you just joined
this will not happen.

2) you are participating in a question and the question moved from one
phase to the other (hasn't happened yet). That is, from writing to voting.
&gt;<i>From voting to writing, or from voting to consensus found.
</I>
3) you just moved to the writing phase from a voting and you are a &quot;key
person&quot;. In which case Vilfredo will specifically ask you to rewrite a
specific proposal. (more about it as soon as it happens)

There are other situations where Vilfredo will comunicate to you, but
mostly through the website. I have not implemented yet all the messages
Vilfredo should tell the users because I am scared to make them feel
Vilfredo might be spamming them (I might have coded a couple extra, like
when you write a proposal and people ask a question about it).

As we are moving from Vilfredo to Vilfredo 2.0 which is changing the core
algorithm inside, we are also not putting any effort in designing the
communication protocol better, as the situations where Vilfredo will need
to communicate with the participants will change.

So for now,  just wait. As soon as Ned moves the question on, you should
receive an email.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Steve, hi All.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It looks like Ned has started a question on Vilfredo for the homepage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The question is here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As you never participated in a question before, it is possible that you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might not have received the invitation. Also please (THIS FOR ALL) consider
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checking in your spam filter to make sure that any email from Vilfredo does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not go there. Vilfredo relies on those emails to tell you all what is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next step, so it is important that your email service provider does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> catalog them as Spam.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo explains step by step what you are supposed to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generally in Vilfredo we have a writing phase and a voting phase,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> followed by another writing phase, and another voting phase... and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (In the next version of Vilfredo we might have found a way to have only one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phase, with great happiness of some of the older members who have asked it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about 4 years ago. Sorry I needed to clarify the math). The person who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started it decides how long each phase lasts (also this is non democratic,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know). Ned has chosen that each phase will take a minimum of 24 hours and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a maximum of 48 hours. This means that he will not be allowed to move on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the question before the first day. But after 2 days the question will move
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on automatically if he still has not done it (and if there are at least 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals/2 voters).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if you think you know how Vilfredo works, you should pay attention
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as there are many changes that have been made (and even more we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> planning and testing and designing right now). Differences respect to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> previous versions: now you can say if you do not understand a proposal. Now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if a proposal cannot be deleted because of you (and only of you) you will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get alerted, and a request to consider changing your mind. And we have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nice video explaining how graph work, and what is represented there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very happy people are using Vilfredo again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please let me know how I can be of help.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
