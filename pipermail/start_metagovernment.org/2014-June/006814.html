<PRE>I still like 2712 well enough but from a logical positivism view I believe
it to be nonsense. Most things are from that view.  But words like quality
are pretty much feel good stuff as opposed to a basis to write
requirements.

Here we can start to look at some new elements.

Here is something from OpenBSD Theo:

It is easier to develop a pattern/meme when the choice is simple to
remember.  If the decision tree is too complex, people simply walk
away.

Paraphrasing Cosmologist David Deutsch:

Love is not the answer.  When we find the answer it will be so simple and
obvious that everyone will say &quot;oh, yes.  How could it be otherwise?&quot;

I pull some of my phrasing like &quot;democratic process&quot; out of a non creed
creed and I looked at the history there and at some related activities
around consensus.

I have an interest in integrating rational and non rational into public
policy debates.  The research and the history lessons are important.  Here
is what I take away.

It takes 20 years.
Avoid pushing just because you get to win.
It often involves a complete refocus.
Afterwards you still are likely to get a civil war.

But if you could offer the hope that this actually reliably worked a lot of
people would say let's skip the civil war.

There is some money floating around to do this sort of thing.  But I do not
see getting from the mission statement to the grants I have in mind via how
we are doing things.

What comes to mind is not projects but APIs. Alas the commercialization of
APIs  is after my time and where I did this the focus was much different
than these days.

Anyone here have expertise in this high end design field?
