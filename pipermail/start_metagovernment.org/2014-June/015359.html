<PRE>This post strikes me as just a bit naive: There are lots of
prototyping and rapid application development systems out there, and
lots of more conventional development systems that provide most or all
of your list in their sample/tutorial application.  The problem is
getting from that rough system to something actually ready for people
to use.  Rails is a good example as it absolutely exemplifies the old
saw about &quot;The first 90% of the functionality takes 10% of the
development time, the last 10% takes the other 90%&quot;.  There *are*
systems that are a little more linear including some of those based on
Python, but IMHO (having run a startup in that market for 12 years)
they all pretty much suck compared to what is really required for a
single developer or small group to develop and deploy an application
in a reasonable period of time.

After reviewing all the options, I'm convinced that the evolution of
the product that I developed (<A HREF="http://livecode.com/">http://livecode.com/</A>) is still the
closest thing to that ideal in the market today, and what I've been
using for the prototype system I've been working on.  Unfortunately my
time has been pretty divided of late (I started up a similar
&quot;disruptive&quot; proposal discussion on the constructed language mailing
list a couple weeks ago and have been devoting a lot of time to that
(and brushing up on my linguistics) since then).  If you want to play
around some recommend you try LiveCode: It's free and open source
(they charge for developers who want to deploy a closed-source app),
and we'll have something better than Loomio up within weeks (or at
least within weeks of when I resume working on that part of my project
again ;-)  Even if you don't get very far on your own, you'll be in a
better position to be able to modify the app that I'm working on later
on when it actually starts doing something useful and I'm able to
release it to alpha test.
  Regards,
     Scott
