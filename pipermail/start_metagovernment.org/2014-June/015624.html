<PRE>A good description of the issues, but it doesn't mention another
possible solution: Simply omit the &quot;inspiration&quot; from the recording of
the law/rule.  When we try to include these justifications in the
rules themselves it makes the process of creating them vastly more
complicated, Exhibit A being this MG Home Page project, albeit that
being almost exclusively &quot;inspiration&quot; with very little in the way of
actual &quot;rules&quot;.  Another example is the second amendment of the US
constitution, that pesky &quot;a well-regulated militia&quot; clause which
renders the rule subject to interpretation, and is a design flaw
(i.e., that justification should have either been part of the rule
(e.g., &quot;if you serve in the militia you have the right to keep arms&quot;),
or simply omitted).

This allows (actually requires) that the justifications be recorded
*separately* from the rules themselves, and everyone can have their
own set of these.  They'll surely trot their preferred set out when it
comes time to debate changing the rule at some point in the future,
but because the justification is not part of the rule itself in the
end people will vote on the inherent merit of the rule rather than
confounding that with requiring agreement on the justification for the
rule.

There are two side effects of this design:
1) Because the rule-enforcers (i.e., judges) won't have this
additional information to guide their own interpretations, the rules
themselves need to be more explicit.  This is a good thing, since that
way rule enforcement is far more likely to comply with the wishes of
the the rule-makers rather than the whims of whatever judge happens to
be hearing a case.

2) This also implies a civil law vs a common law system (as is used in
the US and Commonwealth countries).  I go into more detail on this
issue and why civil law is an inherently better system than common law
in my book, but to summarize see my point #1: If a decision hinges on
precedent or a judges interpretation of the *intent* of the
rule-makers, it is far more likely that corruption or other
undesirable factors will unduly influence the ultimate decision.

</I>&gt;<i> On the post script the joining I believe got better than 90% agreement.
