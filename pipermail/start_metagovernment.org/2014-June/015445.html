I like where you are going with this Pietro. (+1) My apologies though for being confused about what system we would use to vote in (or not) the results we reach on Vilfredo. It seems to me we'll need to clear that up before we move on to a vote. 

This isn&#8217;t meant as a challenge. I&#8217;m just not sure I fully understand the existing rule. (I may need a tutorial for that as well :-)   

In the meantime I personally would really like to continue with what we are doing in Vilfredo&#8230;..if for no other reason than to learn how to use it. 

A suggestion: Let&#8217;s slow down for a minute. I don&#8217;t mind conflict as I think it can be juicy and even productive at times. I do though get a little edgy when the flurry of email becomes so intense. I'm concerned the speed at which we&#8217;re moving may precipitate more reaction than response.
