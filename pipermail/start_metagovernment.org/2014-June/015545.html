Well, speaking for myself, I'll keep using Vilfredo for as long as
it's marginally useful for its purpose.  I wouldn't want to switch
unless I found something better.  Currently I'm doubtful there's
anything better.  But Vilfredo still needs work before the rest of the
world is likely to see its potential.  By using it whevenever it's
useful, I help to keep Pietro and Derek on their toes, and therefore
help (in a small way) to make something that really works.

The stack approach doesn't work well in my case, and doesn't feel
right.  My competitors (the engineers who design the tools on the
stack) generally aren't helping me by critiquing *my* designs, so why
should I help *them* by critiquing theirs?

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> Allow me to restate:   
</I>&gt;<i> I propose we have a stack of viable tools that we can test and utilize in order to: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Become more familiar with the available platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. To help debug (at the developers request).
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Offer constructive feedback on the overall design.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone on the list can add a tool to the stack. (they must include a brief description of the tool&#8217;s characteristics.)
</I>&gt;<i> When we finish with one tool, we vote whether to test/utilize the next one on the stack.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Or we just vote on which tool on stack to use/test next..?)   Not sure about this last piece.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The good news, of course, is that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we can be the first to make something that really works.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please say more&#8230;.
