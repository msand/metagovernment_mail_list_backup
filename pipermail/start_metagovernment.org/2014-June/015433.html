<PRE>Jo and Pietro,

Jo Owen said:
&gt;<i> Can you do me a favour and stop changing the e-mail subject line
</I>&gt;<i> when it's the same proposal? it breaks the flow in my email reader
</I>&gt;<i> and makes it appear a new thread.
</I>
Sure, Jo.  I'll keep the vote totals out from now on.


Pietro said:
&gt;<i> I made a proposal to use Vilfredo for the homepage. No one opposed
</I>&gt;<i> it. ...
</I>
Where?  I see no proposal to use Vilfredo exclusively and thus switch
us over to a unanimous decision process for the home page.
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Proposals</A>

&gt;<i> Sorry, but I feel you are trying to cheat us.  Not so much in having
</I>&gt;<i> your homepage, but in wanting the process your way.
</I>
My way?  Cheating?  This is the way we agreed, Pietro.  It's the same
decision process we always use here in Metagov.

&gt;<i> This decision, right now, is being taken using Vilfredo. ...
</I>
On who's authority?  Please make a proper proposal to this group and
then wait for it to pass.  We can't go changing our decision process
for this issue without an agreement.  That would be wrong.

Meantime, the current proposal stays open.  It's an honest proposal
made according to the rules.  And it's a good one.  Bentley's text is
better than anything we've seen in a long time.  You all liked it well
enough in Vilfredo, and now you down-vote it for narrow political
reasons.  But wouldn't it be better to have something decent on the
home page as a temporary measure?  While we continue to talk?

Let's give people in the list time to express their opinions.


   PROPOSAL 3
   ----------
   Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:

       OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

       Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
       re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
       choose between the lesser of a few evils.                      

       We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
       to use technology to work on these issues together when it is  
       convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having    
       society work together.

       Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
       and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
       governments and societies.                                     

   Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.


   CURRENT VOTES
   -------------                                                          
       For: Mike
   Against: Ned, Pietro


(Pietro wishes that I remove Bentley's vote till he speaks, so I do.)

Mike


Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> I made a proposal to use Vilfredo for the homepage. No one opposed it. The
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio proposal was dropped by the author, and Ed sayd how Vilfredo was so
</I>&gt;<i> much better than Loomio (surprising me). As we were discussing it (Steve
</I>&gt;<i> asking how to proceed) Ned started the question. We all rushed there, and
</I>&gt;<i> started using it. This is as much as a voting to reach a consensus over the
</I>&gt;<i> home page, as it is a tutorial moment (both Steve and Bentley wanting to
</I>&gt;<i> try Vilfredo out and you recognising that &quot;Vilfredo has improved
</I>&gt;<i> considerably since I last used it.&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As Steve wanted to use this more, and Bentley was trying to get his head
</I>&gt;<i> around the, not simple, concepts of Vilfredo you just took a snippet out of
</I>&gt;<i> it, and wrote a proposal. Somehow everything else we did is not valid. My
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is not valid. The process we are going through is not valid. And
</I>&gt;<i> the only thing that seem to be valid are proposal written in your specific
</I>&gt;<i> way, by you, who also arrogate to you the right to decide for people who
</I>&gt;<i> have not voted, how you expect them to vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, but I feel you are trying to cheat us. Not so much in having your
</I>&gt;<i> homepage, but in wanting the process your way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a time when Vilfredo was at the center of Metagovernment. So much
</I>&gt;<i> that I was writing most of the posts, and the list was quite silent. As I
</I>&gt;<i> did not want that I went silent, so other project could raise and share the
</I>&gt;<i> space. I do not want Vilfredo to be the only project, but I also do not
</I>&gt;<i> want Vilfredo to be so much in the periphery that new members do not even
</I>&gt;<i> know that is there.
</I>&gt;<i> You think Vilfredo is good as a &quot;brainstorming tool&quot;. I disagree, Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> is much more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This decision, right now, is being taken using Vilfredo. Or at least Ned is
</I>&gt;<i> asking it, and I am helping along, hoping to show how far can Vilfredo go.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course if you do not play along we cannot have a full consensus. And not
</I>&gt;<i> always appear a consensus. But the aim of Vilfredo is not just to reach
</I>&gt;<i> consensus but to expose the hidden polarity so that after you can vote on
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please, have patience, and if you cannot please at least do not vote for
</I>&gt;<i> other people.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
