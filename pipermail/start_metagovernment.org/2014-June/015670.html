<PRE>Thanks Alex, these suggestions are very helpful.

&gt;<i> Why is all this what you are write (the steps/phases in the given
</I>&gt;<i> order) necessary? It looks like a lot of complexity.
</I>
Yes, it's definitely complex.  But it's built up from several layers.
Just now I wrote up the base layer as a separate draft, keeping your
critique in mind.  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/SoP</A>

   CoP    (CoP) Compare the overplans
    |
   SoP    (SoP) Select the best overplan
    |
   ToP    (ToP) Track discussion of the overplan
    |
   XoP    (XoP) Execute the overplan
    .
    .

This is a kind of overplan too (an abstract one), but much simpler.
So let's re-apply your critique *here* first of all:

&gt;<i> What particular problems do they solved?  How are these problems
</I>&gt;<i> currently, without that &quot;new process&quot; solved?  Why is the above
</I>&gt;<i> approach better ...?
</I>
I agree that's important to explain.  Probably we should explain it
right at the top of each overplan.  So here's the top of this one:

   This abstract overplan tells how to do selective overplanning.  An
   overplan is a comprehensive plan for the future of humanity.
   Today, most of us know little or nothing about overplans.  We're
   almost completely in the dark about the possibilities for the
   future, and therefore unable to make much of a contribution.  Even
   if you already know of an overplan or two, it would make no sense
   to execute a particular one unless you were reasonably confident of
   executing the best one.  The following steps are designed to make
   sure of that.

&gt;<i> ... who executes...? is it one person? all the people?  how exactly?
</I>
I think all overplans must be for the reader to execute.  There'll
usually be steps that require cooperation from others, but the reader
should be able to secure that by following the steps of the overplan.
Rather than say this outright, however, I'm trying (a little harder
now) to make it obvious from the wording of the overplan.

So what do you think of this base layer, as far as it goes?  Is it
good enough, or does it still need improving?

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> you make ur vocabulary up. it sounds interesting, but it doesnt say
</I>&gt;<i> anything at all to those who do not know how all what you are saying fits
</I>&gt;<i> together or what each of these steps in particular mean.
</I>&gt;<i> I think if you take time to make some kind of &quot;Glossary&quot; that makes a small
</I>&gt;<i> summary for each of those &quot;steps&quot; in words that &quot;explain it to a five year
</I>&gt;<i> old&quot;, and set them into relation, thus, making a second &quot;glossary&quot; in which
</I>&gt;<i> phases or steps are contrasted against each other, that would help a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, such an aproach can not replace a more formal definition, but i
</I>&gt;<i> think or at least i hope, this would help people to get a grasp on which
</I>&gt;<i> mind set to apply when reading what you are writing. With what of the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;known words/things&quot; to compare those what you are writing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why is all this what you are write (the steps/phases in the given order)
</I>&gt;<i> necessary? It looks like a lot of complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What particular problems do they solved? How are these problems currently,
</I>&gt;<i> without that &quot;new process&quot; solved? Why is the above approach better and who
</I>&gt;<i> executes that approach? is it one person? all the people? how exactly? ...
</I>&gt;<i> [if you do not take the time to educate people about what all those things
</I>&gt;<i> are about, then its very hard to follow and thus agree]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is it not possible to &quot;make it simple&quot; and if so, then why not? Education
</I>&gt;<i> of people should be one of your top most priorities if you want people to
</I>&gt;<i> join those ideas. maybe this is not necessary because it happens anyway,
</I>&gt;<i> but then you can also make less effort to communicate it. If its necessary,
</I>&gt;<i> that more and more people understand, then you should try to make some kind
</I>&gt;<i> of workshop or series of workshops (maybe videos/exercises/.... look @
</I>&gt;<i> coursera.org or similar platforms)
</I>&gt;<i> It needs education, and a lot thereof, especially amongst programmers and
</I>&gt;<i> other tech folks, because whatever you try to communicate, it sounds at
</I>&gt;<i> least as if it needs a lot of people to join forces :-)
</I>
