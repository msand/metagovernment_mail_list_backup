<PRE>Hello everybody. So Ned have moved the system to the next generation.

You can see the result of this generation here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=5">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=5</A>

This page will open also if you are not logged in.

This time Ned and Michael are key players. And should probably write their
own version of the proposal they did not like trying to use the information
from the comments.

On the other side I want to clarify one thing, we are going near the point
where people are and will start to get tired with the question. We have
made a lot of progress respect to the first generation, and if you look at
the table (on the right side of the page linked) you can see how proposals
slowly changed and slowly got more integrated and more similar.

Vilfredo does not always reach a consensus. Sometimes (in fact most of the
time), it just reaches a very clear, unsolvable, polarity. Or a three poles
polarity (does that have a specific name?).

At that point it makes sense to vote among the options.

Vilfredo 2.0 will basically let people move on as long as there are new
ideas, and new proposals being inserted. But as soon as the threashold of
time is reached and no new proposal has been written, the system will
assume that the community creativity on that topic has exhausted. Now in
that version people will vote on a sliding scale, so Vilfredo will have
enough information to directly extract a complete list of all the
proposals, thus giving a clear winner.

If we do not reach a consensus on the next proposal I will suggest to just
pick whatever are the proposal in the Pareto front and Vote with Majority
Judgment on them.

Majority Judgment works by letting everybody express what they think of
each proposal on 5 adjectives:
Terrible, Weak, so-so, good, Brilliant.
Then it extracts the mediane of the votes for each proposal and uses that
as the result.

Using the mediane instead of the average (like you do in range voting)
makes the system robust against strategic voting (where people do not vote
what they honestly think to manipulate the result).

Also there is a theorem that states that the mediane on a (single peak) 1d
evaluation, is the condorcet winner of the various options. In other words
more people will prefer that value respect to any other.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In hindsight, when Pietro suggested that we try to reduce the size of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pareto Front, I see that he put me into a &quot;be more selective&quot; mindset. That
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then led me to think this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    If you are going to be proposing a new version of an existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    proposal in the next generation, it would be appropriate to vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    against the existing version (since you no longer prefer it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    compared to your new version). If that removes the existing version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    from the Pareto Front, so much the better, since the old version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    will not then show up in the next generation to compete against your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    new version. (I am trusting Pietro to correct me if I am wrong,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    again ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro then did correct me:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Maybe Ned.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Vilfredo works by asking everybody to accept everything as long as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    it is slightly acceptable. It will never reach a consensus if people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    all only accept their best and only. Basically the idea is: if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    everybody is as open as they can be (but not more) then a consensus
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    can be found.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Notice in this how the comments are becoming more precise. Before we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    would vote down something for big things. Now a wrong word can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    enough to strike down a proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    I wonder how Vilfredo would vote if we require people to vote up at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    least n proposals. With n that is 1 at the first generation. 2 at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    the second generation, ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    If you strike down a proposal because you want to rewrite it, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    are being very selective. Also in theory people should use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    proposals in the Pareto Front as guidelines. So everybody knows what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    are the ingredients, and the Pareto Front represents the Community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    So personally I would try to get the proposal I want to rewrite in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    the Pareto Front, and then rewrite it. If not someone could just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    vote down my proposal because it is a rewrite of something we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    already decided as a community to vote against.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    I think we should accept that minor correction, like small grammar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    correction can be done after a consensus is found.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    In fact, as I explained here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple-point-of-views/
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    it would be interesting to integrate Vilfredo with a wiki. So you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    use the normal wiki procedures in general. And Vilfredo when a flame
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    war raises.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am beginning to appreciate that in Vilfredo, a vote does not mean what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it means in an ordinary count-votes system. (Steve in an earlier email
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mentioned that he saw only 1 proposal in the final Pareto Front of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Generation 4, when in fact there are 5. I suspect that he was noticing that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2712 had more votes than the others, and took that to mean that it was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore the single winner.)
