<PRE>Mike,
I made a proposal to use Vilfredo for the homepage. No one opposed it. The
Loomio proposal was dropped by the author, and Ed sayd how Vilfredo was so
much better than Loomio (surprising me). As we were discussing it (Steve
asking how to proceed) Ned started the question. We all rushed there, and
started using it. This is as much as a voting to reach a consensus over the
home page, as it is a tutorial moment (both Steve and Bentley wanting to
try Vilfredo out and you recognising that &quot;Vilfredo has improved
considerably since I last used it.&quot;.

As Steve wanted to use this more, and Bentley was trying to get his head
around the, not simple, concepts of Vilfredo you just took a snippet out of
it, and wrote a proposal. Somehow everything else we did is not valid. My
proposal is not valid. The process we are going through is not valid. And
the only thing that seem to be valid are proposal written in your specific
way, by you, who also arrogate to you the right to decide for people who
have not voted, how you expect them to vote.

Sorry, but I feel you are trying to cheat us. Not so much in having your
homepage, but in wanting the process your way.

There was a time when Vilfredo was at the center of Metagovernment. So much
that I was writing most of the posts, and the list was quite silent. As I
did not want that I went silent, so other project could raise and share the
space. I do not want Vilfredo to be the only project, but I also do not
want Vilfredo to be so much in the periphery that new members do not even
know that is there.
You think Vilfredo is good as a &quot;brainstorming tool&quot;. I disagree, Vilfredo
is much more.

This decision, right now, is being taken using Vilfredo. Or at least Ned is
asking it, and I am helping along, hoping to show how far can Vilfredo go.
Of course if you do not play along we cannot have a full consensus. And not
always appear a consensus. But the aim of Vilfredo is not just to reach
consensus but to expose the hidden polarity so that after you can vote on
them.

Please, have patience, and if you cannot please at least do not vote for
other people.

Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>    PROPOSAL 3
</I>&gt;<i>    ----------
</I>&gt;<i>    Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
</I>&gt;<i>        re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
</I>&gt;<i>        choose between the lesser of a few evils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
</I>&gt;<i>        to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
</I>&gt;<i>        convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
</I>&gt;<i>        society work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
</I>&gt;<i>        and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
</I>&gt;<i>        governments and societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
