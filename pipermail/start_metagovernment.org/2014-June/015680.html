<PRE>Max said:
&gt;<i> Different people, different overplans.  A reasonable way to proceed
</I>&gt;<i> into the future is to $X it into existence.  Is that not always how
</I>&gt;<i> it works underneath the axioms?
</I>
Yes, roughly speaking.  The future is the product of a top-level
program that we run.  I agree.

An &quot;overplan&quot; is a top-level program, then.  I guess &quot;over-program&quot;
(or &quot;over-macro&quot;) would be more correct.  But &quot;overplan&quot; sounds
better.  Maybe it's good enough.

&gt;<i> This $X in some places is a convention for a macro that gets
</I>&gt;<i> instantiated.  I ran across this in the form $DEITY and liked it.
</I>
Then someone ran $modernity and $deity became a meaningless lifestyle
choice, no longer a viable overplan at all.  But $deity was just one
variation on $immortality.  I'll open a separate thread on a different
variation called &quot;eliminating existential risk&quot;.  That one runs in the
context of modernity.  I claim there's no sane alternative to running
it, and we'll see if anyone can refute that claim.

Mike
