<PRE>One of the things that is missing in Vilfredo is the possibility to make a
diff between proposals. The problem is I do not know how to make a diff
between text &quot;Rich text&quot;. Text that is in italic, in bold, with links and
so on. The tools I found work mostly on pure text (and code).

This means: (1) if anyone has a tool they want to suggest that solves this
problem we will test it and integrate it if it works.
(2) I did see two proposals very similar but I could not see ANY
difference, so I thought it was just someone reproposing the same text
again. Since of the two proposal equal proposal one had the comments
included of the previous generation, I preferred to vote on that.

Unfortunately if your change is very small, you should do something to
clarify what it is. Maybe something in Italic or in the abstract explaining
it.

Well, Mike, Vilfredo works in a way that at least one of the proposal that
you have voted will be in the Pareto Front. You did vote, so there is one
of your proposal there. If that did not satisfy you, why did you vote for
it?

You can, of course, keep on submitting the same proposal that was voted
down by the community. But generally this is (I am sorry) a recipe for
failure. We are all trying to collaborate in doing something that we all
like, or at least all find acceptable. My proposals were eliminated too, as
well as all the proposal that integrated a specific idea that I thought was
very important. If you really like that proposal you should mutate it, but
as you do this, look at all the comments the proposal received, and try to
use them to improve your proposal. This way it will have a better chance of
getting accepted.

A better way would be to try to change the proposal that did pass,
introducing in them some of the elements that are so dear to your heart.

But please, do not try to impose your will on the whole community. This has
nothing to do with Vilfredo. You do not need Vilfredo to understand that no
cooperation inside a community is possible if some members are set in not
accepting anything unless their own will.

In Vilfredo what you risk is that Vilfredo members might all reach a
consensus over a proposal, except a single person who is only voting for
their own proposal. If this happens for many generations, there is a point
after which the community might decide to just go forward with the partial
consensus, and ignore the dissident member.

Even more so in a situation in which the proposals are moved on this list
to be proposed and voted in a yes/no way.
