if my questions will not have positive answers, then these are in fact the
downsides of loomio.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Email and Wiki do not have a &quot;Lock In&quot; effect, because the wiki is open and
the data can be used elsewhere.
The Email List ist archived and it is a standard format, so no problem here.

The Pirate Party in Germany has a system called: &quot;Sync Forum&quot;, which
synchronizes their mailinglists with a forum.
People can either use the forum or the mailinglist and the content is
mirrored to the other medium automatically.

What we might need is a plattform that has an IMPORT feature, which accepts
&quot;discussions&quot; or &quot;profiles&quot; or whatever other data items we might have.
Once that is done, everything cna be discussed in that new tool instead of
the old. Ideally, its still SYNCHRONIZED with the old tool, so that those
people, which do not transition to the new tool are NOT EXCLUDED from the
discussion.

The &quot;AG Meinungsfindungstool&quot; of the german pirate party is working on some
kind of ontology to make that happen, but i do not know whether their
approach is the right one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (which is not even a participant in our group),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does it really matter whether *they* are a participant in *our* group.
</I>&gt;<i> Their group is open to everyone&#8230;.as is ours. We are all in this together.
</I>&gt;<i> Lot&#8217;s of room for cross pollination I would say.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> but to experiment, try out different platforms, explore flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio has a great-looking interface, but it is rigid and inflexible in
</I>&gt;<i> some of its underpinnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe they would wholeheartedly agree with you. They are just getting
</I>&gt;<i> started&#8230;.you of all people should know these things take time. If there is
</I>&gt;<i> any inflexibility on this issue, I would say it has found a very
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable home on this list.    ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I know that those things take time. And i've seen hundreds or more
approaches of tools that try to somehow solve all kinds or problems when it
comes to groups or communities and their problems that should be solved
through discussion and some form of democracy...

Whenever there is a new tool, if it would adhere to certain &quot;standards&quot; or
bring up such standards in regards to:
1. protocols (technically)
2. API's (to import/export all data + remote control their tool)
3. data formats
4. open source client, which allows hosting of their software on &quot;my own
hardware&quot; but connection to their existing network

... then it would be relatively easy, to create a tool, that complies with
those &quot;standards&quot; and is thus compatible with it.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other platforms have strengths that it does not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And vice versa. Let&#8217;s try it out and help them to make *their* platform
</I>&gt;<i> better.  Really though, at some point we must examine the glaring irony of
</I>&gt;<i> a group that's all about designing systems for global democracy&#8230;.but is
</I>&gt;<i> mostly unwilling to consider collaborating with *another* group.  Aren&#8217;t we
</I>&gt;<i> all in this together?  It seems to me that the people on *our* [MG] list
</I>&gt;<i> would have a lot to offer *those* people developing Loomio.   The
</I>&gt;<i> resistance to doing so is highly suspect&#8230;.in my mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this group to know when a proposal is being presented, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> broadcast technology (i.e., this email list), not a destination where
</I>&gt;<i> people must check periodically. My primary objective is to give us some
</I>&gt;<i> uniformity so that the casual observer can tell when a new proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> presented, and when people are replying to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I get an email every time a new discussion thread begins in any Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> group I am a part of&#8230;.or when a proposal has been made&#8230;.or when a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> is about to close.  You would too if you signed up.  ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The wiki is not perfect, but we have to sacrifice some perfection for
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed (on the wiki not being perfect).  In my mind, being flexible would
</I>&gt;<i> look like being open to trying something new&#8230;..maybe even helping *them*
</I>&gt;<i> out a bit as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don&#8217;t get the resistance on this list to using Loomio for a while (or
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis, or Vilfredo, or Blinap, or whatever). Is it an ego thing (&#8220;my
</I>&gt;<i> system is different, better, or more uniquely special&#8221;), or a proprietary
</I>&gt;<i> thing (&#8220;I can&#8217;t make any money helping someone else with *their*
</I>&gt;<i> platform&#8221;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The planet is on it&#8217;s way to becoming a piece of toast. E democracy is
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps the only hope for creating the kind of culture that can turn that
</I>&gt;<i> around. E democracy is all about developing means of collaboration&#8230;.coming
</I>&gt;<i> up with solutions *together*. And we&#8217;re still talking about us and
</I>&gt;<i> them&#8230;.&#8221;ours&quot; and &#8220;theirs&#8221;.   I suppose one might find this humorous, if it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn&#8217;t so fucking perplexing.
