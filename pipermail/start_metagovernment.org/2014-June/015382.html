<PRE>Here I speak up for Votorola; give my opinion on digital democracy
(nothing ready to use yet); and back up Ed on the decision process.

</I>
(I let others speak for Vilfredo and SettleIt.)  The way Votorola
works for newcomers these days, which differs from what Steve was
exposed to, is you talk.  That's all.  There's nothing else you need
to do because formal users with experience will take care of the rest.
You can join them if you wish (by degrees, at your own pace), but you
never need to.  You never need to use any software or even know it
exists in order to participate.  We could already be introducing
Votorola to this group without anyone knowing.  All you'd notice at
first (if it worked) is an increase in the quality of the discussion.

Heavy-lifting designs like Votorola aren't available for general use.
They're experimental lab contraptions with wires sticking out.  If you
want to use them, then you must work on them, which means you must be
a heavy-lifter yourself.  There's no getting around this.  You can
search high and low, but anything easy enough to attract light users
is going to be useless.  Production software just hasn't been released
yet; if a viable project has even *formed* with that intention, then
its designs haven't been announced yet.  Otherwise I'd be breaking
down the doors to help in any way I could, or complaining bitterly
that they've rejected my offers.

I think anyone who follows the rushing crowd is going to be among the
last to arrive.  If you want to make a contribution, then I think you
have to work hard and take your chances.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; [snip] We have a new decision rule, the one I proposed and that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; passed on Loomio: the lesser of 1/3 of the population and a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; simple majority.  I claim that that rule supersedes the one on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the metagovernment site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See above. You say imposed rules should be ignored, and now you're
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to impose a rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *I'm* not imposing it, the majority voted for it!  You're the one
</I>&gt;<i> imposing a rule, the one that I, and probably some other active
</I>&gt;<i> members of this group never even voted for...
</I>
Ed's clearly in the right here, Scott.  There may be a majority in a
Loomio group, but no majority in Metagov voted to change the decision
rules.  They're two different groups, even if they share some of the
same people.
