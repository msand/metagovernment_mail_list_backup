<PRE>To Everyone,
I&#8217;m making a proposal on this [MG] list to:  Use Loomio to discuss, and vote on an *Opening Statement for the [MG] Homepage* (in order to replace the existing statement with one that more accurately reflects the vision and practice of this group). Please respond to this proposal on this list.

The quorum will consist of those participating in the vote that follows 2 weeks of open discussion (vote to end on Friday June 20th at 9pm PST).

Please respond with one of the following:

+   I agree
0   I don&#8217;t agree but I won&#8217;t block this proposal (and here is why I don&#8217;t agree)
-    I don&#8217;t agree and I will block this proposal (and here is why I don&#8217;t agree) 


Below is my most recent edit/draft of a statement for the [MG] home page that I will propose in order to begin the discussion on Loomio&#8230;.if and when the current (above) proposal is agreed upon. Following the ensuing discussion and vote (on Loomio) I will summarize the proceedings that take place there, and then post them in an email (for the record) on the [MG] list.

&gt;<i> Metagovernment is a group that discusses the theory and technical practice of, the design, development, and implementation of various scalable systems of human self-governance. We aim to establish viable systems for a horizontal distribution of power in order to facilitate the transparent evolution of our global democracies. We welcome all to join us in our efforts to form a more just and sustainable world.
</I>
