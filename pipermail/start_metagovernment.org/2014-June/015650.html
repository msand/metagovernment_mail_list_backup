<PRE>Steve, Pietro and Ned,

Steve said:
&gt;<i> Bently wrote on the homepage for Loomio: We are a global community
</I>&gt;<i> of people working on numerous projects to enable collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance.
</I>
Thanks Steve, I think it would be a good first step to discuss that.
But I guess Pietro and Ned don't agree.


Pietro said:
&gt;<i> you approach would not pass through me and Ned who want the homepage
</I>&gt;<i> to be comprehensible enough, and not just a single [sentence].
</I>
I don't want just a single sentence either, Pietro.  I want to make
progress and I'm okay with making it one step at a time.

&gt;<i> Getting an agreement on nothing and a promise to agree later is
</I>&gt;<i> something I would never do because it sounds too much like signing a
</I>&gt;<i> white paper to someone else.
</I>
Well, a single sentence isn't nothing.  Nor is there a promise
attached to it.  Nor is there a 'someone else'.  It's just a way of
taking a break from the effort without giving up entirely.


Ned said:
&gt;<i> ... In the past I have voted &quot;yes&quot; to 2712 for example, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;yes&quot; actually meant &quot;this is acceptable as the Introduction&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> did not mean &quot;this is acceptable as the whole page&quot;. ...
</I>
Please specify when you're proposing parts instead of wholes, Ned,
since it makes a difference in the voting.

It looks like I'm alone in my preferences.  If I'm still alone on the
next round, then I'll stand aside and let others move forward.

Mike
