<PRE>Hi Michael,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thank you very much for this message. ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; P.S. it's the first time that a person discusses in public the ins
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and outs of some proposals, speaking directly to the key players,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very interesting twist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree.  It might be a good exercise for the developer to log out of
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo and sit with the non-users, e.g. in this list, in order to

</I>&gt;<i> participants, though they're not yet users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>If you knew how often have I tried to sit with the people of the Pirate
Party...
But right now I very much like the way Ned is keeping us all on our toes.




&gt;<i> I want to acknowledge that Vilfredo has improved considerably since I
</I>&gt;<i> last used it.  I'm not sure what's changed.  Maybe it's the graphs, or
</I>&gt;<i> the key players summary, or the commenting system, but overall it
</I>&gt;<i> hangs together quite nicely.  Nice work, Pietro (and I guess Derek).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Thanks (yes Derek has a great merit in translating my ideas into code - and
asking me not to do it :-D ). Probably the last time you participated was
even before the 3 ways voting, and surely the comments (which will change)
after a chat with Robert Bjarnson. Also at the time there was no recursive
voting. You voted, but could only see at the end of the voting phase what
the results was. This had the unintended effect that people never really
understood the graph because too much time passed from when they voted and
when they saw the results. Now seeing it immediately, and being able to see
the changes right away, was a big step.

Still I feel the participants need to be walked through it. Not only the
system is not intuitive, but there are also no good tutorial. This is why I
am keeping a strict discipline with myself in not explaining too much all
at once :-)
