<PRE>Hi Again Everyone,
Thanks to all of you who took the time to respond.

 Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;<i> We can't change the rules without following the rules for changing the rules. Otherwise, we are just anarchy.
</I>
I agree. 

&gt;<i> The current rules are&#8230;.. (roughly) that we vote continually and if/when there is a supermajority, then it must hold for a full week before it passes.
</I>
 I wasn&#8217;t aware of these rules (my apologies).

&gt;<i> Anyway, I tried joining the Loomio metagov board, and I had to ask for permission. I don't understand how a system can be democratic if some authoritarian (someone with authority) gets to decide who may participate.
</I>
I didn&#8217;t set the group up. I imagine the group settings are something we will need to discuss should we at some point choose to go there. 

&gt;<i> I only see up/down style voting. How does that build consensus? If someone disagrees with a word, how is the proposal refined? 
</I>
Very good questions. 

&gt;<i> If someone has a counter-proposal, how is it compared to the original? I am not seeing how Loomio is supposed to be more than a simple replication of the problems/limitations of the status quo. Systems like Vilfredo and Votorola appear to be vastly more sophisticated at consensus-building, even if they don't have quite as pretty of a front-end (which truly is the worst standard: otherwise, let's just use Facebook for decision-making).
</I>
I&#8217;m going to respond to this along with Pietro&#8217;s statement:     &quot;-1, it looks like the OP just wants us all to use Loomio.&quot;

I&#8217;m up for using any (and all) of the systems available. I&#8217;ve stated this repeatedly. I worked with Michael for several months a couple of years ago trying to gather support for testing Votorola with the NYC #Occupy group. I really don&#8217;t care which system we begin with, and I personally would like to use them all at some point. It&#8217;s seems it would be an opportunity for some really great constructive feedback. Mostly though, I just want to practice this whole dynamic of *collaborative governance*&#8230;..on a platform other than e-mail.
