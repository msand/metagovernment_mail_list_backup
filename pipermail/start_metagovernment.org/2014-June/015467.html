<PRE>Hi, Scott. I won't answer you inline because you are repeating yourself: I have already answered all of your questions and you are ignoring my answers.

I have answered you as to how a government can be replaced: by making the old one irrelevant. I also invited you to make this group irrelevant. But you cannot assert a minority decision-rule on a community that has never used that and which does not generally accept that.

Deciding what's on our home page is NOT a minor decision: it is a defining moment of this community. Michael has brought us to a point where we must examine who we are and how we present ourselves to the world. Coming up with a fast-but-wrong answer to this question would be the worst possible outcome. Just like most minority decisions. They get the job done... but they do it wrong. What value is that?

If instead we accept your premise that the decision-rule can be changed in the same moment that it is proposed, then remember that I proposed a one-vote-rule which makes me absolute dictator of this group: whatever I say goes. So if your claim is valid, then so is mine and I thus revert us back to our original decision rule.

And thus again, I demonstrate the failure of fast-but-wrong decisions. I would much rather that we take our time and come up with a great homepage than that we put up some junk that doesn't represent the community.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps you will be braver than he and address the issue of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;election&quot; of Hitler as dictator, or the question about how the US (or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> any country) gets from its current system to a direct democracy.  Do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the people have to follow the rules of their current government to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> replace it, or can it be done with a simple majority vote?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's not a lack of bravery (but thanks for the backhanded insult), but rather a lack of time, as I have already made abundantly clear repeatedly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm, looks like Ed can't take a little teasing.  You had time to
</I>&gt;<i> respond to the previous post, and had time to respond to this one.
</I>&gt;<i> But, curiously, neither post addresses the question I asked: Can a
</I>&gt;<i> government be replaced with a simple majority vote, or is something
</I>&gt;<i> more complicated required depending on the existing governing
</I>&gt;<i> documents?  Explain why.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for comparing me to Adolf Hitler (quite likely the most evil person of the recent era if not ever... thanks again for the implied insult?), your comparison contains the answer: Hitler had tanks and I have nothing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The comparison wasn't you and Hitler, it was merely the Germans and
</I>&gt;<i> us: Just like the Germans in 1939 we seem to be stuck with a decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule that is preventing us from making what should be a relatively
</I>&gt;<i> simple change to the Metagovernment Home page.  What happens when
</I>&gt;<i> something really contentious comes up?  E.g., never mind immigration
</I>&gt;<i> and gun control, let's try to define what is a legitimate revolution!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no authority over you, and you can do whatever you want. I am not Hitler imposing myself on you; nor is any other member of this group. The group is the community of people who are generally agreeing on some basic things, and communities are defined by their history as well as their membership. Our beginning premise and our continuing tradition is one of consensus and almost always of unanimity among current participants on our email list server. If you think there should be a community that works on minority rule on Loomio, then that is another group: go start it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I'm no big fan of Loomio, but see that it works (we actually
</I>&gt;<i> made decisions!)  I'm enjoying this Vilfredo trial as well, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> still not really understanding how the process works and so remain
</I>&gt;<i> skeptical that it will be usable by an average person.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And therein lies the rest of the answer to your question above. Replacing the status quo is about starting a new system and getting people to join until it becomes the prevalent system. There is no need to abide by the rules of the status quo: we will just make it irrelevant. Back when we had a home page, this was described in the Transition section:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not specific, though: Where exactly is the threshold where the
</I>&gt;<i> actual transition occurs?  Is there some event to mark that
</I>&gt;<i> transition?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if you wish to change the rules of this group, then please do the same thing: start a better group and MAKE US IRRELEVANT. But please don't say that the new rule is minority-rule and a minority is in favor that rule so it is now the law of this whole community. That is much more tyrannical than anything any of us have proposed here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's not exactly minority rule, it's minority gridlock: By setting the
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule too high (i.e., consensus) you've essentially proven my
</I>&gt;<i> point because there still is no home page, nor apparently even
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot; on the decision rule even though a majority of the active
</I>&gt;<i> participants in the group approved my &quot;1/3 or majority&quot; rule.  Again,
</I>&gt;<i> after we get the home page situation sorted, we really need to get
</I>&gt;<i> back to the issue of decision rules, especially as they apply to
</I>&gt;<i> changing governing documents.  Taking a month to change a Home page is
</I>&gt;<i> one thing, how long do you think it would take to e.g., reform the
</I>&gt;<i> prison or school system at this rate?
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
