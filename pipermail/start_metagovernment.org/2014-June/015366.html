<PRE>I'm not looking for something much more than what they have in Sharepoint
today. Just collect data in fields with relationships validation and
identity. That's much of what these edemocracy systems need. I could do
Loomio in Sharepoint in a few hours without code.

I had a prototyping system half way built when I did SettleIt.org and
realized I could make it multitennat and add a javascript editor and a
no-sql backend and it's pretty much there. I'm not looking to create
anything complicated. Javascript is fine for quick formulas and small
snippets. I have three projects that are just forms over text with a little
business logic. They are hardly worth downloading an app just to test out.
I was just throwing it out there to see if anyone else wants to give it a
go.

Scott, I understand you don't believe in it but let's not discourage others
from having a learning experience trying it out. There may someone on the
list that doesn't have your experience and spending a few weeks prototyping
a prototyping system might provide value even if it was never used.

I'll probably find time in the next month and just wanted to see if anyone
wanted to check it out with me.

I would rather not spend time debating the idea. If anyone is interested
you can email me.
