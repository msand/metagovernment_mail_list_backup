<PRE>Can we use consensus-making tools in a cooperative way?  So the tools
work together and each helps the other?  I was thinking we could run
an experiment and find out.

I offer Votorola as one of the guinea pigs.  It's only a prototype and
hasn't yet been tested (not the complete design, which is new).
Testing is difficult because it's intended for large-scale use on laws
and such.  Also it's designed to strengthen an existing discussion,
not to create the discussion from scratch.  Generally it requires some
other process (such as Vilfredo) continually running in parallel to
keep the issue alive and kicking; plus a group that's open to
experimenting with new tools, ideas, etc.

Even if there's no interest, I'll probably learn something by making
the attempt.  So please bear with me.  I'll set things up and be back
shortly with a question for the group.
