<PRE>Thank you for appreciating the text. Sorry I've been so quiet on this
thread. I wanted to see where it would go.  I don't believe all the
proposals so far have followed the rules specifically and some proposals
were to change the rules so I'm not sure where that leaves us. The rules
have a few holes in them in defining the participants and I don't believe
it specifies a system. I don't see anyone cheating or manipulating the
system. This seems to be a result of different interpretations and
misunderstanding which tends to happen. We'll sort it out in time.

My priority right now is experimenting with systems and it would be nice to
say we made the decision using a system. My preference would be to wait on
Vilfredo although I don't have a great justification.

Bentley

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, Jo.  I'll keep the vote totals out from now on.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, but I feel you are trying to cheat us.  Not so much in having
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your homepage, but in wanting the process your way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My way?  Cheating?  This is the way we agreed, Pietro.  It's the same
</I>&gt;<i> decision process we always use here in Metagov.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This decision, right now, is being taken using Vilfredo. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On who's authority?  Please make a proper proposal to this group and
</I>&gt;<i> then wait for it to pass.  We can't go changing our decision process
</I>&gt;<i> for this issue without an agreement.  That would be wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meantime, the current proposal stays open.  It's an honest proposal
</I>&gt;<i> made according to the rules.  And it's a good one.  Bentley's text is
</I>&gt;<i> better than anything we've seen in a long time.  You all liked it well
</I>&gt;<i> enough in Vilfredo, and now you down-vote it for narrow political
</I>&gt;<i> reasons.  But wouldn't it be better to have something decent on the
</I>&gt;<i> home page as a temporary measure?  While we continue to talk?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's give people in the list time to express their opinions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    PROPOSAL 3
</I>&gt;<i>    ----------
</I>&gt;<i>    Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
</I>&gt;<i>        re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
</I>&gt;<i>        choose between the lesser of a few evils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
</I>&gt;<i>        to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
</I>&gt;<i>        convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
</I>&gt;<i>        society work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
</I>&gt;<i>        and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
</I>&gt;<i>        governments and societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;<i>    -------------
</I>&gt;<i>        For: Mike
</I>&gt;<i>    Against: Ned, Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Pietro wishes that I remove Bentley's vote till he speaks, so I do.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
