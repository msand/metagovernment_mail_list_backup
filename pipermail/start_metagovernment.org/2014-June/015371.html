<PRE>Hi Scott, hi Steve, hi everybody.

Vilfredo is available and ready to use at <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org">http://vilfredo.org</A> and I DID
propose to use Vilfredo for the discussion. It is in the discussion
archives:

<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006535.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-May/006535.html</A>

My message did not receive any attention to the point that I wondered if it
was even received by the list (now I checked and it was there).

Vilfredo could be used very well to decide the homepage.

Right now I am working very hard (as in every morning at 8am I have a skype
call) to develop the next Vilfredo. Vilfredo 2.0. But the original Vilfredo
is at <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org">http://vilfredo.org</A> and works perfectly well.

For the records this was my proposal:

Hi,
speaking strictly for Vilfredo, but with a general view to the other tools.
Each tool is different and it is different the kind of questions and the
contexts in which it works well (or at all).

Vilfredo works under those conditions:
-5-25 people
-a situation where people are all willing to read each proposal (in a
future version we will try to change this but for now it is a necessity)
-a question where we are looking for a single answer.

The last point requires a bit of explenation: if we are saying what shall
we do for the US economy (or the Italian Economy), well there are plenty of
things that need to be done. And Vilfredo is not the right tool because it
permit a proposal to dominate another one, even if they have nothing to do
with each other.

Instead if you ask: how shall we build this car, where shall we go to eat
this evening, what shall we write to the MG homepage, then Vilfredo works
really well, because you are looking for a single answer. And if there are
multiple answers, you need to try to integrate them, or you will ignore one
instead of the other.

So saying that we shall use Vilfredo for each MG decision for 6 months does
not make sense. Vilfredo should be used only for certain metagovernment
decisions.

For example we could use it now to decide the homepage.

In this way, one week to propose what should be written,
one week to vote.
If we reach consensus we write what is in the consensus.
If we do not reach consensus, we give the alternative versions, of all the
proposals in the Pareto Front.
In the meantime, in the background we keep on running Vilfredo as a slow
buring, while trying to find a consensus.

Similarly Loomia works better for simpler decisions with many more people.
I think Loomia and Vilfredo could integrate very well. In fact you should
start with Loomia and once someone asks to use Vilfredo, provided there are
not more than 25 people, a Vilfredo question starts instead.

And so on.

Cheers,
Pietro



Cheers again :-),
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way Votorola works (or at least the way it has been used here) is in
</I>&gt;<i> conjunction with a wiki. People use wiki articles to create proposals, then
</I>&gt;<i> those can be compared to each other, sections can easily be copied from one
</I>&gt;<i> to another, and votes can hop between competing proposals as they develop.
</I>&gt;<i> It is exactly built for proposal generation and consensus-building, and it
</I>&gt;<i> works now and it does not rely on any authority (no single person moderates
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal). Vilfredo works completely differently, has no wiki, and yet
</I>&gt;<i> also is extremely adept at proposal generation combined with consensus
</I>&gt;<i> building. It too runs right now and requires no authority. SettleIt looks
</I>&gt;<i> like it too, working in yet another completely different way, is built for
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-building and proposal generation. Loomio is so primitive in
</I>&gt;<i> comparison, that I don't know why it is even being discussed here.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because, unlike those other two, it works and is available on-line
</I>&gt;<i> right now!  If those other two are so useful, why *aren't* we using
</I>&gt;<i> them?  I previously stated my objection that I don't consider either
</I>&gt;<i> viable candidates for the general system (because they're too complex
</I>&gt;<i> and people simply won't trust them), but I'd actually like to try them
</I>&gt;<i> to see how they work in practice.  But I don't see anyone (else)
</I>&gt;<i> rushing to do so.  Why not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did not impose that rule. It was unanimously adopted by the
</I>&gt;<i> participating members of this group. Included in the decision-rule was a
</I>&gt;<i> method for how the rule itself should be changed. That is a community
</I>&gt;<i> charter, and to throw it away destroys our community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, the irony!  Here it is 1939 and Hitler has just invaded Poland.
</I>&gt;<i> The majority of the German people say &quot;Hey, wait a minute, that's not
</I>&gt;<i> what we signed up for...&quot; and Hitler says &quot;No Backsies!  You voted for
</I>&gt;<i> that rule with me as dictator, and now your stuck with it!&quot;.  The
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the active members of this group voted for my &quot;1/3 or
</I>&gt;<i> majority&quot; decision rule.  Now you're saying that a democratic vote by
</I>&gt;<i> a majority of the group is invalid because it will &quot;destroy the
</I>&gt;<i> community&quot; by not obeying an earlier (and IMHO impractical) policy.  I
</I>&gt;<i> also note that you snipped out my comment about how in the long run we
</I>&gt;<i> get from our current system in the US to a direct democracy: Which is
</I>&gt;<i> it going to be, Ed, majority rule, or follow the old rule &quot;to preserve
</I>&gt;<i> the community&quot; even though it isn't what the majority want?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This, of course, is on top of the irony that I'm opposed to the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of &quot;consensus&quot; as a decision rule and against any voting
</I>&gt;<i> system with a &quot;block&quot; option where an individual or small minority can
</I>&gt;<i> stop any progress.  I'm not opposing consensus just to be a PITA, but
</I>&gt;<i> so far you haven't even *attempted* to disprove my theory that because
</I>&gt;<i> a quarter to a third of the population is authoritarian and prone to
</I>&gt;<i> be simply irrational about decisions where their safety and access to
</I>&gt;<i> resources are concerned that any system that requires them to act
</I>&gt;<i> against their natures is just doomed to fail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; [snip] We have a new decision rule, the one I proposed and that passed
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Loomio: the lesser of 1/3 of the population and a simple majority.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; claim that that rule supersedes the one on the metagovernment site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; See above. You say imposed rules should be ignored, and now you're
</I>&gt;<i> trying to impose a rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I'm* not imposing it, the majority voted for it!  You're the one
</I>&gt;<i> imposing a rule, the one that I, and probably some other active
</I>&gt;<i> members of this group never even voted for...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I now see the proposal you reference on Loomio. I was busy then and
</I>&gt;<i> could not participate. It got 57% of the vote. By the standing decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule, (which to change the decision rule requires 100% for that many
</I>&gt;<i> participants; or a minimum of 80% for large populations) it failed. few
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Saying it passed on its own rule is a tautology. Otherwise: I propose
</I>&gt;<i> that the new decision rule is that whatever I say goes and the vote shall
</I>&gt;<i> be decided only by me and I vote yes, so that's the new decision rule. In
</I>&gt;<i> other words... you can't impose a new decision rule before changing the
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps your misunderstanding is &quot;What is a democracy, anyway?&quot;  To me
</I>&gt;<i> it means majority rule, where the majority in this case are the active
</I>&gt;<i> participants in this group (i.e., those people who signed up for
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio to see how it works).  You seem to think it's more like an
</I>&gt;<i> oligarchy, where the people who started the group or who voted in the
</I>&gt;<i> previous decision have some sort of priority over the current active
</I>&gt;<i> membership.  My decision rule isn't a &quot;tautology&quot; because there are
</I>&gt;<i> any number of other decision rules I could have proposed that would
</I>&gt;<i> *not* have achieved a majority vote.  It does smack a little of being
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;recursive&quot;, but that's OK, again, as long as it's clear that that is
</I>&gt;<i> what the majority wants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As I've expressed before I'm not completely comfortable with the fact
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that there are 100+ people on the list a whole 9 of whom have bothered
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to sign up for Loomio, but if they're not even interested in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; *experimenting* with Loomio, I'm satisfied that they're not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sufficiently engaged to be considered part of the &quot;group&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How does this follow, when there are many systems participating here,
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio is not even one of them, and you apparently are not willing to try
</I>&gt;<i> out these other systems. Have you looked at Vilfredo? It is fantastic at
</I>&gt;<i> building consensus, and lightyears ahead of loomio in architecture.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, may be, but I don't see them being used, or even being proposed
</I>&gt;<i> to be used, by anyone other than you.  I'm not any happier with Loomio
</I>&gt;<i> than you (apparently) are but I do believe it is up to the current
</I>&gt;<i> task (approving a proposal for a new home page) and so we should just
</I>&gt;<i> get on with the business of using it for that.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
