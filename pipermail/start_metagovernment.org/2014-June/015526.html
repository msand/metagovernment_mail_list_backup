<PRE>I want to try them all. I say we set up a stack and begin moving through them one by one. I&#8217;m not as interested in the task of filling the homepage as I am in familiarizing myself with the tools and their architecture. But we could use the next one to conjure a vision statement, and then the next for a mission statement&#8230;..and so on.

&gt;<i> Dear Mike
</I>&gt;<i> No one want to enforce the use of Airesis, is just part of the mission of metagovernment, (but if you believe you have the best than we should rewrite the mission). Vilfredo is doing a good job here, so far, i believe. But I also believe that for building a home page is not the best tool, please read me well, I say for that specific tasks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> About Airesis:
</I>&gt;<i> Is a place where you find diverse tool in order to be flexible and create social bonding around ideas. The calendar and the forum where requested by the community but &quot;our&quot; main tool is to build collaboratively a proposal by mean of a set of rules ( each group can set their ones, in the metagovernment group are perfectly horizontal) and the interpretation of one or more relater. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> While in vilfredo you have to work on one single proposal all the time end every time you  give approval to the whole, in Airesis you can work on paragraphs and/or a multiple solution and have voting range on multiple solution. Is designed for larger groups and managed and interpreted proposals This is a strength and can be a weakness depending on the relater/s, personally my interest is to have a test performed by the largest number of active member of the metagovernment group while selecting the best copywriter to be the relater. The better the group collaborate the list amount of solutions will be the outcome, in the best scenario one single text should be the outcome, and if so the final vote too. In case we have multiple solution Schulze voting should give the most widely accepted home page. So please forghet about the living space and just evaluate the proposal tool
</I>&gt;<i> Kind Regards
</I>&gt;<i> Jacopo

&gt;<i> I don't think this is a group decision, Jacopo; it's an individual
</I>&gt;<i> decision.  Anyone who wishes to use Airesis is immediately free to,
</I>&gt;<i> and anyone who doesn't can't be forced.  A group decision (one way or
</I>&gt;<i> the other) won't change that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise each person is free to use Vilfredo, or not.  There was no
</I>&gt;<i> group decision to use it.  Some started using it, while others didn't.
</I>&gt;<i> It's an experimental tool with a unique design for consensus making,
</I>&gt;<i> which makes it interesting.  I think that's why people are trying it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I'm wrong (please correct me), Airesis isn't so much a tool as
</I>&gt;<i> a place to live.  It's a group-hosting platform with built-in tools.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of us aren't looking for that because we already have the best
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list software (arguably better than your forums, though some
</I>&gt;<i> may disagree), the best wiki software (almost certainly better than
</I>&gt;<i> your document storage), plus whatever other tools we choose to add to
</I>&gt;<i> the mix in the future.  For a tech-savvy group like us, we already
</I>&gt;<i> have pretty much the best living space that's available.  I think that
</I>&gt;<i> explains why we're less interested in Airesis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (To be clear, I'm not voting in this proposal.)
