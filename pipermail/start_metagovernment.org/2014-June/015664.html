<PRE>We're now able to put this into practice.  Here's what one particular
overplan looks like: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>


                    (CoP) Compare the overplans
       CoP          (SoP) Select the best overplan
        |           (ToP) Track discussion of the overplan
       SoP          (XoP) Execute the overplan
        |
       ToP          (CeP) Compare the existential plans
        |           (SeP) Select the best existential plans
       XoP          (SeN) Identify the enabling norms
        |
     .-.-.---.      (DwP) Deploy the pollwikis
    /  |  \   \     (DwS) Deploy the streetwikis
  DwP DwS  )  CeP   (DvI) Deploy the vote mirroring inter-network
    \ /   /   /
    DvI RaM SeP     (RaM) Reform as myth
    / \ /   /       (BaM) Build agreement on the myth
   (  BaM SeN        (O)  Overguide the norms
    \   \ /
     )   O --.      (TeP) Track discussion of the existential plans

     '- XaN  /      (EbX) Elect the best executive officers
          \ /       (NbL) Nominate the best legislators
          XeP       (EbL) Elect the best legislators
           |
          NxR       (XaN) Execute the enabling norms
                    (XeP) Execute the existential plans
                    (NxR) Eliminate existential risk


An interesting thing about overplanning in general shows up in the
initial steps of the example above.  Those steps will probably be
common to all rational overplans, because it wouldn't make sense to
proceed without them.  They're simple enough in themselves:

   (CoP) Compare the overplans
   (SoP) Select the best overplan
         . . .

If you're an abstract thinker, however, then you'll appreciate that
the *meaning* here is far from simple.  What we've discovered in these
steps (or re-discovered) is the necessity of myth and myth making.  An
overplan is a kind of proto-myth wrapped up in a technical language
that we moderns can understand.

If you're *not* an abstract thinker, but more of a practical hand,
then you'll nevertheless appreciate how the problem that prompted the
formation of this list (which is basically the problem of modernity)
is now solved.  We know precisely how to &quot;start&quot;, and can never again
become lost, or stuck.

Starting also promises to be fun.  We get to be on top of things when
everyone else in the world who's trying to move forward is frustrated
and confused, and blaming others for it.  Isn't that the situation
we're all familiar with?

Does anyone have doubts about this approach?  I'll work to demonstrate
it in the months and years ahead, along with anyone else who comes to
see the sense in it.  We're currently on step CoP, and borrowing the
neutral resources of Metagov (e.g. the wiki) to help. *

  * Other tools are already available by the way (tools of your
    choice), but you probably won't see them till you need them.
