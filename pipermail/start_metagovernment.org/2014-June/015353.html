<PRE>I disagree with the format of the debate, as it is not what we have already agreed upon. We can't change the rules without following the rules for changing the rules. Otherwise, we are just anarchy.

The current rules are not that we have two weeks of discussion and then vote (and if so, what defines a winning vote), but rather (roughly) that we vote continually and when there is a supermajority, then it must hold for a full week before it passes. Again, they are stated here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>

And just to be clear:
-1

Anyway, I tried joining the Loomio metagov board, and I had to ask for permission. I don't understand how a system can be democratic if some authoritarian (someone with authority) gets to decide who may participate. Now that I have been deemed worthy of participating in the board, I only see up/down style voting. How does that build consensus? If someone disagrees with a word, how is the proposal refined? If someone has a counter-proposal, how is it compared to the original? I am not seeing how Loomio is supposed to be more than a simple replication of the problems/limitations of the status quo. Systems like Vilfredo and Votorola appear to be vastly more sophisticated at consensus-building, even if they don't have quite as pretty of a front-end (which truly is the worst standard: otherwise, let's just use Facebook for decision-making).

To Michael's point, I do agree that we should be discussing what we are doing here. So... does everyone agree with the mission, vision, and common principles stated here?
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

If so, that sounds like a great starting point. And the mission statement sounds like a good first sentence for the home page, right? (Which is pretty much what it was before it got blanked.)

</I>&gt;<i> Or if some people want to test different platforms and think maybe

</I>&gt;<i> of purpose do we want?  (Again, don't answer here.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe we have lots of different problems, or maybe none at all.
</I>&gt;<i> But please let's take them one at time, or it's too confusing.
