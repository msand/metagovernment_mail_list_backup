<PRE>Hi Bentley,
Hi Scott,
hi all,

Bentley:
every generation some proposals of the previous generation go to the next
generation. From a mathematical point of view, those are the Pareto Front.
The proposal that are not-dominated by any other proposal.

In our case only 4 proposals were in the Pareto Front. We then wrote 21
(twentyone!!!) new proposals :-), and so one we have to evaluate each of
 those 21+4=25 proposals.

I have seen that someone (Ned, I gather) have started writing proposals
expressing parts of the homepage. Unfortunately Vilfredo does not work in
this way. Basically the domination system that makes sure that one proposal
dominates another under certain conditions makes only sense if the two
proposals are trying to answer the same question. Semantically speaking. So
you can substitute one proposal for the other. When this is not the case,
the result is much less meaningful. You might end up finding a full
consensus over a small part of what you are working on. This is the reason
why I explained at the beginning that Vilfredo works well for &quot;how shall
we&quot; kind of question. In other words question where we are looking for a
single answer (maybe complex). But not a list of elements more or less
independently structure. If we want to use Vilfredo in this way, we should
open a separate question for each element. For example if we agree to have
a specific structure made of &quot;mission, vision, projects, ... &quot; then for
each of them we can ask: &quot;what is the mission of Vilfredo to insert in the
homepage?&quot;. (which is not a how, but it is still a question where you are
looking for a single winning proposal).

Scott:
There were some suggestions from you (Scott), to evaluate the proposals
with a 10 star system. It is interesting, but first you would need to
understand the way Vilfredo works. What you are suggesting is something
similar to Range Voting. A slightly better version of that would be
Majority Judgment. But regardless, Vilfredo uses a completely different
method. We DO NOT sum the votes. Instead we declare that a proposal A
dominates a proposal B iff (if and only if) the set of people that vote for
B is a subset of the people that vote for A. So it is not just that A has
more support, but it is also supported by the same people. So each person
that like B will also be happy if we pass A. Then the Pareto Front is the
set of the non-dominated proposals.
In this way you can be sure that whoever votes in Vilfredo, will find at
least one of the proposals he voted for in the Pareto Front. Because if you
voted for B, and A dominates B, so that A is in the Pareto Front. Then you
MUST have also voted for A, so you are still represented in the Pareto
Front. For this reason you can say that the Pareto Front represents the
community :-).
The next version of Vilfredo will use a mixed system. People will vote on
an inverted triangle to say how much they like and they understand a
proposal. Then a first approximation will be used to find the Pareto Front.
And in situations where several proposals are competing (especially if no
one is presenting new ideas) the actual position in the triangle will be
used. It is much more complex, which is why its development is so slow.



Finally consider looking at the Pareto Front, looking at how you vote, and
how by changing your vote you can slightly change the Pareto Front. We are
releasing this information (the graph, how other people votes) specifically
so that people can change their vote and look for a specific consensus.

Cheers,
Pietro.


P.S. I wrote a proposal suggesting that this Vilfredo consultation was the
official way for Metagovernment to decide the homepage.

If this proposal reaches enough support then maybe we can reach an
agreement inside the community with the people (i.,e. Michael Allen) who
feel we are excluding by using Vilfredo without going through a formal vote
before. Please take your time to vote.
