<PRE>For all those that have voted,
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>
after you have voted you will see a graph that represents how people have
voted, and what is the actual Pareto Front.

I made a video about it here:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI</A>

Remember that in Vilfredo you ARE allowed to change your vote. And as you
do so the graph will change. In fact it is sometimes fun to just change the
vote to see it changing. Unfortunately as the comments are tied to the
vote, this is not so easy anymore. In the next versions the comments will
not be tied to the vote (but still divided into comments for, against, and
question), so to permit to people to switch easily vote.

You will also see who are the keyplayers, but I will speak about it only
later.

Cheers,
Pietro


P.S. if you have posted a proposal now you should have a mail in your
inbox. As I am very worried that some mail servers send those mails to the
spam folder, now you can check if it is in the spam.
