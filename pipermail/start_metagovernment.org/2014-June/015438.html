<PRE>Hi Mike,

I confess to being a little confused. You made a proposal (quite 
properly from the perspective of &quot;traditional&quot; metagovernment practice), 
and Pietro and I voted against it (again quite properly -- in the 
&quot;traditional&quot; metagovernment vote-count system we don't need no stinkin' 
reasons in order for our votes to be valid). Your problem is that the 
vote has been going against you, not that you are being &quot;improperly&quot; 
forced or denied. Try making another proposal. Perhaps it will attract 
more support than this one has. (In super-majority systems, minorities 
routinely feel &quot;forced and denied&quot; -- welcome to the club.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     PROPOSAL 3
</I>&gt;<i>     ----------
</I>&gt;<i>     Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
</I>&gt;<i>         re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
</I>&gt;<i>         choose between the lesser of a few evils.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
</I>&gt;<i>         to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
</I>&gt;<i>         convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
</I>&gt;<i>         society work together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
</I>&gt;<i>         and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
</I>&gt;<i>         governments and societies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Then leave the door open to further proposals and content.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     CURRENT VOTES
</I>&gt;<i>     -------------
</I>&gt;<i>         For: Mike
</I>&gt;<i>     Against: Bentley, Ned, Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bentley said:
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you for appreciating the text. Sorry I've been so quiet on this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thread. I wanted to see where it would go.  I don't believe all the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals so far have followed the rules specifically and some proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were to change the rules so I'm not sure where that leaves us. The rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a few holes in them in defining the participants and I don't believe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it specifies a system. I don't see anyone cheating or manipulating the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system. This seems to be a result of different interpretations and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misunderstanding which tends to happen. We'll sort it out in time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My priority right now is experimenting with systems and it would be nice to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> say we made the decision using a system. My preference would be to wait on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo although I don't have a great justification.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
