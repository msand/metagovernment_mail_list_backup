<PRE>You make two bold claims here, Scott.  I think they're both *too* bold
and you'll be forced to retreat a little on them.  Or maybe I'm wrong.
(To the group: In this discussion with Scott, I hope to demonstrate a
larger point about overplanning.  See bottom.)


Scott said:
&gt;<i> ... Other than a desire for &quot;good government&quot; I don't [think] any of
</I>&gt;<i> us are in a position to specify what it should even look like or how
</I>&gt;<i> to achieve it at the level of an &quot;overplan&quot;.  ...
</I>
That's your first claim.  But if your thinking is correct here, then
there must be something wrong with this overplan:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Overplan/d/NxRO</A>

Can you actually *see* what is wrong with it?  I challenge you.

&gt;<i> ...  Although I do give a basic structural outline of how the
</I>&gt;<i> government itself should be organized in my book... and some key
</I>&gt;<i> points about the structure of The System... I'd rather do without an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;overplan&quot; in favor of designing a working decision-making system
</I>&gt;<i> first and then seeing where that leads us.
</I>
That's your second claim, that we can design good systems with no idea
of how they could become useful to anyone.  But are you being sincere
here?  Are you really *unable* to conceive of any possible sequence of
events by which a new design for a decision system might prove useful
in structuring a good government?  Or in furthering some other good
cause?  None whatsoever?


(Maybe I'm wrong, but I think Scott is now stuck.  There's no way to
dismiss overplans *in general* without abandoning reason.  If instead
you stand and confront them reasonably, as Scott is attempting to do,
then you're drawn into the practice of overplanning *whether you like
it or not*.  So it appears to be a sure-fire start technique.)

Mike
