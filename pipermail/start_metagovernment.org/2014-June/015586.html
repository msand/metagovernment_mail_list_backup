<PRE>Jacopo and Bentley, thanks for helping with this test.

Jacopo said:
&gt;<i> ... please do you have a some instruction on the interface, I am
</I>&gt;<i> having hard time understanding it and this is a major turnoff.
</I>
There's no special interface unless you want to do something advanced.
Then unfortunately you're into an experimental prototype on the lab
bench.  If you're okay with that (wires sticking out), then I'll try
to help.  Just say what you want to do.

Otherwise, all that's needed is to read this text and join in the
discussion of it: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom</A>


Bentley asks a lot of good questions here:
&gt;<i> I'm not sure there is enough information here to accept or reject.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you suggesting that these be the 4 headings or are these just
</I>&gt;<i> sections we will be filling in?
</I>
The section headings are just for us planners.  They won't appear on
the home page.

&gt;<i> If we accept this can it change later if the content drives us to a
</I>&gt;<i> different format?
</I>
Yes, always.  There are no restrictions.

To begin with, we want the biggest potential consensus.  This draft
(as far as it goes) seems to have the biggest of all (universal).  In
reason, everyone can accept it and work within its four sections.
Nobody would ever have to reject it.

But that doesn't mean it's ideal.  The sections might be better named.
Alex's little group is working (in a branch draft) on proposed changes
along these lines: <A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?k=7508-7509!1">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?k=7508-7509!1</A>

Or it might be better with fewer sections, or more.  And so on.  All
we've done is put one foot on the ground of consensus to test how firm
it is.  Now we're free to place the other foot (indeed all our feet)
and move freely.  In plain terms, we begin with two things:

  * Consensus text
  * Freedom to improve it

&gt;<i> Are we supposed to just tell you if we accept it or are we to start
</I>&gt;<i> filling it in?
</I>
If it looks acceptable, then probably the next thing is to discuss how
to fill the holes (abstract hotspots), yes.  I say 'probably' because
this hasn't been tested before.  Also because home pages can be boring
after a while, so we might want to take a break and come back later.
(I've no preference, either way.)

&gt;<i> Is this a part of [Votorola] or is this another tool?
</I>
Both.  The most important and visible tool is the discussion medium
(here a list).  Next the drafting medium (one of two wikis, author's
choice).  Next the diff bridge (link above).  Most participants will
just read drafts (not write them) and read diffs (not merge).  Of the
three tools I mention, Votorola provides only the diff bridge ofc.

Other tools and facilities are running too, but mostly they don't need
to be visible at this point: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/t">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/t</A>

&gt;<i> Do you see us working on this in parallel to Vilfredo and Airesis?
</I>
As long as anyone wants to participate, and at least some of them
agree that Vilfredo is providing our body content, then I guess we're
already working in parallel with Vilfredo:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom#Body">http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1139-ZeleaCom#Body</A>

I don't yet know how we'd use Airesis.  Jacopo seems to be offering us
its decision tool, which I imagine is something like LiquidFeedback -
i.e. not much good for discussion and consensus building.  I'm not
sure what we'd do with it.  However, if anyone participating in this
thread *thinks* Airesis can supply something to the issue, then we
could put Airesis on par with Vilfredo in this regard.  We'd just
leave a smaller piece of the pie to Votorola (no problem).

More meaningfully, I've been thinking of a way to spark a deeper kind
of cooperation among tool makers and participants in the field.  It
begins with a comparative approach like Steve's testing stack, but
otherwise it's quite different.  It would tell us (among other things)
exactly what Jacopo and Airesis are offering to the field, and who's
interested in the offer.  Ditto for all the other tool makers and
participants offering stuff.  I want to hear what others think of the
idea, so I'll post it to a separate thread shortly.

&gt;<i> I see a lot of things happening on this page that I do not
</I>&gt;<i> understand.  Is there a concise description oh how this works and
</I>&gt;<i> what the symbols mean?
</I>
No, unfortunately there's no user-friendly docs yet.  We might need to
shield people entirely from these distractions.  We want them to focus
on discussing the issue and the text, not trying to figure out the
toolset.  Then again, it's only a prototype at this stage; probably we
can't afford to optimize it (with shielding, etc) just yet.

Mike
