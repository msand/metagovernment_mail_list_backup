<PRE>Hi Mark, thanks for elaborating.

I don't know whether we have a real dispute here, or just a difference
in our diagramming techniques.  I draw diagrams with deliberation and
decision processes, too.  I draw them as independent processes with no
direct interconnection.  I think that's how they really are.

&gt;<i> I think both &quot;decision without deliberation&quot; and &quot;deliberation
</I>&gt;<i> without decision&quot; are real problems. ...
</I>
To solve that problem on paper, I insert a non-binding &quot;guideway&quot;.
The guideway indirectly and loosely interconnects the two process:
(see figure PGD)  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/a/M1">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/a/M1</A>

&gt;<i> ... I think our chances of success are higher working in cooperation
</I>&gt;<i> with existing authority systems rather than seeking to dominate
</I>&gt;<i> them.  ...
</I>
I agree on condition that *both* processes (public deliberation and
authoritative decision) remain independent of each other, such that
neither can dominate the other.

Maybe it's just the way your diagram is drawn, e.g. from the decision
perspective, that makes public deliberation seem a harnessed process
no longer independently running according to its own priorities.

But even if you and I have a dispute, I don't think it's reflected in
the larger societies we live in.  The decision authorities in those
societies (modern democracies) already have a deep respect for the
independence of public deliberation and opinion forming.  And public
opinion, for its part, has no power over those authorities aside from
the respect they already freely grant it.  Maybe we can agree that
this arrangement of mutual independence and respect should not change.

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,

</I>&gt;<i> I think both &quot;decision without deliberation&quot; and &quot;deliberation without

</I>&gt;<i> messes of all sorts, the latter is fiddling while Rome burns.  If your
</I>&gt;<i> point is that decision without deliberation is worse, I'll accept it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> An enormous topic you mention in your comment is that of authority.  The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;lifeless machine&quot; and its decision cycle have authority over us.  You
</I>&gt;<i> claim that the system will take its cues from the public, which I'd like to
</I>&gt;<i> believe.  But not all systems are democratic, and not all democratic
</I>&gt;<i> systems are honest.  We don't have to look beyond newspaper headlines to
</I>&gt;<i> see examples of authorities enforcing their will at the point of a gun over
</I>&gt;<i> the public.  I think our chances of success are higher working in
</I>&gt;<i> cooperation with existing authority systems rather than seeking to dominate
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Something about our conversation reminded me of this old (2000) article
</I>&gt;<i> from David Brin imagining online tools for deliberation and decision.
</I>&gt;<i> Still insightful 14 years later: <A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>

</I>&gt;<i> I need to run but will chime in with additional thoughts as they
