<PRE>Hi Mike,
you make ur vocabulary up. it sounds interesting, but it doesnt say
anything at all to those who do not know how all what you are saying fits
together or what each of these steps in particular mean.
I think if you take time to make some kind of &quot;Glossary&quot; that makes a small
summary for each of those &quot;steps&quot; in words that &quot;explain it to a five year
old&quot;, and set them into relation, thus, making a second &quot;glossary&quot; in which
phases or steps are contrasted against each other, that would help a lot.
Of course, such an aproach can not replace a more formal definition, but i
think or at least i hope, this would help people to get a grasp on which
mind set to apply when reading what you are writing. With what of the
&quot;known words/things&quot; to compare those what you are writing.

Why is all this what you are write (the steps/phases in the given order)
necessary? It looks like a lot of complexity.

What particular problems do they solved? How are these problems currently,
without that &quot;new process&quot; solved? Why is the above approach better and who
executes that approach? is it one person? all the people? how exactly? ...
[if you do not take the time to educate people about what all those things
are about, then its very hard to follow and thus agree]


Is it not possible to &quot;make it simple&quot; and if so, then why not? Education
of people should be one of your top most priorities if you want people to
join those ideas. maybe this is not necessary because it happens anyway,
but then you can also make less effort to communicate it. If its necessary,
that more and more people understand, then you should try to make some kind
of workshop or series of workshops (maybe videos/exercises/.... look @
coursera.org or similar platforms)
It needs education, and a lot thereof, especially amongst programmers and
other tech folks, because whatever you try to communicate, it sounds at
least as if it needs a lot of people to join forces :-)

</I>&gt;<i> An interesting thing about overplanning in general shows up in the
</I>&gt;<i> initial steps of the example above.  Those steps will probably be
</I>&gt;<i> common to all rational overplans, because it wouldn't make sense to
</I>&gt;<i> proceed without them.  They're simple enough in themselves:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    (CoP) Compare the overplans
</I>&gt;<i>    (SoP) Select the best overplan
</I>&gt;<i>          . . .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're an abstract thinker, however, then you'll appreciate that
</I>&gt;<i> the *meaning* here is far from simple.  What we've discovered in these
</I>&gt;<i> steps (or re-discovered) is the necessity of myth and myth making.  An
</I>&gt;<i> overplan is a kind of proto-myth wrapped up in a technical language
</I>&gt;<i> that we moderns can understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're *not* an abstract thinker, but more of a practical hand,
</I>&gt;<i> then you'll nevertheless appreciate how the problem that prompted the
</I>&gt;<i> formation of this list (which is basically the problem of modernity)
</I>&gt;<i> is now solved.  We know precisely how to &quot;start&quot;, and can never again
</I>&gt;<i> become lost, or stuck.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Starting also promises to be fun.  We get to be on top of things when
</I>&gt;<i> everyone else in the world who's trying to move forward is frustrated
</I>&gt;<i> and confused, and blaming others for it.  Isn't that the situation
</I>&gt;<i> we're all familiar with?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone have doubts about this approach?  I'll work to demonstrate
</I>&gt;<i> it in the months and years ahead, along with anyone else who comes to
</I>&gt;<i> see the sense in it.  We're currently on step CoP, and borrowing the
</I>&gt;<i> neutral resources of Metagov (e.g. the wiki) to help. *

</I>&gt;<i>     choice), but you probably won't see them till you need them.
