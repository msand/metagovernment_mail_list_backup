<PRE>Jacopo, Greetings! (I am happy to see you still offering!)

The old home page had several &quot;link to&quot; pages associated with it. The 
new home page will also probably need several &quot;link to&quot; pages. After we 
know what those pages are, I for one would be just fine with creating 
some of them collaboratively on Airesis. But, we will need to wait until 
we know what is needed, after the Vilfredo process has run its course 
and the resulting proposal has passed through the list vote successfully.
