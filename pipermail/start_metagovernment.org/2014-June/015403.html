&gt;<i> Hi Bentley, 
</I>&gt;<i> thank you very much for this message.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have to admit I understand Jacopo's position when he says that 2650 is too general. It is more like an introductions. So I am very happy for it to be in the Pareto Front, so it will be an important ingredient in the next generation. But not the sole winner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Similarly what I miss in 2649 a paragraph that clearly states that we are working on different projects, and links to the list, dividing between projects represented (someone from that project came here once), and &quot;in house&quot; projects (someone is constantly here and we are following the development quite close).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2651 has such a paragraph. So I don't think I will change my vote, instead as soon as the voting phase is over I am planning to do a bit of paragraph shopping, and mix up a few ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am quite happy that we do not reach a consensus at this generation, as I feel no proposal is complete enough.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. it's the first time that a person discusses in public the ins and outs of some proposals, speaking directly to the key players, very interesting twist.
