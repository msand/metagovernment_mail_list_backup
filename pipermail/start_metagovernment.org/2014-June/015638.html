<PRE>Hi Michael, it is true that Vilfredo stifles the conversation without its
boundaries. And does so in a fair way by doing it to everybody at the same
time. Already adding comments has been a good opening, and we are going to
have others in future, as we discover ways to let people talk without
leaving the louder voices to decide for everybody.

I think the idea of sticking to the bare fact is great. Next time you are a
key player, why not changing a proposal using this strategy. I am starting
to think Vilfredo should close you and Ed in one room with no food until
you agree on a home page ;-)

Dr. Pietro Speroni di Fenizio,

</I>&gt;<i> For me, it arrives in what Scott says:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating them vastly more complicated, Exhibit A being this MG Home
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Page project, albeit that being almost exclusively &quot;inspiration&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with very little in the way of actual &quot;rules&quot;.  ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd immediately agree to a home page that sticks to the dull facts.

</I>&gt;<i> i.e. by a competent effort at sincerity, as from an artist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We needn't be sincere to state the dull facts, only correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't get much opportunity to talk about my preferences and the
</I>&gt;<i> reasons behind them.  That's partly because everyone's tired of the
</I>&gt;<i> whole issue and wants to avoid sinking more effort into it.  But it's
</I>&gt;<i> also partly because Vilfredo hasn't encouraged or supported this kind
</I>&gt;<i> of talk, except tangentially, as we see in this thread.
