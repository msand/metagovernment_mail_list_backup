<PRE>Dear All,
I would like to formally offer to use Vilfredo to reach an agreement over
what to write on the Homepage.

Right now there is already a question that is being discussed on Vilfredo,
asking what should be written on Metagovernment Homepage.

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

I would like to suggest that the process (and that very question) gets
adopted in this case as our official way to decide what to write for the
Homepage.

As you know Vilfredo ends only when there is a full consensus. On the other
side at each generation we can have multiple proposals in the Pareto Front.
And when we reach a consensus, we can even reach a consensus with more than
1 proposal winning.

My suggestion is that at the end of each generation we change the homepage
using the proposals that are in the Pareto Front AND have the maximum of
the votes.

When this is more than one proposal, they should be represented side by
side (until the next generation when the situation would be solved).

Of course this would bring a homepage that changes quite often at the
beginning, but eventually it would become stable.


PLEASE REPLY TO THIS PROPOSAL TO VOTE, ADDING YOUR NAME.


PRO: Pietro,
AGAINST:
