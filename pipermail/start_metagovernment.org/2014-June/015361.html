It *is* a nice system, and has a lot more functionality than Loomio,
but unfortunately IMHO is just not ready for use a decisionmaking
system yet.  There are just too many little broken things (translation
failures, the very-nice tutorials that just stop allowing progress at
some point, the need to repeatedly log in when you try to navigate,
etc.)

I voted against the &quot;proposal&quot; but couldn't find any way to actually
edit it.  Neither Airesis nor Loomio is ready (or maybe even designed)
to do what some of you seem to be expecting them to do, which is to
support collaboration on *generating* proposals.  This is what wikis
are for, albeit IMHO they are solving this problem in a way that is
simply inappropriate for political projects (i.e., any project where
what is being debated are peoples *opinions* on things, not merely
facts, which is the reason Wikipedia works but most other wikis,
including the metagovernment site,  don't).

My design on proposal generation is that *one person* is responsible
for a proposal and that they alone assume the responsibility for
updating it based on feedback from anyone who reads it.  The design of
the system has to include ways for normal users to communicate
questions and suggestions to the proposer but not necessarily to allow
them to edit the proposal themselves.  Loomio will support this
(albeit clumsily) but we need someone to step up to be the one
responsible for managing the process.  If no one volunteers, I
nominate whoever took down the Metagovernment home page on the grounds
that they took responsibility for seeing this process through when
they did so.  There have been lots of good suggestions of what the new
page should contain, please someone just integrate those into a
proposal and put it up on Loomio...
  Regards,
    Scott
