<PRE>Steve Coffman said:
&gt;<i> I want to try them all. I say we set up a stack and begin moving
</I>&gt;<i> through them one by one. I&#8217;m not as interested in the task of
</I>&gt;<i> filling the homepage as I am in familiarizing myself with the tools
</I>&gt;<i> and their architecture. But we could use the next one to conjure a
</I>&gt;<i> vision statement, and then the next for a mission statement&#8230;..and so
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>
Most of them (50 or so) have little in the way of new ideas.  They
don't help much in building consensus.  The few with ideas tend to be
experimental things, difficult to use.  I've already tried all the
ones that looked interesting to me.  I may have missed some.  A new
one appears every year, or so, that looks interesting.

Intermix is interesting.  Vilfredo is interesting.  MixedInk is (or
was) interesting...  and maybe a few others that slip my mind.  There
are also off-line methods, which I'm less familiar with.

I'm sorry to sound negative, Steve.  The good news, of course, is that
we can be the first to make something that really works.

Mike
