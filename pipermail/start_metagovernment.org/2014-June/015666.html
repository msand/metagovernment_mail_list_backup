<PRE>Hi Mike,

I think both &quot;decision without deliberation&quot; and &quot;deliberation without
decision&quot; are real problems.  The former plunges us into wars, crisis and
messes of all sorts, the latter is fiddling while Rome burns.  If your
point is that decision without deliberation is worse, I'll accept it.

An enormous topic you mention in your comment is that of authority.  The
&quot;lifeless machine&quot; and its decision cycle have authority over us.  You
claim that the system will take its cues from the public, which I'd like to
believe.  But not all systems are democratic, and not all democratic
systems are honest.  We don't have to look beyond newspaper headlines to
see examples of authorities enforcing their will at the point of a gun over
the public.  I think our chances of success are higher working in
cooperation with existing authority systems rather than seeking to dominate
them.

Something about our conversation reminded me of this old (2000) article
from David Brin imagining online tools for deliberation and decision.
Still insightful 14 years later: <A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/disputation.html</A>

I need to run but will chime in with additional thoughts as they
percolate...

Mark

</I>&gt;<i> You employ strong images here, Mark, but I disagree with your message.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem we face is not deliberation without decision, but decision
</I>&gt;<i> without deliberation.  Society is ruled by a lifeless machine whose
</I>&gt;<i> decisions make no sense.  You propose to hook living, breathing people
</I>&gt;<i> up to that machine as though it were a benefit to them, like an
</I>&gt;<i> artificial respirator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel certain that the public will be strong enough to deliberate the
</I>&gt;<i> issues independently, taking no cue from the decision system or any
</I>&gt;<i> other authority.  The system will instead take *its cues* from the
</I>&gt;<i> public.  When public deliberations result in a consensus, then the
</I>&gt;<i> decision system will obey that consensus and decide accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Society's enforcement of decisions (laws and executive orders) is
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate only so long as freedom of speech is respected.  It follows
</I>&gt;<i> that the decision machine must keep its scaly tentacles out of our
</I>&gt;<i> free deliberations.  It must not attempt to rule them in any way.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the feedback Max.  To me, the difference between waterfall and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agile development is the frequency of the iteration.  Nothing about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process described suggests a waterfall approach.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael, your comment
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I agree that *decisions* can be formalized as distinct steps, but not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deliberations.  Deliberations are unconstrained (if valid) and cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily be turned on and off.  They tend to have a life of their own.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think deliberation is ongoing, but that when it's set against a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time-based decision cycle it will take on a character rather like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breathing.  Increasing in inputs and interest in a lead-up to a decision,
