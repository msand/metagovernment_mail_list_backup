Seems like you&#8217;re making a bit of an assumption here Ed. I&#8217;d like to hear from Alex what his point was&#8230;.'specifically'.

&gt;<i> I seek not to lock us into one platform
</I>
Except maybe e-mail and the wiki?  I&#8217;m merely suggesting that we try out each available platform for a given period of time. Move around a bit&#8230;.test, suggest, collaborate. Perhaps you missed that in my other e-mails.

&gt;<i> (which is not even a participant in our group),
</I>
Does it really matter whether *they* are a participant in *our* group. Their group is open to everyone&#8230;.as is ours. We are all in this together. Lot&#8217;s of room for cross pollination I would say.

&gt;<i> but to experiment, try out different platforms, explore flexibility.
</I>
Exactly!

&gt;<i> Loomio has a great-looking interface, but it is rigid and inflexible in some of its underpinnings. 
</I>
I believe they would wholeheartedly agree with you. They are just getting started&#8230;.you of all people should know these things take time. If there is any inflexibility on this issue, I would say it has found a very comfortable home on this list.    ;-)

&gt;<i> Other platforms have strengths that it does not.
</I>
And vice versa. Let&#8217;s try it out and help them to make *their* platform better.  Really though, at some point we must examine the glaring irony of a group that's all about designing systems for global democracy&#8230;.but is mostly unwilling to consider collaborating with *another* group.  Aren&#8217;t we all in this together?  It seems to me that the people on *our* [MG] list would have a lot to offer *those* people developing Loomio.   The resistance to doing so is highly suspect&#8230;.in my mind.

&gt;<i> For this group to know when a proposal is being presented, we need a broadcast technology (i.e., this email list), not a destination where people must check periodically. My primary objective is to give us some uniformity so that the casual observer can tell when a new proposal is presented, and when people are replying to it.
</I>
I get an email every time a new discussion thread begins in any Loomio group I am a part of&#8230;.or when a proposal has been made&#8230;.or when a proposal is about to close.  You would too if you signed up.  ;-)

&gt;<i> The wiki is not perfect, but we have to sacrifice some perfection for flexibility.
</I>
Indeed (on the wiki not being perfect).  In my mind, being flexible would look like being open to trying something new&#8230;..maybe even helping *them* out a bit as well.

I don&#8217;t get the resistance on this list to using Loomio for a while (or Airesis, or Vilfredo, or Blinap, or whatever). Is it an ego thing (&#8220;my system is different, better, or more uniquely special&#8221;), or a proprietary thing (&#8220;I can&#8217;t make any money helping someone else with their platform&#8221;)? 

The planet is on it&#8217;s way to becoming a piece of toast. E democracy is perhaps the only hope for creating the kind of culture that can turn that around. E democracy is all about developing means of collaboration&#8230;.coming up with solutions *together*. And we&#8217;re still talking about us and them&#8230;.&#8221;ours&quot; and &#8220;theirs&#8221;.   I suppose one might find this humorous, if it wasn&#8217;t so fucking perplexing.
