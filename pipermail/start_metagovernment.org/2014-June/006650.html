<PRE>Today I researched the current status of what is know by people who run
serious meetings as ROR.  Having one in your back pocket at a meeting is
sort of like brushing your teeth before a hot date.  It is a common
parliamentary authority that is 150 years old.  The 11th edition covers
email meetings as so on.

Much of the abuse in this mailing list is covered by solutions therein even
in the older editions.

I am in the US.  There is something similar up North.  Pretty much in the
English speaking world if you do not have an different authority explicitly
then you can cite to the ROR as less than authorative but reliable.

Scott would hate it so I can like it right there.  He is right though that
you can run a railroad with it.  This is slang for the chair cheating.

I am thinking of taking the 1915 out of copyright version and drop it on a
shared edit platform for modifying.  I may do that after deciding on the
licensing.

But here is a useful suggestion IMO.  Per ROR there is a treatment on what
constitutes a valid and binding vote including how to change validly what
constitutes a valid and binding vote.  Hint.  Ed wins maybe.

Otherwise I did notice what seems to be a going web concern that has real
voting  with staff and encryption and maybe even paying clients.  And they
would run a ten member club vote for free.  And they have multiple voting
schemes.  They do not have discussion software.  Figure it will take a long
time to get from a decision here to a vote through them but that is fine.

I suggest you use ROR as your informal authority and make it your formal
authority.  And then use whatever to make further decisions and then run
the decision through a commercial vote system.  This two step approach is
supported by ROR.

The good thing is that people make their living making ROR decisions.  If
you can get to just a few decisions then you can maybe get a ROR expert to
help you get further.
