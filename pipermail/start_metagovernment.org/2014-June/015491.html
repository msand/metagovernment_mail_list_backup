<PRE>Dear Steve,
dear Reid,
you raise some very important points here.

Some about Vilfredo, some about the user interface, and some about its
current uses.

Indeed this is an exciting time for me, and we are gathering lots of
feedback.

I shall try to answer you point by point, although it might be a bit long.
Please bear with me.

</I>&gt;<i> My primary problem with Vilfredo though is the lack of actual debate
</I>&gt;<i> between answers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has been a sticking point for me for an incredibly long time. If you
</I>go back to the first discussions we had about Vilfredo at the beginning,
also there there was a request for the possibility to comment to proposals.
To the point that if you look at one of the first basic questions where
this community got involved, the Wall of Text question, some proposals were
actual comments, not meant to be voted. This was how much needed it.

Still it was important for me that the discussion be integrated inside the
Vilfredo process.

Vilfredo works basically by:
let people propose
let people vote
filter the proposal
use the filtered proposals as a feedback mechanism to the community
let people propose
...

If people can discuss proposal outside, there is the risk that this might
take away some of the power of the filter. Which is the only thing that
prevents the participant to drift around (like in a normal discussion
group, where the person that writes more has more power), but be focused in
a fair way to all participants.


The solution to this eventually was to have the comments integrated with
the voting. In this version, when you vote against, or that you do not
understand, you explain your perplexities.

In the next version, which is actually present, but still full of bugs
participants can make points pro and against each proposal. As well as ask
questions (to which the author can answer).


&#8203;

I am not sure if the image that I am inserting above will appear, but this
is from a version of Vilfredo that we developed after the one you are
using. But that never reached the debug stage, as no one was using Vilfredo
at the moment so we preferred to move and and focus to the next big
release, Vilfredo2.0. Which will make so many changes, and is being written
in another language (from php to python) that the code was going to be
rewritten in any case.

there is no recorded conversation, from what I can
&gt;<i> tell, of how the proposals needed to be altered to find acceptance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're able to voice your opinion in the voting stage but afterwards
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the comments disappear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Not really, there might be a problem with the user interface. On the top
right of each proposal there is a little icon of a man speaking. If you
click on it you can read the comments. Also when you click on &quot;mutate&quot; to
change a new proposal based on an existing one, on the right of the screen
you will find all the comments that have been given, so you can use them to
guide you in writing a new version.

We want to make better forms of collaboration possible, but as you  might
have picked up by now, I am very slow and quite retentive in making sure
each element is well integrated with the rest. And does not give to any
participant an unfair advantage.

What's more is the proposer is not able to
&gt;<i> defend themselves from the criticism their proposal receives, they
</I>&gt;<i> just have to take it and hope that they are able to fine tune it
</I>&gt;<i> enough next round to gain these anonymous users approval.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. The phrase is no feedback on feedback. And that is actually a feature
</I>and not a bug ;-)

You need
&gt;<i> conversation, you need to debate ideas sometimes, to refute certain
</I>&gt;<i> claims and uncover certain truths.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here you raise another important point. The important difference between
</I>facts versus opinion. And the role of experts who (supposedly) should be
the one knowing the facts, on which the participant should base their
opinions. So far we have not faced this problem at all. But I am very much
aware that it is there. Again, this is a well known limit in Vilfredo, and
it is one of the reasons why I advocate Vilfredo only in a group of peers,
for now.


&gt;<i> People need to be able to track the
</I>&gt;<i> debates and decide where the rational lies for either side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, indeed they do. And indeed Vilfredo for now is not able to do it.
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m having the same issues in terms of the lack of coherent discussion
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities. I voted for some proposals even though I have issues with
</I>&gt;<i> them (including my own) and would like to be able to make a comment about
</I>&gt;<i> my reservations&#8230;.as well as to read those of the other voters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As I said before, this is not available in this version. If people feel it
is very important, on monday I can ask Derek to work on debugging that
version of Vilfredo where people can write comments in favor and against,
instead of working on Vilfredo 2.0.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe instead of having a (?) specific button it could be more
</I>&gt;<i> generic&#8230;.for questions, or comments, or even amendment suggestions for the
</I>&gt;<i> next generation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Please see above.


&gt;<i>  Also, why does the *big (green) thumb* show so dominant even before I
</I>&gt;<i> vote. Seems like it should only be there after voting???
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is another very important element. In the first version of Vilfredo,
each proposal was an empty tick box, and you could tick it to vote for it.
So the default option was &quot;against&quot; (there was no ? at the beginning). This
had a big fault on the fact that people would vote in a traditional way,
where they would just tick the box of their proposal (or of one proposal)
and submit. They were expecting the vote to be counted by being summed. But
the votes in Vilfredo are MUCH more powerful. Basically every against you
vote is a veto you give. No amount of me saying: &quot;vote for all that you can
accept&quot; was enough. The implicit education of years of plurality voting
would make people just ignore it. So the system would not reach a small
Pareto Front but an unnecessary big one.

For this reason we turned the voting around. The default of YES. In Italy
we say: Silence is equivalent of assent (chi tace acconsente). And voting
no has a cost. You must say why you are against a proposal. Indeed this
raises the work necessary for people who participate, and makes consensus
easier to reach. Not a bad deal.

In Vilfredo2.0 the people who do not understand a proposal will be treated
differently than now. As a result, people who did not read a proposal will
be considered as a &quot;?&quot; and not as a &quot;YES&quot;.

But for now the default is YES.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your recent (thorough) responses Pietro. I imagine this is both
</I>&gt;<i> exciting and challenging for you to track. Personally I&#8217;m really gaining a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of ground here in my understanding of what&#8217;s possible&#8230;and maybe some of
</I>&gt;<i> what&#8217;s not. I'm appreciating your work as well as your willingness to bare
</I>&gt;<i> it to such a bitchy bunch of geeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If you are willing to read my long responses... :-)
&gt;<i>From my point of view, it has been quite frustrating doing such a long
</I>work, without a real community using it, yet. People trying it out, and
moving on because something is not as they like it. But me being unable to
just add their idea because it breaks something else, or it is not in line
with how fair I want the product to be. I need a community using Vilfredo,
that has the patience to see it develop gradually.

Cheers,
Pietro
