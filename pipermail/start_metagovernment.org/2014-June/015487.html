In truth, I feel it is.  You wrote a masterpiece here.  Alone
(especially alone) it would pull people into the group.


    OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

    Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
    re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
    choose between the lesser of a few evils.

    We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want to
    use technology to work on these issues together when it is
    convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having society
    work together.

    Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss and
    work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
    governments and societies.


&gt;<i> ... I would prefer to not see this old text on the home page now
</I>&gt;<i> even though it is better than a blank page.  I would prefer to not
</I>&gt;<i> have the page change then change again so quickly. ...
</I>
No great danger of that!  We'll be lucky if we ever have a home page,
never mind one so heartfelt and appealing as this.

I think the challenge is to put something up there (anything) without
trampling over each other in the process.  Then we'll experience a sea
change.  We'll feel different, and be ready for the next challenge.

&gt;<i> Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You bring up some interesting points about participation by people not in
</I>&gt;<i> the system being used. We do need to decide if to make a decision official
</I>&gt;<i> it also has to go to a vote in the email list or if the rule of the system
</I>&gt;<i> being used are sufficient. I'm equally torn. People should not be forced to
</I>&gt;<i> us a system they don't like but also using these system,s is a core of
</I>&gt;<i> MetaGovernment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  I think everyone is open to other decisions being made in other systems or
</I>&gt;<i> the email list. The concern is making two very similar systems in two
</I>&gt;<i> different systems in a similar time period.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree with your proposal specifically because the text is not
</I>&gt;<i> complete. Not because of the system being used. I voted for it in Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> because I was learning how it works. I'm a little disappointing that I can
</I>&gt;<i> only vote up or down on an item. I would refer a ranking. I imagine that
</I>&gt;<i> would make the math exponentially harder. I voted for the best several
</I>&gt;<i> proposals so they would move to the next round but I do not think any are
</I>&gt;<i> done. I have proposed a new version with text taken from other items and
</I>&gt;<i> some items removed. I would prefer to not see this old text on the home
</I>&gt;<i> page now even though it is better than a blank page. I would prefer to not
</I>&gt;<i> have the page change then change again so quickly. I don't think I will
</I>&gt;<i> agree to a proposal on the home page until I can drink up the other ideas
</I>&gt;<i> and build an informed opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my experience Home Pages are one of the most contentious issues in group
</I>&gt;<i> governance. If we can make it through this we will be in a good place.
