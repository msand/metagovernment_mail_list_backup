<PRE>I guess it's a technical dispute, Pietro, and none of us is an expert.
We could ask the experts to help us resolve it:
<A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/</A>

But I think it's moot.  There's no way to force a particular design of
straw poll on the population.  So we'll have a bunch of straw-polling
sites and methods, and each individual will choose whichever one suits
his/her personal needs and preferences.

Generally I think there's never anything to fight about in our field.
The challenge instead is to focus on how we can cooperate.

&gt;<i> yes, we are speaking single winner, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Plurality practically never reaches the Condorcet winner. Not even if you
</I>&gt;<i> go through several rounds.
</I>&gt;<i> Plurality can be gamed easily with strategic voting.
</I>&gt;<i> Plurality is very weak against cloning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only reason why plurality is good is because it is the most anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> form of voting. And it is good for people who want to keep the status quo
</I>&gt;<i> by making fake elections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea how you can find plurality to be ideal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I really do not see how this would be different for straw polls
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_poll">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_poll</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In fact intuitively I would expect a continuous system which is weak
</I>&gt;<i> against strategic voting to have the effect to polarise the community into
</I>&gt;<i> two groups that hate each other. Like on Amazon reviews tend to get more
</I>&gt;<i> and more extreme for the same book (there was a paper on this, sorry I do
</I>&gt;<i> not have the reference).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I realise: if you see our democracies as a continuos, several
</I>&gt;<i> years long straw poll, the result is indeed this polarisation.
</I>&gt;<i>
