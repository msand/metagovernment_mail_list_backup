<PRE>Come Ned, try to be fair.  You and Pietro (and now Bentley) confess to
voting against this proposal *not because you disagree with it*, but
because you no longer want people in the list to participate.  The
home page is now to be decided using Vilfredo's process *alone*.  This
is your aim.  Anyone in the list who attempts to participate is doing
an &quot;end-run&quot; around the process, and is guilty of &quot;very incorrect&quot;
behaviour and outright &quot;cheating&quot;.  You will therefore vote against a
good proposal *just in order to kill the process*.

&gt;<i> ... Try making another proposal.  Perhaps it will attract more
</I>&gt;<i> support than this one has. ...
</I>
This one already had lots of support in Vilfredo.  Now it has none.
Apparently we can no longer make proposals from the list.

Why not live and let live, Ned?  We thought to put something agreeable
on the home page as a temporary stopgap, a step forward.  You saw us
making the effort and somehow it bothered you.  You hurried over and
threw a wrench in the process.  Now when I protest, you taunt me.

How if I return the favour by blocking Vilfredo?  Where are we then?

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I confess to being a little confused. You made a proposal (quite 
</I>&gt;<i> properly from the perspective of &quot;traditional&quot; metagovernment practice), 
</I>&gt;<i> and Pietro and I voted against it (again quite properly -- in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;traditional&quot; metagovernment vote-count system we don't need no stinkin' 
</I>&gt;<i> reasons in order for our votes to be valid). Your problem is that the 
</I>&gt;<i> vote has been going against you, not that you are being &quot;improperly&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> forced or denied. Try making another proposal. Perhaps it will attract 
</I>&gt;<i> more support than this one has. (In super-majority systems, minorities 
</I>&gt;<i> routinely feel &quot;forced and denied&quot; -- welcome to the club.)
