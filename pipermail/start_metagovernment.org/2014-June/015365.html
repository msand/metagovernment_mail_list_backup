<PRE>I ran across several of these in my explorations, but when it came
down to it they were basically just web-oriented drawing tools.
Unless you can also prototype the interactivity it might be enough to
get budget authorization or grant approval (which is what the target
market for those tools seems to be) but it's really not going to be
sufficient to gain any understanding of how the released version of
these systems will actually work.  Even after decades of experience,
I'm still amazed at how often my first attempt at building something
is totally disappointing and exposes some crucial misunderstanding of
the issues involved.  Worse, I get to have that exact same experience
again when I deploy an alpha-test and people provide feedback about
how they expect it to work.

I certainly see the attraction of what you're looking for, but IMHO it
is an impossible goal: The current browser-based development
environment is just too primitive and poorly designed to ever offer
the kind of productivity you're looking for.  RunRev *is* working on a
browser-deployment tool for Livecode (converting the language to
Javascript on the fly) but I'm skeptical that it will ever be viable
except for niche-type products that are currently served by Flash
applications.  The only reason I'm not totally pessimistic about our
chances is that I've been using Android a lot lately and it's driving
the market away from web-based apps and back to downloaded apps in a
big way and IMHO this is the future because life is just too short,
and our needs for new and better applications too large, for *anyone*
to have to resort to programming in Javascript and HTML.
  Regards,
    Scott
