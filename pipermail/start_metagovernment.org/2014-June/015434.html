It's not a lack of bravery (but thanks for the backhanded insult), but rather a lack of time, as I have already made abundantly clear repeatedly.

As for comparing me to Adolf Hitler (quite likely the most evil person of the recent era if not ever... thanks again for the implied insult?), your comparison contains the answer: Hitler had tanks and I have nothing.

I have no authority over you, and you can do whatever you want. I am not Hitler imposing myself on you; nor is any other member of this group. The group is the community of people who are generally agreeing on some basic things, and communities are defined by their history as well as their membership. Our beginning premise and our continuing tradition is one of consensus and almost always of unanimity among current participants on our email list server. If you think there should be a community that works on minority rule on Loomio, then that is another group: go start it.

And therein lies the rest of the answer to your question above. Replacing the status quo is about starting a new system and getting people to join until it becomes the prevalent system. There is no need to abide by the rules of the status quo: we will just make it irrelevant. Back when we had a home page, this was described in the Transition section:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=4031#Transition</A>

So if you wish to change the rules of this group, then please do the same thing: start a better group and MAKE US IRRELEVANT. But please don't say that the new rule is minority-rule and a minority is in favor that rule so it is now the law of this whole community. That is much more tyrannical than anything any of us have proposed here.
