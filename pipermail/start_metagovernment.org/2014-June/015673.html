<PRE>I have to admit, i do not believe in &quot;overplans&quot;.

Like i imagine a &quot;fish swarm&quot; does not have an overplan. its behavior
emerges from all the single fishes following their neighbors ...somehow...
and patterns emerge and evolve through feedback over time.

I think it might be possible that something like an &quot;overplan&quot; will emerge,
but it is not necessary and might also depends on peoples values in general
and what kind of life they would like to live or however that evolves.

What you describe is some kind of &quot;waterfall&quot; planning model, but under
incomplete information which is the common case, everything has to change
frequently and often... so even that kind of vocabulary and top-down
approach you are introducing leads easily into the wrong kind of thoughts i
would imagine. Reading it feels like some kind of universal truth approach
something... ...which might actually evolve or not but its actually not
important if it does or not.
My perspective is, that it is not necessary to anticipate it.

I cannot really express how i see stuff, but speaking more
&quot;analogy/pattern/feeling&quot; like, i imagine that we come up with some &quot;micro
mechanisms&quot; roughly in the sense that fish swarms orient, but these &quot;micro
patterns&quot; are crafted so carefully, so that bigger organizational patterns
emerge from that.

One of those mechanisms which exists today, is money and every day
transactions in which all the people participate all the time...
given all the rules and mechanics that apply to those micro transactions,
there are bigger patterns which emerge from that because the &quot;micro rules&quot;
are like they are.

so i do not really see the need for BIG UPFRONT PLANNING, but more to apply
stuff to some kind of micro environment but with scalability in mind :-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or can anyone see how we might follow those steps faithfully, yet
