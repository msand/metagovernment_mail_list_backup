<PRE>By now you should all have received this email (check the spam folder if
not. Mine arrives out of the spam folder but google signals it as an email
&quot;probably spam&quot;. Please help me to raise google evaluation, by explaining
that it is not spam!). My message follows after the mail:

Subject: VgtA: What sentences/paragraphs/lists shall we put on the
Metagovernment Home Page?

Hello,
 The question: What sentences/paragraphs/lists shall we put on the
Metagovernment
Home Page?

 has just been updated.
We are now in Generation=2.

You can now see the minimum set of proposal on which everybody agrees.
If you think you can propose something better,
that would satisfy more people,
please do so. Here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>

------------------------------------------------------------

There is a few informations that are missing. So let me add them:

1) if you are a key player you have received an email suggesting you to
rewrite a proposal you did not like.

2) If you are not a key player or if regardless of the key player status
you wish to keep on writing:
if you agree with 2 or more proposals in the Pareto Front, you can try to
merge them

3) If there is a proposal you did not like, but you think it is quite
easily mendable, please do so, and post the new version.

Cheers,
Pietro
