You employ strong images here, Mark, but I disagree with your message.
The problem we face is not deliberation without decision, but decision
without deliberation.  Society is ruled by a lifeless machine whose
decisions make no sense.  You propose to hook living, breathing people
up to that machine as though it were a benefit to them, like an
artificial respirator.

I feel certain that the public will be strong enough to deliberate the
issues independently, taking no cue from the decision system or any
other authority.  The system will instead take *its cues* from the
public.  When public deliberations result in a consensus, then the
decision system will obey that consensus and decide accordingly.

Society's enforcement of decisions (laws and executive orders) is
legitimate only so long as freedom of speech is respected.  It follows
that the decision machine must keep its scaly tentacles out of our
free deliberations.  It must not attempt to rule them in any way.

&gt;<i> Thanks for the feedback Max.  To me, the difference between waterfall and

</I>&gt;<i> Michael, your comment
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I agree that *decisions* can be formalized as distinct steps, but not
</I>&gt;<i> deliberations.  Deliberations are unconstrained (if valid) and cannot
</I>&gt;<i> easily be turned on and off.  They tend to have a life of their own.&quot;
