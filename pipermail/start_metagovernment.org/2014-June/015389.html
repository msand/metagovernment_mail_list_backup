Metagovernment being a case in point ;-)

&gt;<i>   There will always be the possibility of a single

</I>
Hence the need for a relatively low threshold for revolution.  The
issue of Cheney (and Bush) wasn't just their selfish behavior (though
that too is characteristic of authoritarians: See Altemeyer's &quot;Global
Change Game&quot; experiments where the high RWA subject took significantly
more money from the public funds and put it into their own pockets).
The bigger problems are their prejudice and their verifiable
irrationality when their safety or resources are threatened.  The end
result (two (unnecessary) wars, economic collapse, etc.) show that
Bush/Cheney are just living stereotypes for authoritarian behavior.
The only thing lacking were public displays of prejudice, but I guess
that just means the Political Correctness movement does have *some*
value...

&gt;<i> Whereas with a simple majority rule, it&#8217;s seems that every individual is
</I>&gt;<i> always facing the possibility of being *easily ruled out* and is therefore
</I>&gt;<i> less likely to participate when their views are perceived to be those of the
</I>&gt;<i> minority.
</I>
Tyranny of the majority is going to be an issue in *any* democratic
system.  But IMHO it's orthogonal to the question of &quot;What is a
legitimate revolution?&quot;

&gt;<i> On the one hand, the majority fears the power of the individual to hold
</I>&gt;<i> things up, or manipulate the system in their favor.
</I>
Which is why even a simple majority is a very hard thing to achieve
when proposing a revolution, and why of course it is *sufficient* as a
decision rule.

&gt;<i> On the other, the individual fears the power of the majority to overlook
</I>&gt;<i> their individual views and concerns and moves towards isolation and apathy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, neither one is optimal.
</I>
Umm, I'm not seeing an answer to my question anywhere in there....
  Regards,
    Scott
