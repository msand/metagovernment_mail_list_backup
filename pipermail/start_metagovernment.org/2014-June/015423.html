<PRE>Ned Conner said:
&gt;<i> I also like the passage, but as Bentley suggests, it may be improved
</I>&gt;<i> as the Vilfredo process proceeds.
</I>
Maybe, maybe not.  But it's already an excellent text, and excellent
texts are hard to come by.  We shouldn't reject it.  The attempt at an
improvement might take months, or might end in failure.  Meantime we
already have this excellent text.  Why not use it?

You agreed, Ned.  Now you change your mind.  You give this reason:

&gt;<i> What I mainly don't like is the attempt to do an end-run around the
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo process by trying to drag us back to casting and counting
</I>&gt;<i> votes on the email list.
</I>
An end run?  So that's your idea...  Now I see your thinking.
Vilfredo is similar to Blinap in that both require unanimity.  You
like unanimity (and dislike majority and plurality), so you thought
you might use Vilfredo to introduce a unanimous decision process.

But that wouldn't be right.  Vilfredo's a fine tool for brainstorming
or small-scale decision making, but we haven't agreed to use it as our
decision platform, any more than we've agreed to Loomio.  In fairness,
we must open up *all* of our decisions to people in the list, even to
non-users of Vilfredo or Loomio.  And the decision rule here is rough
consensus, not unanimity.

I put you down as a 'no', Ned, but I think your reasons are invalid.
I hope you change your mind.  We can continue to brainstorm and build
consensus with the Vilfredo process even while we add content to the
home page with our decision process.  The two processes are not
mutually exclusive, as you imply.  They can run in parallel without
blocking each other.  Both are useful and valid and neither can mount
an &quot;end-run&quot; around the other.

Currently:


   PROPOSAL 3
   ----------
   Atop the home page, add Bentley's 'stifled' text:

       OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

       Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
       re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
       choose between the lesser of a few evils.

       We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want
       to use technology to work on these issues together when it is
       convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having
       society work together.

       Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss
       and work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
       governments and societies.

   Then leave the door open to further proposals, changes and content.
