<PRE>Bentley, Jacopo and Pietro,

&gt;<i> Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i> You said &quot;Too generalist&quot; which is unfortunately too general for my
</I>&gt;<i> little mind. What would you like to add to be more specific. If I
</I>&gt;<i> find it needed I will remove my approval of this item.

This is a gem.  Who wrote this, please?  Where does it come from?

   OUR LIVES ARE STIFLED BY A BROKEN POLITICAL SYSTEM

   Our politicians spend more time bickering and trying to get
   re-elected instead of solving issues.  We can only periodically
   choose between the lesser of a few evils.

   We want to have the option of being directly involved.  We want to
   use technology to work on these issues together when it is
   convenient for us.  We want to explore new ways of having society
   work together.

   Metagovernment is group of people coming together to discuss and
   work on ideas and technologies to improve our dysfunctional
   governments and societies.


Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> I have to admit I understand Jacopo's position when he says that
</I>&gt;<i> 2650 is too general. It is more like an introductions. So I am very
</I>&gt;<i> happy for it to be in the Pareto Front, so it will be an important
</I>&gt;<i> ingredient in the next generation. But not the sole winner.
</I>
It's a gem, though.  It has balance and clarity.  Maybe we should just
grab it?

Vilfredo's good at surfacing little gems like this.  Maybe we can
build up the home page one gem at a time?  Then we'd have lots of
winners, not just one.

After all, if we put this text to a vote here in the list, then it'll
probably win a consensus.  But if we put anything big and clumsy to a
vote, then it'll most likely get torn apart.
