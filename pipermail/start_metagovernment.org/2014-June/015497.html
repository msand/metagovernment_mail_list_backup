<PRE>As this experience with Vilfredo is progressing, let me add another layer
of complexity.

In a normal election, when you are trying to elect one candidate out of a
n, there are basically n possible results. And usually m people voting,
with m much bigger than n. The result is that no person can singularly
change the result of the election.

In Vilfredo we are not looking for a single winner, but for a set of
winners (the famous Pareto Front). And if we have n candidates, the number
of possible Pareto Front that can be extracted is 2^n (two elevated to n),
which is usually a big number, often much bigger than m, even when m is
much bigger then n. So 2^n &gt; m &gt; n. So each person by changing their vote
can change the result. It will not able to control fully the result. It
will always be some change among the possibles. But no person can say that
his vote did not matter.

Let us make an example. In our case we are having 7 person participating.
25 proposals. In our case the number of voters is even smaller than the
number of proposals, so each of us have a direct effect on the result. But
it is even more so considering that the number of possible results is 2^25=
33,554,432 (thirty-three million five hundred fifty-four thousands four
hundred thirty-two - spelled out sounds even bigger :-) )

Inevitably the vote of each of us has a huge effect on the result. And
since we have such a huge result, and since it is all math base, we can
measure it.

After each generation there is a page that is produced automatically that
summarises what has happened in that generation. I have not introduced it
before because I did not want to flood you with information. But the page
for the first generation was <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1</A> (I will
show you where the link is, in an email soon).

If we look at that first generation, there were 11 proposals, 7
participants, 2^11= 2048 possible results.

Each participant effect can be seen here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1#Effect">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1#Effect</A>

In other words here we can read how would the result have changed if each
of us has not voted. Some people did not change the Pareto Front (Ned and
Steve), but everybody else did. For example Bentley added the proposal 2649
with his vote. And also Ned and Steve &quot;could&quot; have changed the Pareto Front
if they voted differently. For example Steve voted on that generation for
every proposal. If you vote for every proposal you are sure not to affect
the result.

For this reason it is important in Vilfredo to consider your vote, and
consider not just what you like, but how by voting differently you can
change the Pareto Front. Not all changes are possible. But among the
changes that you can reach, is the actual result the one you like most.

If everybody does this, the result will be among the thousands (or
millions) of possible results THE Nash equilibrium of the community. Not a
bad result indeed :-).

Soon (in less than 1 hour) we are going to move to the third generation.
This will happen, independently of Ned, as we have reached the maximum time
that Ned established at the beginning, when he posed the question. Can you
guess once we open the generation page for the second generation, was the
effect of your vote was? How did you change the result?


Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Scott,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Bentley:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> every generation some proposals of the previous generation go to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> next generation. From a mathematical point of view, those are the Pareto
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Front. The proposal that are not-dominated by any other proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In our case only 4 proposals were in the Pareto Front. We then wrote 21
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (twentyone!!!) new proposals :-), and so one we have to evaluate each of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  those 21+4=25 proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have seen that someone (Ned, I gather) have started writing proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> expressing parts of the homepage. Unfortunately Vilfredo does not work in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this way. Basically the domination system that makes sure that one proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dominates another under certain conditions makes only sense if the two
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposals are trying to answer the same question. Semantically speaking. So
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you can substitute one proposal for the other. When this is not the case,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the result is much less meaningful. You might end up finding a full
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus over a small part of what you are working on. This is the reason
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> why I explained at the beginning that Vilfredo works well for &quot;how shall
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we&quot; kind of question. In other words question where we are looking for a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> single answer (maybe complex). But not a list of elements more or less
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> independently structure. If we want to use Vilfredo in this way, we should
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> open a separate question for each element. For example if we agree to have
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a specific structure made of &quot;mission, vision, projects, ... &quot; then for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> each of them we can ask: &quot;what is the mission of Vilfredo to insert in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> homepage?&quot;. (which is not a how, but it is still a question where you are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> looking for a single winning proposal).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Scott:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> There were some suggestions from you (Scott), to evaluate the proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with a 10 star system. It is interesting, but first you would need to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> understand the way Vilfredo works. What you are suggesting is something
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> similar to Range Voting. A slightly better version of that would be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Majority Judgment. But regardless, Vilfredo uses a completely different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> method. We DO NOT sum the votes. Instead we declare that a proposal A
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> dominates a proposal B iff (if and only if) the set of people that vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> B is a subset of the people that vote for A. So it is not just that A has
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> more support, but it is also supported by the same people. So each person
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that like B will also be happy if we pass A. Then the Pareto Front is the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> set of the non-dominated proposals.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In this way you can be sure that whoever votes in Vilfredo, will find at
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> least one of the proposals he voted for in the Pareto Front. Because if you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voted for B, and A dominates B, so that A is in the Pareto Front. Then you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> MUST have also voted for A, so you are still represented in the Pareto
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Front. For this reason you can say that the Pareto Front represents the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> community :-).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The next version of Vilfredo will use a mixed system. People will vote
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> on an inverted triangle to say how much they like and they understand a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. Then a first approximation will be used to find the Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And in situations where several proposals are competing (especially if no
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> one is presenting new ideas) the actual position in the triangle will be
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> used. It is much more complex, which is why its development is so slow.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Finally consider looking at the Pareto Front, looking at how you vote,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and how by changing your vote you can slightly change the Pareto Front. We
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are releasing this information (the graph, how other people votes)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> specifically so that people can change their vote and look for a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> P.S. I wrote a proposal suggesting that this Vilfredo consultation was
