<PRE>Alexander Praetorius said: *
&gt;<i> i think the post that triggered this was about some alternatives to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;digital democracy&quot; in general, namely &quot;money&quot;, which is a form of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, where votes are not automatically re-gained over time,
</I>&gt;<i> but have to be re-earned after they are spent
</I>
Actually it was triggered here in Metagov.  I realized that I don't
understand what Steve is trying to accomplish with a 'test stack'.  I
don't know his plan, or how a test stack would fit into it.  And I
don't know the plans of the toolmakers who's tools we'd be testing.
And they probably don't know mine.  So I thought it would be useful to
expose these various plans, their steps, and who's working on them.
Does anyone else in Metagov think it would be useful?

* Alex refers to a discussion between me and the Pirate Martin Stolze,
  to which I reposted this suggestion of comparing step-wise plans:

  ... etc, a bunch of other Pirate lists I'm not on (I'm not a Pirate)
