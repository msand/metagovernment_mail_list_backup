<PRE>I'm going to jump in here. This is a problem in my mind, there is
never an end to the question in Vilfredo, nothing is ever final so
nothing can ever move forward. Even if it magically reaches consensus
one time another person can just come in repropose an alternative and
the whole process starts again. Forcing old users that considered the
question answered to come back, revisit the multiple new answers, and
decide again that the old one was still the best. If they don't do
that then the new opinion gets there way as no one could be bothered
to reinforce old answer again. It's too much constant busy work and
the average person will not have the patience for it. As I understand
it the whiniest eventually get their way if they're persistent enough.
This does not seem like a credible system for the future to me.

It's cool to see Vilfredo in action but as a few have mentioned
already, and as we can see with the homepage question, the structure
quickly turns to chaos once more than a couple dozen participant sign
up to answer a question. This system's not practical in any larger
scale and therefore is kind of meaningless as a tool for comprehensive
open source governance.

My primary problem with Vilfredo though is the lack of actual debate
between answers, there is no recorded conversation, from what I can
tell, of how the proposals needed to be altered to find acceptance.
You're able to voice your opinion in the voting stage but afterwards
the comments disappear. What's more is the proposer is not able to
defend themselves from the criticism their proposal receives, they
just have to take it and hope that they are able to fine tune it
enough next round to gain these anonymous users approval. You need
conversation, you need to debate ideas sometimes, to refute certain
claims and uncover certain truths. People need to be able to track the
debates and decide where the rational lies for either side. Otherwise
again, it's just the stubborn bullies who can hide away and just keep
stalling the process.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not easily, in the sense that Vilfredo does not always  reach an end result.
</I>&gt;<i> It does if there is a full consensus. But it is enough that one person makes
</I>&gt;<i> sure to vote against any popular proposal (remember any person can change
</I>&gt;<i> their vote) that a full consensus is not reached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically in the years we observed Vilfredo reach one of 3 possible results.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) full consensus, everybody is happy.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) full consensus except for one person, who generation after generation
</I>&gt;<i> will keep voting for a proposal that the others do not like, often written
</I>&gt;<i> by him. (Manuel has the long standing record here of holding his ground for
</I>&gt;<i> 17 generations)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) a real unreconciliable polarity. With some people reaching a partial
</I>&gt;<i> consensus over one proposal, other people reaching their consensus over the
</I>&gt;<i> other proposal, and nearly no one voting for both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In case 2 and 3, eventually people start to drop out because they get bored,
</I>&gt;<i> or have no ideas anymore, and the &quot;theoretical win&quot; goes to the person more
</I>&gt;<i> resilient (which actually is often what happens in the ling night meetings
</I>&gt;<i> of the UN, I heard).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all this deciding to &quot;use the result&quot; is not such an easy claim. Except
</I>&gt;<i> in case 1 (which we are not going to get, since Michael have already claimed
</I>&gt;<i> that he will &quot;block&quot; the process -his words-) what is the result?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also consider that the length of a question is not decided at the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> It is a recursive process, and it continues until people reach a consensus,
</I>&gt;<i> or keep adding ideas. It can reach a consensus in 1 generation or in 20
</I>&gt;<i> (usually 3-4 are enough).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My idea &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> that at the end of each generation we change the homepage using the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals that are in the Pareto Front AND have the maximum of the votes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When this is more than one proposal, they should be represented side by side
</I>&gt;<i> (until the next generation when the situation would be solved).
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> made sure that we had always something on the homepage, not a blank
</I>&gt;<i> homepage. Whatever we had was quite supported.  And it would become stable
</I>&gt;<i> only when the Vilfredo process became stable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe is not the best solution, but if you want to use the final Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> result, you need to first define what &quot;final&quot; and &quot;result&quot; is. The system
</I>&gt;<i> tend to get stable, but not in a way you can easily predict.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case I am happy to go a few other generations, so you and Scott and
</I>&gt;<i> Steve and Max get more and idea of how it works, and maybe you can present
</I>&gt;<i> your own proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
