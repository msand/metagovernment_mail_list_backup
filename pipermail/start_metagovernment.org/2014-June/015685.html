I appreciate the criticism, Scott, and that you have taken time to read 
Economic Direct Democracy.  I agree that inheritance issues are very 
important, but I don't believe that your criticism of my book on this 
matter is well placed. Inheritance issues are typically addressed via 
policies of federal and state governments and such policies are outside 
the domain of my book.  Rather, the book focuses only on concepts and 
mechanics of a LEDDA (Local Economic Direct Democracy Association).

Having said that, a main theme of the book is achieving a high degree of 
income equality.  These discussions focus mostly on families who earn 
below the 90th percentile of income, but one can easily imagine that if 
the LEDDA framework were to spread, in the long term it would impact 
incomes of the wealthy 10 percent also. For example, if a higher portion 
of goods and services are purchased from small to medium sized local 
businesses, and if those businesses are funded through the 
profit-neutral financial system I discuss, then profits for some large 
national corporations and their investors would likely fall.  While 
impacts on the wealthy are not directly discussed in the book, some 
impact is implied.  Also, the computer simulation study of a LEDDA that 
has been submitted for publication and referenced in the book does touch 
upon the issue.
