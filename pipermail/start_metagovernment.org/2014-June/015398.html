<PRE>Hi Steve,
yes that's the basic idea.

Vilfredo goes a few steps forward from this. In particular it analyses how
people have voted, to suggest possible actions.

For example (I will only speak about what is going on, trying not to flood
you) right now it is probably asking to Jacopo and Bentley to change their
support for a specific proposal (a different one). This because they are
the only person missing that is preventing that proposal from dominating
another one (thus simplifying the situation).
And it is suggesting to some of us, to convince them. And to do this it is
telling us what is the critic they brought to that proposal.

All those actions are in the box just under the graph.

Said that I think that we should go at least to a second generation. So I
will not contact neither Jacopo nor Bentley on this... for now.

(future versions will permit the contact to happen inside the system, so it
might even be possible to work in a group of anonymous users)

Happy you like it.


&gt;<i> So, in the next (and subsequent) phases proposals are reconstructed (by
</I>&gt;<i> humans not the software) and that keeps happening until (hopefully) one
</I>&gt;<i> proposal emerges that everyone agrees on?  Sorry, that&#8217;s probably a really
</I>&gt;<i> dumb question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Basically yes, that is the general procedure, and no it is not a dumb
question. It takes usually a lot of time to people to even catch the basic
structure inside Vilfredo.


&gt;<i> I&#8217;m going to need to watch the video again as I fairly quickly went into
</I>&gt;<i> information overload.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes. That video only focuses on the graph. Congratulations for picking up a
bit of the context. I need to make other video explaining the rest, but as
Vilfredo is being rewritten, it makes very little sense to do them now. In
Italian there are 4 video that explain it pretty much all.

Also, what type of groups are currently using this?
&gt;<i>
</I>
hmm, groups? The old metagovernment used this in its basic format, some
time ago. Also we sometimes use it to decide parts of the development,
although the development being a malignant dictatorship of the only person
who are willing to code it, does not follow well such a democratic process.
Oh, yes, also the PP-IT, the Italian Pirate Party has used it for some time
to develop one of the options that then was going to be competing with the
others developed in the more traditional way inside LQFB.



&gt;<i> Awesome&#8230;thanks Pietro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I am just a gorgeous humble mathematician trying to help.

Pietro
