<PRE>On grammar issues people can recall that the US constitution convention
(which was a runaway operation in bad faith) got the intent of the assembly
and then sent it to a style committee.  Off hand I think that was
effectively Ben and tmTom.  Thomas Jefferson certainly was the writer.  I
imagine Ben Franklin kept an eye on Tom.  I sort of figure new England up
lifter with Virginia aristocratic slaver.

The resulting implication is that there should not be Grammer nazi too
early but the intent of the assembly must be knowable.  Over here SCOTUS
looks at the legislative record to help on many rulings.  Well, once up a
time.

I confess I never turned on email from vitfredo.  So I ask:  will this tell
us intent?

&gt;<i> Unless someone asks for delay before the 24-hour timer times out, I am

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In hindsight, when Pietro suggested that we try to reduce the size of the
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto Front, I see that he put me into a &quot;be more selective&quot; mindset. That
</I>&gt;<i> then led me to think this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If you are going to be proposing a new version of an existing
</I>&gt;<i>    proposal in the next generation, it would be appropriate to vote
</I>&gt;<i>    against the existing version (since you no longer prefer it,
</I>&gt;<i>    compared to your new version). If that removes the existing version
</I>&gt;<i>    from the Pareto Front, so much the better, since the old version
</I>&gt;<i>    will not then show up in the next generation to compete against your
</I>&gt;<i>    new version. (I am trusting Pietro to correct me if I am wrong,
</I>&gt;<i>    again ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro then did correct me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Maybe Ned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Vilfredo works by asking everybody to accept everything as long as
</I>&gt;<i>    it is slightly acceptable. It will never reach a consensus if people
</I>&gt;<i>    all only accept their best and only. Basically the idea is: if
</I>&gt;<i>    everybody is as open as they can be (but not more) then a consensus
</I>&gt;<i>    can be found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Notice in this how the comments are becoming more precise. Before we
</I>&gt;<i>    would vote down something for big things. Now a wrong word can be
</I>&gt;<i>    enough to strike down a proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I wonder how Vilfredo would vote if we require people to vote up at
</I>&gt;<i>    least n proposals. With n that is 1 at the first generation. 2 at
</I>&gt;<i>    the second generation, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    If you strike down a proposal because you want to rewrite it, you
</I>&gt;<i>    are being very selective. Also in theory people should use the
</I>&gt;<i>    proposals in the Pareto Front as guidelines. So everybody knows what
</I>&gt;<i>    are the ingredients, and the Pareto Front represents the Community.
</I>&gt;<i>    So personally I would try to get the proposal I want to rewrite in
</I>&gt;<i>    the Pareto Front, and then rewrite it. If not someone could just
</I>&gt;<i>    vote down my proposal because it is a rewrite of something we
</I>&gt;<i>    already decided as a community to vote against.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I think we should accept that minor correction, like small grammar
</I>&gt;<i>    correction can be done after a consensus is found.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In fact, as I explained here:
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/04/29/one-document-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> multiple-point-of-views/
</I>&gt;<i>    it would be interesting to integrate Vilfredo with a wiki. So you
</I>&gt;<i>    use the normal wiki procedures in general. And Vilfredo when a flame
</I>&gt;<i>    war raises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am beginning to appreciate that in Vilfredo, a vote does not mean what
</I>&gt;<i> it means in an ordinary count-votes system. (Steve in an earlier email
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned that he saw only 1 proposal in the final Pareto Front of
</I>&gt;<i> Generation 4, when in fact there are 5. I suspect that he was noticing that
</I>&gt;<i> 2712 had more votes than the others, and took that to mean that it was
</I>&gt;<i> therefore the single winner.)
