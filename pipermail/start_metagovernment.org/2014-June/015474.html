&gt;&gt;<i> I have answered you as to how a government can be replaced: by making the old one irrelevant. I also invited you to make this group irrelevant. But you cannot assert a minority decision-rule on a community that has never used that and which does not generally accept that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so this is part of an answer: Your position is that no revolution
</I>&gt;<i> is possible even if the majority of the population want it if the OLD
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule requires a supermajority (or even unanimity) because
</I>&gt;<i> that is what what would be required to make it &quot;irrelevant&quot;.
</I>
Not true. Take for example the &quot;government&quot; of this project. If you start another project using your decision rule and get more people to join it, you make us irrelevant. This project's rules just don't matter to the new project, and we fade away while your project transforms the world without us.

&gt;<i>   Too bad
</I>&gt;<i> for us: That means to implement a direct democracy we have to go
</I>&gt;<i> through every state legislature and have them vote themselves out of a
</I>&gt;<i> job...
</I>
In the case of the United States, I am pretty sure that everywhere where a legislature has the authority to do something, that can also be done by a referendum. Referenda are horrible tools normally... but if everybody wants to get rid of the legislature (by means of changing the constitution), they can do so through referenda.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Deciding what's on our home page is NOT a minor decision: it is a defining moment of this community. Michael has brought us to a point where we must examine who we are and how we present ourselves to the world. Coming up with a fast-but-wrong answer to this question would be the worst possible outcome. Just like most minority decisions. They get the job done... but they do it wrong. What value is that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to take issue with the expression &quot;minority decision&quot;.  For
</I>&gt;<i> example, the *majority* of active participants in this group voted
</I>&gt;<i> *for* using Loomio and *for* my new decision rule.  And you now claim
</I>&gt;<i> that because the old rule required some other stuff, that these
</I>&gt;<i> *MAJORITY* opinions can simply be disregarded.  Right?
</I>
This is not a simple-majority-rule community and it never has been. Additionally, that vote did not sustain consensus for a week.

If the majority of this group wants to operate under a different decision rule, then I invite that majority to go form another group. I believe you will find that you are the only one going to that group, however.

&gt;<i> And again, an imperfect decision is better than no decision.  At least
</I>&gt;<i> with an imperfect decision you've got something in place while you go
</I>&gt;<i> back and do it again better.  With no decision, you've got a blank
</I>&gt;<i> Home page...
</I>
Again, no. How about we change the home page to: &quot;We are a community of orangoutangs who live in Antarctica and fly dirigibles.&quot; It is not a *great* decision, but at least it is a decision, right? So it is better than nothing?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If instead we accept your premise that the decision-rule can be changed in the same moment that it is proposed, then remember that I proposed a one-vote-rule which makes me absolute dictator of this group: whatever I say goes. So if your claim is valid, then so is mine and I thus revert us back to our original decision rule.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is silly: The Loomio votes took a full week.
</I>
That is not the decision rule. They must sustain consensus for a week.

&gt;<i>  If you can announce
</I>&gt;<i> a vote on this list and then don't get anyone to respond but yourself
</I>&gt;<i> in a week, more power to you.  Otherwise, you're being a dictator who
</I>&gt;<i> is *imposing* your preferences on the rest of us.  In which case I'd
</I>&gt;<i> recommend you step back from this issue (i.e., it was you who
</I>&gt;<i> sabotaged the Loomio process, so the onus is therefore on you to
</I>&gt;<i> either resurrect it or see to it that some other process (perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, but I'm kind of doubting it) finishes the job).
</I>
Who else is supporting you at this time? The only other input I have seen on this thread is others disagreeing with you.

Apart from the process not following the standing rules, there is your own argument that something merely following the rules shouldn't be forced on the people. Ask this group if they agree with you now: I suspect you will get little (or likely no) support. So at this point, you are advocating tyranny, not me.

&gt;&gt;<i> And thus again, I demonstrate the failure of fast-but-wrong decisions. I would much rather that we take our time and come up with a great homepage than that we put up some junk that doesn't represent the community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've no problem with the time frame per se, but it's been 2 weeks now
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't see us coming any closer to any decisions.  We have the
</I>&gt;<i> raw material for someone to make a specific comprehensive proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> but no one has done even that...
</I>
Yes, we are doing that, both here and on the Vilfredo. Some great stuff has come together, and we will work it out. The last thing we should do, however, is try to force a rushed decision. Especially when so many of us can only participate very sporadically.
