<PRE>I'm watching old propaganda films from WWII.  Here's one that fits
Max's volunteer story.  It also ends with Lincoln's &quot;by the people,
for the people&quot;.  It's part of a deliberate effort at myth making .

  <A HREF="http://www.nfb.ca/film/call_for_volunteers">http://www.nfb.ca/film/call_for_volunteers</A>  (1941)

I've watched about 100 of these wartime films.  I wasn't too surprised
at first to notice a socialist tilt; Canada and other countries were
being pulled to the left by a combination of the depression and the
war effort, as I knew.  But I soon noticed more than just a tilt here,
and I couldn't explain it.  These films from the 1940s were painting a
picture of a society more caring than the one I grew up with in the
1970s.  I felt recharged watching them.

Later I learned about the film pioneer who ran the propaganda effort
during the war, a Scotsman by the name of John Grierson.  Once you get
past the hammed-up intro by Lorne Greene, this is a fascinating film:

  <A HREF="https://www.nfb.ca/film/grierson">https://www.nfb.ca/film/grierson</A>  (1973)

So I figured Grierson must be part of the answer.  But only yesterday
did I realize he's the *whole* answer.  I was re-watching some of the
wartime films and thinking about myth making, when it dawned on me:
this Scotsman created the myth of Canada that I live by today, and he
did it deliberately.

  <A HREF="https://www.nfb.ca/film/shameless_propaganda">https://www.nfb.ca/film/shameless_propaganda</A>  (2013)

I just found the film above, which confirms the theory.  But it was a
wonderful experience discovering it on my own.  I watched over 1,000
NFB films from 1939 to 2010.  Only slowly did the message of a caring
society fade from the picture (I now recall), to be replaced by that
of the critical film maker, objective and alienated.  The message was
still there on the day I was born, when this film was shot:

  <A HREF="https://www.nfb.ca/film/september_five_at_saint-henri">https://www.nfb.ca/film/september_five_at_saint-henri</A>  (1962)

(You should be able to stream these films for free.  Please let me
know if they charge you money, or anything.)

&gt;<i> I think I noticed Mike citing to not rational structures and I appreciate
</I>&gt;<i> that.  One of my threads is the jung Erickson cambell bateson etc
</I>&gt;<i> sequence.  And somehow I spent the day looking at stories and meanings
</I>&gt;<i> about non creed creeds and some unfamiliar Abrahamic stories.  I was
</I>&gt;<i> looking for consensus stories.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I observe these stories to be powerful and compelling.  Notice that Scott
</I>&gt;<i> gets edgy here I expect.  After all we find a non creed statement by
</I>&gt;<i> anticreed types tends to go creed after you put enough blood and treasure
</I>&gt;<i> and tears into it.  So if it is a non creed moral statement that people die
</I>&gt;<i> to defend then it ends up looking like a religious moral creed even if the
</I>&gt;<i> idea of a creed is against the non creed and most of the adherents moral
</I>&gt;<i> code.  Nothing is easy for the mechanical social engineer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But it brings to mind a possible decision process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here it might look like:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My neighbor has a lot of weeds in his front yard.  I do not like that.
</I>&gt;<i> What should i do?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now we crowd source stories about what to do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My neighbor was that way.  She was a frail 75 year old female widow.  I
</I>&gt;<i> offered to take care of the lawn for her and she was glad for the offer.
</I>&gt;<i> The lawn bother her also. I paid my kid to do it as if he was a
</I>&gt;<i> contractor.  The kid got some business experience and the lawn looked great
</I>&gt;<i> within 6 weeks.  The woman was very greatful.  That winter she passed.  The
</I>&gt;<i> house sold quickly and the nice front yard I am sure helped.  The new
</I>&gt;<i> owners are a nice couple with a daughter my son's age.  My boy is thinking
</I>&gt;<i> about offering his services around the neighborhood.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And many more stories.  Some involved bank ownership.  Meth houses. Rentals
</I>&gt;<i> that were not fit for human habitation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So we do some ranking.  Some  pattern matching.  When the question is asked
</I>&gt;<i> live then up comes a response and maybe a community interested in helping.
</I>&gt;<i> Dear abby design pattern.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we need to go to public policy issues we might try running the stories
</I>&gt;<i> through a reification process and mashing them so that we have in fact code
</I>&gt;<i> that represents the crowd wisdom which then generates a statute.  Then
</I>&gt;<i> rework the generated text.
</I>&gt;<i>
