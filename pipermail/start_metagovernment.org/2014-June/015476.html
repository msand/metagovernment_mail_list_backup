&gt;<i> There were some suggestions from you (Scott), to evaluate the proposals with

</I>&gt;<i> the way Vilfredo works. What you are suggesting is something similar to
</I>&gt;<i> Range Voting. A slightly better version of that would be Majority Judgment.
</I>&gt;<i> But regardless, Vilfredo uses a completely different method. We DO NOT sum
</I>&gt;<i> the votes. Instead we declare that a proposal A dominates a proposal B iff
</I>&gt;<i> (if and only if) the set of people that vote for B is a subset of the people
</I>&gt;<i> that vote for A. So it is not just that A has more support, but it is also
</I>&gt;<i> supported by the same people. So each person that like B will also be happy
</I>&gt;<i> if we pass A. Then the Pareto Front is the set of the non-dominated
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>
Understood, but I would still recommend including a rating instead of
a simple thumbs up/thumbs down vote, if for no other reason than that
the proposer (and the electorate) gets some feedback as the overall
fitness of their proposal.  While the comments do provide some
additional feedback, most people won't do comments whereas they are
very likely to hold their nose and vote for something they don't
really like only because it's better than the alternatives (in fact,
this is the way I have to cast pretty much all of my votes ;-)

&gt;<i> The next version of Vilfredo will use a mixed system. People will vote on an
</I>&gt;<i> inverted triangle to say how much they like and they understand a proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> Then a first approximation will be used to find the Pareto Front. And in
</I>&gt;<i> situations where several proposals are competing (especially if no one is
</I>&gt;<i> presenting new ideas) the actual position in the triangle will be used. It
</I>&gt;<i> is much more complex, which is why its development is so slow.
</I>
The other problem with complexity being that it reduces voter
confidence in the system, i.e., that they are not falling victim to
someone gaming the system...

&gt;<i> P.S. I wrote a proposal suggesting that this Vilfredo consultation was the official way for Metagovernment to decide the homepage.

</I>
I'm not really liking that one: We (especially Ed, apparently) are not
in a huge hurry to get this decided and so doing regular updates with
incomplete proposals would seem to me to just make the Home page look
worse than it does now...
  Regards,
    Scott
