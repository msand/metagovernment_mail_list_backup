<PRE>Hi Pietro, cc Ned, Bentley  (a request at bottom)

Pietro said:
&gt;<i> So you felt that Vilfredo was not part of the decision process. But
</I>&gt;<i> was some type of &quot;brainstorming&quot;. While me, Ned and Bentley felt
</I>&gt;<i> this was the actual decision going on.
</I>
No, I'm happy to have Vilfredo as *part* of the decision process.
What I didn't realize was that it would now be the *entire* process,
and non-users of Vilfredo would no longer have a say in the home page.

&gt;<i> So you made a proposal which from your point of view was
</I>&gt;<i> independent, while for us it was trying to shortcut a decision
</I>&gt;<i> system that was being implemented. When we voted against it (and in
</I>&gt;<i> a way you did not expect) you felt that your proposal was unjustly
</I>&gt;<i> struck down. and this felt that we were &quot;forcing on you&quot; Vilfredo.
</I>
Weren't you?  You agreed with the proposal when it was in Vilfredo,
but then down-voted it when it was taken outside.  Then you called me
a &quot;cheat&quot; for making it.  So naturally I felt that I (and everyone
else) was being forced to use Vilfredo.

&gt;<i> So they key element is that according to you Vilfredo is a
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming method while according to me, and Ned and Bentley is
</I>&gt;<i> an actual decision mechanism.
</I>
Fair enough, I promise never to call Vilfredo a &quot;brainstorming&quot; tool
again.  If I forget, you can call Votorola a &quot;decision mechanism&quot; and
I will stifle my shouts of protest. ;^)

Seriously, I already agree that Vilfredo is a useful tool for
small-scale decisions.
 
&gt;<i> And the other key element is that we did not &quot;vote on what system to
</I>&gt;<i> use&quot;.  I made an official proposal to use Vilfredo. Steve asked how
</I>&gt;<i> to proceed, and Ned did not wait for the voting process, but simply
</I>&gt;<i> started.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this proposal to use Vilfredo was gone through the vote (so a
</I>&gt;<i> vote on the voting system, a meta-vote), then we would be ok in
</I>&gt;<i> using Vilfredo, and you would not feel forced anymore.
</I>
If the group agrees to use Vilfredo alone and to exclude non-Vilfredo
users from participating in decisions, then OK.  Then you can rightly
call me a &quot;cheat&quot; if ever again I use Metagov's old decision process.

Meantime, please you, Ned and Bentley remove your 'no' votes from this
proposal.  None of you disagree with the proposal itself, instead you
were trying to block the decision process and force changes through
Vilfredo.  That's not fair.

Mike
