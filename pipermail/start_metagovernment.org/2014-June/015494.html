<PRE>So apparently the image did not went through.

So I am adding it as a link to the image in my dropbox. At least for now:
<A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2754299/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-14%20at%2008.06.48.png">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2754299/Screen%20Shot%202014-06-14%20at%2008.06.48.png</A>


Ed, is there any way in which we can permit to people to submit images and
screenshots.
They might be quite useful :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My primary problem with Vilfredo though is the lack of actual debate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> between answers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This has been a sticking point for me for an incredibly long time. If you
</I>&gt;<i> go back to the first discussions we had about Vilfredo at the beginning,
</I>&gt;<i> also there there was a request for the possibility to comment to proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> To the point that if you look at one of the first basic questions where
</I>&gt;<i> this community got involved, the Wall of Text question, some proposals were
</I>&gt;<i> actual comments, not meant to be voted. This was how much needed it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still it was important for me that the discussion be integrated inside the
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo works basically by:
</I>&gt;<i> let people propose
</I>&gt;<i> let people vote
</I>&gt;<i> filter the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> use the filtered proposals as a feedback mechanism to the community
</I>&gt;<i> let people propose
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people can discuss proposal outside, there is the risk that this might
</I>&gt;<i> take away some of the power of the filter. Which is the only thing that
</I>&gt;<i> prevents the participant to drift around (like in a normal discussion
</I>&gt;<i> group, where the person that writes more has more power), but be focused in
</I>&gt;<i> a fair way to all participants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The solution to this eventually was to have the comments integrated with
</I>&gt;<i> the voting. In this version, when you vote against, or that you do not
</I>&gt;<i> understand, you explain your perplexities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the next version, which is actually present, but still full of bugs
</I>&gt;<i> participants can make points pro and against each proposal. As well as ask
</I>&gt;<i> questions (to which the author can answer).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#8203;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure if the image that I am inserting above will appear, but this
</I>&gt;<i> is from a version of Vilfredo that we developed after the one you are
</I>&gt;<i> using. But that never reached the debug stage, as no one was using Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment so we preferred to move and and focus to the next big
</I>&gt;<i> release, Vilfredo2.0. Which will make so many changes, and is being written
</I>&gt;<i> in another language (from php to python) that the code was going to be
</I>&gt;<i> rewritten in any case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> there is no recorded conversation, from what I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell, of how the proposals needed to be altered to find acceptance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You're able to voice your opinion in the voting stage but afterwards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the comments disappear.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not really, there might be a problem with the user interface. On the top
</I>&gt;<i> right of each proposal there is a little icon of a man speaking. If you
</I>&gt;<i> click on it you can read the comments. Also when you click on &quot;mutate&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> change a new proposal based on an existing one, on the right of the screen
</I>&gt;<i> you will find all the comments that have been given, so you can use them to
</I>&gt;<i> guide you in writing a new version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We want to make better forms of collaboration possible, but as you  might
</I>&gt;<i> have picked up by now, I am very slow and quite retentive in making sure
</I>&gt;<i> each element is well integrated with the rest. And does not give to any
</I>&gt;<i> participant an unfair advantage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What's more is the proposer is not able to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defend themselves from the criticism their proposal receives, they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just have to take it and hope that they are able to fine tune it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> enough next round to gain these anonymous users approval.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes. The phrase is no feedback on feedback. And that is actually a
</I>&gt;<i> feature and not a bug ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversation, you need to debate ideas sometimes, to refute certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claims and uncover certain truths.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here you raise another important point. The important difference between
</I>&gt;<i> facts versus opinion. And the role of experts who (supposedly) should be
</I>&gt;<i> the one knowing the facts, on which the participant should base their
</I>&gt;<i> opinions. So far we have not faced this problem at all. But I am very much
</I>&gt;<i> aware that it is there. Again, this is a well known limit in Vilfredo, and
</I>&gt;<i> it is one of the reasons why I advocate Vilfredo only in a group of peers,
</I>&gt;<i> for now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People need to be able to track the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debates and decide where the rational lies for either side.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, indeed they do. And indeed Vilfredo for now is not able to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#8217;m having the same issues in terms of the lack of coherent discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibilities. I voted for some proposals even though I have issues with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them (including my own) and would like to be able to make a comment about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my reservations&#8230;.as well as to read those of the other voters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said before, this is not available in this version. If people feel it
</I>&gt;<i> is very important, on monday I can ask Derek to work on debugging that
</I>&gt;<i> version of Vilfredo where people can write comments in favor and against,
</I>&gt;<i> instead of working on Vilfredo 2.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe instead of having a (?) specific button it could be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generic&#8230;.for questions, or comments, or even amendment suggestions for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> next generation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Please see above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Also, why does the *big (green) thumb* show so dominant even before I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote. Seems like it should only be there after voting???
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is another very important element. In the first version of Vilfredo,
</I>&gt;<i> each proposal was an empty tick box, and you could tick it to vote for it.
</I>&gt;<i> So the default option was &quot;against&quot; (there was no ? at the beginning). This
</I>&gt;<i> had a big fault on the fact that people would vote in a traditional way,
</I>&gt;<i> where they would just tick the box of their proposal (or of one proposal)
</I>&gt;<i> and submit. They were expecting the vote to be counted by being summed. But
</I>&gt;<i> the votes in Vilfredo are MUCH more powerful. Basically every against you
</I>&gt;<i> vote is a veto you give. No amount of me saying: &quot;vote for all that you can
</I>&gt;<i> accept&quot; was enough. The implicit education of years of plurality voting
</I>&gt;<i> would make people just ignore it. So the system would not reach a small
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto Front but an unnecessary big one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For this reason we turned the voting around. The default of YES. In Italy
</I>&gt;<i> we say: Silence is equivalent of assent (chi tace acconsente). And voting
</I>&gt;<i> no has a cost. You must say why you are against a proposal. Indeed this
</I>&gt;<i> raises the work necessary for people who participate, and makes consensus
</I>&gt;<i> easier to reach. Not a bad deal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Vilfredo2.0 the people who do not understand a proposal will be treated
</I>&gt;<i> differently than now. As a result, people who did not read a proposal will
</I>&gt;<i> be considered as a &quot;?&quot; and not as a &quot;YES&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But for now the default is YES.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for your recent (thorough) responses Pietro. I imagine this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> both exciting and challenging for you to track. Personally I&#8217;m really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gaining a lot of ground here in my understanding of what&#8217;s possible&#8230;and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe some of what&#8217;s not. I'm appreciating your work as well as your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willingness to bare it to such a bitchy bunch of geeks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are willing to read my long responses... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view, it has been quite frustrating doing such a long
</I>&gt;<i> work, without a real community using it, yet. People trying it out, and
</I>&gt;<i> moving on because something is not as they like it. But me being unable to
</I>&gt;<i> just add their idea because it breaks something else, or it is not in line
</I>&gt;<i> with how fair I want the product to be. I need a community using Vilfredo,
</I>&gt;<i> that has the patience to see it develop gradually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
