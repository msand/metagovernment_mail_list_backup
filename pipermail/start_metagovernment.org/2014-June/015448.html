<PRE>Ok. Now I get it.  I had no clue what you were referring to earlier. I mistook ROR as *Ruby on Rails *.  :-)  Wouldn&#8217;t Roberts Rules of Order be RRO?

&gt;<i> Today I researched the current status of what is know by people who run serious meetings as ROR.  Having one in your back pocket at a meeting is sort of like brushing your teeth before a hot date.  It is a common parliamentary authority that is 150 years old.  The 11th edition covers email meetings as so on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the abuse in this mailing list is covered by solutions therein even in the older editions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am in the US.  There is something similar up North.  Pretty much in the English speaking world if you do not have an different authority explicitly then you can cite to the ROR as less than authorative but reliable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Scott would hate it so I can like it right there.  He is right though that you can run a railroad with it.  This is slang for the chair cheating.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am thinking of taking the 1915 out of copyright version and drop it on a shared edit platform for modifying.  I may do that after deciding on the licensing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But here is a useful suggestion IMO.  Per ROR there is a treatment on what constitutes a valid and binding vote including how to change validly what constitutes a valid and binding vote.  Hint.  Ed wins maybe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise I did notice what seems to be a going web concern that has real voting  with staff and encryption and maybe even paying clients.  And they would run a ten member club vote for free.  And they have multiple voting schemes.  They do not have discussion software.  Figure it will take a long time to get from a decision here to a vote through them but that is fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest you use ROR as your informal authority and make it your formal authority.  And then use whatever to make further decisions and then run the decision through a commercial vote system.  This two step approach is supported by ROR. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The good thing is that people make their living making ROR decisions.  If you can get to just a few decisions then you can maybe get a ROR expert to help you get further.
