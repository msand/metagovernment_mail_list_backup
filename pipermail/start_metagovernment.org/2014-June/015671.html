<PRE>If you're *not* an abstract thinker, but more of a practical hand,
then you'll nevertheless appreciate how the problem that prompted the
formation of this list (which is basically the problem of modernity)
is now solved.  We know precisely how to &quot;start&quot;, and can never again
become lost, or stuck.

I found this hubristic.  So I gave you a story.

&quot;Cthutul&quot; and the &quot;beginning of infinity&quot; are easy to google.  I played
with different meaning of the word &quot;past&quot; since you spoke of &quot;start&quot; and
&quot;modernity&quot;

It seems to me that a myth need not be plain.  And should not be
explained.  But I did here offer the simple referants to the story.

I could tease you on the rational side but the story might be more useful.
But sincerely, good luck.

Max




I don't follow, Max.  Please speak plainly and I'll try to answer.

</I>&gt;<i> Anything starting I get to eat.  Slowly and enjoying the wiggling. And in

</I>&gt;<i> modernity or even post modernity is believing differently enough than in
</I>&gt;<i> the past to be past the start.

</I>&gt;<i> Looks great.  I wonder if it wiggles.  Hmm.  Where did that come from?
