<PRE>Sure, that makes sense Pietro.  You don't want them voting.  But maybe
let them see the graphs you were pointing to, and other information.
They might find it attractive.

Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> Hi Michael, in those years we have tried several strategies to try to
</I>&gt;<i> promote Vilfredo. And for most of it it was quite transparent and possible
</I>&gt;<i> to even write and vote without being registered (Vilfredo would then record
</I>&gt;<i> it as an Anonymous vote). Now we closed that off, as there were several
</I>&gt;<i> problems and it was quite common that people would write a long answer just
</I>&gt;<i> to see it deleted because they forgot to login. So we wanted an easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure that would not happen. At least while we wrote Vilfredo2.0
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But regardless of this, there is a deeper lesson we got. We do NOT want
</I>&gt;<i> random people coming and voting. Vilfredo is not a poll system. It is a
</I>&gt;<i> recurrent process where the same people go through a process to find a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus between them. Which is not directly representative of what
</I>&gt;<i> happens outside. While it is very rare but possible that a person might
</I>&gt;<i> just stumble upon a question and participate to the end, it is much more
</I>&gt;<i> common that someone that no one knows who is, votes in a random way, and
</I>&gt;<i> changes the Pareto Front slowing down the process for everybody.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the next Vilfredo will not be organised in rooms, but in a more
</I>&gt;<i> traditional way. And it will be possible to set up questions where only
</I>&gt;<i> some people are allowed to vote or to propose, or to do both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But we are thinking of ways to make an automatic animation out of a
</I>&gt;<i> question. So everybody can get up to speed on what has happened. And this
</I>&gt;<i> could also be used to promote it.
