<PRE>I've been a little busy so I missed the last vote. The comments don't make
much sense to me as the previous one that passed is more negative than this
one and it passed again instead of the new text. I guess it shows that when
there are a lot of proposals things get a muddled. It's frustrating to see
my old text move on which is far worse than the updated text. I just
submitted a revision so we'll see how it goes on the next vote.

&gt;<i> Hi Bentley,
</I>&gt;<i> why didn't you vote in the last generation? We missed you :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your proposal with no abstract was number 2660. Let's make a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> analysis on this. In the previous email, yesterday I explained how to
</I>&gt;<i> access the history page and the generation page. I will be using those
</I>&gt;<i> pages:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/vhq.php?q=164</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=1</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=3">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=3</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the histoy page we can find the proposals you wrote. The one without
</I>&gt;<i> abstract is 2660. It was presented in the second generation, but did not
</I>&gt;<i> make it into the third generation.
</I>&gt;<i> So let's go to the second generation page to understand better (we could
</I>&gt;<i> actually do a lot more in the history, but the generation page is more
</I>&gt;<i> clear)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2">http://vilfredo.org/vg.php?q=164&amp;g=2</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2660 was supported on generation 2 by you, Ned and Reid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it was voted against because it had no abstract. In fact we
</I>&gt;<i> can see the comments that it did generate, by slicking on &quot;repropose or
</I>&gt;<i> mutate&quot; button.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> which leads us to:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/npv.php?p=2660&amp;submit=Repropose+or+Mutate">http://vilfredo.org/npv.php?p=2660&amp;submit=Repropose+or+Mutate</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The comments it got were:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;This language is too negative. We should excite people about what we're
</I>&gt;<i> doing, not complain about how bad things are.
</I>&gt;<i> (by 2 users)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Vilfredo group (Ned, Pietro, Bentley) is blocking Metagov's normal
</I>&gt;<i> decision process (proposal 3). They want to force everyone to use Vilfredo
</I>&gt;<i> instead, leaving non-users without a say in the home page. Please ask them
</I>&gt;<i> to stop blocking our process. Until they do, we will block theirs.
</I>&gt;<i> by 1 user (we know this is Mike as he has said he will do this in the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And two other user wrote: &quot;same&quot; and &quot;nope&quot;. I suspect Same means that he
</I>&gt;<i> agrees with the excite comment. No one said anything about the abstract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this was voted by you Ned and Reid. But then all three of you voted
</I>&gt;<i> also for: 2659 2666 2669 2670 2672 2673 2674 2675 2676 2677 2678 2679. And
</I>&gt;<i> in each of those proposal there were other people who voted for them too.
</I>&gt;<i> So 2660 was dominated by them. Eventually all those proposal were dominated
</I>&gt;<i> by proposals 2677, 2678 and 2679. Which made it to the next generation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can see the graph of domination in the page of the proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2660">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=2660</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again Vilfredo asks you to support everything which is acceptable. But if
</I>&gt;<i> you are upset by what is in the Pareto Front, then you should revote before
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the generation to make sure the Pareto Front is more similar to
</I>&gt;<i> your wishes.  This is how you submit include inside Vilfredo the little
</I>&gt;<i> differences like: &quot;I like both those proposals, but this one I like more so
</I>&gt;<i> if this is not included I am not going to be happy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said in the previous email, this does not work if people try to
</I>&gt;<i> exaggerate their influence, but I know this is not a risk with you. :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
