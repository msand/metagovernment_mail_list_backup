<PRE>You guys should look into bitcoin, ethereum and DAO (distributed autonomous
organizations) which are organizations that follow certain rules written in
a computer language.

Said that, this thread mentions Vilfredo in the subject, but I don't seem
to understand how is it related. Just wanted to let you know in case there
was a hidden message. It's not arriving :-)

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sigh.  Some are in love to with the LAW.  Sort of a 1820 positivism thing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't be such a pessimist!  I've (unfortunately) spent a lot of time
</I>&gt;<i> reading statutes and am always amazed by how badly they're written.  A
</I>&gt;<i> lot of it is just lawyers seeming to want to sound like lawyers
</I>&gt;<i> instead of technical writers (which is what the job really calls for).
</I>&gt;<i> But most of it, IMHO, is simply lack of time and effort both in the
</I>&gt;<i> production and in the reviewing of the bills before they're voted on.
</I>&gt;<i> With &quot;countless&quot; more eyeballs on the proposals (i.e., crowdsourcing
</I>&gt;<i> the review), we'll naturally see a lot less of the kind of crap that
</I>&gt;<i> current legislators produce...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The wording &quot;inherently better&quot; are interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I make a convincing case for civil over common law, read the
</I>&gt;<i> book (www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf).  I'm not alone in having this
</I>&gt;<i> opinion, but it seems there are actually very few people who have even
</I>&gt;<i> done a careful examination of the alternatives.  Certainly the lawyers
</I>&gt;<i> in the US don't even want to *know* about any options like this
</I>&gt;<i> because it would make a large swath of their training and experience
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete (and good riddance!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So judges cannot do equity.  The jury cannot do nullification.  And no
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gets to interposition, especially if it counts.  If you go for Shar'ia
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pick the Wahhabi version and burn the Sufi shrines.  Damn innovators.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I actually don't have a problem with jury nullification or even
</I>&gt;<i> judicial activism (though in my system the electorate can make a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to remove a judge, or *any* employee of the government, at
</I>&gt;<i> any time via the normal proposal/voting process).  But the need for
</I>&gt;<i> this will be drastically reduced in a direct democracy because we
</I>&gt;<i> simply won't have authoritarians and other biased parties making
</I>&gt;<i> immoral (e.g., religion derived) laws in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is an idea i had a million years ago When AI Was Going To Be Real
</I>&gt;<i> Soon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; now.  Let us force the legislators to write the law in COBOL.  We get
</I>&gt;<i> less
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; law for  starters.  And you do not really need lawyers or judges in many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cases. This idea can be expanded for much hilarity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also don't have a problem with AI acting as our &quot;benevolent
</I>&gt;<i> dictator&quot; and actually believe that it is our destiny (albeit not
</I>&gt;<i> until long after all of us are dead and buried).  But back to the
</I>&gt;<i> original subject, it looks to me like this &quot;laws as programming&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy also supports the idea that the written rules should *not*
</I>&gt;<i> contain all the justifications and other background information in
</I>&gt;<i> them but instead that this information should be kept separately so
</I>&gt;<i> that we don't all have to agree on that part of it.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
