<PRE>Thanks for mentioning this, Mark.  I agree about the overriding need
for emotive content.  It's crucial.  I took the opportunity to create
an editorial group for this purpose.  I added a section on &quot;imagery&quot;
to their draft of the plan: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1142-ZeleaCom">http://zelea.com/w/User:Pipe-1142-ZeleaCom</A>

Should we move further on this?  I've some ideas of my own, but I'd
prefer to work with others.  Currently I'm restricting my efforts to
getting a suitably short, emotive text out of Vilfredo.
