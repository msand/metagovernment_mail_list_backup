Good question, Alex.  We want the seed draft to contain stuff that
everyone can reasonably accept.  So I stuck a linkage section in there
because I can't see why anyone would be unable to accept it.

Can you think of another section that nobody could reasonably reject?
Then we could add that section, too.

&gt;<i> There is another link which leads me from &quot;the wiki with additional
</I>&gt;<i> ui&quot; to &quot;the votespace&quot; (according to the URL name) In there, i see
</I>&gt;<i> your name, and then a user &quot;cooperatively tooled + ed pastore and
</I>&gt;<i> thomas von der elbe...  i do not understand what that votespace is
</I>&gt;<i> voting for and who is voting for what and what are the mechanics in
</I>&gt;<i> general.
</I>
What you see there are the remnants of the last time we discussed the
home page (years ago), plus our current discussion.  The technical
details aren't important at this point, unless you're interested.

&gt;<i> ... am i supposed to &quot;edit&quot; the &quot;the wiki with additional ui&quot; which
</I>&gt;<i> contains the 4 sections mentioned under A. ??? ....or do i &quot;fork&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>
There's nothing further you need to do, unless you wish to.  You're
already doing exactly the right thing, which is to critique the seed
draft.  Do we have consensus on it?  Or can anyone think of a reason
why it would be unacceptable?
