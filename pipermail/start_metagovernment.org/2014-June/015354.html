<PRE>change to -1

   - It looks like this thread had incorrect rules listed. The rules should
   probably be left out of the proposal thread or  a link to the rules as Ed
   did.
   - There are also multiple points in the email. The initial email in a
   proposal thread should have just the proposal in it.
   - The proposal does not have a number on it for tracking as suggested
   earlier. Although not a rule it's a good idea.

Do we need to propose to use a system for a proposal or did we &quot;decide&quot; the
proposer can choose the system and they should just say int the proposal
email what system they are using and provide a link?

I suggest for clarity new proposals be made on a different thread (Like
Ed's discussion or proposal which I believe has been made previously)

I suggest we all vote against this proposal thread.

I guess the current rules never allow for a proposal to be closed except
for approval which makes maintaining a list of current proposals long and
difficult.

&gt;<i> I disagree with the format of the debate, as it is not what we have
</I>&gt;<i> already agreed upon. We can't change the rules without following the rules
</I>&gt;<i> for changing the rules. Otherwise, we are just anarchy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current rules are not that we have two weeks of discussion and then
</I>&gt;<i> vote (and if so, what defines a winning vote), but rather (roughly) that we
</I>&gt;<i> vote continually and when there is a supermajority, then it must hold for a
</I>&gt;<i> full week before it passes. Again, they are stated here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And just to be clear:
</I>&gt;<i> -1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I tried joining the Loomio metagov board, and I had to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> permission. I don't understand how a system can be democratic if some
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian (someone with authority) gets to decide who may participate.
</I>&gt;<i> Now that I have been deemed worthy of participating in the board, I only
</I>&gt;<i> see up/down style voting. How does that build consensus? If someone
</I>&gt;<i> disagrees with a word, how is the proposal refined? If someone has a
</I>&gt;<i> counter-proposal, how is it compared to the original? I am not seeing how
</I>&gt;<i> Loomio is supposed to be more than a simple replication of the
</I>&gt;<i> problems/limitations of the status quo. Systems like Vilfredo and Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be vastly more sophisticated at consensus-building, even if they
</I>&gt;<i> don't have quite as pretty of a front-end (which truly is the worst
</I>&gt;<i> standard: otherwise, let's just use Facebook for decision-making).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To Michael's point, I do agree that we should be discussing what we are
</I>&gt;<i> doing here. So... does everyone agree with the mission, vision, and common
</I>&gt;<i> principles stated here?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, that sounds like a great starting point. And the mission statement
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like a good first sentence for the home page, right? (Which is
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much what it was before it got blanked.)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, disagree (-).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's not clear what problem we're trying to solve with this proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I feel it's especially confusing to mix issues (home page, decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making, testing new platforms).  If the home page is a concern, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let's start by talking about what the problem is.  We're not doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.  It makes no sense to discuss solutions (e.g. particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content) when we've no idea what the basic problem is.  E.g. maybe the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; home page is missing some important information?  What kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information would be important on a home page?  Anybody know?  (Don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer here please, I'm just explaining what I mean.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or if decision making is a concern, then what is the problem with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current decision-making process?  Again (don't answer here), it makes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; no sense to decide on a solution (Loomio) when we haven't talked about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the problem it's supposed to solve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or if some people want to test different platforms and think maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that could be a purpose for this group, then I guess we should clarify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our purpose.  Do we have a purpose?  Do we want a purpose?  What kind
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of purpose do we want?  (Again, don't answer here.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So maybe we have lots of different problems, or maybe none at all.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But please let's take them one at time, or it's too confusing.
