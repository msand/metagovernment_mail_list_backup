Don't be such a pessimist!  I've (unfortunately) spent a lot of time
reading statutes and am always amazed by how badly they're written.  A
lot of it is just lawyers seeming to want to sound like lawyers
instead of technical writers (which is what the job really calls for).
But most of it, IMHO, is simply lack of time and effort both in the
production and in the reviewing of the bills before they're voted on.
With &quot;countless&quot; more eyeballs on the proposals (i.e., crowdsourcing
the review), we'll naturally see a lot less of the kind of crap that
current legislators produce...

&gt;<i> The wording &quot;inherently better&quot; are interesting.
</I>
I think I make a convincing case for civil over common law, read the
book (www.metacard.com/ThePlan.pdf).  I'm not alone in having this
opinion, but it seems there are actually very few people who have even
done a careful examination of the alternatives.  Certainly the lawyers
in the US don't even want to *know* about any options like this
because it would make a large swath of their training and experience
obsolete (and good riddance!)

&gt;<i> So judges cannot do equity.  The jury cannot do nullification.  And no one
</I>&gt;<i> gets to interposition, especially if it counts.  If you go for Shar'ia then
</I>&gt;<i> pick the Wahhabi version and burn the Sufi shrines.  Damn innovators.
</I>
I actually don't have a problem with jury nullification or even
judicial activism (though in my system the electorate can make a
proposal to remove a judge, or *any* employee of the government, at
any time via the normal proposal/voting process).  But the need for
this will be drastically reduced in a direct democracy because we
simply won't have authoritarians and other biased parties making
immoral (e.g., religion derived) laws in the first place.

&gt;<i> Here is an idea i had a million years ago When AI Was Going To Be Real Soon
</I>&gt;<i> now.  Let us force the legislators to write the law in COBOL.  We get less
</I>&gt;<i> law for  starters.  And you do not really need lawyers or judges in many
</I>&gt;<i> cases. This idea can be expanded for much hilarity.
</I>
I also don't have a problem with AI acting as our &quot;benevolent
dictator&quot; and actually believe that it is our destiny (albeit not
until long after all of us are dead and buried).  But back to the
original subject, it looks to me like this &quot;laws as programming&quot;
philosophy also supports the idea that the written rules should *not*
contain all the justifications and other background information in
them but instead that this information should be kept separately so
that we don't all have to agree on that part of it.
  Regards,
    Scott
