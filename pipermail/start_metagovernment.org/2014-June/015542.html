<PRE>Craig Simon said:
&gt;<i> Nothing is up at sygnol.com (or its planned sister sites) just
</I>&gt;<i> yet. I'm early in the development process, building a body of
</I>&gt;<i> explanatory content for potential partners.  I'm putting minimal
</I>&gt;<i> energy into maintaining the older sites, other than converting the
</I>&gt;<i> datasets and using what's there for the occasional demo and video
</I>&gt;<i> project.
</I>
I might offer to help, Craig, if it were pitched more to the electors
and candidates.  I bet that's the only approach that has legs for the
long haul, and I'd like to make a career of it.  Parties etc. have
money, but surely there are other sources?

&gt;<i> The big gamble for Sygnol is to attract an audience. If just a small
</I>&gt;<i> but measurable percentage of voters check it out prior to an
</I>&gt;<i> election, candidates are likely to be attentive to it...
</I>
Definitely!  Everyone will be attentive.  It'll be big news.  I'd sure
like to be part of it when it takes off.

&gt;<i> ...especially during a fractured multicandidate election in a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively small state where 100 vote margins could be make or break
</I>&gt;<i> for a candidate's viability going into the next primary or caucus.
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't said much yet about my approach for convening useful
</I>&gt;<i> candidate/voter discussions, but I'm certainly not ignorant of the
</I>&gt;<i> natural fears and antagonisms in that space For now I'll cite
</I>&gt;<i> Politics 101... Politics is managed competition.
</I>
I think electors and candidates are naturally on the same side, and
both against the party machines.  I bet the candidates would love to
become independent, if only they could.  Straw polls (when designed
properly) would give them that independence.

I don't think it requires discussion facilities.  There's enough out
there already, and no need for tight integration.  A voting service is
pretty much all that's needed.  It can be deployed stand-alone.

&gt;<i> The earlier projects allowed for resubmission of ranks until the
</I>&gt;<i> official close of voting, and the planned systems will as well. I
</I>&gt;<i> presume that's what you mean by continuous.
</I>
Sure, changeable ballots.  But then there's probably no need for
ranked choice or other complicated methods.  A changeable ballot
basically means a continuous runoff.  The best method is arguably the
simplest: plurality.

I suggested that in the thread below.  It's a list of voting reform
lobbyists, though, so naturally they're unreceptive to the idea.

I CC you to punch a hole in my spam filter, Craig.  If you're moveable
on where the funding comes from, please ping me.  I'd love to talk
about the design aspects.
