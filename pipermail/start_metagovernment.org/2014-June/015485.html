I&#8217;m having the same issues in terms of the lack of coherent discussion possibilities. I voted for some proposals even though I have issues with them (including my own) and would like to be able to make a comment about my reservations&#8230;.as well as to read those of the other voters. 

Maybe instead of having a (?) specific button it could be more generic&#8230;.for questions, or comments, or even amendment suggestions for the next generation. Also, why does the *big (green) thumb* show so dominant even before I vote. Seems like it should only be there after voting???

Thanks for your recent (thorough) responses Pietro. I imagine this is both exciting and challenging for you to track. Personally I&#8217;m really gaining a lot of ground here in my understanding of what&#8217;s possible&#8230;and maybe some of what&#8217;s not. I'm appreciating your work as well as your willingness to bare it to such a bitchy bunch of geeks.
