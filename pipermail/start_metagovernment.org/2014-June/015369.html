<PRE>On Sun, Jun 8, 2014 at 12:44 PM, Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> The way Votorola works (or at least the way it has been used here) is in conjunction with a wiki. People use wiki articles to create proposals, then those can be compared to each other, sections can easily be copied from one to another, and votes can hop between competing proposals as they develop. It is exactly built for proposal generation and consensus-building, and it works now and it does not rely on any authority (no single person moderates the proposal). Vilfredo works completely differently, has no wiki, and yet also is extremely adept at proposal generation combined with consensus building. It too runs right now and requires no authority. SettleIt looks like it too, working in yet another completely different way, is built for consensus-building and proposal generation. Loomio is so primitive in comparison, that I don't know why it is even being discussed here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because, unlike those other two, it works and is available on-line
right now!  If those other two are so useful, why *aren't* we using
them?  I previously stated my objection that I don't consider either
viable candidates for the general system (because they're too complex
and people simply won't trust them), but I'd actually like to try them
to see how they work in practice.  But I don't see anyone (else)
rushing to do so.  Why not?

&gt;<i> I did not impose that rule. It was unanimously adopted by the participating members of this group. Included in the decision-rule was a method for how the rule itself should be changed. That is a community charter, and to throw it away destroys our community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Oh, the irony!  Here it is 1939 and Hitler has just invaded Poland.
The majority of the German people say &quot;Hey, wait a minute, that's not
what we signed up for...&quot; and Hitler says &quot;No Backsies!  You voted for
that rule with me as dictator, and now your stuck with it!&quot;.  The
majority of the active members of this group voted for my &quot;1/3 or
majority&quot; decision rule.  Now you're saying that a democratic vote by
a majority of the group is invalid because it will &quot;destroy the
community&quot; by not obeying an earlier (and IMHO impractical) policy.  I
also note that you snipped out my comment about how in the long run we
get from our current system in the US to a direct democracy: Which is
it going to be, Ed, majority rule, or follow the old rule &quot;to preserve
the community&quot; even though it isn't what the majority want?

This, of course, is on top of the irony that I'm opposed to the
concept of &quot;consensus&quot; as a decision rule and against any voting
system with a &quot;block&quot; option where an individual or small minority can
stop any progress.  I'm not opposing consensus just to be a PITA, but
so far you haven't even *attempted* to disprove my theory that because
a quarter to a third of the population is authoritarian and prone to
be simply irrational about decisions where their safety and access to
resources are concerned that any system that requires them to act
against their natures is just doomed to fail.

&gt;&gt;<i> [snip] We have a new decision rule, the one I proposed and that passed on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Loomio: the lesser of 1/3 of the population and a simple majority.  I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> claim that that rule supersedes the one on the metagovernment site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See above. You say imposed rules should be ignored, and now you're trying to impose a rule.
</I>
*I'm* not imposing it, the majority voted for it!  You're the one
imposing a rule, the one that I, and probably some other active
members of this group never even voted for...

&gt;<i> I now see the proposal you reference on Loomio. I was busy then and could not participate. It got 57% of the vote. By the standing decision rule, (which to change the decision rule requires 100% for that many participants; or a minimum of 80% for large populations) it failed. few
</I>&gt;<i> Saying it passed on its own rule is a tautology. Otherwise: I propose that the new decision rule is that whatever I say goes and the vote shall be decided only by me and I vote yes, so that's the new decision rule. In other words... you can't impose a new decision rule before changing the decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Perhaps your misunderstanding is &quot;What is a democracy, anyway?&quot;  To me
it means majority rule, where the majority in this case are the active
participants in this group (i.e., those people who signed up for
Loomio to see how it works).  You seem to think it's more like an
oligarchy, where the people who started the group or who voted in the
previous decision have some sort of priority over the current active
membership.  My decision rule isn't a &quot;tautology&quot; because there are
any number of other decision rules I could have proposed that would
*not* have achieved a majority vote.  It does smack a little of being
&quot;recursive&quot;, but that's OK, again, as long as it's clear that that is
what the majority wants.

&gt;&gt;<i> As I've expressed before I'm not completely comfortable with the fact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that there are 100+ people on the list a whole 9 of whom have bothered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to sign up for Loomio, but if they're not even interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *experimenting* with Loomio, I'm satisfied that they're not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sufficiently engaged to be considered part of the &quot;group&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does this follow, when there are many systems participating here, Loomio is not even one of them, and you apparently are not willing to try out these other systems. Have you looked at Vilfredo? It is fantastic at building consensus, and lightyears ahead of loomio in architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, may be, but I don't see them being used, or even being proposed
to be used, by anyone other than you.  I'm not any happier with Loomio
than you (apparently) are but I do believe it is up to the current
task (approving a proposal for a new home page) and so we should just
get on with the business of using it for that.
  Regards,
    Scott
