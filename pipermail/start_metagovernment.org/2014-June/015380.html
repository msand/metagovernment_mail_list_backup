<PRE>Hi Steve, hi All.
It looks like Ned has started a question on Vilfredo for the homepage.

The question is here:

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=164</A>


As you never participated in a question before, it is possible that you
might not have received the invitation. Also please (THIS FOR ALL) consider
checking in your spam filter to make sure that any email from Vilfredo does
not go there. Vilfredo relies on those emails to tell you all what is the
next step, so it is important that your email service provider does not
catalog them as Spam.

Vilfredo explains step by step what you are supposed to do.

Generally in Vilfredo we have a writing phase and a voting phase, followed
by another writing phase, and another voting phase... and so on. (In the
next version of Vilfredo we might have found a way to have only one phase,
with great happiness of some of the older members who have asked it about 4
years ago. Sorry I needed to clarify the math). The person who started it
decides how long each phase lasts (also this is non democratic, I know).
Ned has chosen that each phase will take a minimum of 24 hours and a
maximum of 48 hours. This means that he will not be allowed to move on the
question before the first day. But after 2 days the question will move on
automatically if he still has not done it (and if there are at least 2
proposals/2 voters).

Even if you think you know how Vilfredo works, you should pay attention as
there are many changes that have been made (and even more we are planning
and testing and designing right now). Differences respect to previous
versions: now you can say if you do not understand a proposal. Now if a
proposal cannot be deleted because of you (and only of you) you will get
alerted, and a request to consider changing your mind. And we have a nice
video explaining how graph work, and what is represented there.

I am very happy people are using Vilfredo again.

Please let me know how I can be of help.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Or should we tackle something perhaps a little easier (like the homepage)?
