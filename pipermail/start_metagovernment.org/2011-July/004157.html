<PRE>Dear Thomas,

thank you for your comment. The proposal edition is made by a single 
person - but not necessarly.  the idea is chop the proposal into 
argumentative points that are the core, them and let support to evolve 
in order to reach consensus. I dont see it as a proliferation of 
proposal, rather the opposite.

Concerning the first situation, no supervision is needed. You only have 
to add a section for contra-argumentation and response to take place.
That will not increase complexity, only one extra level of 
argumentation. This is needed, mainly when discussing very dividing 
points of view, like the nuclear energy.

Concerning, the second, the answer is yes,  some supervision will be 
needed in order to create the grid of points addressed in each proposal 
- but not necessarily.
The matrix will be useful for clarification of arguments and 
understanding of the popular support for each point and where the heart 
of discussion lies.

PS: Iceland is rebuilding its constitution on a crowdsourcing basis

&gt;<i> I want to understand: Who is in control of editing a proposal? To not
</I>&gt;<i> end like Wikipedia it needs to be a single person only, right? So
</I>&gt;<i> everybody with a different point of view might well have a different
</I>&gt;<i> proposal (in case it is not enough for him to hope that someone else
</I>&gt;<i> changes his proposal because of some high rated con-arguments), right?
</I>&gt;<i> And these potentially thousands of proposals are structured within the
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola-tree ... is that the picture?
</I>&gt;<i>
