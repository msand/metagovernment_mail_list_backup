One alternative to consider is impromptu meetings.  Each meeting would
start immediately as the need for it arose.  More details below.

&gt;<i> Issues I'd like to resolve for future meetings include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Being more accessible to a global audience. (Matteo was excluded  
</I>&gt;<i> from that meeting because he resides in Japan, where the start time  
</I>&gt;<i> was local midnight.)
</I>
I could easily have an impromptu meeting with Matteo.  I am often in
his time zone, so to speak, because I keep odd hours.

&gt;<i> 2. More reliable hosting. We might want to consider asking if  
</I>&gt;<i> individuals would like to make ad hoc payments to a commercial  
</I>&gt;<i> audioconferencing service. There are ones which work with both Skype  
</I>&gt;<i> and phone, and which are not really very expensive at all.
</I>
Impromptu meetings are likely to be smaller, so hardware limitations
would be less of a factor.

&gt;<i> 3. Transcribing the meeting better.
</I>
An impromptu meeting will usually be preceded by discussion in some
other medium (list or IRC) that has prompted it.  If it is also
followed by a sentence or two of summary, then that would suffice to
plant the seed of transcription.  Anyone who wanted more information
could simply ask, &quot;Can you elaborate?&quot;

All of this might happen more naturally if meetings were focused on
some kind of action.  I feel that action is important, so I'll start a
separate subthread on the topic.
