<PRE>The framework I use to discuss rule making (for the sake of argument 
here, equivalent to decision making) is called Rule-Oriented 
Constructivism (ROC). It's a school of thought in IR Theory based on the 
writings of Nick Onuf, which draws largely on the linguistic philosophy 
of Johnathon Searle and logical categories of philosopher and 
semiotician Charles Pierces.

ROC generally holds that rule making is a skilled linguistic practice 
that divides into three categorically distinct kinds of moves... 
assertives (truth claims), directives (official commands), and 
commissives (bids for contingent agreement).

Consider a statement that has a bunch of &quot;whereas&quot; clauses culminating 
in a &quot;hereby be it resolved&quot; clause.  The whereas parts are assertives, 
the &quot;be it resolved&quot; expresses a directive (which may itself reflect a 
move to promulgate an assertive) and the overall project of negotiating 
agreement is commissive.


I don't know if framework might help you folks sort things out, but it's 
helped me be very clear about the need to start by building platforms 
where people can talk about values (assertives) before taking on the 
more critical task of making resource-controlling hard laws (directives).

I've recently been working very hard on a new iteration of Indaba, and 
hopefully I'll have more to contribute when that's launched.
