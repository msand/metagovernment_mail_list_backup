<PRE>Last week's Skype meeting was very good. We had about six people  
participating, and the conversation mostly centered around the Outcast  
network (which includes Outcast, Crossforum, and Pollwiki) and the new  
project Pietro is contributing to which helps aggregate large numbers  
of proposals into groupings so that dialog and voting can progress in  
a meaningful fashion.

I tried to take notes on the Pad during the meeting:
<A HREF="http://piratepad.net/hfrCkDPeE0">http://piratepad.net/hfrCkDPeE0</A>
though it is difficult to transcribe and participate at the same time.

I invite other participants to build on this summary, and non- 
participants to reply with questions you may have in regards to the  
meeting.

Overall a voice meeting seems like a very useful tool, and I would  
very much like to do it again. It was great to be able to dig into  
ideas that seemed clear to the person who initiated them but fuzzy to  
the rest of us.

The only issue was that, as we noted going in, the host needs to have  
good bandwidth up and down. My router shut down in the middle of the  
meeting, and Pietro had to reinitiate it. (On the plus side, it's  
fascinating to think our meeting began in the U.S. and concluded in  
Italy, with other participants from Germany, Portugal, and Canada.)

I would like to suggest we try to have monthly voice meetings. What do  
you think?

Issues I'd like to resolve for future meetings include:

1. Being more accessible to a global audience. (Matteo was excluded  
from that meeting because he resides in Japan, where the start time  
was local midnight.)

2. More reliable hosting. We might want to consider asking if  
individuals would like to make ad hoc payments to a commercial  
audioconferencing service. There are ones which work with both Skype  
and phone, and which are not really very expensive at all.

3. Transcribing the meeting better.

</PRE>
