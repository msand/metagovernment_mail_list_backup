<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Alex, Greetings again! Below are responses to your critique of the 
Appraisal System. However, I will not be surprised if the responses fail 
to be persuasive to you at this point. The big step on the road to 
appreciating the appraisal system (or any alternative decision 
mechanism) involves losing faith in voting as a feasible option at the 
global level. Until one has reached that point, there is not much reason 
to be interested in other alternatives. (&quot;If it's not broke, don't fix 
it.&quot;) (I used to be a &quot;voting is all there is&quot; guy myself, so I know all 
about that condition.)

I&#8217;m not yet convinced of the appraisal system and the way it might 
randomly elect a couple of people, usually three, to negotiate issues or 
decide on something&#8230;

The appraisers do not negotiate, and do not decide, and are not selected 
just randomly.

Three *highly qualified* appraisers are software selected so as to 
minimize conflicts of interest and other potential sources of 
corruption. (There is indeed a random component to the selection, after 
the pool has been narrowed down by all the other criteria.)

The appraisers are selected to not know one other or the proposer, and 
they have no way of communicating while the appraisal is in progress, so 
that there is never any negotiation of any kind, or any contact of any kind.

The appraisers study the proposal and answer software-presented 
questions about it. The questions do not ask the appraisers about their 
personal preferences or for personal value judgments. When all three 
appraisers answer a particular question the same way, that is taken to 
be the resolved answer to that question. If the answers to the question 
differ, the answer remains unresolved, and an investigation is 
triggered. Neither the agreements nor the disagreements affect whatever 
decision is subsequently produced by the decision software. The 
appraisers do not decide; the decision software does.

The reason that there are *three* appraisers is to enable comparing 
answers. Because each appraiser never knows how the others have 
answered, the three act as &quot;checks and balances&quot; for one another, which 
makes it very difficult for an appraiser to &quot;game the system&quot; by 
answering the questions in such a way as to indirectly produce a desired 
decision. The job of the appraisers is to provide honest input 
(information) about the proposal to the software decision program.

The reason that there are *only* three appraisers is that the appraisers 
are being paid, and adding more appraisers would raise the decision 
cost. Given that tens of millions of appraisals will be made each year, 
cost per decision is a very important consideration.

&#8230;it just does not feel natural.

I hear ya, brother. And also I hear Michael Allen when he says:

    Experience teaches me (though I sometimes forget the lesson) that
    any attempt to communicate technology via ideas, designs or other
    generalities is a waste of time. You said as much in one of your
    earlier posts Alex, and I thought, &quot;Wow! This guy understands
    engineering.&quot; The only way to connect with non-technologists is via
    hands on practice.

To begin an appraisal session, you would sit down in front of the 
computer screen, and first study the proposal (which would be presented 
in all sorts of flashy fancy ways on screen). Then, you would click the 
&quot;ready to answer&quot; button, and then answer questions about the proposal 
as they were presented one-by-one on screen. At the point that all 
questions were answered, you would click the &quot;submit&quot; button, and you 
would be done. I betcha it would feel quite natural -- you would feel 
like you were back in school.

Any person could and many will come up with arguments against the decision.

Yes! Anyone can propose anything, especially objections to proposals (or 
decisions). Each proposed objection is treated as a proposal in its own 
right, and passes through the appraisal process. The integrity and 
trustworthiness of the system depends upon people objecting when they 
see objectionable proposals or decisions.

A problem that any *consensus* decision system faces (whether voting or 
appraisal or any other) is that individuals can object for &quot;bad&quot; 
reasons. A single individual wishing to make the consensus system 
unworkable need only object to each and every proposal. An individual 
wishing to gain &quot;leverage&quot; can object and then bargain for something 
else entirely unrelated. Any and all can object when a proposal would be 
detrimental to narrow self-interests. The purpose of sending objections 
through the appraisal process is to filter out these &quot;bad&quot; objections, 
while fully honoring all &quot;good&quot; (principled) objections.

Maybe people won&#8217;t accept the decision made by 3 randomly selected 
appraisers?

The decision is not made by the three appraisers. The appraisers provide 
honest input (information) to the decision software. The decision 
software makes the decision. (The appraisals themselves are available 
for public inspection after the appraisal project ends, and can serve as 
a basis for objections.)

Regarding public acceptance: My main concern is that we really need to 
actually create the more trustworthy decision making system. For the 
next few years, things are probably going to get bad enough to cause the 
public to look around for better systems. I see that as a window of 
opportunity, if the new system is ready to demonstrate. The decision 
systems that we have now are not that hard to be better than -- they are 
horrible.

1. I don&#8217;t understand how the categorization will happen. If there is a 
fixed scheme of categories, some proposals won&#8217;t fit in any. If it&#8217;s not 
fixed, then people have a hard time to decide which category to follow.

The categorization problem is stupendously huge and critically 
important. Any decision system (whether voting or appraisal or whatever) 
that has a participating population in the billions and a decision 
volume in the tens of millions per year faces this problem. In fact, the 
problem of appropriate and timely notification of new proposals and 
decisions is exactly the same regardless of which decision mechanisms 
are used.

In the appraisal system, categorization (including proposing new 
categories) is an integral part of the system. The proposer categorizes 
his own proposal (and can propose new categories if need be), and the 
appraisers categorize the proposal (to make sure the proposer did it 
right). Whenever new categories are proposed, notifications of those 
proposals (and the subsequent decisions) are sent to everyone whose 
category registration might need to be modified.

In dealing with this problem, we do everything we can, and that's all we 
can do.

There might also be different categories for the same issues and it will 
depend on the proposers cultural background under which category he 
might file his proposal, therefore it will not reach all the people 
possibly interested in the proposal.

Anyone in the world who spots this kind of problem would be able to 
immediately propose that the problem exists (thereby putting it into the 
issues management system -- thank you Alex), and would be free to 
propose solutions.

2. Who decides on the set of questions that are being asked?

There is no &quot;who&quot; for the set as a whole.

Anyone in the world can propose any question at any time.

When an appraisal question is proposed, the proposal will contain:

    * the question itself
    * the proposal categories to which the question is relevant
    * the list of anticipated answers
    * (for each answer) the actions that the decision software should
      take upon receiving that answer

Subsequently, when any proposer categorizes his own proposal into any of 
the categories of the question, the question-presentation software will 
subsequently present the question to the appraisers.

So, for each particular question, the two human actors are the proposer 
of the question, and the proposer of the proposal questioned.

If an investigation project decides that a question is not suitable as 
an appraisal question, some people might complain about removing the 
question or modifying it in a way, so that the proposal becomes 
appraisable. They might argue that important questions might not be 
included.

As responsible citizens, it is the job of those people to complain. 
(And, they will potentially be paid for complaining, if the complaint is 
appraised to be worthy of payment.) This is what &quot;collaborative 
governance&quot; is all about. When situations such as this arise, anyone in 
the world can participate in resolving the situation, through proposing.

3. An appraisal system would have a fatal flaw. If someone would hack 
the selection mechanism he could manipulate who answers questions and 
who investigates on issues, thus giving him a lot of power. People have 
to trust into the system and that its selection mechanism is reliable. 
How can they be sure it is not manipulated?

You are absolutely right that the potential would exist for this to 
happen. We would need to set things up so that it didn't, and so that 
detection would be easy if it did. (I have all kinds of ideas about how 
to accomplish that, and probably so do you.)

These sorts of vulnerabilities exist for any computerized system. Here 
in the USA, our computerized voting systems have been corrupted every 
which way, with major elections determined by the corrupted vote counts. 
(Offline systems, of course, are not immune to such corruptions either. 
Look at any congress or parliament.)

We do the best we can, and that is all we can do.

4. Why are appraisers information gatherers and not decision makers? If 
they all consent on a proposal, it will become reality?

Here is a story: Early on in the big &quot;design a new social system&quot; 
project that I have been working on, I spent the better part of three 
years trying to come up with a global voting system that would be better 
than those we have. During that period, the thought of using anything 
other than voting as the decision mechanism was for me an unthinkable 
thought. I had not in my wildest imaginings ever considered even the 
remotest possibility that there might be any other decision mechanism 
that could enable global collaborative governance. What finally happened 
during the third year was that it became clear that the fundamental 
problems of voting were intrinsic, and that it really is true that you 
can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.

At the point that I finally &quot;grokked in fullness&quot; that I was not going 
to be able to make voting work, I was ready to declare failure, and shut 
the project down. (It was a big deal to me.) But there were other parts 
of the project that were going well, so I kept working on those, and 
pondering the decision making problem became just a puzzle-hobby. In the 
course of that aimless thinking, I backed into the appraisal system.

The reason I tell this story is to substantiate that I know from 
personal experience exactly where you are coming from when you ask this 
question. The appraisal system has to be some sort of voting system, 
because there can't be anything else.

The direct answer to the question is that if the answers of all 
appraisers to a particular appraisal question match, then that 
particular question has a resolved answer. If the three answers do not 
match, then the question does not have a resolved answer, and an 
investigation will be triggered. If having a resolved answer to that 
question turns out to be necessary to reaching a software-generated 
decision, then there will be no decision from that appraisal project, 
and another appraisal project (with three different appraisers) will be 
initiated to deal with the proposal, after the investigation has 
proposed its findings, and that &quot;findings proposal&quot; has been appraised 
and acted upon. (This may delay the decision on the original proposal by 
a week or two.)

When the answers of all three appraisers match for every question, that 
means that the decision software will be able to output a decision. The 
decision is determined (algorithmically) by the answers. The fact of 
agreement has no effect on what the software-generated decision will be.

5. Won&#8217;t shadow-appraisal evolve a system that will be change-resistant? 
Because if a tendency evolves to give a certain kind of answer to a 
certain kind of question (pro vs. contra nuclear energy), only those 
&#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; are rewarded who give mainstream answers&#8230;

This is a great question. The short answer is &quot;no&quot;. The kernel of the 
long answer is that formulating good appraisal questions is actually 
quite hard, and will take lots of creativity and trial-and-error. For 
this reason, the appraisal system should start out as part of an online 
game, so that in the beginning no one depends on it, and everyone can play.

The purpose of asking an appraisal question is to gather 
decision-relevant information about the proposal. Here is an example of 
a kind of question will *not* be asked: &quot;Are you in favor of nuclear 
energy?&quot; This question does not seek information about the proposal; it 
seeks information about the answerer. It is a voting question, not an 
appraisal question.

The *proposer* of a question (*not the appraiser* who answers the 
question) is the one who has a preference and is attempting to express 
that preference by inserting it into the appraisal process. For example, 
someone who is opposed to nuclear energy could propose that this 
question be asked for all nuclear energy proposals:

    * A1: Would implementation of this proposal potentially endanger
      future generations? (YES =&gt; turn back)

Note that from the perspective of the knowledgeable appraiser, answering 
this question (with respect to a proposal to build a new uranium-fueled 
power plant) would be a no-brainer. In the wake of Chernobyl and now 
Fukushima, there is no question at all that the existence of 
uranium-fueled power plants does potentially endanger future 
generations. The appraiser may be absolutely in favor of nuclear energy, 
but he will nonetheless have to give &quot;YES&quot; as the answer to this 
question, even knowing that the proposal will be doomed if he does. 
There is no principled basis for any other answer.

Someone who was in favor of nuclear energy could then propose to replace 
question A1 with questions A2 and B1:

    * A2: Would implementation of this proposal potentially endanger
      future generations? (YES =&gt; ask B1)
    * B1: Would implementation of this proposal substantially increase
      available electrical energy? (NO =&gt; turn back)

What this does, of course, is create a loophole through which to squeeze 
nuclear power plants.

At this point, the appraisal system version of an edit-war has begun. 
How is such a war fought?

All moves are made through proposing. All proposals must argue from 
facts, projections, and principles. When principles are prioritized, the 
argument for the prioritization must be based on facts, projections, and 
principles. Appraisers must never be asked to express personal 
preferences or personal value judgments.

All the foregoing statements are themselves proposals, that would need 
to be proposed and pass through the appraisal process successfully in 
order to become effective. Especially in the beginning, we will be 
making up everything as we go along. The startup will be the ultimate 
bootstrap operation. The aim of the startup game will be to create a 
decision making system that we are willing to trust. The startup game 
will be seriously hard -- like writing the kernel for an operating system.

All of the kinds of decisions that the appraisal system will be making 
are already being made now, by corporations, bureaucracies, 
legislatures, and so on. The aim is that the appraisal system become 
able to make those same decisions, better and quicker and cheaper. The 
appraisal system will not be perfect out of the box, or ever. Perhaps 
its main advantage is that it is infinitely improvable, and can be 
improved by anyone. That has not proved to be the case for corporations, 
bureaucracies, legislatures, and so on.

Why is there a need of &#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; anyway?

Shadow-appraising is the path to actual appraising. Through 
shadow-appraising, a partnership accumulates an appraisal history. The 
appraisal history is distilled into an appraisal rating, and the rating 
is used in selecting actual appraisers. As the shadow-appraiser's rating 
increases, it becomes increasingly likely that the partnership will be 
selected as an actual appraiser. Thus, shadow-appraising is the means 
through which partnerships become actual appraisers. There are no 
appraiser schools that produce qualified appraisers -- learning happens 
on the job, and demonstration of proficiency happens on the job.

6. I think people will never ever accept decisions being made by 3 
randomly selected appraisers who might not have a clue what the proposal 
is all about and only have a time window of e.g. 3 days to decide on 
something like (will we increase the public copy-fee) or (will our 
country go to war?)

As both you and Mike have suggested, the key is hands-on experience. As 
the appraisal system becomes fully operational, anyone in the world will 
be able to propose anything, and see whether the system does a good job 
of deciding, and explore every detail of exactly what led the system to 
make the decision that it did. Anyone in the world will be able to 
register as a shadow-appraiser, and experience directly what the work of 
an appraiser entails, and learn about the sorts of expertise that must 
be developed in order to become an actual appraiser. All the software 
will be open source, and available for inspection. The appraisal system 
will not be some distant thing, that must be accepted on faith without 
examination or demonstration.

You ask great questions! Feel free to keep doing that!
