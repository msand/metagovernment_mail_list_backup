<PRE>Hi Ed,
I am not really sure how to insert this.

One of the things we noticed in Vilfredo is a difference between &quot;what&quot; and
&quot;how&quot; questions. Or more in general between questions that are looking for a
single answer, and questions where multiple concurring answers can be
accepted. For example if we are speaking about, what shall we do about
global warming, we have several strategies that needs to be followed in
parallel. While if we have decided that we are going to build a solar panel,
then we ask: &quot;how&quot; shall we build this solar panel? we are essentially
asking a question where we want a single, complex answer.

The division is not strict and there are how question that needs several
answers and what questions that have a single answer. And often you can
rephrase a how question as a what question, and viceversa. But generally
there is a difference.

This is important in Vilfredo because we have found how Vilfredo is a great
tool for a limited group of people to tackle a how question. But it does not
seem to work so well with what questions or if the number of people is too
big.  And it is for this that we are developing the bubble system as part of
Vilfredo.

Now I think this division should be expressed in the page, but I am unsure
on how to add it, after all here we are speaking about type of decisions,
and my discourse is about type of questions.

Cheers,
Pietro
