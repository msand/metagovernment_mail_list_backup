<PRE>Alexander, Greetings! You have asked great questions!  :-)

Is this a complete list?

I betcha it will be by the time we are done. I am delighted to now have 
you working on it with me.

Is there a theory attached to it?

Yes and no. There is no scientific theory attached to it (so far as I 
know), but in my work (as a social systems designer), each of the 
systems in the list has been part of the overall project to design a new 
kind of social system, capable of rendering obsolete the social systems 
we now have. Since none of those new designs have yet been implemented, 
I guess we could appropriately call them theories at this point.

Is there a branch of science that asks these kinds of questions?

There are definitely individual scientists asking these kinds of 
questions (including some in the metagovernment community :-) ), but I 
am not aware of any particular formal branch of science that is focused 
on them. (If anybody else knows of one or more, please tell!)

&#8226; land parcel infrastructure systems
&#8226; manufacturing/production systems
&#8226; transportation system(s)
What about an energy supply system?
(Is a transportation more special than energy supply?)

The reason that I did not put &quot;energy supply system&quot; as a separate item 
is that -- by design -- the intention is that every land parcel be 
energy self-sufficient, and have enough spare energy capacity to provide 
energy to transportation vehicles. The equipment that produces the 
energy is one of the &quot;land parcel infrastructure systems.&quot;

At least since the time of Nikola Tesla (and in fact since long before 
that), numerous ways have been discovered and rediscovered to produce 
clean and abundant energy locally, with the discoveries each time 
effectively kept from public use. We are forced to depend on receiving 
electricity from the grid and gasoline from far away refineries and oil 
wells because these are profitable and power-full arrangements for the 
Powers-That-Be, not because there are no other alternatives.

&#8226; financial system
&#8226; economic system
&#8226; emergency response system(s)
(will an institution that might investigate issues be included?)

Yes and no. The emergency response system that is part of the design 
package does indeed include investigation capabilities of all kinds, but 
the social system as a whole contains no &quot;institutions&quot; of any kind. All 
work is done by small partnerships, with each partnership working to 
fulfill its own individual project contract. (Partnerships never work 
&quot;for&quot; other partnerships, and all projects are time-limited. Each 
investigation case would be a separate project.)

&#8226; communication system(s)
- What about a media or information system?
(is it just a communication system?)

This item was intended to refer to all the systems of &quot;The Cloud&quot; 
(satellites, cable runs between land parcels, servers, cloud software of 
all kinds, etc.). Most if not all of the functionality of what we now 
call media systems and information systems will indeed probably be 
available in The Cloud. We should probably find a better term for this 
item than &quot;communication systems&quot;.

&#8226; decision making system(s)
&#8226; charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
- What about a judgment system?
(Is it just a decision making system?)

It seems to me that the Appraisal System 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System</A>&gt; is capable of 
making all of the kinds of decisions that are now made by judicial 
systems, executive branch systems, congressional and parliamentary 
systems, bureaucracies, corporations, NGOs, etc. However, we won't know 
that for sure until we have actually seen it demonstrated.

&#8226; learning systems
- What about an information or knowledge system?

This question deserves a long response, but one short response would be 
that (in my software design sketches) the software for the various 
systems of the list wound up being so tightly integrated and so 
overlapping as to be essentially a single software system with different 
functional faces. So, is there a separate information or knowledge 
system? I guess I would say that we could make it look like there were 
if we wanted to, and we might want to. In that case, we should probably 
add it as a separate item on the list.

&#8226; systems to support research, invention, design
&#8226; systems to support arts &amp; entertainment
&#8226; systems to support health

- what about an issues management system?

One of the core principles of the appraisal system is that anybody can 
propose anything. I have not myself done any work with issues management 
systems, and that is the only reason that it was not on my list. I will 
be very interested to see any proposals you come up with for such a system.

- What about an audit system?

In my (very idiosyncratic) lexicon, an audit is a particular kind of 
investigation. Each audit would be a project, carried out by a small 
partnership. If the audit required multiple partnerships, each of the 
partnerships would be working on its own project within the overall 
project, with its relations and responsibilities to the other 
partnerships spelled out in its own project contract.

Both the appraisal system and the emergency response system have the 
ability to trigger investigations (including audits), and many kinds of 
big projects trigger an investigation when the project ends, as part of 
the project appraisal process. So I guess I didn't put a separate list 
item for investigations and audits because the function is actually a 
part of those other systems.

- What's a human resources system good for? (like the one Taiwan has...)

I can't speak to what Taiwan has, but the general purpose of a human 
resources system is to match workers to work. In my designs, this would 
involve matching partnerships to projects. Below is an excerpt from the 
Appraisal System article that talks about the functionality of the 
&quot;human resources&quot; software of the appraisal system.

The software will also select the three appraisers. The selection 
criteria can include anything and everything which might eliminate or 
mitigate conflicts of interest and other sources of corruption. For example:

    * select the three appraisers from three different continents
    * select three appraisers who speak three different native languages
    * select appraisers having no known associations with one another or
      the proposer
    * select appraisers who have never appraised together
    * select appraisers who have never appraised any of the proposer's
      prior proposals

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Decision Contexts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be fully functional, a global trans-community social system needs 
</I>&gt;<i> these parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     * decision making system(s)
</I>&gt;<i>     * charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
</I>&gt;<i>     * financial system

</I>&gt;<i>     * communication system(s)

</I>&gt;<i>     * emergency response system(s)
</I>&gt;<i>     * landparcel infrastructure systems
</I>&gt;<i>     * manufacturing/production systems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So are these examples of what you mean by &quot;decision contexts&quot;? (If 
</I>&gt;<i> your answer is &quot;no,&quot; my feelings will not be hurt. I actually like 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's suggestion better that &quot;what&quot; questions and &quot;how&quot; questions 
</I>&gt;<i> are two different decision contexts.)

</I>&gt;<i> One of the things we noticed in Vilfredo is a difference between

</I>&gt;<i> shall we build this solar panel? we are essentially asking a question 
</I>&gt;<i> where we want a single, complex answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The division is not strict and there are how question that needs 
</I>&gt;<i> several answers and what questions that have a single answer. And 
</I>&gt;<i> often you can rephrase a how question as a what question, and 
</I>&gt;<i> viceversa. But generally there is a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is important in Vilfredo because we have found how Vilfredo is a 
</I>&gt;<i> great tool for a limited group of people to tackle a how question. But 
</I>&gt;<i> it does not seem to work so well with what questions or if the number

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I think this division should be expressed in the page, but I am
