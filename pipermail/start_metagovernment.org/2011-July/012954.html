</I>Yes! I very much agree that it would be good to have a single integrated 
system that could make decisions with respect to rule-making, task 
execution, and judging behavior, as well as with respect to choosing 
workers and auditing. Whether or not these different kinds of decisions 
need differing mechanisms, they need to be made.

</I>I very much hope not! :-)   My hope (and my intent) is that all 
centralized governments (in particular), and all Big Hierarchical 
Organizations (in general) will be rendered obsolete and wind down to 
the point that they cease to exist, in the near future.

Any experiment succeeds when we learn from it. The &quot;centralized 
government&quot; experiment has now been run many times, in many places, with 
many variations (three branches, five branches, etc.). The results of 
all those centralized government experiments are in at this point, and 
are available for study (both as history and as current events).

For myself, my examination of the evidence leads me to think that 
*dispersing* power would work much better that centralizing power has. 
The &quot;separation of powers&quot; within central governments has not worked 
very well. All three (or five) &quot;separated&quot; powers wind up controlled by 
the hidden hands of special interests, to the detriment of humanity, 
nature and future generations.
