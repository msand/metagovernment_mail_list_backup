<PRE>1. how does the system know if an appraiser is &quot;highly qualified&quot; ?

2. how does the system minimize conflicts and other sources of potential corruption ?

3. how can you be sure experts of a special field do not know each other ?

4. how can you find questions which do not ask about personal preferences, especially if experts know what other things depend on answering such questions ?

5. how can you be sure the appraisers do not try to find each other during the appraisal time interval to coordinate their answers, especially if a network of shadow appraisers have managed to increase their chance to become selected ?

 

6. Will the questions only be yes or no answers to make them comparable ?

7. Who pays the appraisers ?

8. What about creating very special categories with my friends and making friends subscribe to these, so i can put a proposal to it and my friends will agree to it to make it binding for everyone...

 

 

&gt;&gt;<i> &#8230;it just does not feel natural.
</I>
&gt;<i> I hear ya, brother. And also I hear Michael Allen when he says: 
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> Experience teaches me (though I sometimes forget the lesson) that any attempt to communicate
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> technology via ideas, designs or other generalities is a waste of time. You said as much in one of &gt;&gt; your earlier posts Alex, and I thought, &quot;Wow! This guy understands engineering.&quot; The only way to &gt;&gt; connect with non-technologists is via hands on practice.
</I>
 

I think that's not exactly true, because people can actually discuss topics and think themselves into it to see the vision that someone else thought trough before. Not everyone is willing to make that effort, because the further afar you are from the technology the harder it is to think something through. So YES, its not possible to communicate a new technology to a massive audience, but its defenitly possible to communicate it to a small audience interested in the topic.

 

 

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes! Anyone can propose anything, especially objections to proposals (or decisions). Each proposed &gt;&gt; objection is treated as a proposal in its own right, and passes through the appraisal process. The

&gt;&gt;<i> integrity and trustworthiness of the system depends upon people objecting when they see

</I>
 

WTF??? So I do a proposal and it gets rejected, so i redo it over and over until some people will be selected who all agree on it so it becomes &quot;the law&quot;. Soon, someone will create a proposal that will remove my proposal which became &quot;the law&quot;... propably it will pass the first time he makes that proposal or it passes after a few times.

So now again, its my turn and i again create the flawed proposal that became &quot;the law&quot; and try it over and over until again it becomes &quot;the law&quot; ...i think it is similar to an EDIT WAR!!!

And each of these accepted and rejected proposal over the same topic will cost money.

Actually i could becom a shadow appraiser to raise my chance of getting elected and start to spam proposals all over the place for all kinds of categorys and i subscribe to them all. Like with email technology i would flood the system to earn money.

...these kind of edit wars will only resolve if society will discuss it and come to a conclusion, so that its nearly impossible to get a flawed proposal through the system which will reach appraisers that would accept it. ...but until then it costed a lot of money and its a very intransparent process, because the system has so much say and there is so much random selection and so on...

 

 

&gt;<i> Whenever new categories are proposed, notifications of those proposals
</I>
&gt;<i> (and the subsequent decisions) are sent to everyone whose category registration might
</I>
&gt;<i> need to be modified.
</I>
 

So people can flood my inbox with newly proposed categories???

At least in regular voting systems, categorization is a problem, but it only makes the system hard to use, but it's hard to abuse it. Strange categories will propably only contain proposals with a few votes that wont become relevant to the majority any time soon, but in you system this can be used to get strange proposals through the system.

 

 

&gt;<i> There is no &quot;who&quot; for the set as a whole.
</I>
&gt;<i> Anyone in the world can propose any question at any time.
</I>
 

Ok i get it. There are categories

(something that is easy abused in the current design of the apraisal system design),

there are questions that could be attached to categories... but nothing prevents multiple categories for the same thing

(in fact, i believe categories to be something like a &quot;world view&quot;, and because people have different views of the world, it will happen!)

and there are proposals that can be filed into categories and will automatically have the questions attached to that categories...

 

what if:

1. i attach my proposal to categories with to few questions?

2. i formulate my proposal in a way it will fit into a category, but wont have the questions attached to them that are needed to get a &quot;fair&quot; result?

(e.g. &quot;health and welfare system category&quot;: take all the money from the richest 2% of earths inhabitants and distribute it equally among the remaining 98%) ... i guess u can find a proposal that fits into a category and formulate it in a way so that the appopriate questions to get it rejected will not appear.

3. If someone could easily propose the missing question to get it attached, how can you prevent the list of questions from growing to unmanagable sizes?

 

&gt;<i> A1: Would implementation of this proposal potentially endanger future generations?
</I>
&gt;<i> (YES =&gt; turn back) 
</I>
 

There is no neutral question. If you ask this kind of question, people who are in favor of nuclear energy will answer NO and people who are opposed to it will answer YES.

 

The only way i could think of a fair process might be, if u repeat the appraisal process for each proposal very many times, so all kinds of different people will answer it and following laws of statistics, there might be something like (approved: x%, rejected: y%), but that again is somehow like voting, isnt it?

 

&gt;<i> In the wake of Chernobyl and now Fukushima, there is no question at all that the existence of
</I>
&gt;<i> uranium-fueled power plants does potentially endanger future generations. The appraiser may be 
</I>
&gt;<i> absolutely in favor of nuclear energy, but he will nonetheless have to give &quot;YES&quot; as the answer to &gt; this question, even knowing that the proposal will be doomed if he does. There is no principled
</I>
&gt;<i> basis for any other answer.  
</I>
 

Thats a naive assumption. If my wife, my family, my welfare or the welfare of the people surrounding me or the welfare of my industry or maybe the welfare of the city i'm living in depend on it, i WILL NOT ANSWER YES. ...i personally know a few people that sill argue that nuclear energy DOES NOT ENDANGER future generations. Some argue that technology will arise which can handle it. Some argue that the modern technology is very safe (unlike the one used in fukushima which wasnt build for the environment it was used in) and many other strange arguments...

 

&gt;<i> B1: Would implementation of this proposal substantially increase available electrical energy?
</I>
&gt;<i> (NO =&gt; turn back)
</I>
 

I would have answers YES, maybe because i do not have enough knowledge about it, but i was pretty sure that nuclear power plants would help a lot in producing energy, so its very likely there are people like me in this world who would answer the questions from an uninformed point of view, but would still believe there answer was the right one...

 

The shadow-appraisal mechanism is highly important and could be used to game the system.

The shadow-appraisal mechanism you suggest takes the status quo to measure what is good and what is bad, thus strenghtening the status quo. You can only become an appraiser if you learn to answer like the elite does.

Subject: [MG] Appraisal System

 

Alex, Greetings again! Below are responses to your critique of the Appraisal System. However, I will not be surprised if the responses fail to be persuasive to you at this point. The big step on the road to appreciating the appraisal system (or any alternative decision mechanism) involves losing faith in voting as a feasible option at the global level. Until one has reached that point, there is not much reason to be interested in other alternatives. (&quot;If it's not broke, don't fix it.&quot;) (I used to be a &quot;voting is all there is&quot; guy myself, so I know all about that condition.)

I&#8217;m not yet convinced of the appraisal system and the way it might randomly elect a couple of people, usually three, to negotiate issues or decide on something&#8230;

The appraisers do not negotiate, and do not decide, and are not selected just randomly.

Three highly qualified appraisers are software selected so as to minimize conflicts of interest and other potential sources of corruption. (There is indeed a random component to the selection, after the pool has been narrowed down by all the other criteria.)

The appraisers are selected to not know one other or the proposer, and they have no way of communicating while the appraisal is in progress, so that there is never any negotiation of any kind, or any contact of any kind.

The appraisers study the proposal and answer software-presented questions about it. The questions do not ask the appraisers about their personal preferences or for personal value judgments. When all three appraisers answer a particular question the same way, that is taken to be the resolved answer to that question. If the answers to the question differ, the answer remains unresolved, and an investigation is triggered. Neither the agreements nor the disagreements affect whatever decision is subsequently produced by the decision software. The appraisers do not decide; the decision software does. 

The reason that there are three appraisers is to enable comparing answers. Because each appraiser never knows how the others have answered, the three act as &quot;checks and balances&quot; for one another, which makes it very difficult for an appraiser to &quot;game the system&quot; by answering the questions in such a way as to indirectly produce a desired decision. The job of the appraisers is to provide honest input (information) about the proposal to the software decision program.

The reason that there are only three appraisers is that the appraisers are being paid, and adding more appraisers would raise the decision cost. Given that tens of millions of appraisals will be made each year, cost per decision is a very important consideration.

&#8230;it just does not feel natural.

I hear ya, brother. And also I hear Michael Allen when he says: 

Experience teaches me (though I sometimes forget the lesson) that any attempt to communicate technology via ideas, designs or other generalities is a waste of time. You said as much in one of your earlier posts Alex, and I thought, &quot;Wow! This guy understands engineering.&quot; The only way to connect with non-technologists is via hands on practice.

To begin an appraisal session, you would sit down in front of the computer screen, and first study the proposal (which would be presented in all sorts of flashy fancy ways on screen). Then, you would click the &quot;ready to answer&quot; button, and then answer questions about the proposal as they were presented one-by-one on screen. At the point that all questions were answered, you would click the &quot;submit&quot; button, and you would be done. I betcha it would feel quite natural -- you would feel like you were back in school. 

Any person could and many will come up with arguments against the decision.

Yes! Anyone can propose anything, especially objections to proposals (or decisions). Each proposed objection is treated as a proposal in its own right, and passes through the appraisal process. The integrity and trustworthiness of the system depends upon people objecting when they see objectionable proposals or decisions.

A problem that any consensus decision system faces (whether voting or appraisal or any other) is that individuals can object for &quot;bad&quot; reasons. A single individual wishing to make the consensus system unworkable need only object to each and every proposal. An individual wishing to gain &quot;leverage&quot; can object and then bargain for something else entirely unrelated. Any and all can object when a proposal would be detrimental to narrow self-interests. The purpose of sending objections through the appraisal process is to filter out these &quot;bad&quot; objections, while fully honoring all &quot;good&quot; (principled) objections. 

Maybe people won&#8217;t accept the decision made by 3 randomly selected appraisers?

The decision is not made by the three appraisers. The appraisers provide honest input (information) to the decision software. The decision software makes the decision. (The appraisals themselves are available for public inspection after the appraisal project ends, and can serve as a basis for objections.) 

Regarding public acceptance: My main concern is that we really need to actually create the more trustworthy decision making system. For the next few years, things are probably going to get bad enough to cause the public to look around for better systems. I see that as a window of opportunity, if the new system is ready to demonstrate. The decision systems that we have now are not that hard to be better than -- they are horrible. 

1. I don&#8217;t understand how the categorization will happen. If there is a fixed scheme of categories, some proposals won&#8217;t fit in any. If it&#8217;s not fixed, then people have a hard time to decide which category to follow.

The categorization problem is stupendously huge and critically important. Any decision system (whether voting or appraisal or whatever) that has a participating population in the billions and a decision volume in the tens of millions per year faces this problem. In fact, the problem of appropriate and timely notification of new proposals and decisions is exactly the same regardless of which decision mechanisms are used.

In the appraisal system, categorization (including proposing new categories) is an integral part of the system. The proposer categorizes his own proposal (and can propose new categories if need be), and the appraisers categorize the proposal (to make sure the proposer did it right). Whenever new categories are proposed, notifications of those proposals (and the subsequent decisions) are sent to everyone whose category registration might need to be modified.

In dealing with this problem, we do everything we can, and that's all we can do. 

There might also be different categories for the same issues and it will depend on the proposers cultural background under which category he might file his proposal, therefore it will not reach all the people possibly interested in the proposal.

Anyone in the world who spots this kind of problem would be able to immediately propose that the problem exists (thereby putting it into the issues management system -- thank you Alex), and would be free to propose solutions.

2. Who decides on the set of questions that are being asked?

There is no &quot;who&quot; for the set as a whole. 

Anyone in the world can propose any question at any time.

When an appraisal question is proposed, the proposal will contain:

*	the question itself
*	the proposal categories to which the question is relevant
*	the list of anticipated answers
*	(for each answer) the actions that the decision software should take upon receiving that answer 

Subsequently, when any proposer categorizes his own proposal into any of the categories of the question, the question-presentation software will subsequently present the question to the appraisers.

So, for each particular question, the two human actors are the proposer of the question, and the proposer of the proposal questioned.

If an investigation project decides that a question is not suitable as an appraisal question, some people might complain about removing the question or modifying it in a way, so that the proposal becomes appraisable. They might argue that important questions might not be included.

As responsible citizens, it is the job of those people to complain. (And, they will potentially be paid for complaining, if the complaint is appraised to be worthy of payment.) This is what &quot;collaborative governance&quot; is all about. When situations such as this arise, anyone in the world can participate in resolving the situation, through proposing. 

3. An appraisal system would have a fatal flaw. If someone would hack the selection mechanism he could manipulate who answers questions and who investigates on issues, thus giving him a lot of power. People have to trust into the system and that its selection mechanism is reliable. How can they be sure it is not manipulated?

You are absolutely right that the potential would exist for this to happen. We would need to set things up so that it didn't, and so that detection would be easy if it did. (I have all kinds of ideas about how to accomplish that, and probably so do you.)

These sorts of vulnerabilities exist for any computerized system. Here in the USA, our computerized voting systems have been corrupted every which way, with major elections determined by the corrupted vote counts. (Offline systems, of course, are not immune to such corruptions either. Look at any congress or parliament.) 

We do the best we can, and that is all we can do.

4. Why are appraisers information gatherers and not decision makers? If they all consent on a proposal, it will become reality?

Here is a story: Early on in the big &quot;design a new social system&quot; project that I have been working on, I spent the better part of three years trying to come up with a global voting system that would be better than those we have. During that period, the thought of using anything other than voting as the decision mechanism was for me an unthinkable thought. I had not in my wildest imaginings ever considered even the remotest possibility that there might be any other decision mechanism that could enable global collaborative governance. What finally happened during the third year was that it became clear that the fundamental problems of voting were intrinsic, and that it really is true that you can't turn a sow's ear into a silk purse.

At the point that I finally &quot;grokked in fullness&quot; that I was not going to be able to make voting work, I was ready to declare failure, and shut the project down. (It was a big deal to me.) But there were other parts of the project that were going well, so I kept working on those, and pondering the decision making problem became just a puzzle-hobby. In the course of that aimless thinking, I backed into the appraisal system.

The reason I tell this story is to substantiate that I know from personal experience exactly where you are coming from when you ask this question. The appraisal system has to be some sort of voting system, because there can't be anything else.

The direct answer to the question is that if the answers of all appraisers to a particular appraisal question match, then that particular question has a resolved answer. If the three answers do not match, then the question does not have a resolved answer, and an investigation will be triggered. If having a resolved answer to that question turns out to be necessary to reaching a software-generated decision, then there will be no decision from that appraisal project, and another appraisal project (with three different appraisers) will be initiated to deal with the proposal, after the investigation has proposed its findings, and that &quot;findings proposal&quot; has been appraised and acted upon. (This may delay the decision on the original proposal by a week or two.) 

When the answers of all three appraisers match for every question, that means that the decision software will be able to output a decision. The decision is determined (algorithmically) by the answers. The fact of agreement has no effect on what the software-generated decision will be. 

5. Won&#8217;t shadow-appraisal evolve a system that will be change-resistant? Because if a tendency evolves to give a certain kind of answer to a certain kind of question (pro vs. contra nuclear energy), only those &#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; are rewarded who give mainstream answers&#8230;

This is a great question. The short answer is &quot;no&quot;. The kernel of the long answer is that formulating good appraisal questions is actually quite hard, and will take lots of creativity and trial-and-error. For this reason, the appraisal system should start out as part of an online game, so that in the beginning no one depends on it, and everyone can play.

The purpose of asking an appraisal question is to gather decision-relevant information about the proposal. Here is an example of a kind of question will not be asked: &quot;Are you in favor of nuclear energy?&quot; This question does not seek information about the proposal; it seeks information about the answerer. It is a voting question, not an appraisal question. 

The proposer of a question (not the appraiser who answers the question) is the one who has a preference and is attempting to express that preference by inserting it into the appraisal process. For example, someone who is opposed to nuclear energy could propose that this question be asked for all nuclear energy proposals:

*	A1: Would implementation of this proposal potentially endanger future generations? (YES =&gt; turn back) 

Note that from the perspective of the knowledgeable appraiser, answering this question (with respect to a proposal to build a new uranium-fueled power plant) would be a no-brainer. In the wake of Chernobyl and now Fukushima, there is no question at all that the existence of uranium-fueled power plants does potentially endanger future generations. The appraiser may be absolutely in favor of nuclear energy, but he will nonetheless have to give &quot;YES&quot; as the answer to this question, even knowing that the proposal will be doomed if he does. There is no principled basis for any other answer. 

Someone who was in favor of nuclear energy could then propose to replace question A1 with questions A2 and B1:

*	A2: Would implementation of this proposal potentially endanger future generations? (YES =&gt; ask B1)
*	B1: Would implementation of this proposal substantially increase available electrical energy? (NO =&gt; turn back)

What this does, of course, is create a loophole through which to squeeze nuclear power plants.

At this point, the appraisal system version of an edit-war has begun. How is such a war fought? 

All moves are made through proposing. All proposals must argue from facts, projections, and principles. When principles are prioritized, the argument for the prioritization must be based on facts, projections, and principles. Appraisers must never be asked to express personal preferences or personal value judgments.

All the foregoing statements are themselves proposals, that would need to be proposed and pass through the appraisal process successfully in order to become effective. Especially in the beginning, we will be making up everything as we go along. The startup will be the ultimate bootstrap operation. The aim of the startup game will be to create a decision making system that we are willing to trust. The startup game will be seriously hard -- like writing the kernel for an operating system. 

All of the kinds of decisions that the appraisal system will be making are already being made now, by corporations, bureaucracies, legislatures, and so on. The aim is that the appraisal system become able to make those same decisions, better and quicker and cheaper. The appraisal system will not be perfect out of the box, or ever. Perhaps its main advantage is that it is infinitely improvable, and can be improved by anyone. That has not proved to be the case for corporations, bureaucracies, legislatures, and so on. 

Why is there a need of &#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; anyway?

Shadow-appraising is the path to actual appraising. Through shadow-appraising, a partnership accumulates an appraisal history. The appraisal history is distilled into an appraisal rating, and the rating is used in selecting actual appraisers. As the shadow-appraiser's rating increases, it becomes increasingly likely that the partnership will be selected as an actual appraiser. Thus, shadow-appraising is the means through which partnerships become actual appraisers. There are no appraiser schools that produce qualified appraisers -- learning happens on the job, and demonstration of proficiency happens on the job. 

6. I think people will never ever accept decisions being made by 3 randomly selected appraisers who might not have a clue what the proposal is all about and only have a time window of e.g. 3 days to decide on something like (will we increase the public copy-fee) or (will our country go to war?)

As both you and Mike have suggested, the key is hands-on experience. As the appraisal system becomes fully operational, anyone in the world will be able to propose anything, and see whether the system does a good job of deciding, and explore every detail of exactly what led the system to make the decision that it did. Anyone in the world will be able to register as a shadow-appraiser, and experience directly what the work of an appraiser entails, and learn about the sorts of expertise that must be developed in order to become an actual appraiser. All the software will be open source, and available for inspection. The appraisal system will not be some distant thing, that must be accepted on faith without examination or demonstration.

You ask great questions! Feel free to keep doing that!
