      Decision Mechanisms

To me, compromise and synthesis are properties of proposals, and motives 
of proposers, and &quot;mechanisms&quot; for formulating proposals, but not 
decision mechanisms. At the end of the long session in the smoke-filled 
room spent negotiating and synthesizing to create a proposal that 
achieves compromise or synthesis, there will be a vote. The vote is the 
decision mechanism, not the negotiating or the synthesizing.

Voting needs to be on the list of decision mechanisms, as an item in its 
own right. The fact that voting is not already on the list appears to me 
to be a symptom of &quot;in the box&quot; thinking. One the main things that keeps 
us in the box is that we don't realize that there is a box. (The fish 
says &quot;What water?&quot;) Voting is a decision mechanism. It is not the only 
possible decision mechanism that there can be besides edict.

Here is a list of three decision mechanisms:

    * Edict
    * Voting
    * Appraisal &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System</A>&gt;

Representative democracy uses voting as its signature decision 
mechanism. Your idea of collaborative governance also appears to use 
voting as its signature decision mechanism. My idea of collaborative 
governance does not use voting at all. (See Voting Versus Appraisal 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Versus_Appraisal">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Voting_Versus_Appraisal</A>&gt; for reasons.)

The assertions that (a) compromise is the preferred method of 
representative democracy, and that (b) synthesis is the preferred method 
of collaborative governance, appear to me to be really hard assertions 
to support with any kind of evidence or argument. Neither 
&quot;representative democracy&quot; nor &quot;collaborative governance&quot; are sentient 
beings, and so are not the sorts of things that can have preferences. 
Individuals working within either of those systems can seek either 
compromise, or synthesis, or both. To me it seems that the preference 
would lie in each individual, not in either system.

I certainly agree that synthesis is to be preferred over compromise as a 
personal aim in formulating proposals, in either system. In any voting 
system (whether representative or collaborative or whatever), a 
synthetic proposal would be preferred (by anyone with common sense), if 
only because it would probably last longer. Making the unsupportable 
claim that the two systems are distinguished by this feature just 
muddies the waters, as far as I can see.
