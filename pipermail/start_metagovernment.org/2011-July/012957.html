<PRE>Is this a complete list? Is there a theory attached to it?

Is there a branch of science that asks these kinds of questions?

 

&#8226;             landparcel infrastructure systems

&#8226;             manufacturing/production systems

&#8226;             transportation system(s)

- What about an energy supply system? (is a transportation more special than energy supply?)

&#8226;             financial system

&#8226;             economic system

&#8226;             emergency response system(s) (will an institution that might investigate issues be included?)

- What about a media or information system? (is it just a communication system?)

&#8226;             communication system(s)

&#8226;             decision making system(s)

&#8226;             charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)

- What about a judgement system? (is it just a decision making system?)

&#8226;             learning systems

- What about an information or knowledge system?

&#8226;             systems to support research, invention, design

&#8226;             systems to support arts &amp; entertainment

&#8226;             systems to support health

- what about an issues management system?

- What about an audit system?

- whats a human ressources system good for? (like the one taiwan has...)

 

I really like your list, but i want to understand it better so i ask these questions :)

Decision Contexts


To be fully functional, a global trans-community social system needs these parts:

*	decision making system(s)
*	charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
*	financial system
*	economic system
*	learning systems
*	systems to support research, invention, design
*	systems to support arts &amp; entertainment
*	systems to support health
*	communication system(s)
*	transportation system(s)
*	emergency response system(s)
*	landparcel infrastructure systems
*	manufacturing/production systems

So are these examples of what you mean by &quot;decision contexts&quot;? (If your answer is &quot;no,&quot; my feelings will not be hurt. I actually like Pietro's suggestion better that &quot;what&quot; questions and &quot;how&quot; questions are two different decision contexts.)

Hi Ed, 

I am not really sure how to insert this.

 

One of the things we noticed in Vilfredo is a difference between &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions. Or more in general between questions that are looking for a single answer, and questions where multiple concurring answers can be accepted. For example if we are speaking about, what shall we do about global warming, we have several strategies that needs to be followed in parallel. While if we have decided that we are going to build a solar panel, then we ask: &quot;how&quot; shall we build this solar panel? we are essentially asking a question where we want a single, complex answer.

 

The division is not strict and there are how question that needs several answers and what questions that have a single answer. And often you can rephrase a how question as a what question, and viceversa. But generally there is a difference.

 

This is important in Vilfredo because we have found how Vilfredo is a great tool for a limited group of people to tackle a how question. But it does not seem to work so well with what questions or if the number of people is too big.  And it is for this that we are developing the bubble system as part of Vilfredo.

 

Now I think this division should be expressed in the page, but I am unsure on how to add it, after all here we are speaking about type of decisions, and my discourse is about type of questions.

 

Cheers,

Pietro

At the recent Skype meeting, we touched on a topic which I believe needs more attention in most governance projects: clearly defining different kinds of decisions.

Some of our mechanisms may make sense for one kind of decision, but not for another. For example, coordinating the construction of a community service such as a homeless shelter may be a matter of just getting the material and labor necessary to make it happen. But making gambling illegal or legal is an societal ethical decision of a completely different context.

Previously I had started this page on the wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision</A>
It is just a basic outline at this time. I encourage others to expand it and/or to respond on this thread.
