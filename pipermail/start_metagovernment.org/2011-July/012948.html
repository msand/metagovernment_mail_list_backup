<PRE>I would add this:

  4. The need for action.

Ideally the meeting is centered on action.  Not only is it prompted by
a problem of action - we were trying to do A but we ran into problem P
- but it also results in action - we decided on plan B instead, so now
we're doing it.  Otherwise what is the purpose of meetings?  Why
bother with any kind of organizational effort at all if nothing real
ever comes of it?

On the other hand, action itself is often impromptu.  It is often
motivated by a need or opportunity that just happens to arise.  If it
does not arise here - if we ourselves do not feel a need, or see an
opportunity - then probably it has arisen elsewhere.  We ought
therefore to go looking for it.  Looking is itself a valid form of
action.

What do you think?  Could we do something about this?

</I>&gt;<i> though it is difficult to transcribe and participate at the same time.

</I>&gt;<i> I invite other participants to build on this summary, and non- 
</I>&gt;<i> participants to reply with questions you may have in regards to the  
</I>&gt;<i> meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Overall a voice meeting seems like a very useful tool, and I would  
</I>&gt;<i> very much like to do it again. It was great to be able to dig into  
</I>&gt;<i> ideas that seemed clear to the person who initiated them but fuzzy to  
</I>&gt;<i> the rest of us.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only issue was that, as we noted going in, the host needs to have  
</I>&gt;<i> good bandwidth up and down. My router shut down in the middle of the  
</I>&gt;<i> meeting, and Pietro had to reinitiate it. (On the plus side, it's  
</I>&gt;<i> fascinating to think our meeting began in the U.S. and concluded in  
</I>&gt;<i> Italy, with other participants from Germany, Portugal, and Canada.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to suggest we try to have monthly voice meetings. What do  
</I>&gt;<i> you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Issues I'd like to resolve for future meetings include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Being more accessible to a global audience. (Matteo was excluded  
</I>&gt;<i> from that meeting because he resides in Japan, where the start time  
</I>&gt;<i> was local midnight.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. More reliable hosting. We might want to consider asking if  
</I>&gt;<i> individuals would like to make ad hoc payments to a commercial  
</I>&gt;<i> audioconferencing service. There are ones which work with both Skype  
</I>&gt;<i> and phone, and which are not really very expensive at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Transcribing the meeting better.
