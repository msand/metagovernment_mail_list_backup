<PRE>I&#8217;m not yet convinced of the appraisal system and the way it might randomly elect a couple of people, usually three, to negotiate issues or decide on something&#8230;

&#8230;it just does not feel natural. Any person could and many will come up with arguments against the decision.
Maybe people won&#8217;t accept the decision made by 3 randomly selected appraisers?


1. I don&#8217;t understand how the categorization will happen. If there is a fixed scheme of categories, some proposals won&#8217;t fit in any. If it&#8217;s not fixed, then people have a hard time to decide which category to follow.
There might also be different categories for the same issues and it will depend on the proposers cultural background under which category he might file his proposal, therefore it will not reach all the people possibly interested in the proposal.

2. Who decides on the set of questions that are being asked?
If an investigation project decides that a question is not suitable as an appraisal question, some people might complain about removing the question or modifying it in a way, so that the proposal becomes appraisable.
They might argue that important questions might not be included.

3. An appraisal system would have a fatal flaw. If someone would hack the selection mechanism he could manipulate who answers questions and who investigates on issues, thus giving him a lot of power.
People have to trust into the system and that its selection mechanism is reliable. How can they be sure it is not manipulated?

 

4. Why are appraisers information gatherers and not decision makers? If they all consent on a proposal, it will become reality?

5. Won&#8217;t shadow-appraisal evolve a system that will be change-resistant? Because if a tendency evolves to give a certain kind of answer to a certain kind of question (pro vs. contra nuclear energy), only those &#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; are rewarded who give mainstream answers&#8230;
Why is there a need of &#8220;shadow appraisers&#8221; anyway?

6. I think people will never ever accept decisions being made by 3 randomly selected appraisers who might not have a clue what the proposal is all about and only have a time window of e.g. 3 days to decide on something like (will we increase the public copy-fee) or (will our country go to war?)

Alexander, Greetings! You have asked great questions! :-) 

Is this a complete list?

I betcha it will be by the time we are done. I am delighted to now have you working on it with me. 

Is there a theory attached to it?

Yes and no. There is no scientific theory attached to it (so far as I know), but in my work (as a social systems designer), each of the systems in the list has been part of the overall project to design a new kind of social system, capable of rendering obsolete the social systems we now have. Since none of those new designs have yet been implemented, I guess we could appropriately call them theories at this point. 

Is there a branch of science that asks these kinds of questions?

There are definitely individual scientists asking these kinds of questions (including some in the metagovernment community :-) ), but I am not aware of any particular formal branch of science that is focused on them. (If anybody else knows of one or more, please tell!)

&#8226; land parcel infrastructure systems
&#8226; manufacturing/production systems
&#8226; transportation system(s)
What about an energy supply system?
(Is a transportation more special than energy supply?)

The reason that I did not put &quot;energy supply system&quot; as a separate item is that -- by design -- the intention is that every land parcel be energy self-sufficient, and have enough spare energy capacity to provide energy to transportation vehicles. The equipment that produces the energy is one of the &quot;land parcel infrastructure systems.&quot;

At least since the time of Nikola Tesla (and in fact since long before that), numerous ways have been discovered and rediscovered to produce clean and abundant energy locally, with the discoveries each time effectively kept from public use. We are forced to depend on receiving electricity from the grid and gasoline from far away refineries and oil wells because these are profitable and power-full arrangements for the Powers-That-Be, not because there are no other alternatives. 

&#8226; financial system
&#8226; economic system
&#8226; emergency response system(s)
(will an institution that might investigate issues be included?)

Yes and no. The emergency response system that is part of the design package does indeed include investigation capabilities of all kinds, but the social system as a whole contains no &quot;institutions&quot; of any kind. All work is done by small partnerships, with each partnership working to fulfill its own individual project contract. (Partnerships never work &quot;for&quot; other partnerships, and all projects are time-limited. Each investigation case would be a separate project.) 

&#8226; communication system(s)
- What about a media or information system?
(is it just a communication system?)

This item was intended to refer to all the systems of &quot;The Cloud&quot; (satellites, cable runs between land parcels, servers, cloud software of all kinds, etc.). Most if not all of the functionality of what we now call media systems and information systems will indeed probably be available in The Cloud. We should probably find a better term for this item than &quot;communication systems&quot;. 

&#8226; decision making system(s)
&#8226; charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
- What about a judgment system?
(Is it just a decision making system?)

It seems to me that the Appraisal System &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Appraisal_System</A>&gt;  is capable of making all of the kinds of decisions that are now made by judicial systems, executive branch systems, congressional and parliamentary systems, bureaucracies, corporations, NGOs, etc. However, we won't know that for sure until we have actually seen it demonstrated.

&#8226; learning systems
- What about an information or knowledge system?

This question deserves a long response, but one short response would be that (in my software design sketches) the software for the various systems of the list wound up being so tightly integrated and so overlapping as to be essentially a single software system with different functional faces. So, is there a separate information or knowledge system? I guess I would say that we could make it look like there were if we wanted to, and we might want to. In that case, we should probably add it as a separate item on the list. 

&#8226; systems to support research, invention, design
&#8226; systems to support arts &amp; entertainment
&#8226; systems to support health

- what about an issues management system?

One of the core principles of the appraisal system is that anybody can propose anything. I have not myself done any work with issues management systems, and that is the only reason that it was not on my list. I will be very interested to see any proposals you come up with for such a system. 

- What about an audit system?

In my (very idiosyncratic) lexicon, an audit is a particular kind of investigation. Each audit would be a project, carried out by a small partnership. If the audit required multiple partnerships, each of the partnerships would be working on its own project within the overall project, with its relations and responsibilities to the other partnerships spelled out in its own project contract. 

Both the appraisal system and the emergency response system have the ability to trigger investigations (including audits), and many kinds of big projects trigger an investigation when the project ends, as part of the project appraisal process. So I guess I didn't put a separate list item for investigations and audits because the function is actually a part of those other systems. 

- What's a human resources system good for? (like the one Taiwan has...)

I can't speak to what Taiwan has, but the general purpose of a human resources system is to match workers to work. In my designs, this would involve matching partnerships to projects. Below is an excerpt from the Appraisal System article that talks about the functionality of the &quot;human resources&quot; software of the appraisal system.

The software will also select the three appraisers. The selection criteria can include anything and everything which might eliminate or mitigate conflicts of interest and other sources of corruption. For example:

*	select the three appraisers from three different continents
*	select three appraisers who speak three different native languages
*	select appraisers having no known associations with one another or the proposer
*	select appraisers who have never appraised together
*	select appraisers who have never appraised any of the proposer's prior proposals

I really like your list, but i want to understand it better so i ask these questions :)

Decision Contexts


To be fully functional, a global trans-community social system needs these parts:

*	decision making system(s)
*	charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
*	financial system
*	economic system
*	learning systems
*	systems to support research, invention, design
*	systems to support arts &amp; entertainment
*	systems to support health
*	communication system(s)
*	transportation system(s)
*	emergency response system(s)
*	landparcel infrastructure systems
*	manufacturing/production systems

So are these examples of what you mean by &quot;decision contexts&quot;? (If your answer is &quot;no,&quot; my feelings will not be hurt. I actually like Pietro's suggestion better that &quot;what&quot; questions and &quot;how&quot; questions are two different decision contexts.)

Hi Ed, 

I am not really sure how to insert this.

 

One of the things we noticed in Vilfredo is a difference between &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions. Or more in general between questions that are looking for a single answer, and questions where multiple concurring answers can be accepted. For example if we are speaking about, what shall we do about global warming, we have several strategies that needs to be followed in parallel. While if we have decided that we are going to build a solar panel, then we ask: &quot;how&quot; shall we build this solar panel? we are essentially asking a question where we want a single, complex answer.

 

The division is not strict and there are how question that needs several answers and what questions that have a single answer. And often you can rephrase a how question as a what question, and viceversa. But generally there is a difference.

 

This is important in Vilfredo because we have found how Vilfredo is a great tool for a limited group of people to tackle a how question. But it does not seem to work so well with what questions or if the number of people is too big.  And it is for this that we are developing the bubble system as part of Vilfredo.

 

Now I think this division should be expressed in the page, but I am unsure on how to add it, after all here we are speaking about type of decisions, and my discourse is about type of questions.

 

Cheers,

Pietro

At the recent Skype meeting, we touched on a topic which I believe needs more attention in most governance projects: clearly defining different kinds of decisions.

Some of our mechanisms may make sense for one kind of decision, but not for another. For example, coordinating the construction of a community service such as a homeless shelter may be a matter of just getting the material and labor necessary to make it happen. But making gambling illegal or legal is an societal ethical decision of a completely different context.

Previously I had started this page on the wiki:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Decision</A>
It is just a basic outline at this time. I encourage others to expand it and/or to respond on this thread.
