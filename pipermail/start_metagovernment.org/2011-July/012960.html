<PRE>This list may be somewhat beyond the scope of what I was talking about  
(not that it isn't valuable as well). Please feel free to add this  
list to the wiki in a related article.

The purpose of the article on Decisions is to help with discussions of  
decision-rules when building governance software. There are many times  
on this list when we talk about how decisions are made, but we are  
only talking about one kind of decision.

For example, the resources, commitment, and social organization needed  
to make a decision about building a community kindergarden are  
different than those needed to make a decision about the legality of  
alcoholic beverages. Having a better definition of Decisions can help  
us better understand how to make the tools to help communities reach  
them.

Some of the systems listed here are kinds of things which use decision- 
making processes, so are related, but not the same thing. Does that  
sound right?

</I>&gt;<i> Decision Contexts
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To be fully functional, a global trans-community social system needs  
</I>&gt;<i> these parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> decision making system(s)
</I>&gt;<i> charters &amp; contracts (legal instruments)
</I>&gt;<i> financial system
</I>&gt;<i> economic system
</I>&gt;<i> learning systems
</I>&gt;<i> systems to support research, invention, design
</I>&gt;<i> systems to support arts &amp; entertainment
</I>&gt;<i> systems to support health
</I>&gt;<i> communication system(s)
</I>&gt;<i> transportation system(s)
</I>&gt;<i> emergency response system(s)
</I>&gt;<i> landparcel infrastructure systems
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturing/production systems
</I>&gt;<i> So are these examples of what you mean by &quot;decision contexts&quot;? (If  
</I>&gt;<i> your answer is &quot;no,&quot; my feelings will not be hurt. I actually like  
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's suggestion better that &quot;what&quot; questions and &quot;how&quot; questions  
</I>&gt;<i> are two different decision contexts.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One of the things we noticed in Vilfredo is a difference between  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;what&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions. Or more in general between questions  
</I>&gt;<i> that are looking for a single answer, and questions where multiple  
</I>&gt;<i> concurring answers can be accepted. For example if we are speaking  
</I>&gt;<i> about, what shall we do about global warming, we have several  
</I>&gt;<i> strategies that needs to be followed in parallel. While if we have  
</I>&gt;<i> decided that we are going to build a solar panel, then we ask: &quot;how&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> shall we build this solar panel? we are essentially asking a  
</I>&gt;<i> question where we want a single, complex answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The division is not strict and there are how question that needs  
</I>&gt;<i> several answers and what questions that have a single answer. And  
</I>&gt;<i> often you can rephrase a how question as a what question, and  
</I>&gt;<i> viceversa. But generally there is a difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is important in Vilfredo because we have found how Vilfredo is  
</I>&gt;<i> a great tool for a limited group of people to tackle a how question.  
</I>&gt;<i> But it does not seem to work so well with what questions or if the  
</I>&gt;<i> number of people is too big.  And it is for this that we are  
</I>&gt;<i> developing the bubble system as part of Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now I think this division should be expressed in the page, but I am  
</I>&gt;<i> unsure on how to add it, after all here we are speaking about type  
</I>&gt;<i> of decisions, and my discourse is about type of questions.
