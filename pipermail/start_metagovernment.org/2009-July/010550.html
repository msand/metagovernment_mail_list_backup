<PRE>Michael, users would vote (and, if they choose, comment) on individual goal
and objective statements of which they are stakeholders.  

They would not necessarily vote on entire strategic plans and, presumably,
they would self-select themselves to vote (&amp;/or comment) only on goals and
objectives in which they have an interest -- either as potential
beneficiaries or as &quot;performers&quot; of the required tasks, e.g., paying taxes
or user fees.  However, to the degree necessary and appropriate, &quot;rules&quot;
could be applied to determine who is eligible to participate based upon the
attributes of individual stakeholders.

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires U.S. federal
agencies &quot;When developing a strategic plan [to] solicit and consider the
views and suggestions of those entities [stakeholders] potentially affected
by or interested in such a plan.&quot; [5 USC 306(d)]
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/mgmt-gpra_gplaw2m/#h3">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/mgmt-gpra_gplaw2m/#h3</A>  

One way or another, they all do so.  However, in my view, they do so poorly,
and regardless of how well they may do it, there is always room for
improvement ... which is how I hope MetaScore and similar software services
can add value.

When AIIM announces approval of the StratML standard (hopefully in a couple
months), it would be neat if Metagov could issue a statement announcing the
availability of and pointing to software and services enabling citizens more
easily, effectively, and &quot;directly&quot; provide feedback in the GPRA
consultation process.

P.S. It would also be good if the expectation could be established that all
candidates for elective office will document their &quot;platforms&quot; in StratML
format on their political action committee Web sites, so that interested
folks can vote directly on individual objectives rather than being forced to
vote only on the candidate him or herself.  Moreover, in the longer-term,
rather than merely using our votes to project our responsibilities onto
someone else, it would be good to redirect the focus toward achieving our
common objective using the resources and efforts that we ourselves are
willing and able to bring to bear, in partnership with those who share our
objectives.

Really, that's interesting.  So instead of voting up i) legislation or
policy statements, you vote up ii) StratML docs?

In that case, you probably won't be restricted to using Metascore.
Any public decision-making system that's reasonably flexible ought to
suffice.

Maybe the StratML community will be the first customer in line then -
the first to be served by the new, reformed Metagov.  Is it your hope
to bring a touch of direct democracy (so to speak) to enterprise
management?  It might have that effect.
