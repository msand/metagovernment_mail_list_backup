My own suggestion is given in [[Metagovernment:healthy society]].
Perhaps a poor place for it but reads something like:

The goal of a project such as metagovernment is to design a
bootstrapping system that meets not the desires of society, per se,
but the *mechanisms* in which those desires can be best achieved. As
such, its goal is to find a commonly agreeable framework and standard
about which every individual can agree is fair and applicable to all.
In political science terms, this would be called a &quot;constitution&quot;:
the fundamental, bottom-level rules which allow the body of society to
organize and construct itself, properly allocating decision-making
authority where needed to those who are most qualified and motivated,
while at the same time rewarding those who contribute and serve the
larger desires of society.

See also [[free and open source software]] for additional &quot;ground
rules&quot;  or &quot;preamble&quot;.

Also, as for the name &quot;open source governance&quot; I think it should be
noted that all the title suggestions given thus far can have their own
title pages that use the #REDIRECT command to direct the user to the
same content with minimal redundancy.  Using the statistical features
of the wiki (and its crowdsourced design, in general), one can let the
users determine the most favored (not unlike Pietro's software).  The
nice thing about the wiki is that it allows for the best solution to
evolve *in situ*:  there is no separate decision-making process
beforehand which, in practice, seems to slow progress down intolerably
(if any doubt on that, consider that an online encyclopedia could have
never even been conceived without this feature)--different opinions
just get different pages and the crowd determines which gets adopted.
