<PRE>Yes, changes to the wiki draft home page are of course highly  
encouraged:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07</A>

At some point soon, we should make this the new home page of  
metagovernment.org. It is getting awkward these days when I tell  
people about the project and have to say that the homepage is out of  
date, and that a new draft page is what the project is actually about  
these days. It would also be easier for other projects to understand  
(when we approach them) if we have this on our homepage instead of a  
sub-page.

So, please make changes to this page as you see fit. When there are no  
more changes for a few days and no dissent to changing it, I (or  
someone else) will assume there is a consensus and will change the  
homepage to use the content on this page.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Softwares like Votorola use a delegation system, where people can

</I>&gt;<i> Both of these are more advanced than traditional representation, so
