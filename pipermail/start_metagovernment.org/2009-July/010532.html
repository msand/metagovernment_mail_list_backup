<PRE>Dear Vilfredo users,
there was a small bug in Vilfredo that I just spotted. Unfortunately by the
time I noticed it, it has deleted various rows of information. It was a bug
that would delete the old endorsements on a question, when a person would
endorse something in the last generation of that question.

This did not change who won the various generations, nor who the winners
are, but now the proof of it is failing.

So we corrected the bug, added a NB advise near the history, explaining that
it might not be complete, and added a point in the FAQ.

I could go back and change the DB, but I don't know all the information that
was deleted, maybe it is possible to recover the older DB from dreamhost,
but again I am not sure if it is worth, for now.

SOrry about that. At least if you see things you do not understand, you know
why.

Cheers,
Pietro
