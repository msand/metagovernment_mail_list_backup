<PRE>Hello Arthur,
welcome.


You are making a movie on this?
Now this is exciting.

I have grown up with science fiction, and now I just cannot read any
science fiction, as it is always old, by the time I read it.
Reality is faster than fantasy those days.

So I started thinking how would I imagine the future, considering the
internet, and how society is changing  (and of course also nano
technologies, and artificial life, and biology, ...) and yet when I
try to do this exercise I find it really difficult. The whole world
seem to be exploding of innovations all the time.

And now you want to make a movie to
&gt;<i> help inject the idea of
</I>&gt;<i> popular self government both at a local and global level.
</I>
Wow!!! How can I help you?

Do you have any script to read?
Can I lend you a couple of ideas?

Is someone already taken for the part of C3PO ;-)


Regards,
Pietro
