Well, actually not. You often get tortured if you become too unpleasent.
But I will agree that while you are allowed to speak, this have little or no
effect.
Like a wheel that can turn on itself, but is not linked with the engine.

</I>&gt;<i> decisions. In representative democracy, the act of voting for a candidate
</I>is
&gt;<i> the only actual participation in the actual decision-making process that
</I>we
&gt;<i> get. Everything else is not democratic because the participation is not

&gt;<i> potentially be completely ignored by my representative. In that case, all

&gt;<i> my actions are irrelevant to the actual decision-making process.In the
</I>&gt;<i> status quo, I can only *hope* that my representative will listen to me.

&gt;<i> I have to pick one or a very few issues to be heard on, or it is almost

&gt;<i> my mind.
</I>

But if your critics to a law where to appear next to the law, in the moment
in which everybody is voting the law, would you not feel that your right of
criticism has suddenly become politics?


As Beppe Grillo (italian comedian, among the top 10 bloggers in the world),
said:
we have so many delinquents in the parliament,
when we vote the criminal record of each should be attached under each name.
Then at least each would be able to chose the crook he prefers.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The critical difference in open governance is that all decision-making is
</I>&gt;<i> open to participation by everyone. Whether or not the debate is integrated
</I>&gt;<i> into the system may be relevant and helpful, but the most important part
</I>is
&gt;<i> opening up the decisions to everyone. That's the real promise of
</I>democracy,
&gt;<i> and any system in which any citizen is not guaranteed input into any
</I>&gt;<i> decision is less than democratic.
</I>

I disagree on this. I fear that if people discuss things in room A, and then
vote in room B, too many people will never enter into room A, will just stay
in room B, and not realise what is really going on.

There have been many situations in History where we all believed we were on
the verge to reach a really good and fair society.

Universal Male Voting was surely one. Voting for Women was another.

You can understand how those moments gave rise to those ambitions. After all
if the poor people are allowed to vote, what would stop them from voting
someone who it really a friend of the poor?

People vote with their guts, and the guts can be easily manipulated with
some precise advertisment. And this is what is stopping them. Even a direct
democracy like this will not really change the status quo. The discussion
must be interweaven inside the voting.

The results of the discussion must be available WHEN you are voting.

Pietro

P.S. I find myself limited with no *bold* *italic* and *underline*.
If I send emails in HTML are they correctly read by all?
