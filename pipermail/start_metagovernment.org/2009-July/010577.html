<PRE>I have some problem with the nebulosity of just saying we all should  
get together. Who is &quot;we all?&quot; There needs to be some sort of limiting  
factor before we bring in others or we won't be sure who to bring in.  
The field is vast, and if we try to accommodate everyone, we become  
just a meaningless collection of unassociated groups. Or, alternately,  
it can be said that e-democracy.org is already fulfilling the general  
role.

What makes the existing Metagovernment project -- along with the other  
groups that have participated -- unique is our focus on pushing  
democracy out to the people and away from the anointed few through the  
use of internet technologies. We each have different approaches and in  
some respects different philosophies, but we all share the use of  
internet tools and the empowerment of individuals. So I think we were  
on the right track with:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to support the  
development of internet tools which enable the members of any  
community to fully participate in the governance of that community.&quot;

I agree with the idea that we shouldn't take this step too  
seriously... ie, that we allow the mission to grow/change as more  
people join. But it makes sense to have *something* of a definition to  
start with. That way we know what groups we should be approaching and  
what we should be telling them we are asking them to join.

</I>&gt;<i> potentially interested project further away from the co-founder-

</I>&gt;<i> I think, we should approach them right now.
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow like: &quot;We are now 5(?) e-dem-projects looking for better  
</I>&gt;<i> ways to cooperate with each other and would also like to cooperate

</I>&gt;<i> towards this goal and we would like to invite you to join us. We  
</I>&gt;<i> have no more precise Mission Statement yet, because for that your  
</I>&gt;<i> input would be necessary and hoped for. ...&quot;
