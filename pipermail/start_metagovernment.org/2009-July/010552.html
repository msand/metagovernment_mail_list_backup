<PRE>Hi Michael,

Vilfredo is becoming open source soon.

There are some prerequisite, but I think by the end of this month they could
be all solved.

After that I will publish the algorithm.

I also would want to make the website opensource. I need to speak about it
with Chris, but being him a great supporter of open source I would be
surprised if he would not want it.

Still I don't know how to publish it.
I know I can't just &quot;publish&quot; the files, as they include details like the
password name for the DB, and similar sensitive data.

How do people usually solve this?

&gt;<i> (Vilfredo could play that trick too, if you could loosen up your
</I>&gt;<i> definition of integration, and adopt the &quot;small tools&quot; philososphy of
</I>&gt;<i> Unix.)
</I>
Sorry, this just went over my head.

I think Vilfredo is a bit too simple to be further subdivided. But I am
interested to be proven wrong.

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; That's interesting.  Votorola is designed to interface with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; recombinant text, and recombinant text has a close relation to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; human-based evolutionary (and genetic) algorithms:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You know, one of the complex things that are missing in Vilfredo is a
</I>&gt;<i> tool
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that let you integrate the answers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this regard what they have done at MixedInk is very good. As not only
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brings up the text you might be interested, but if you add it, it keeps
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; information of the author. And then you can see the different color for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different authors. I wish we had something like that for Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could, if:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   i) the technology was open, and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ii) you could negotiate interfaces with the developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If moreover the negotiation process (ii) was itself open, then the sum
</I>&gt;<i> of your efforts would feed into:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  iii) the open e-democracy architecture (or ecosystem).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By contrast, Votorola could interface with MixedInk even today, if
</I>&gt;<i> only the developers had provided a simple URL for each proposal.  That
</I>&gt;<i> would be cool eh?  Imagine Votorola taking over MixedInk's servers!
</I>&gt;<i> (Vilfredo could play that trick too, if you could loosen up your
</I>&gt;<i> definition of integration, and adopt the &quot;small tools&quot; philososphy of
</I>&gt;<i> Unix.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On another note, it's been quiet in the NCDD list since MixedInk took
</I>&gt;<i> over phase III.  For possible reasons, see the thread &quot;Phase III
</I>&gt;<i> Extended: Open Government Update&quot; in these weeks:
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (All my own proposals have been rejected by the other Vilfredo users,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  and have disappeared from view.  But I still think they're good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  proposals.  What should I do?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe the proposal you have written have been rejected,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but at least one of the proposal you have endorsed is always included in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (please re read the last phrase, that is half of the core of Vilfredo. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you get this you get the selection process)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In other words:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By definition the Pareto Front ALWAYS include a proposal that have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; endorsed by each user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I even think (but I am not mathematically sure, yet), that a Pareto Front
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the smallest set that satisfy this requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you are so attached to your own proposal, then you just need to
</I>&gt;<i> endorse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only your own proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If everybody does this, the pareto front becomes the whole set of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And society unexistant :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I understand.  If you think your proposal is a good one, then you
</I>&gt;<i> should vote for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Somehow the system works on the assumption that although everybody
</I>&gt;<i> writes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and everybody endorses, people are not so attached to their own proposal
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advance. In other words, it is ok, and accepted to vote for your own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals, if you genuinely think they are better. But it is bad manners
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do it, just to remain in the pareto front. We had some cases in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now the history clearly shows who writes what, and whoe endorses what,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is pretty easy to spot this kind of behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the suggested action against this behaviour?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing. Keep on doing your thing. Keep on endorsing only what you agree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually the whole system will still generate its own best proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the grandious kid (sorry, no better way to define such behaviour), will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; remain with its own unedited proposals, only endorse by himself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sad fate!  I hope the story has a happier ending for our hero. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>

Yes, when he grows up, he joins the rest of the human community :)
