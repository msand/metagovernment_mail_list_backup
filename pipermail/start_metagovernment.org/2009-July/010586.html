<PRE>I have changed this statement on the wiki ever so slightly, as follows:

We expect new forms of governance software to be adopted in small
communities and to spread outward with the potential to replace every
institution of [[representative democracy]] with [[open source governance]].


Instead of :

We expect new forms of governance software to be adopted in small
communities and to spread outward until they have replaced every institution
of [[representative democracy]] with [[open source governance]].

Since this is a draft, perhaps we should all be editing the draft to come up
with more acceptable phrasing? This, after all, is the wiki-way :)
