I wanted to address this issue separately, as it was something I did  
not make very clear in my presentation.

All of that extraneous process around our decision-making is indeed  
part of the political process, but it is not (in my opinion)  
democracy. You can have the same conversations and even the same  
upward-trickle of ideas in a monarchy or almost any other form of  
government.

i think that what defines democracy is the participation in the actual  
decisions. In representative democracy, the act of voting for a  
candidate is the only actual participation in the actual decision- 
making process that we get. Everything else is not democratic because  
the participation is not guaranteed. I can debate and protest and  
petition for years on one issue and potentially be completely ignored  
by my representative. In that case, all of my actions are irrelevant  
to the actual decision-making process.In the status quo, I can only  
*hope* that my representative will listen to me. And I have to pick  
one or a very few issues to be heard on, or it is almost certain they  
will ignore me as a crackpot if I bug them about every issue on my mind.

The critical difference in open governance is that all decision-making  
is open to participation by everyone. Whether or not the debate is  
integrated into the system may be relevant and helpful, but the most  
important part is opening up the decisions to everyone. That's the  
real promise of democracy, and any system in which any citizen is not  
guaranteed input into any decision is less than democratic.
