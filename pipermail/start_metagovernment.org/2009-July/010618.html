<PRE>I think in the second paragraph on the main page, we should replace &quot;...with
the potential to replace every institution of representative democracy
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy</A>&gt;  with open
source governance

with &quot;...with the potential to replace institutions of representative

&lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Open_source_governance">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Open_source_governance</A>&gt; .&quot;
 
I think it makes us sound a little less radical.  I'll make the edit if
others agree.

Subject: Re: [Start] Transition Steps
 
Any other comments? Shall we replace the current metagovernment.org Main
Page with <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07</A> ?
 
If there are no objections by Monday 7/27, then it likely will be changed.
 
P.S. Please make edits to the above page now if you have any improvements to
offer.

Hi Ed, 
thanks for all the work.

I would say:
just move it now.

It will get better with time.

Yes, changes to the wiki draft home page are of course highly encouraged:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07</A>
 
At some point soon, we should make this the new home page of
metagovernment.org. It is getting awkward these days when I tell people
about the project and have to say that the homepage is out of date, and that
a new draft page is what the project is actually about these days. It would
also be easier for other projects to understand (when we approach them) if
we have this on our homepage instead of a sub-page.
 
So, please make changes to this page as you see fit. When there are no more
changes for a few days and no dissent to changing it, I (or someone else)
will assume there is a consensus and will change the homepage to use the
content on this page.
 
Thanks.

I have changed this statement on the wiki ever so slightly, as follows:

We expect new forms of governance software to be adopted in small
communities and to spread outward with the potential to replace every
institution of [[representative democracy]] with [[open source governance]].


Instead of :

We expect new forms of governance software to be adopted in small
communities and to spread outward until they have replaced every institution
of [[representative democracy]] with [[open source governance]]. 

Since this is a draft, perhaps we should all be editing the draft to come up
with more acceptable phrasing? This, after all, is the wiki-way :)

If we keep this on as a stated goal, then I would additionally note that
'every institution of representative democracy' may be a bit extreme. Do we
as a group feel that there are *no* scenarios in which a representative
democracy might be better than open source governance? I can imagine a
hybrid government like the US senate &amp; house of reps, where the house of
reps is replaced by OS democracy but the senate remains. Isn't it a bit soon
to say that such a strategy isn't ideal?
 
Softwares like Votorola use a delegation system, where people can delegate a
representative but can take that delegation away at any time. Projects like
DemoEx use a direct-representation mix, where there is a representative, but
that rep is bound to act in accordance with the will of the collective.

Both of these are more advanced than traditional representation, so yes I
would say that we want to overturn the traditional model altogether. But
that also agrees with Jim's statement that my wording seems to radical.
There should be a way to incorporate these forms of permutation into the
verbiage. Unfortunately I don't have time to work on it now as am preparing
for a meeting in half an hour. :)

I personally would have preferred the original from Ed, but I can understand
how unconfortable must be for someone who is working side by side with the
gov to be associated with a bunch of leftist utopian technicratz ;-)
 
Just to be clear, I don't see this project as leftist at all. I consider
myself a radical moderate (and leave the details up to the beholder). We
certainly are anti-authoritarian, but that does not and should not equate
with the Left. We need participation from everyone to ever gain traction.

(And yes, Pietro, I suspect you were joking, but I think this needs to be
said outright so there is no misunderstanding.)
