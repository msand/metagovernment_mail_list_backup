<PRE>Ed, to replace the words &quot;which allows,&quot; I like the word &quot;enabling&quot;.

I also still think the concept of &quot;governance&quot; has been vastly oversold,
tends to deflect attention away from that which we can and should do for
ourselves in favor of trying to tell others what they should do, and may
inherently and needlessly impose the risk of abuse of power.  (One of the
things I noticed about my involvement in the federal CIO Council was that
everyone wanted to be on the Governance Committee and far fewer folks wanted
to serve on the committees charged with actually doing the work.)

While I would prefer to focus on decision-making and action (in pursuit of
shared goals), I don't expect to win this argument anytime soon and don't
intend to fall on my sword over the continued use of the term &quot;governance&quot;.
However, it would be good to have a clear definition of what *we* mean and
do not mean when we use it.  For example, it seems to me that the ability to
coerce behavior is generally implied.  See, for example,
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#The_state_and_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#The_state_and_politics</A> 

Do we mean to imply that anyone may be forced to do anything that is not of
their own volition?  <A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/volition">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/volition</A>

Subject: Re: [Start] Mission Statement

One comment I recently learned in the exercise of developing a mission  
statement: imagine you are in an elevator with someone. You both get  
on on the first floor, and they ask what your project does. You have  
until you get off to explain it to them. This is referred to as the  
&quot;elevator pitch.&quot; The point is that you have to be extremely brief and  
also extremely clear. So that said, try to limit your phrases to  
something you could say to someone in one sentence and have them  
immediately understand you. The more complexity to the sentence, the  
more likely you are to lose them.

That said... integrating all of the responses so far, I am seeing this:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to foster the study,  
development, and use of open source software which allows the members  
any community to govern themselves.&quot;

I'm still not liking the nuance of the last section, starting with  
&quot;which allows...&quot; I think there should be a clearer way to say this  
and still have it be very concise.
