I think we should use Vilfredo... in a little while. I like the dialog  
we are having in this format, and I would suggest that that is a  
limitation of Vilfredo. Right now, we are not just making suggestions  
and voting on which one we like best, we are commenting on each  
others' suggestions and making tweaks to them. I think this sort of  
process could be integrated into Vilfredo, and I have just suggested  
it on <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=17">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=17</A>

In other words... currently Vilfredo does not promote cross- 
fertilization of ideas. People can propose ideas and vote them up and  
down, but there is no formal logic which allows a person to say why  
they support/oppose a proposal. So sometimes, I might not know how to  
answer a question, but I can tell others what I like or don't like  
about the proposals they have made so far and hope that they can use  
my suggestions to come up with a better proposal.

So anyway... for now, I suggest that we continue the discussion on the  
list until we see some refinements worked out, and then we place  
several of the most favored items on Vilfredo and see if we can come  
up with a winner.

I haven't really tried it out, but so far I am not seeing the appeal.  
I think the process we are using now, combined with Vilfredo would  
work better. And I like the idea of using the tools of the group, and  
tools which are not bound by a commercial entity and a simply massive  
terms of agreement.
