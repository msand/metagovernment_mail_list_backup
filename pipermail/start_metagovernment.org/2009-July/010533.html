<PRE>While it's good to be specific, this seems (to me) a little too specific
given that our aims are to be an organizer of organizations.

For example, if I were on an elevator, I would not likely say &quot;study,
development, and use of .. &quot; there's got to be a phrase that can encompass
all three (and, potentially more).

I'm laughing reading this because these words are like little earmarks : )
though I agree with Pietro's remarks.

Development in the larger sense (ie developing capabilities), rather than
specifically of software could easily cover these three.

I am thinking something along the lines of the following (in part, inspired
by Michael's mission, below):

[Support|Promote] development of [software|tools|potential] for direct
democracy via the internet

Or, simply, Support initiatives promoting or enabling direct democracy


This brings up a few questions that may need discussion:

   1. do we really want to focus on software development rather than include
   algorithms / interface design / hardware-technology / ???
   2. is our mission to promote, coordinate, foster, ?? engage in
   participate in the development of these things? I personally like &quot;support&quot;
   because it encompasses all of these.
   3. do we want to limit the project to web-based initiatives? It would
   certainly help clarify the 'elevator pitch'
   At the same time, if there were a better way that didn't use the
   internet, would we not include that since it's not via the internet?

Thoughts from the group?

We would then follow this by saying something like:

Specifically, :

   - work towards open standards and foster collaboration between projects
   - brainstorm about implementation and methods
   - promote adoption of direct democracy by communities
   - participate in development of tools for direct democracy
   - engage existing open source communities with potential for
   collaboration (read: mediawiki presentation)
