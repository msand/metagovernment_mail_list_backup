Hi Pietro,

Respectfully, I favour an open architecture.  It depends on keeping
the tools physically separate.  I will explain.  Here's the three
tools you mention:

  1. Brainstorming

  2. Discussion

  3. Voting

It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
and voting.  Brainstormers are supposed to be non-judgemental.  Their
interaction is limited to statements like: &quot;What if X!&quot;  and &quot;Yeah,
that's a great idea, then we could do Y!&quot;  The point is to get a
positive storm of ideas, not to sort the good from the bad.  In true
brainstorming, no idea is ever better than another.

Discussion and voting, on the other hand, have a different relation.
They must be mixed together, or the one will be aimless and the other
irrational.  But there is no reason why the discussion and voting
tools themselves must be welded together into a single system.  One
can instead have an open architecture, in which people can pick up
different tools for different purposes, and different people are free
to make different choices.  The choice to do a particular
brainstorming session in Vilfredo should not preclude the choice to
discuss the resulting ideas in a mailing list; nor should the choice
of a mailing list by some of the participants, preclude the choice of
Debategraph by others.

That said, there is no reason why the participants cannot interleave
these systems *procedurally*.  They may be stuck in a discussion that
is going in circles, for example, and boring everyone to tears.  So
they may decide to head back into a brainstorming session in order to
recharge their batteries and share perspectives.  Meanwhile others are
separately voting on the same issue.  In the birds-eye view, the
process is ongoing - parallel cycles of brainstorming, discussion and
vote shifting - and never ending.

I think the participants will prefer to use these tools within an open
architecture, and that's how we ought to build them.
