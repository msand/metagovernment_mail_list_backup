<PRE>Ed, you left off the rest of the StratML  Committee's definition of
&lt;Vision&gt;, i.e., &quot;thus motivating its actions toward a future state it
strives to achieve.&quot;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision</A>

 

Jacki's message to which I was responding contained some statements that
could be taken as objectives.  As Phil has pointed out, they state what we
might *do* rather than what we aim to *accomplish* (in terms of outcomes).
Ultimately, what we *do* (and who volunteers to do it) is what matters
because it will determine our outputs, and outcomes cannot be achieved
without outputs.  On the other hand, as Phil has pointed out, it would be
good to be clear about the outcome(s) we are trying to achieve.  It would
also be good to be clear about for whom we are trying to achieve such
results, as well as to engage them in providing feedback to ensure that we
are meeting their needs/expectations.

 

The reason I subscribed to the Metagov listserv was to learn if MetaScore
might be used to enable stakeholder feedback on goals and objectives
documented in StratML documents.

It sounds like we may be debating the distinction between a vision statement
versus a mission statement.

 

I'm not sure I see that confusion. It looks to me like we're mostly focused
on mission. I don't think I agree with the definition of vision as &quot;A
concise and inspirational statement implicitly relating an organization's
purpose to its values.&quot; I was under the impression that a vision statement
was precisely that: our statement of what our vision for the future is. In
other words: what we envision the world will be like if we are successful.
If that is the definition, then I think we are pretty close if we just use
something like the current vision:

It would be good to specify our objectives and stakeholders as well as our
mission, vision, values, and goal(s).

 

Given how much debate we have over just the mission statement, I thought it
would be better to focus on them sequentially. But you're welcome to take
the lead here if you want to take a stab at all four...
