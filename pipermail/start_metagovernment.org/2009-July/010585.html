Softwares like Votorola use a delegation system, where people can  
delegate a representative but can take that delegation away at any  
time. Projects like DemoEx use a direct-representation mix, where  
there is a representative, but that rep is bound to act in accordance  
with the will of the collective.

Both of these are more advanced than traditional representation, so  
yes I would say that we want to overturn the traditional model  
altogether. But that also agrees with Jim's statement that my wording  
seems to radical. There should be a way to incorporate these forms of  
permutation into the verbiage. Unfortunately I don't have time to work  
on it now as am preparing for a meeting in half an hour. :)

Just to be clear, I don't see this project as leftist at all. I  
consider myself a radical moderate (and leave the details up to the  
beholder). We certainly are anti-authoritarian, but that does not and  
should not equate with the Left. We need participation from everyone  
to ever gain traction.

(And yes, Pietro, I suspect you were joking, but I think this needs to  
be said outright so there is no misunderstanding.)
