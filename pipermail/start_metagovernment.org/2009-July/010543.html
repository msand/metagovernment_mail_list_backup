<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> &gt; That's interesting.  Votorola is designed to interface with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recombinant text, and recombinant text has a close relation to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; human-based evolutionary (and genetic) algorithms:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields">http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You know, one of the complex things that are missing in Vilfredo is a tool
</I>&gt;<i> that let you integrate the answers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In this regard what they have done at MixedInk is very good. As not only it
</I>&gt;<i> brings up the text you might be interested, but if you add it, it keeps the
</I>&gt;<i> information of the author. And then you can see the different color for the
</I>&gt;<i> different authors. I wish we had something like that for Vilfredo.
</I>
You could, if:

   i) the technology was open, and

  ii) you could negotiate interfaces with the developers.

If moreover the negotiation process (ii) was itself open, then the sum
of your efforts would feed into:

 iii) the open e-democracy architecture (or ecosystem).

By contrast, Votorola could interface with MixedInk even today, if
only the developers had provided a simple URL for each proposal.  That
would be cool eh?  Imagine Votorola taking over MixedInk's servers!
(Vilfredo could play that trick too, if you could loosen up your
definition of integration, and adopt the &quot;small tools&quot; philososphy of
Unix.)

On another note, it's been quiet in the NCDD list since MixedInk took
over phase III.  For possible reasons, see the thread &quot;Phase III
Extended: Open Government Update&quot; in these weeks:

  <A HREF="http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A1=ind0906D&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION">http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A1=ind0906D&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION</A>

  <A HREF="http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A1=ind0906E&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION">http://lists.thataway.org/scripts/wa-THATAWAY.exe?A1=ind0906E&amp;L=NCDD-DISCUSSION</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; (All my own proposals have been rejected by the other Vilfredo users,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  and have disappeared from view.  But I still think they're good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  proposals.  What should I do?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the proposal you have written have been rejected,
</I>&gt;<i> but at least one of the proposal you have endorsed is always included in a
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto Front.
</I>&gt;<i> (please re read the last phrase, that is half of the core of Vilfredo. If
</I>&gt;<i> you get this you get the selection process)
</I>&gt;<i> In other words:
</I>&gt;<i> By definition the Pareto Front ALWAYS include a proposal that have been
</I>&gt;<i> endorsed by each user.
</I>&gt;<i> I even think (but I am not mathematically sure, yet), that a Pareto Front is
</I>&gt;<i> the smallest set that satisfy this requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are so attached to your own proposal, then you just need to endorse
</I>&gt;<i> only your own proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> If everybody does this, the pareto front becomes the whole set of proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> And society unexistant :).
</I>
OK, I understand.  If you think your proposal is a good one, then you
should vote for it.
 
&gt;<i> Somehow the system works on the assumption that although everybody writes,
</I>&gt;<i> and everybody endorses, people are not so attached to their own proposal in
</I>&gt;<i> advance. In other words, it is ok, and accepted to vote for your own
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, if you genuinely think they are better. But it is bad manners to
</I>&gt;<i> do it, just to remain in the pareto front. We had some cases in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> Now the history clearly shows who writes what, and whoe endorses what, and
</I>&gt;<i> it is pretty easy to spot this kind of behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What is the suggested action against this behaviour?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> nothing. Keep on doing your thing. Keep on endorsing only what you agree
</I>&gt;<i> with.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually the whole system will still generate its own best proposal. And
</I>&gt;<i> the grandious kid (sorry, no better way to define such behaviour), will
</I>&gt;<i> remain with its own unedited proposals, only endorse by himself.
</I>
Sad fate!  I hope the story has a happier ending for our hero. ;)
