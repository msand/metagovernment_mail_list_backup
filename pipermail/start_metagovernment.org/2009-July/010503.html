<PRE>One comment I recently learned in the exercise of developing a mission  
statement: imagine you are in an elevator with someone. You both get  
on on the first floor, and they ask what your project does. You have  
until you get off to explain it to them. This is referred to as the  
&quot;elevator pitch.&quot; The point is that you have to be extremely brief and  
also extremely clear. So that said, try to limit your phrases to  
something you could say to someone in one sentence and have them  
immediately understand you. The more complexity to the sentence, the  
more likely you are to lose them.

That said... integrating all of the responses so far, I am seeing this:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to foster the study,  
development, and use of open source software which allows the members  
any community to govern themselves.&quot;

I'm still not liking the nuance of the last section, starting with  
&quot;which allows...&quot; I think there should be a clearer way to say this  
and still have it be very concise.
