<PRE>&quot;in facebook there is not security that the person you are speaking with is
really the person you think he is.&quot;

but it's pretty darn close.  closer than any widely adopted system has come
so far.  my approach in nationbuilder has been to integrate with facebook.
people don't even have to create a new account to use the site AND they are
about 100x more likely to use their real name than if they didn't use their
facebook account, so it's a double win from my perspective.

i realize it's not perfect, but i've seen a ton of online voting systems get
bogged down in this problem of verifying a voter over the years, but i think
it will ultimately get solved, so i've avoided the problem entirely and
assumed someone will figure it out.  facebook has come the closest of
anyone.  of course, if something better comes along (like EUGAGER), i will
definitely support it too.  i know in the u.s. there is a very nascent
effort to provide login for civic applications based on the voter rolls.

&gt;<i> Thanks Giovani.

</I>&gt;<i> To add to the very good first post by Giovani, let me explain a bit more.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea was essentially to have a facebook style platform, on which a
</I>&gt;<i> number of applications could interact.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why would this be better than, say Facebook? Because in facebook there
</I>&gt;<i> is not security that the person you are speaking with is really the
</I>&gt;<i> person you think he is.
</I>&gt;<i> This is serious business, as if a government wants to aska question to
</I>&gt;<i> its citizen, it needs to be sure that the question is answered by the
</I>&gt;<i> right people. If this is not the case the government can always claim
</I>&gt;<i> that the answer does not have relevance, because they are not sure who
</I>&gt;<i> is on the other side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The toolbox would have tools to run a poll, but also to reach a a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus (Collaborative Proposal Tools). This would be done both with
</I>&gt;<i> syncronised voting (like the now called Vilfredo), or asyncronised
</I>&gt;<i> voting (like White house 2).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result might then go to the Poll system, and from there to a
</I>&gt;<i> suggest to the government. In other words the tools might speak to
</I>&gt;<i> each other. Without saying who voted for what, but saying other data
</I>&gt;<i> (like what are the ideas, and what percentage did those idea reached
</I>&gt;<i> in a partcular constituency domain).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tags would have been used to organise the material.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all this you can maybe understand the excitment of me and Giovani
</I>&gt;<i> when we kept on seeing other people coming up with similar ideas.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes here, sometimes in google wave, and from Tim OReilly Twitter
</I>&gt;<i> stream.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Giovani said, we are both available to answer questions :)

</I>&gt;<i> opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to re-submit it in another call, reworking the dissemination and

</I>&gt;<i> research
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and technical proposal were judged adequate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is the introduction. Me and Pietro are available for questions,
</I>&gt;<i> sharing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of information about the platform and how Metagovernment can benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The EUGAGER project consists of research, design and prototype
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementation of a web-based, open and secure toolbox for e-government
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-participation tools. The proposed system will consist of a core
</I>&gt;<i> (toolbox)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providing a basic set of secure primitives (an open Application Program
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interface) including those typically needed for the design of complex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-governance and e-participation web applications (tools). Moreover, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; toolbox will support external tools resting on the toolbox API.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The proposed system will enable project stakeholders (governments, SMEs,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-profit organizations and existing e-participation/e-government
</I>&gt;<i> free/open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source communities) to make the system evolve by creating new tools and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually constitute an ecosystem for citizens engagement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Citizen engagement will be greatly encouraged by EUGAGER. Indeed, it will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; provide: 1) advanced and usable tools for knowledge learning,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpretation, sharing and creation; 2) a flexible authentication
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensuring privacy; 3) trusted tools that allow citizens to verify that
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inputs are correctly taken into account in application results. On the
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hand, EUGAGER will be a powerful tool for governments: 1) powerful
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; filtering helps governors to meet citizens will; 2) certified secure API
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensures the toolbox against misuse and malicious attacks.
