<PRE>It sounds like we may be debating the distinction between a vision statement
versus a mission statement.

 

Here's how AIIM's StratML Committee has defined each of those elements:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Mission">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Mission</A> 

 

See also <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Value">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Value</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Goal">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Goal</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Objective">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Objective</A> 

 

Metagov's previous charter is available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml</A> (plain XML text) or
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml</A> (styled).  

 

It would be good to specify our objectives and stakeholders as well as our
mission, vision, values, and goal(s).

While it's good to be specific, this seems (to me) a little too specific
given that our aims are to be an organizer of organizations.

For example, if I were on an elevator, I would not likely say &quot;study,
development, and use of .. &quot; there's got to be a phrase that can encompass
all three (and, potentially more).

I'm laughing reading this because these words are like little earmarks : )
though I agree with Pietro's remarks.

Development in the larger sense (ie developing capabilities), rather than
specifically of software could easily cover these three.

I am thinking something along the lines of the following (in part, inspired
by Michael's mission, below): 

[Support|Promote] development of [software|tools|potential] for direct
democracy via the internet

Or, simply, Support initiatives promoting or enabling direct democracy


This brings up a few questions that may need discussion: 

1.	do we really want to focus on software development rather than
include algorithms / interface design / hardware-technology / ??? 
2.	is our mission to promote, coordinate, foster, ?? engage in
participate in the development of these things? I personally like &quot;support&quot;
because it encompasses all of these.
3.	do we want to limit the project to web-based initiatives? It would
certainly help clarify the 'elevator pitch'
At the same time, if there were a better way that didn't use the internet,
would we not include that since it's not via the internet?

Thoughts from the group?

We would then follow this by saying something like:

Specifically, :

*	work towards open standards and foster collaboration between
projects
*	brainstorm about implementation and methods
*	promote adoption of direct democracy by communities
*	participate in development of tools for direct democracy
*	engage existing open source communities with potential for
collaboration (read: mediawiki presentation)

One comment I recently learned in the exercise of developing a mission
statement: imagine you are in an elevator with someone. You both get on on
the first floor, and they ask what your project does. You have until you get
off to explain it to them. This is referred to as the &quot;elevator pitch.&quot; The
point is that you have to be extremely brief and also extremely clear. So
that said, try to limit your phrases to something you could say to someone
in one sentence and have them immediately understand you. The more
complexity to the sentence, the more likely you are to lose them.

That said... integrating all of the responses so far, I am seeing this:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to foster the study,
development, and use of open source software which allows the members any
community to govern themselves.&quot;

I'm still not liking the nuance of the last section, starting with &quot;which
allows...&quot; I think there should be a clearer way to say this and still have
it be very concise.

My own work is (to state it as a mission) to develop the tools of a
direct democracy.  While I don't suggest adopting that as your mission
statement, it's not incompatible with anything else that was put
forward.
