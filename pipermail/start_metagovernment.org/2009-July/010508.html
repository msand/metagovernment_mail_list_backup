So the mission itself could be stated as:

  To foster communication and collaboration among e-democracy
  projects.

Then the projects might have their own visions, their own missions.
By mutual communication and collaboration there might emerge a larger
mission that was shared by all.  But that would take time.

It's only fair to point out that it was Thomas's initiative that
brought me into the discussion.  The ideas I contributed early on were
mostly technical, regarding an open architecture for e-democracy.
None of them included the reorganization and refocus of Metagov as a
metaproject.  That was your own idea Ed, your own proposal.

Thomas von der Elbe wrote, on June 12:

&gt;<i> I think it would be best if all projects found this group together.
</I>&gt;<i> That we inform them of our idea and formally invite them to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the founding.
</I>
I personally support Ed's proposal, and I think it's a great
opportunity.  But I will wait for Thomas to return.  He is the best
spokesman for Votorola, when it comes to non-technical issues.

Hoping for the best,
