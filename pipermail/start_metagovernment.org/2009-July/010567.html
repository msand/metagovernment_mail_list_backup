It goes without saying that we think it will be more effective. However 
it is possible that the human race is not capable of fully governing 
themselves once the community scales beyond a couple of hundred people 
(the size of the villages we evolved in). It may well be less effective.

It would be good to also mention that it our goal for it to be scalable 
to the point where it can govern a country.
