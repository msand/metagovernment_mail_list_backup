That raises the question of what is &quot;valid.&quot; It seems likely to be  
open to interpretation, and that sounds like the imposition of an  
arbitrary authority on a community. I have no doubt that many projects  
will look for some sort of validity standards, but I wouldn't bet that  
all would.

At least in my mind, Metascore does not have any imposed validity  
standard... the idea being that anyone who cares enough to take part  
in a discussion must ipso facto have a valid stake in that discussion.  
(An understood result of this is that, for example, an American  
environmentalist may have a stake in China's Three Gorges project. And  
also that a Chinese factory worker may have a stake in American  
regulations on Walmart.)

&gt;<i> 2)      I thought one of the goals was to seek the ability to share

</I>
Good point. I have just added a sentence to that effect, though it  
could probably use further editing or expansion.
