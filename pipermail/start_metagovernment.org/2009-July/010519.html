Hi Ed,
although this is not coded at the moment in Vilfredo, I have already
worked out the mathemathics for it, and I can assure you that the
Pareto front would work equally well with a 0/1 as with a 1-5,  as
with a 1-100 or any other n dimensional valuation Even a continuous
one (think a sliding bar). Provided that everybody evaluates
everything along the same dimensions. I am already planning to permit
to the person that raises the question to define how would people be
allowed to vote.

But all this is not the same thing as commenting. Commenting by its
own very nature defies dimensions because if you already know what are
the dimensions among which you are going to have a feedback, you
mater-of-fact already have considered those comments.

This is why commenting and voting are different actions. And should be
treated separately.



&gt;<i> Then that still leaves the question of what to do with the scores. You can't
</I>&gt;<i> just take the average, since 100 scores of 1 would count more than 10 scores
</I>&gt;<i> of 5, and that doesn't seem right. But from there, I assume your knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> of Mathematics should take over... e.g., shouldn't standard deviations help?
</I>

If you do any of this, you are back at square one.
You need to take the pareto front of them.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there is also the option of making Vilfredo modular such that it
</I>&gt;<i> can be a component of other systems... in other words, it could be a
</I>&gt;<i> focusing tool which then hands off its results to Metascore...
</I>
As the webdeveloper of Vilfredo I can tell you:
You surely can do that,
you can set up questions from the outside, and then once you reach an
answer use it somwhere else.

As the scientist who is coming out with the algorithm behind it:
You can of course re use this algorithm (I put no patent on it :) ),
inside any system you want. Only there should be an acknowledgment
(bibliographic reference)  in the descritpion of it.

As a member of metagovernment I will instead say:
Before starting to see how VIlfredo can be used as part of something
bigger I would like people to explore what can Vilfredo do by itself.

To really test Vilfredo I need 10 people, committed to run an
experiment for 10 generations on a topic they truly care about.

Cheers,
Pietro
