<PRE>Hello,
sorry, I was late to this really important discussion.
I am still using most of my free time coding for Vil.
(BTW, thanks Ed for all the mentions in your talk, I was also really
interested to discover what are the programmer of Vilfredo working on.
;-) ).

Now speaking about mixedink.
I just saw the presentation in:
<A HREF="http://www.vimeo.com/2674991">http://www.vimeo.com/2674991</A>

I was really impressed, so I went to get ALL the messages in this list
about it.
And I think you guys have been really really unfair. I mean, what they
built is a really cool system.
Yes it's proprietary, yes that sucks, but look at how well does it work.
Making an open version later should not be such a big deal later on.
Think microsoft word vs open office.

Of course instead than normal voting, I would like to have pareto
front of the proposal to appear, but this is irrelevant, it can be
added later, or at any stage.

Yes, there is no karma.

But this is I would say the first serious shot.

I think we should ALL use it a lot to learn it strong points, its weak
points, and see how should we proceed. The world has changed again.
They changed it, and we need to learn the new world, before going
forward.

Taking my own suggestion I will now test the system, keep on hacking
vil, and then I'll get back to you.


Cheers,
Pietro
