<PRE>Ed, regarding the question of the validity of interest, due to the
complexities and complications involved, I agree that it probably would be
best not to try to address it at this stage.  However, at some points I
believe it will become important if voting/decision-making software is to be
taken seriously.  

 

On one side of the equation, for example, so-called &quot;externalities&quot; are
commonly ignored in decision-making processes, to the detriment of many
folks who do indeed have valid, albeit unacknowledged or at least
unrepresented interests.  On the other hand, it seems like those who are
contributing ought to have more to say about what is done than those who are
free-riding.   See <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem</A> 

 

With respect to the latter, James Surorwiecki notes: &quot;... public goods games
are played in a similar fashion throughout the developed world ... By the
end, 70 to 80 percent of the players are free riding, and the group as a
whole is much poorer than it would otherwise be.&quot;
<A HREF="http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf">http://ambur.net/crowdwisdom.pdf</A>  It would be a shame to &quot;pave the cow path&quot;
by giving free-riders even more power to control outcomes than they
currently have in existing election systems.

 

With respect to the former, although the StratML standard will not dictate a
means of providing feedback or method of ascribing weight to it, enabling
stakeholders to comment more efficiently and effectively on strategic goals
and objectives is among the purposes of the proposed standard.  Hopefully,
doing so will help to make &quot;externalities&quot; more salient and, thus, harder
for decision-makers to ignore.  

 

As previously stated, the reason I joined the Metagov listserv was to
explore prospects that Metascore might be used to facilitate feedback from
stakeholders on strategic goals and objectives rendered in StratML format.
(The latest version of the StratML schema includes an &lt;Identifier&gt; element
and the standard indicates that using GUIDs is a good practice, to enable
explicit referencing of goal and objective statements regardless of where
they may reside at any point in time on the Web and/or any changes that may
occur to other elements of a plan.) 

 

BTW, I converted the latest draft of Metagov's mission statement to StratML
format at  <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Metagov">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Metagov</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MP.xml</A>  The three goals I have inferred from the text
are: Ideas, Learning, and Standardization.  It will be interesting to see
what, more specific objectives may be identified under each of those goals
and, in turn, what outputs are produced by the group and what outcomes may
result.  (Since we don't yet have authoring/editing forms that have
implemented the latest version of the StratML schema, the &lt;Identifier&gt;
elements are not included.  However, Art Colman has transformed the
documents previously in the collection to conform to the latest version of
the schema.  They do contain the &lt;Identifier&gt; element are available at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults</A> or, more specifically,

1)      With reference to the vision statement -- &quot;. a world where every
person, without exception, is able to substantively participate in any
governance structure in which they have an interest&quot; - I wonder if it might
not be appropriate to insert the word &quot;valid&quot; before &quot;interest&quot; (i.e., &quot;a
valid interest&quot;).  However, that may raise needless complications at this
point.

 

That raises the question of what is &quot;valid.&quot; It seems likely to be open to
interpretation, and that sounds like the imposition of an arbitrary
authority on a community. I have no doubt that many projects will look for
some sort of validity standards, but I wouldn't bet that all would.

 

At least in my mind, Metascore does not have any imposed validity
standard... the idea being that anyone who cares enough to take part in a
discussion must ipso facto have a valid stake in that discussion. (An
understood result of this is that, for example, an American environmentalist
may have a stake in China's Three Gorges project. And also that a Chinese
factory worker may have a stake in American regulations on Walmart.)





2)      I thought one of the goals was to seek the ability to share a core
set of information across the various projects.

Is that not the case?

 

Good point. I have just added a sentence to that effect, though it could
probably use further editing or expansion.
