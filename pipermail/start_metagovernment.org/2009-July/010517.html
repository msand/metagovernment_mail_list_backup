I don't mind.  Thanks for letting me know.  I should say that after
re-reading my original post, I'd say I over-stated the issue at least
to some degree.  Its fair for them (MixedInk) to need the ability to
publish (even re-publish)  content submitted to their site, and in
general their values (as can minimally be determined by the AboutUs
page) appear genuinely for the benefit of society.

Really my main gripe was having to wade through a rather annoying
Terms of Service *from a private company* in order to participate in
my government.

Best of luck,

marcos
