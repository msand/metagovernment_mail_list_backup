<PRE>Just to make everybody aware that I have activated a sort of
&quot;automatic move on&quot;, which should automatic move on a question under
the right conditions.
This was something that has been asked again and again.

The right conditions are:
1 week must have passed from the first proposal or endorsment (new
questions can change how much is this time, from 1 hour to 31 days)

a minimum of 2 people must have endorsed (if in the endorsement phase)
a minimum of 2 proposals must be present to vote on
at least 1 new proposal must have been written.

Since some questions are so old that the endorsements and the
proposals did not carry the time stamp of when they were done, if a
question has some proposal/endorsement and no time stamp, I instead
use the &quot;time from the last move on&quot;.

I set up the system so that it SHOULD move on 1 question max every 3
hours. Eventually it should move them all, but now we are testing.

In any case all this means that there will be questions that you
haveposed that will start to have a life of their own, and
automatically move on.

But they will always love you :)


Cheers,
Pietro
