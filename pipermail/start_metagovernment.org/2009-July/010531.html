<PRE>Hi Michael,
please see my comments inline.

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  1. Brainstorming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  2. Discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;  3. Voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all I would like to ask you where do you put Vilfredo right now?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let's not speak about the version with the comments, let us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concentrate on the version we have right now. Because you seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; envisioning to use it in conjunction with other tools. So would this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be a brainstorming tool, a discussion tool or a voting tool?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you think carefully on it you will realise that Vilfredo, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now, defies this division.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess you're right.  I was classifying it as a simple brainstorming
</I>&gt;<i> tool, but it's actually a combination of things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In your question:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You use it to start brainstorm something:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;What's a better name than Metagovernment?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is none of my business, but others have raised the question in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the list. So here it is for brainstorming. Can you improve on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (By the way, the question has now 7 suggestions from 4 people. But no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one is allowed to vote on it until You move it on. As the web designer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Vilfredo I am really curious, why have you not moved it on? Did you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forgot about it? Have you not realised that the system required your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; action at this point? Were you waiting for more input? Or were you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just uninterested about this topic? I am really asking, as your answer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might help me to design better the system)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I forgot.  When I signed up for email updates, I didn't get an
</I>&gt;<i> initial message (&quot;Updates are turned on!&quot;) so I couldn't punch a hole
</I>&gt;<i> in my spam filter.  I just fished the messages out now.  OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Feedback received:
When a user inserts an email address, it should send immediately an email,
so the user can make sure that it does not get trapped in the SPAM


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You say there are 7 suggestions, but I can't see them.  It looks like
</I>&gt;<i> my suggestion is the only one.  At first glance, I see no point in
</I>&gt;<i> going to the next phase.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now I see that it says &quot;Number of authors of new proposals: 4&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> So I guess nobody can see the proposals until I press &quot;Move on&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm curious to see them...  Last call folks!  What's a better name
</I>&gt;<i> than Metagovernment?  :)
</I>

Yes, on the central page, if you skim over a question, you get a small
windows that opens up, and tells you how many answers are there.  You are
right, I should add that info on Vilfredo in the question page.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you use it in your question &quot;for brainstorming&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But then in your mail you write:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Brainstormers are supposed to be non-judgemental.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And even more you say that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My ideas on brainstorming are traditional.  I'm not a non-expert.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Ground_Rules">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Ground_Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas
</I>&gt;<i>     generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should
</I>&gt;<i>     focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a
</I>&gt;<i>     later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment,
</I>&gt;<i>     participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're an experimenter, so you can ignore that rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So you must see Vilfredo as a sub-optimal brainstorming device.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After all we vote on each other idea.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If this is the case I can see why you rebelled over the fact of me
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adding the comment.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not only I builded something which was half way between a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brainstorming tool and a voting tool.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But now I also wanted to add the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is my analysis correct?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's more than I deserve.  And just because you propose a combination
</I>&gt;<i> of multiple functions in a single facility, that doesn't necessarily
</I>&gt;<i> mean that the architecture is closed.  You can still do it in an open
</I>&gt;<i> fashion, if you wish.  So my critique was premature at best.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And now let me enter more in my defence.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and voting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am a mathematician. I recognise things as being &quot;known&quot; only if they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have been proved mathematically. If not they are &quot;believed&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;assumed&quot;, or &quot;supposed&quot;. And if I believed I could not improve on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; current state of knowledge, I would not be in the field of academic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research. All this to say that the fact that we &quot;believe&quot; something is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the only solution will not stop me from trying something else.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And something else I am trying, because Vilfredo is neither a pure
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; brainstorming device, nor a pure voting device, nor a pure discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; device (of which, I admit, have little so far). Mine over here is not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually that a revolutionary idea, I am just building a genetic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; algorithm, only using human beings to generate the mutations and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluations. Recently I discovere that there are already a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; papers on similar devices. Funny enough, one is just from one of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collegues at the university, from a few years back. (google: Human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Based Genetic Algorithm, HBGA, I think). So this to give a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; justification on the fact that this approach does effectively work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's interesting.  Votorola is designed to interface with
</I>&gt;<i> recombinant text, and recombinant text has a close relation to
</I>&gt;<i> human-based evolutionary (and genetic) algorithms:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields">http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You know, one of the complex things that are missing in Vilfredo is a tool
that let you integrate the answers.

In this regard what they have done at MixedInk is very good. As not only it
brings up the text you might be interested, but if you add it, it keeps the
information of the author. And then you can see the different color for the
different authors. I wish we had something like that for Vilfredo.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And since I am using a Pareto Front, we can call this approach a PFHBGA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will avoid, for now, proving that the PFHBGA is better, in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quality of the solutions, and speed in reaching theose , than keeping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the three tools separated because I think it is too early. Qualitative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comparison can only be made among estabilished practices. There is too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; much optimisation to be done, at this stage.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I will claim that the PFHBGA is ethically better. I will claim an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ethical superiority in the fact that when we keep the three tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separated it is very common that the most smart, intelligent, or just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connected people dominate the discussions. And then impose, and define
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the terms on which the others vote. And whoever defines what are the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting possibilities is effectively in a position to decide the result
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the voting itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It depends on the voting mechanism.  For an example of a mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> that interfaces with separate tools, and cannot be dominated by
</I>&gt;<i> elites, see of course:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks, I will read it, in the next days.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This, on the other side, does not happen on a PFHBGA (I swear, I like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more Vil). No one is in charge of defining the voting options. And the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intelligence and creativity only help you so far, since anybody can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; copy your proposal, modify it to suit their needs, and then repropose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (All my own proposals have been rejected by the other Vilfredo users,
</I>&gt;<i>  and have disappeared from view.  But I still think they're good
</I>&gt;<i>  proposals.  What should I do?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Maybe the proposal you have written have been rejected,
but at least one of the proposal you have endorsed is always included in a
Pareto Front.
(please re read the last phrase, that is half of the core of Vilfredo. If
you get this you get the selection process)
In other words:
By definition the Pareto Front ALWAYS include a proposal that have been
endorsed by each user.
I even think (but I am not mathematically sure, yet), that a Pareto Front is
the smallest set that satisfy this requirement.

If you are so attached to your own proposal, then you just need to endorse
only your own proposals.
If everybody does this, the pareto front becomes the whole set of proposals.
And society unexistant :).

Somehow the system works on the assumption that although everybody writes,
and everybody endorses, people are not so attached to their own proposal in
advance. In other words, it is ok, and accepted to vote for your own
proposals, if you genuinely think they are better. But it is bad manners to
do it, just to remain in the pareto front. We had some cases in the past.
Now the history clearly shows who writes what, and whoe endorses what, and
it is pretty easy to spot this kind of behaviour.

What is the suggested action against this behaviour?

nothing. Keep on doing your thing. Keep on endorsing only what you agree
with.

Eventually the whole system will still generate its own best proposal. And
the grandious kid (sorry, no better way to define such behaviour), will
remain with its own unedited proposals, only endorse by himself.

Maybe at the end of the whole process, when all have stabilised, the number
of people that propose things can be said, and maybe even a small filter on
proposals written  by a single user, and endorsed only by that user. But at
the end. It should not be added before, or...

the brainstorm would not be neutral
:<i>)
</I>


The situation of course is more complex, but let's leave it as that for now
;-)



&gt;<i> &gt; Of course it is possible, and I agree that we should, use different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tools. But what I am trying to build is a system that permits to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community to govern itself. Although I am a classical example of a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; member of the creative class, I don't want a system that puts the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creative people in charge. I want a system where NO ONE is in charge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where ideas grow, but no one is adored and placed on a pedestal, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; given unbalanced power (or just more power), for having had some good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ideas in its life.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I share your vision.  We should put the elites to work for us.  At the
</I>&gt;<i> same time, we should not allow them to dominate us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
