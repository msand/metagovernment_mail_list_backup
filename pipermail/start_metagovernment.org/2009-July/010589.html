<PRE>This could be important, please read it in full.

At the end there will be a link to youtube to a video in english. But you
should read the rest to understand why this link is IMPORTANT.

There is in Italy a comedian very well known. His name is Beppe Grillo. His
blog (www.beppegrillo.it)  is among the top 200 in the world (pos 126:
<A HREF="http://technorati.com/blogs/beppegrillo.it?reactions">http://technorati.com/blogs/beppegrillo.it?reactions</A> ). And the first in
italy.

In Italy he is rapidly becoming a strong political voice. Some people hate
him, some people love him. No one is neutral, and what is more no one can
ignore him.

He speaks pretty much only about italian politics (his posts are translated
in english and in japanese).

In the last days he became quite important as he proposed himself to be
elected for the position of head of the PD, the biggest center-left party.
The biggest party which SHOULD oppose berlusconi, and in fact is not doing
it. Which is why he is saying that he wants to be elected, and kick in the
ass 1000 people among the old top managers in the PD. They are declaring him
as being someone not of the PD, and someone who is not allowed to join the
PD because he was too critic about the PD (speak about politicians wanting
to keep the status quo).


I wrote about Beppe Grill in the past, not only here, but also on my blog.
There I explained why his blog was not so cool technically, and what should
be done to let the people really interact (vote the comments, comments in a
tree structure, etc... ). I never received any answer, but eventually his
blog introduced the suggestions I made.

This is half good. But let's move on...

Now here there was a very interesting article. It is from one of the many
newspapers from Berlusconi:
<A HREF="http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=367587&amp;START=0&amp;2col=">http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=367587&amp;START=0&amp;2col=</A>


In this Beppe Grillo is being attached for having a &quot;secred&quot; plan. What is
his secret plan?
Dictatorship of the democracy.
It takes a bit to get our head around this concept. And it gives an idea of
how convoluted italian politics can be.

Now let us move on a second, and we find that there is another italian
politician. With a very similar plan. His name is Antonio DI Pietro. He is
an ex policeman. One of the ones that exposed the money scandals in italy in
1994. He is considered a very strict policemen, but a bit of a dumb
politician. But very honest. He is also a big fun of the net. And in the
past he has changed his attituude after the comments on his blog &quot;convinced&quot;
him that he was wrong.

Both people have popular blogs with hundreds or thousands of comments each
day.
And they are both produced by the same firm.

Yes, there is a firm behind this:
Casaleggio Associati.
<A HREF="http://www.casaleggio.it">http://www.casaleggio.it</A>

And in a video (in ENGLISH!) on their site they explain how they see the
future of politics:
<A HREF="http://www.casaleggio.it/thefutureofpolitics/">http://www.casaleggio.it/thefutureofpolitics/</A>


I invite you all to see the 7 minutes video.

We should contact them as soon as possible.

So we have here someone who is going toward the same aim, but instead of
developing the technical part has been developing the political consensus.

Through Beppe they have helped move more than 2 million people.

There are people in many italian political places brought there through
Beppe who only aim there is to record what is going on!

I am looking from you all for suggestions on how to interact with them.

Regards,
Pietro
