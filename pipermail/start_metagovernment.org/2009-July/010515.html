<PRE>Thanks Giovani.

To add to the very good first post by Giovani, let me explain a bit more.

The idea was essentially to have a facebook style platform, on which a
number of applications could interact.

Why would this be better than, say Facebook? Because in facebook there
is not security that the person you are speaking with is really the
person you think he is.
This is serious business, as if a government wants to aska question to
its citizen, it needs to be sure that the question is answered by the
right people. If this is not the case the government can always claim
that the answer does not have relevance, because they are not sure who
is on the other side.

The toolbox would have tools to run a poll, but also to reach a a
consensus (Collaborative Proposal Tools). This would be done both with
syncronised voting (like the now called Vilfredo), or asyncronised
voting (like White house 2).

The result might then go to the Poll system, and from there to a
suggest to the government. In other words the tools might speak to
each other. Without saying who voted for what, but saying other data
(like what are the ideas, and what percentage did those idea reached
in a partcular constituency domain).

Tags would have been used to organise the material.

In all this you can maybe understand the excitment of me and Giovani
when we kept on seeing other people coming up with similar ideas.
Sometimes here, sometimes in google wave, and from Tim OReilly Twitter stream.

As Giovani said, we are both available to answer questions :)

cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> The EUGAGER project consists of research, design and prototype
</I>&gt;<i> implementation of a web-based, open and secure toolbox for e-government and
</I>&gt;<i> e-participation tools. The proposed system will consist of a core (toolbox)
</I>&gt;<i> providing a basic set of secure primitives (an open Application Program
</I>&gt;<i> Interface) including those typically needed for the design of complex
</I>&gt;<i> e-governance and e-participation web applications (tools). Moreover, the
</I>&gt;<i> toolbox will support external tools resting on the toolbox API.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposed system will enable project stakeholders (governments, SMEs,
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit organizations and existing e-participation/e-government free/open
</I>&gt;<i> source communities) to make the system evolve by creating new tools and
</I>&gt;<i> eventually constitute an ecosystem for citizens engagement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Citizen engagement will be greatly encouraged by EUGAGER. Indeed, it will
</I>&gt;<i> provide: 1) advanced and usable tools for knowledge learning,
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation, sharing and creation; 2) a flexible authentication mechanism
</I>&gt;<i> ensuring privacy; 3) trusted tools that allow citizens to verify that their
</I>&gt;<i> inputs are correctly taken into account in application results. On the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, EUGAGER will be a powerful tool for governments: 1) powerful knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> filtering helps governors to meet citizens will; 2) certified secure API
</I>&gt;<i> ensures the toolbox against misuse and malicious attacks.
