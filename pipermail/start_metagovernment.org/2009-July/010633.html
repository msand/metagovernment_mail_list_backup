This is an interesting argument since the metagovernment project seems to,
in general, support 'open source democracy' -- a common criticism of which
is the potential for moment-to-moment changes in fundamental policies and/or
legislation.

Mark's concern that restricting edits leads to &quot;a sort of mediocre,
apathetic complacency&quot; ... is perhaps justified and (i believe) happening
now.

I propose that we try to find a compromise -- synthesis ;) -- to allow for
ungettered growth of the wiki without putting our principles or our
integrity at risk ;)

Also, this will only become a bigger problem as the wiki (hopefully) grows
in size.

I have created a page on the wiki for this question:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Edit_policy">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Edit_policy</A>

Thoughts from the group?

&gt;<i> Hi, Mark.

</I>&gt;<i> I welcome your participation and also your dissent over the edit policy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The justification for the edit policy on the Main Page is that it is
</I>&gt;<i> extremely public-facing. People who visit our project often only view the
</I>&gt;<i> main page, and the impression they get from there may be all they get. If it
</I>&gt;<i> is off-kilter for half a day, that's a bunch of people that see something
</I>&gt;<i> which does not represent the project. I know it doesn't seem like the wiki
</I>&gt;<i> way to have something be somewhat restricted, but consider that Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;<i> Main Page is not even editable at all. The use of an alternate page as
</I>&gt;<i> Mat&#237;as linked it a viable workaround that allows people to work on an
</I>&gt;<i> improvement without losing the current version which is known to have
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for the Basic Principles... it just seems reasonable that our
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental principles should not be particularly malleable, otherwise we
</I>&gt;<i> lose our integrity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said... note that the pages in question are not protected by other
</I>&gt;<i> than policy. Only the Copyright page is protected against editing, because
</I>&gt;<i> it wouldn't be nice for someone to suddenly change the legal statement about
</I>&gt;<i> the availability of the content. If you really think a page needs to be
</I>&gt;<i> changed, you are still free to do so. For example, people have fixed typos
</I>&gt;<i> and made other small edits from time to time. The main objection I have is
</I>&gt;<i> about changing the tone or general idea of the Main Page without using the
</I>&gt;<i> established suggested-page method.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any event... welcome to the group. It looks like you've been keeping
</I>&gt;<i> quite busy on the wiki. :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  There's a bunch of other stuff I'd like to dialog about, but will hold
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> off for now and let the conversation continue via wiki edits....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that while we do engage in dialog through the wiki, this list server
</I>&gt;<i> is often the more active method. For more complicated conversations, it is
</I>&gt;<i> often helpful to hash them out in this venue, then to codify and refine them
</I>&gt;<i> in the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. The UCSC trust mechanism sounds fantastic. Do you have a link? I am
</I>&gt;<i> traveling today so don't know when I'll be able to look at it, but it
</I>&gt;<i> certainly sounds worth considering.
