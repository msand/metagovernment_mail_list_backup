OK.  Those eligibility rules can be imposed after the fact.  So anyone
can vote up front, but each individual who later views the results can
decide for herself who the real stakeholders are, and can filter the
results accordingly.  This is natural, and will be possible
(eventually).

&gt;<i> The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires U.S. federal
</I>&gt;<i> agencies &quot;When developing a strategic plan [to] solicit and consider the
</I>&gt;<i> views and suggestions of those entities [stakeholders] potentially affected

</I>&gt;<i> One way or another, they all do so.  However, in my view, they do so poorly,
</I>&gt;<i> and regardless of how well they may do it, there is always room for
</I>&gt;<i> improvement ... which is how I hope MetaScore and similar software services
</I>&gt;<i> can add value.
</I>
Yes, that's reasonable.  Plus add the shifting of initiative to the
stakeholders.  No government approval is required in order to express
opinions.  Feedback can therefore become feed-forward, to which the
government is then expected to respond.  So the tables are turned, and
the stakeholders drive compliance.

Identify if you can the formal stakes (be they corporate shares,
employer/employee contracts, producer/consumer exchanges, and so
forth) and show how a consensus expressed in StratML can be channeled
hence into action.  If the channel is not convincing, then the
quantity + quality of participation will be too low.

In political applications, for example, the formal stakes are
electoral rights.  They channel into action every 4 years or so.  A
pre-election consensus of the public is like a primary election
victory in that it channels voting behaviour on the day of the general
election.  But it is more general than a party primary, and therefore
dictates the general result.  This alone is sufficient to ensure
compliance (eventually) with any public consensus, whether electoral
or normative.

&gt;<i> When AIIM announces approval of the StratML standard (hopefully in a couple
</I>&gt;<i> months), it would be neat if Metagov could issue a statement announcing the
</I>&gt;<i> availability of and pointing to software and services enabling citizens more
</I>&gt;<i> easily, effectively, and &quot;directly&quot; provide feedback in the GPRA
</I>&gt;<i> consultation process.
</I>
The technology will be experimental for one or two years (at best).  I
can demo this with Votorola now, voting on XML formats, but Votorola
is only at alpha.  There's one or two other projects (none open) that
claim to be beta, but I doubt they can do StratML.  They can only do
short textual snippets.  (I even doubt they're at beta.  I think
they're more likely back at the drawing board - pre-alpha.)

If you vote up the textual pieces separately, they must be logically
independent, or the combined result may be incoherent and
in-actionable.  Better to vote up the whole thing (what you see is
what you get).  People are wary of being tricked and having their
words twisted and misinterpreted in false mandates.

&gt;<i> P.S. It would also be good if the expectation could be established that all
</I>&gt;<i> candidates for elective office will document their &quot;platforms&quot; in StratML
</I>&gt;<i> format on their political action committee Web sites, so that interested
</I>&gt;<i> folks can vote directly on individual objectives rather than being forced to
</I>&gt;<i> vote only on the candidate him or herself.  Moreover, in the longer-term,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than merely using our votes to project our responsibilities onto
</I>&gt;<i> someone else, it would be good to redirect the focus toward achieving our
</I>&gt;<i> common objective using the resources and efforts that we ourselves are
</I>&gt;<i> willing and able to bring to bear, in partnership with those who share our
</I>&gt;<i> objectives.
</I>
I agree.  It is better to vote up policies and other norms separate
from the executives.  The best candidates will prefer to run on their
ability to execute, rather than any platform of specific and
contentious issues.  So they will follow the public's lead wherever it
is clearly expressed as a platform of preference, and otherwise they
will avoid taking sides.  People will say &quot;do this&quot;, and elected
officials will do it.  I think we can predict that for politics.  So
maybe elsewhere too.
