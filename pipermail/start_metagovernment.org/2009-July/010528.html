<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> &gt;  1. Brainstorming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  2. Discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  3. Voting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I would like to ask you where do you put Vilfredo right now?
</I>&gt;<i> Let's not speak about the version with the comments, let us
</I>&gt;<i> concentrate on the version we have right now. Because you seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> envisioning to use it in conjunction with other tools. So would this
</I>&gt;<i> be a brainstorming tool, a discussion tool or a voting tool?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you think carefully on it you will realise that Vilfredo, as it is
</I>&gt;<i> right now, defies this division.
</I>
I guess you're right.  I was classifying it as a simple brainstorming
tool, but it's actually a combination of things.

&gt;<i> In your question:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43</A>
</I>&gt;<i> You use it to start brainstorm something:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What's a better name than Metagovernment?
</I>&gt;<i> This is none of my business, but others have raised the question in
</I>&gt;<i> the list. So here it is for brainstorming. Can you improve on the
</I>&gt;<i> name?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (By the way, the question has now 7 suggestions from 4 people. But no
</I>&gt;<i> one is allowed to vote on it until You move it on. As the web designer
</I>&gt;<i> of Vilfredo I am really curious, why have you not moved it on? Did you
</I>&gt;<i> forgot about it? Have you not realised that the system required your
</I>&gt;<i> action at this point? Were you waiting for more input? Or were you
</I>&gt;<i> just uninterested about this topic? I am really asking, as your answer
</I>&gt;<i> might help me to design better the system)
</I>
Yes, I forgot.  When I signed up for email updates, I didn't get an
initial message (&quot;Updates are turned on!&quot;) so I couldn't punch a hole
in my spam filter.  I just fished the messages out now.  OK.

You say there are 7 suggestions, but I can't see them.  It looks like
my suggestion is the only one.  At first glance, I see no point in
going to the next phase.

  <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43</A>

But now I see that it says &quot;Number of authors of new proposals: 4&quot;.
So I guess nobody can see the proposals until I press &quot;Move on&quot;?

I'm curious to see them...  Last call folks!  What's a better name
than Metagovernment?  :)

&gt;<i> So you use it in your question &quot;for brainstorming&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But then in your mail you write:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Brainstormers are supposed to be non-judgemental.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And even more you say that:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and voting.
</I>
My ideas on brainstorming are traditional.  I'm not a non-expert.

     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Ground_Rules">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming#Ground_Rules</A>

  2. Withhold criticism: In brainstorming, criticism of ideas
     generated should be put 'on hold'. Instead, participants should
     focus on extending or adding to ideas, reserving criticism for a
     later 'critical stage' of the process. By suspending judgment,
     participants will feel free to generate unusual ideas.

You're an experimenter, so you can ignore that rule.

&gt;<i> So you must see Vilfredo as a sub-optimal brainstorming device.
</I>&gt;<i> After all we vote on each other idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the case I can see why you rebelled over the fact of me
</I>&gt;<i> adding the comment.
</I>&gt;<i> Not only I builded something which was half way between a
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming tool and a voting tool.
</I>&gt;<i> But now I also wanted to add the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is my analysis correct?
</I>
It's more than I deserve.  And just because you propose a combination
of multiple functions in a single facility, that doesn't necessarily
mean that the architecture is closed.  You can still do it in an open
fashion, if you wish.  So my critique was premature at best.
 
&gt;<i> And now let me enter more in my defence.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am a mathematician. I recognise things as being &quot;known&quot; only if they
</I>&gt;<i> have been proved mathematically. If not they are &quot;believed&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;assumed&quot;, or &quot;supposed&quot;. And if I believed I could not improve on the
</I>&gt;<i> current state of knowledge, I would not be in the field of academic
</I>&gt;<i> research. All this to say that the fact that we &quot;believe&quot; something is
</I>&gt;<i> the only solution will not stop me from trying something else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And something else I am trying, because Vilfredo is neither a pure
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming device, nor a pure voting device, nor a pure discussion
</I>&gt;<i> device (of which, I admit, have little so far). Mine over here is not
</I>&gt;<i> actually that a revolutionary idea, I am just building a genetic
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm, only using human beings to generate the mutations and the
</I>&gt;<i> evaluations. Recently I discovere that there are already a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> papers on similar devices. Funny enough, one is just from one of my
</I>&gt;<i> collegues at the university, from a few years back. (google: Human
</I>&gt;<i> Based Genetic Algorithm, HBGA, I think). So this to give a
</I>&gt;<i> justification on the fact that this approach does effectively work.
</I>
That's interesting.  Votorola is designed to interface with
recombinant text, and recombinant text has a close relation to
human-based evolutionary (and genetic) algorithms:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields">http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Related-Fields</A>
 
&gt;<i> And since I am using a Pareto Front, we can call this approach a PFHBGA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will avoid, for now, proving that the PFHBGA is better, in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> quality of the solutions, and speed in reaching theose , than keeping
</I>&gt;<i> the three tools separated because I think it is too early. Qualitative
</I>&gt;<i> comparison can only be made among estabilished practices. There is too
</I>&gt;<i> much optimisation to be done, at this stage.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I will claim that the PFHBGA is ethically better. I will claim an
</I>&gt;<i> ethical superiority in the fact that when we keep the three tools
</I>&gt;<i> separated it is very common that the most smart, intelligent, or just
</I>&gt;<i> connected people dominate the discussions. And then impose, and define
</I>&gt;<i> the terms on which the others vote. And whoever defines what are the
</I>&gt;<i> voting possibilities is effectively in a position to decide the result
</I>&gt;<i> of the voting itself.
</I>
It depends on the voting mechanism.  For an example of a mechanism
that interfaces with separate tools, and cannot be dominated by
elites, see of course:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht</A>
 
&gt;<i> This, on the other side, does not happen on a PFHBGA (I swear, I like
</I>&gt;<i> more Vil). No one is in charge of defining the voting options. And the
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence and creativity only help you so far, since anybody can
</I>&gt;<i> copy your proposal, modify it to suit their needs, and then repropose
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
(All my own proposals have been rejected by the other Vilfredo users,
 and have disappeared from view.  But I still think they're good
 proposals.  What should I do?)

&gt;<i> Of course it is possible, and I agree that we should, use different
</I>&gt;<i> tools. But what I am trying to build is a system that permits to a
</I>&gt;<i> community to govern itself. Although I am a classical example of a
</I>&gt;<i> member of the creative class, I don't want a system that puts the
</I>&gt;<i> creative people in charge. I want a system where NO ONE is in charge.
</I>&gt;<i> Where ideas grow, but no one is adored and placed on a pedestal, and
</I>&gt;<i> given unbalanced power (or just more power), for having had some good
</I>&gt;<i> ideas in its life.
</I>
I share your vision.  We should put the elites to work for us.  At the
same time, we should not allow them to dominate us.

Best,
--
