<PRE>These are some great points, Jacki. I think you may have hit on a key  
phrase with &quot;development of tools for direct democracy.&quot; And I do  
think that the internet is an essential function of it, because it is  
the new mechanism which solves the most critical flaw of direct  
democracy: the inability of everyone to easily get together all the  
time.

The only thing I see lacking from your notes is the concept of &quot;any  
community.&quot; When people hear &quot;direct democracy&quot; they tend to  
immediately think of large governments.

So... how about something like this?

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to support the  
development of internet tools for direct democracy in any community.&quot;

It still sounds a little clunky to me, but I like the direction it is  
going.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Support|Promote] development of [software|tools|potential] for  
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy via the internet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or, simply, Support initiatives promoting or enabling direct democracy

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This brings up a few questions that may need discussion:
</I>&gt;<i> do we really want to focus on software development rather than  
</I>&gt;<i> include algorithms / interface design / hardware-technology / ???
</I>&gt;<i> is our mission to promote, coordinate, foster, ?? engage in   
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the development of these things? I personally like  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;support&quot; because it encompasses all of these.
</I>&gt;<i> do we want to limit the project to web-based initiatives? It would  
</I>&gt;<i> certainly help clarify the 'elevator pitch'
</I>&gt;<i> At the same time, if there were a better way that didn't use the  
</I>&gt;<i> internet, would we not include that since it's not via the internet?
</I>&gt;<i> Thoughts from the group?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would then follow this by saying something like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, :
</I>&gt;<i> work towards open standards and foster collaboration between projects
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorm about implementation and methods
</I>&gt;<i> promote adoption of direct democracy by communities
</I>&gt;<i> participate in development of tools for direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> engage existing open source communities with potential for  
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration (read: mediawiki presentation)
