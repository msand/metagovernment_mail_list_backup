<PRE>Hi Mark, hi All. I want to inform that the deadline for treating the  
organization of this project has passed, and &#8212;by fully consensus&#8212; it  
has been resolved to make of Metagovernment a meta-project. Deep  
restructuring of the wiki will happen in these days to come, while  
adapting it to the new mission and vision.
It's a really good time also for working in Marks's objections.

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2009-07</A> is the draft of  
the new Main Page.

I've been working on expanding the related projects list, because  
soon we will have to send invitations to them. If you know about  
projects that aren't in the list, please add them.

The following falls in &quot;other matters&quot; category: I think that we  
haven't been making good use of social networks for promoting ourselves.

Well, wait till they see the editor. That's the REAL barrier of every  
wiki.

Bye!
