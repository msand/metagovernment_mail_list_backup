<PRE>How should step 6 of the transition steps, the outreach to other 
projects take place?

I suggest to have an &quot;official&quot; invitation-letter, which could then 
ideally be attached to a personal notification.

We could then start a new Thread &quot;Invited Projects&quot; where each invited 
project gets added to a list, so we keep the overview.
Needless to say, that we invite only those projects, which meet the new 
Metagovernment mission and vision statement.

Here is a rough draft for an invitation-letter (please excuse my strange 
german english):


&quot;Dear members of Project xy,

we are the members of the 5(?) different e-dem-projects: a, b, c, d, and e.

We all came to consensus that for several reasons an intensified 
communication and collaboration among certain e-democracy projects 
around the world would be desirable.

The reasons we see for this are:

1. to profit from possible synergetic effects.

2. to avoid competition for users (voters) among us. Because this would 
unnecessarily slow down the e-democracy-movement as a whole. Therefore 
we think it would be desirable to define an &quot;open source governance 
standard&quot;, in order to enable the exchange of user-data between all of 
our projects.

3. we see the existence of multiple projects as the existence of 
different approaches to find the yet unknown solution to the 'creation 
of an open source governance system' for a healthier society. The mere 
competitive and/or cooperative interaction between projects with the 
same goal seems the best strategy for answering this problem. To let the 
interaction happen, we think about settling the projects in a common 
ground &#8212;the standard&#8212;, so they can communicate to each other.

4. ?
5. ?
...

We think a metaorganization would serve as a step towards this goal.

We would like to invite you and your project to join our group to found 
such a metaorganization.

Because Metagovernment has long been the platform for our communication 
already and was therefore on it&#180;s way to becoming the coordinating group 
for our 5 projects anyway and because it&#180;s software-developing-project 
Metascore is easy to detach, Metagovernment has offered it&#180;s name and 
it&#180;s wiki-pages for the founding of the new Metaorganization.


In hope for our working together,
With best regards, ....&quot;


What do you think?

Thomas
