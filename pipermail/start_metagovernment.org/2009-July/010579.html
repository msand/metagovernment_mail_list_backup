<PRE>I like the

&quot; ...(a project) to support the development of internet tools which enable
the members of any community to fully participate in the governance of that
community.&quot;

I am wondering if we shouldn't push a bit more the &quot;fully participate&quot; part.

When metagovernment started it was very clear that the idea was to generate
a system that could let the members govern themselves. Maybe it is splitting
a hair in four, but I think there is a difference between participating in
the governance of a community, and being the governing body of the
communtiy. I mean, many eGov project will have reached completion if the
average member participate in a representative democracy.

But the aim of metagov was broader, deeper. We wanted to substitute the
government, reaching a point where no person was in charge, but we all were.


&quot; ...(a project) to support the development of internet tools which enable
the members of any community to co-govern a community.&quot;

On the other hand this might push away some more mild projects.
Any co-thoughts?

------
On a second note, I like how this process is slowly building layers of
meaning in the phrase.

An old irish poem said:
&quot;saying much with few words...&quot;
------

On a third note, I started coding the time function in vilfredo. That is how
some questions can only be movedon only after some time, and will
automatically moveon after x time. And possible the questioner will be able
to set up those times.

For now no question can be movedon if 24 hours has not passed. It is a bit
of a problem to test this kind of service, as I would have to make test
cases, and then wait x time, and so on. So please give me a help. If you see
anything that does not work, just give me a shout. Maybe send me an email
with a pic of the screen. That will be really useful.

Regards,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Instead of approaching them as the new Metagovernment looking for new

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now in this small time-window both perspectives are possible. It is
</I>&gt;<i> only a slight difference, but I see it as important.
</I>&gt;<i> The first one gives them more freedom, more room for development. And all

</I>&gt;<i> we are the ones who choose, who to invite.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it could sound something like:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We would like to invite you to found together with us the new
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment project with the mission to support the development of
</I>&gt;<i> internet tools which enable the members of any community to fully

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some respects different philosophies, but we all share the use of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree with the idea that we shouldn't take this step too

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what we should be telling them we are asking them to join.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I really believe, that we can convince more projects to join us, if

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> potentially interested project further away from the co-founder-
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> status.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think, we should approach them right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Somehow like: &quot;We are now 5(?) e-dem-projects looking for better
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ways to cooperate with each other and would also like to cooperate
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> with you. We think the founding of a metaorganization is a step
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> towards this goal and we would like to invite you to join us. We
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> have no more precise Mission Statement yet, because for that your
