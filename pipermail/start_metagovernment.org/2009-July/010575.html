I agree that some verbiage that insinuates that it is worth the effort
to participate because this will be potentially so much more effective
that what any government has *ever* had even the *possibility* of
utilizing before.  A bottom-up method of organization to complement
the historical top-down institutions is *radically* new.  Think about
it, for the last 5000 years (probably since we began recording
things), humans have been building up bigger and bigger top-down (and
often coercive) power structures.  Each of our institions:  political,
religious, educational, economic is a top-down, parent-to-child kind
of power structure--largely because, up until the last century, the
*vast majority* of humans were illiterate and uneducated (*and* we've
never had a technology that allows for such large-scale, bottom-up
organization as the internet).   The glaring ineffiveness of these
institutions is now showing itself in the standstill of the global
economy which for the last few centuries has propped itself up in a
artificial largesse of &quot;prosperity&quot; by recklessly consuming the
majority of its earthly &quot;solar&quot; inheritance (fossil fuels etc), that,
by storing solar energy into the chemical bonds of organic matter, has
taken the earth a billion f*ing years to accumulate.   Think about the
scale of the waste we've made of it, treating all that capital as if
we're *earning* it, and burning it all in &lt;300 hundred years time.

In any case, we've learned to just take these institutions for granted
and call it all &quot;normal&quot; without realizing just how coercive most of
it is:  most people give the rest of their lives to a system which
really doesn't give a shit about them (religion, the exception, was
invented to medicate against this fact).  Like a devil's bargain (cf.
Stockholm syndrome), people sell their soul in exchange for &quot;security&quot;
-- &quot;Hey, give us 80% of your waking life, and hey, we'll keep you fed
with a roof over your head -- you know, keep you from being a loser in
the gutter...&quot; (which of course *they* put there).

If there's any doubt that the system is coercive and that we're
hostages, consider that every culture that our civilization has
encountered has had to be beaten over the head or killed to maintain
the threat for control.  ....Could you really leave the system if you
wanted to?
