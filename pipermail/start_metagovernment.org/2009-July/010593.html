<PRE>Thanks to everybody.
I have few minutes, as soon I am going to meet Giovani to discuss the
possibility to go for a second shot on the FP7 (there is another very
similar call).

I don't think we need to translate our material in italian to speak with
casaleggio, but I do think we might need to do it if we want to speak with
the &quot;grillini&quot; (the people who follow beppe grillo).

The biggest problem with the grillini is technical on the blog.
If the blog was organised as lj, with full tree discussion on the comment,
and email updates of the answer you have received, then we could speak with
them. But so far they don't do it which really makes their movement very old
fashion politics. One person speaks and everybody else shouts &quot;yes yes yes&quot;.
Anyone who is saying anything more complex gets lost in the crowd. This is
why I think we should contact casaleggio, and have a frank and honest
discussion:

&quot;so do you want to do this, or not? Because if you want to do it the blog
need to be ...&quot;

Also from casaleggio is going to be easier to get in touch with Beppe.

Right now our only hope to get the attention from all those people is that
Beppe writes a post about us, but to reach that point (is we want to), we
need to have something to offer (vilfredo/italia or nationbuilder/italy or
metagovernment), and we need to write them, and to have it in italian. But
all this is somehow a longer aim.


Ok, time to go,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Pietro and thank you for bringing this to our attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The video is somewhat ominous, but I think the final statement
</I>&gt;<i> expresses the common ground we could have quite well: &quot;Collective
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge is the new politics&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So how do we interact with a political movement in Italy and more
</I>&gt;<i> specifically a company who sees the emergence of a world
</I>&gt;<i> government/collectivist utopia as the result of the environmental and
</I>&gt;<i> economic collapse in the coming decades?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been able to gather who we're talking about from here:

</I>&gt;<i> I'm still reading and trying to get my head around what this is all

</I>&gt;<i> do want to interact with such a group, the first step would be to
