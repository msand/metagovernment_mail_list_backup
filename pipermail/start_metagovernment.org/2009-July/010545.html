<PRE>Hmm,
I have to say that I am not happy about the &quot;direct democracy&quot; reference.

Although I like the term (and concept) of democracy, and I totally dig the
idea that we all should be involved, my feeling is that the term &quot;direct
democracy&quot; by now has taken a life of its own. It does not just mean a
democracy where we all are part of it, but a democracy where on every issue
everybody votes, and the votes are equal. This is what the average person
understand
and is not that different from what is presented on wikipedia
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy</A>
now this system has a lot of drawbacks (and many positive sides too).

But the effect of this is that many people when they hear about &quot;direct
democracy&quot; immediatly they freeze, and don't want to have anything to do
with that. We cannot risk something like that.

It's better to use something new, and then empower it of a new meaning
ourselves, than having to explain to everybody that our vision will be
qualitatively different from offline direct democracy because...

Cheers,
Pietro
