<PRE>So, I have been thinking about this post from Ed from yesterday.
It was pretty much non stop on the back of the mind.
Because I think it's really important.


&gt;<i> I think we should use Vilfredo... in a little while. I like the dialog we
</I>&gt;<i> are having in this format, and I would suggest that that is a limitation of
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo. Right now, we are not just making suggestions and voting on which
</I>&gt;<i> one we like best, we are commenting on each others' suggestions and making
</I>&gt;<i> tweaks to them. I think this sort of process could be integrated into
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo, and I have just suggested it on
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=17">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=17</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In other words... currently Vilfredo does not promote cross-fertilization of
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. People can propose ideas and vote them up and down, but there is no
</I>&gt;<i> formal logic which allows a person to say why they support/oppose a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. So sometimes, I might not know how to answer a question, but I can
</I>&gt;<i> tell others what I like or don't like about the proposals they have made so
</I>&gt;<i> far and hope that they can use my suggestions to come up with a better
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So anyway... for now, I suggest that we continue the discussion on the list
</I>&gt;<i> until we see some refinements worked out, and then we place several of the
</I>&gt;<i> most favored items on Vilfredo and see if we can come up with a winner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was thinking, why am I so skeptical about adding a discussion on the
side of Vilfredo? After a lot of thinking I came back to your talk.
When you express how you feel that in representative democracies our
only political action are the 2 seconds in which we vote, usually once
every year (between regional election and national election). But is
this correct? Is this really the only form of political action we
have? What about discussions? What about writing articles, or blog
entries. What about what we are doing right now, right here. After all
I can say something that will inspire you to say something that will
inspire Tim O'Reilly to say something that will inspire someone at the
White House to say something. Let's call this in-direct democracy!

And what about the discussion that politicians are having? Apart for
when do they vote. Is that a political action? What if it is happening
inside the Parliament, or outside.

What I am trying to flag is that there is a risk.
The risk in having an official political medium, and then an
unofficial sharing medium.
This is, by itself, not a problem. The problem comes when
(a) people don't have proper access to the official political medium
(like right now in most representative democracies) or
(b) the unofficial medium becomes the real place where politics is done.

Example: Just few days ago Berlusconi went out for dinner with two
guests. The fact was that they were Judges of the Highest Italian
court, which in a few days must judge if a law he passed that prevents
any judge from judging him while he is in office is constitutional or
not. And the risk over here, is of course that Berlusconi made sure
the judges would favour him. And he might have offered money or houses
or women. Irrelevant of all this we are having that a true political
action and decision is not taken anymore inside the correct medium,
but somwhere else.

I know this is not the case over here, but I was trying to understand
why I was skeptic about putting a discussion board on Vil. The risk is
that people stop using Vilfredo for what is really its tool, and start
instead to discuss somwhere else. FInd a partial agreement, and then
turn to Vilfredo to get an official stamp.

But why is this a problem?
It is a problem because Vilfredo (and then metascore, and WH2, etc...)
are carefully balanced instrument, that are being carefully tested (we
are doing it right now), so that they don't abuse of anyone. If the
decisions are taken somwhere else (even if this somwhere else is a
discussion board &quot;inside&quot; Vilfredo), the risk is that some of the
other players feel excluded.

Something similar happens in real politics all the time.
I remember years ago there was a time when England, Germany, and
France would meet (the delegates, for dinner) before every EU meeting.
They would decide a common strategy, and then would go to the EU
meeting making a common front. This was of course very bad for
everybody else, as the three nations together were really powerful
inside the EU. I don't know how are things now. I think the power
balance changed many times from then, as the EU got bigger.

On the other hand we can't eliminate external discussions. It is part
of humanity. We will always have it. You give a talk, then you turn to
your friend, and ask: &quot;so, how was it? Was I assertive enough?&quot; &quot;Oh,
you were great!&quot;. That's humanity.

So I think the challenge is not in excluding the discussion, not in
just adding a simple discussion, but in adding some commenting. And
intertwining it so well to be effectively part of the site, part of
the voting, part of the feedback. It must be inside the system, not
separated to it.

White house 2 does it quite well, where a person is allowed to
comment, and then people can vote a comment up or down, and so on. Of
course in vilfredo things would go a bit differently. After all if we
thought voting something was meaningful then there would have been no
need to code Vilfredo at all. There are already hundreds of project
out there that let people write comment, and vote on each other
comment. And they work quite well.

So my suggestion would be different.

On a first level we can imagin that in the voting phase people who DO
NOT enodorse something, are given the possibility to comment on it.
The idea is, if you endorse something, then it is ok. If it is not ok,
you should NOT endorse it.

But then among the people who did not endorse something there are two
possibilities. The simple one is that each just has the possibility to
write a comment. The comments are hidden, and appear all together
during the next writing phase. Not only, but in future, if that
proposal does pass in the pareto front, the comment will also be
there. So when you write a comment, you are making a serious action.
You are writing: &quot;I did not endorse this because...&quot;. And in future
that shadow will always be with that proposal. This would also take
care of the &quot;what shall we do about illegal proposals&quot;.

But then there is also another possibility. Which is, I think, more
fun, qlthough a bit more complicated.

Imagine that you can set up a Vilfredo Open question, on the spot, for
a certain set of people. Only those people will be allowed to answer
this question. MAybe only them can see it. Or others can see, but not
act.
Well, then we can imagin that on every proposal, after the voting
phase, a new Vilfredo Question is being generated. The question is:
&quot;What's wrong with this proposal [...] as an answer to this question
[...]&quot;. The question is only posed to the users that refuse to endorse
a proposal. The question is run in automatic from the service. It
moves on automatically after few hours, and it only lasts few
generations (1? 2? 3?). After that the Pareto Front of this question
becomes the comments that are included to the original proposal.

DOes this hide the risk that it will go on forever? After all, what if
there are disagreement in this question... .
Well, first of all at each level the number of people who can
participate are less and less. Also not everybody who is invited to
participate will want to do it. SO I imagine very very few people will
really use this system. And when people don't really use it, it will
jst be a normal commenting system.
But it will be there, and it can be used, and it will show how
Vilfredo can be used on simple questions among a closed community.

Of course, for now I would just code the first part. But I would like
to receive some feedbacks on the full idea.

What I tried to achieve with this is a method, coherent with the
prinicples of Vilfredo, to interweave feedback and a discussion inside
the voting. SO that eventually as much as possible the discussion
happens inside the system; remains on record, and becomes part of the
political decision making as much as possible.

Feedbacks welcome.
