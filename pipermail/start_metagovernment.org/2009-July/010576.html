<PRE>Yesterday, when I suggested to invite the other projects to formulate 
the Mission Statement together, I had missed that Michael and Ed had 
been talking about this already a few days ago:

</I>

I really believe, that we can convince more projects to join us, if we 
treat them as hoped-for co-founders instead of hoped-for members. And 
every further step in building the Metaorganization pushes a potentially 
interested project further away from the co-founder-status.
I think, we should approach them right now.
Somehow like: &quot;We are now 5(?) e-dem-projects looking for better ways to 
cooperate with each other and would also like to cooperate with you. We 
think the founding of a metaorganization is a step towards this goal and 
we would like to invite you to join us. We have no more precise Mission 
Statement yet, because for that your input would be necessary and hoped 
for. ...&quot;

What do you think?
