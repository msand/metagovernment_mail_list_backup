<PRE>Instead of integrating verbal comments into the voting, a different  
option would be to express comments as distilled mathematics... in  
other words, to apply scores. This was the original idea behind  
scoring proposals in Metascore.

In Vilfredo, it would work something like assigning a 1 through 5 (or  
0 = ignore) instead of endorsing proposals. This way, people could  
express their opinion something like:

1 - There are elements of this proposal I like, but i do not wish it  
to be policy

2 - This proposal is barely passable; I would take it if there were no  
other options

3 - This proposal has some really good points, yet still has some  
significant flaws

4 - I would be comfortable if this proposal were policy, though I  
think there should be a better way

5 - I whole-heartedly endorse this proposal and want it to be policy  
as-is.

Then that still leaves the question of what to do with the scores. You  
can't just take the average, since 100 scores of 1 would count more  
than 10 scores of 5, and that doesn't seem right. But from there, I  
assume your knowledge of Mathematics should take over... e.g.,  
shouldn't standard deviations help?

Of course, there is also the option of making Vilfredo modular such  
that it can be a component of other systems... in other words, it  
could be a focusing tool which then hands off its results to  
Metascore...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In other words... currently Vilfredo does not promote cross- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fertilization of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideas. People can propose ideas and vote them up and down, but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formal logic which allows a person to say why they support/oppose a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. So sometimes, I might not know how to answer a question,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but I can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tell others what I like or don't like about the proposals they have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> far and hope that they can use my suggestions to come up with a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So anyway... for now, I suggest that we continue the discussion on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> until we see some refinements worked out, and then we place several  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most favored items on Vilfredo and see if we can come up with a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> winner.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking, why am I so skeptical about adding a discussion on the
</I>&gt;<i> side of Vilfredo? After a lot of thinking I came back to your talk.
</I>&gt;<i> When you express how you feel that in representative democracies our
</I>&gt;<i> only political action are the 2 seconds in which we vote, usually once
</I>&gt;<i> every year (between regional election and national election). But is
</I>&gt;<i> this correct? Is this really the only form of political action we
</I>&gt;<i> have? What about discussions? What about writing articles, or blog
</I>&gt;<i> entries. What about what we are doing right now, right here. After all
</I>&gt;<i> I can say something that will inspire you to say something that will
</I>&gt;<i> inspire Tim O'Reilly to say something that will inspire someone at the
</I>&gt;<i> White House to say something. Let's call this in-direct democracy!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what about the discussion that politicians are having? Apart for
</I>&gt;<i> when do they vote. Is that a political action? What if it is happening
</I>&gt;<i> inside the Parliament, or outside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I am trying to flag is that there is a risk.
</I>&gt;<i> The risk in having an official political medium, and then an
</I>&gt;<i> unofficial sharing medium.
</I>&gt;<i> This is, by itself, not a problem. The problem comes when
</I>&gt;<i> (a) people don't have proper access to the official political medium
</I>&gt;<i> (like right now in most representative democracies) or
</I>&gt;<i> (b) the unofficial medium becomes the real place where politics is  
</I>&gt;<i> done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example: Just few days ago Berlusconi went out for dinner with two
</I>&gt;<i> guests. The fact was that they were Judges of the Highest Italian
</I>&gt;<i> court, which in a few days must judge if a law he passed that prevents
</I>&gt;<i> any judge from judging him while he is in office is constitutional or
</I>&gt;<i> not. And the risk over here, is of course that Berlusconi made sure
</I>&gt;<i> the judges would favour him. And he might have offered money or houses
</I>&gt;<i> or women. Irrelevant of all this we are having that a true political
</I>&gt;<i> action and decision is not taken anymore inside the correct medium,
</I>&gt;<i> but somwhere else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know this is not the case over here, but I was trying to understand
</I>&gt;<i> why I was skeptic about putting a discussion board on Vil. The risk is
</I>&gt;<i> that people stop using Vilfredo for what is really its tool, and start
</I>&gt;<i> instead to discuss somwhere else. FInd a partial agreement, and then
</I>&gt;<i> turn to Vilfredo to get an official stamp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But why is this a problem?
</I>&gt;<i> It is a problem because Vilfredo (and then metascore, and WH2, etc...)
</I>&gt;<i> are carefully balanced instrument, that are being carefully tested (we
</I>&gt;<i> are doing it right now), so that they don't abuse of anyone. If the
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are taken somwhere else (even if this somwhere else is a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion board &quot;inside&quot; Vilfredo), the risk is that some of the
</I>&gt;<i> other players feel excluded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something similar happens in real politics all the time.
</I>&gt;<i> I remember years ago there was a time when England, Germany, and
</I>&gt;<i> France would meet (the delegates, for dinner) before every EU meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> They would decide a common strategy, and then would go to the EU
</I>&gt;<i> meeting making a common front. This was of course very bad for
</I>&gt;<i> everybody else, as the three nations together were really powerful
</I>&gt;<i> inside the EU. I don't know how are things now. I think the power
</I>&gt;<i> balance changed many times from then, as the EU got bigger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand we can't eliminate external discussions. It is part
</I>&gt;<i> of humanity. We will always have it. You give a talk, then you turn to
</I>&gt;<i> your friend, and ask: &quot;so, how was it? Was I assertive enough?&quot; &quot;Oh,
</I>&gt;<i> you were great!&quot;. That's humanity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think the challenge is not in excluding the discussion, not in
</I>&gt;<i> just adding a simple discussion, but in adding some commenting. And
</I>&gt;<i> intertwining it so well to be effectively part of the site, part of
</I>&gt;<i> the voting, part of the feedback. It must be inside the system, not
</I>&gt;<i> separated to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> White house 2 does it quite well, where a person is allowed to
</I>&gt;<i> comment, and then people can vote a comment up or down, and so on. Of
</I>&gt;<i> course in vilfredo things would go a bit differently. After all if we
</I>&gt;<i> thought voting something was meaningful then there would have been no
</I>&gt;<i> need to code Vilfredo at all. There are already hundreds of project
</I>&gt;<i> out there that let people write comment, and vote on each other
</I>&gt;<i> comment. And they work quite well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my suggestion would be different.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a first level we can imagin that in the voting phase people who DO
</I>&gt;<i> NOT enodorse something, are given the possibility to comment on it.
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is, if you endorse something, then it is ok. If it is not ok,
</I>&gt;<i> you should NOT endorse it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then among the people who did not endorse something there are two
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities. The simple one is that each just has the possibility to
</I>&gt;<i> write a comment. The comments are hidden, and appear all together
</I>&gt;<i> during the next writing phase. Not only, but in future, if that
</I>&gt;<i> proposal does pass in the pareto front, the comment will also be
</I>&gt;<i> there. So when you write a comment, you are making a serious action.
</I>&gt;<i> You are writing: &quot;I did not endorse this because...&quot;. And in future
</I>&gt;<i> that shadow will always be with that proposal. This would also take
</I>&gt;<i> care of the &quot;what shall we do about illegal proposals&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then there is also another possibility. Which is, I think, more
</I>&gt;<i> fun, qlthough a bit more complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine that you can set up a Vilfredo Open question, on the spot, for
</I>&gt;<i> a certain set of people. Only those people will be allowed to answer
</I>&gt;<i> this question. MAybe only them can see it. Or others can see, but not
</I>&gt;<i> act.
</I>&gt;<i> Well, then we can imagin that on every proposal, after the voting
</I>&gt;<i> phase, a new Vilfredo Question is being generated. The question is:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;What's wrong with this proposal [...] as an answer to this question
</I>&gt;<i> [...]&quot;. The question is only posed to the users that refuse to endorse
</I>&gt;<i> a proposal. The question is run in automatic from the service. It
</I>&gt;<i> moves on automatically after few hours, and it only lasts few
</I>&gt;<i> generations (1? 2? 3?). After that the Pareto Front of this question
</I>&gt;<i> becomes the comments that are included to the original proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DOes this hide the risk that it will go on forever? After all, what if
</I>&gt;<i> there are disagreement in this question... .
</I>&gt;<i> Well, first of all at each level the number of people who can
</I>&gt;<i> participate are less and less. Also not everybody who is invited to
</I>&gt;<i> participate will want to do it. SO I imagine very very few people will
</I>&gt;<i> really use this system. And when people don't really use it, it will
</I>&gt;<i> jst be a normal commenting system.
</I>&gt;<i> But it will be there, and it can be used, and it will show how
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo can be used on simple questions among a closed community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, for now I would just code the first part. But I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to receive some feedbacks on the full idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I tried to achieve with this is a method, coherent with the
</I>&gt;<i> prinicples of Vilfredo, to interweave feedback and a discussion inside
</I>&gt;<i> the voting. SO that eventually as much as possible the discussion
</I>&gt;<i> happens inside the system; remains on record, and becomes part of the
</I>&gt;<i> political decision making as much as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feedbacks welcome.
