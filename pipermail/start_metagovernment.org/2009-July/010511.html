<PRE>As promised, approved or not, we would share with you what the FP7 is
all about.
We missed 2 points (out of 15) to be approved. We have now the
opportunity to re-submit it in another call, reworking the dissemination
and exploitation phases which were judged weak, whereas the scientific
research and technical proposal were judged adequate.

Here is the introduction. Me and Pietro are available for questions,
sharing of information about the platform and how Metagovernment can
benefit from it.

-------------------------------------
*The EUGAGER project consists of research, design and prototype
implementation of a web-based, open and secure toolbox for e-government
and e-participation tools.* The proposed system will consist of a core
(toolbox) providing a basic set of secure primitives (an open
Application Program Interface) including those typically needed for the
design of complex e-governance and e-participation web applications
(tools). Moreover, the toolbox will support external tools resting on
the toolbox API.



The proposed system will enable project stakeholders (governments, SMEs,
non-profit organizations and existing e-participation/e-government
free/open source communities) to make the system evolve by creating new
tools and eventually constitute an ecosystem for citizens engagement.



*Citizen engagement will be greatly encouraged by EUGAGER.* Indeed, it
will provide: 1) advanced and usable tools for knowledge learning,
interpretation, sharing and creation; 2) a flexible authentication
mechanism ensuring privacy; 3) trusted tools that allow citizens to
verify that their inputs are correctly taken into account in application
results. On the other hand, EUGAGER will be a powerful tool for
governments: 1) powerful knowledge filtering helps governors to meet
citizens will; 2) certified secure API ensures the toolbox against
misuse and malicious attacks.
