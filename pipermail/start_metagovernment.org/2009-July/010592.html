<PRE>Hi Everyone.  DemocracyLab will be on a panel at OSCON
&lt;<A HREF="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009">http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009</A>&gt;  next week, and will have a booth in the
expo hall.  Is anyone else going to be there?  If so you'd be welcome to
promote Metagovernment or your own project at our booth space.
I'd like to include Metagovernment's new mission statement on one of our
slides.  Is this what's been settled on?: &quot;The mission of the Metagovernment
project is to support the development of internet tools for direct democracy
in any community.&quot;
Also, DLab recently rolled out a new iteration of our software, which I
think is much improved.  You could check it out here
&lt;<A HREF="http://democracylab.superboy.org/issues_anonymously">http://democracylab.superboy.org/issues_anonymously</A>&gt; .  We've started
testing it out with small groups, and are a few cycles away from promoting
it to the public.  It crossed my mind that it would be fun to create a
Metagovernment Community, which might be an interesting way to track some of
the discussions we're having.  Would anyone be interested participating in
an experiment along those lines?  I'll welcome any feedback this group can
provide.
Mark
 

Good Evening Lucky OSCON Panelists,
Wow, OCSON is nearly upon us!  Please take time to review last minute
panel instructions, get me your presentation materials for:
Bureaucrats, Technocrats and Policy Cats: How the Government is
turning to Open Source, and Why.
07/22/2009  4:30pm -  5:15pm PDT Room: Exhibit Hall 3
You'll find our session abstract at:
<A HREF="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8384">http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8384</A>
I've received confirmation you all will participate.  Greg Elin from
Sunlight is off to new things, but we're fortunate to have Clay
Johnson, Sunlight Labs Director joining us.  The final panel then is:
Deborah Bryant, Public Sector Communities Manager, OSU Open Source
Lab, Panel Moderator
E. John Sebes, Chief Technology Officer, Open Source Digital Voting
Foundation
Bjorn Freeman-Benson, Board Director, DemocracyLab
Greg Lund-Chaix, Oregon Virtual School District Project Manager, OSU
Open Source Lab
Clay Johnson, Director, Sunshine Labs

Panel Format:
Our session is 45 minutes long.  I would like to provide six or seven
minutes for each of the panelists to present, followed by Q &amp; A.  I'd
like to sequence the talks as the life-cycle of policy:
1) Democratic process/policy development:  DemocracyLab
2) Elections Systems: Open Source Digital Voting Foundation / TrustTheVote!
3) Legislative Mandates in the Public Benefit:  Oregon Virtual School
District
4) Accountability: Sunlight Foundation / Sunlight Labs


What I need from you:
1) What your organization is all about
2) Key projects or initiatives
3) What that has to do with open source
4) What you've learned along the way about working with government
Please make one of your slides a &quot;more info contact&quot; slide with email,
URL and such immortalized.
To close out near the end of the Q&amp;A round, I'd like you to be
prepared to suggest what the audience can do to get more involved.
