<PRE>Isn't mission a call to action, while vision describes the intended results?

Subject: [Start] Mission statement


 
I note that all the following are &quot;inputs&quot; describing what 'we' intend to
do.

+ work towards open standards and foster collaboration between Projects
+ brainstorm about implementation and methods
+ promote adoption of direct democracy by communities
+ participate in development of tools for direct democracy
+ engage existing open source communities with potential for collaboration
(read: mediawiki presentation)

I think it would be far better to have a mission statement that describes
what 'we' hope to achieve (what we call &quot;Results&quot; or Outputs) or better
still, how these Results/Outputs will be Used by others to create
Benefits/Outcomes.  

So, for example, rather than focusing on &quot;work towards open standards and
foster collaboration&quot;, the focus could shift to &quot;improved community
governance as a consequence of applying open standards and collaborating
better&quot;.  

It's the improved community governance that really matters, the tools and
processes are just means of getting there.

It sounds like we may be debating the distinction between a vision statement
versus a mission statement.

 

Here's how AIIM's StratML Committee has defined each of those elements:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Vision</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Mission">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Mission</A> 

 

See also <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Value">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Value</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Goal">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Goal</A> &amp;
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Objective">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Objective</A> 

 

Metagov's previous charter is available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/MGP.xml</A> (plain XML text) or
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml</A> (styled).  

 

It would be good to specify our objectives and stakeholders as well as our
mission, vision, values, and goal(s).

Subject: Re: [Start] Mission Statement

 


While it's good to be specific, this seems (to me) a little too specific
given that our aims are to be an organizer of organizations.

For example, if I were on an elevator, I would not likely say &quot;study,
development, and use of .. &quot; there's got to be a phrase that can encompass
all three (and, potentially more).

I'm laughing reading this because these words are like little earmarks : )
though I agree with Pietro's remarks.

Development in the larger sense (ie developing capabilities), rather than
specifically of software could easily cover these three.

I am thinking something along the lines of the following (in part, inspired
by Michael's mission, below): 

[Support|Promote] development of [software|tools|potential] for direct
democracy via the internet

Or, simply, Support initiatives promoting or enabling direct democracy


This brings up a few questions that may need discussion: 

1.	do we really want to focus on software development rather than
include algorithms / interface design / hardware-technology / ??? 
2.	is our mission to promote, coordinate, foster, ?? engage in
participate in the development of these things? I personally like &quot;support&quot;
because it encompasses all of these.
3.	do we want to limit the project to web-based initiatives? It would
certainly help clarify the 'elevator pitch'
At the same time, if there were a better way that didn't use the internet,
would we not include that since it's not via the internet?

Thoughts from the group?

We would then follow this by saying something like:

Specifically, :

*	work towards open standards and foster collaboration between
projects
*	brainstorm about implementation and methods
*	promote adoption of direct democracy by communities
*	participate in development of tools for direct democracy
*	engage existing open source communities with potential for
collaboration (read: mediawiki presentation)

One comment I recently learned in the exercise of developing a mission
statement: imagine you are in an elevator with someone. You both get on on
the first floor, and they ask what your project does. You have until you get
off to explain it to them. This is referred to as the &quot;elevator pitch.&quot; The
point is that you have to be extremely brief and also extremely clear. So
that said, try to limit your phrases to something you could say to someone
in one sentence and have them immediately understand you. The more
complexity to the sentence, the more likely you are to lose them.

That said... integrating all of the responses so far, I am seeing this:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to foster the study,
development, and use of open source software which allows the members any
community to govern themselves.&quot;

I'm still not liking the nuance of the last section, starting with &quot;which
allows...&quot; I think there should be a clearer way to say this and still have
it be very concise.

My own work is (to state it as a mission) to develop the tools of a direct
democracy.  While I don't suggest adopting that as your mission statement,
it's not incompatible with anything else that was put forward.

PCamp's a Wrap!  What's Next?
June 2009
Hello PCampers,

The word is out that PCamp was the place to be.  New ideas took shape, new
connections were made, and in general participants reported that they felt
that something &quot;got done&quot;.  Thank you to everyone who participated in making
this event great.

Of course, this is just the start.  During our wrap-up session, many
participants expressed the desire to continue collaborating around the many
ideas that bubbled up at PCamp.  PCamp's organizers are happy to oblige, and
are holding our first post-PCamp session in the Skype chat next Wednesday
July 15th at 8am PST/11am EST/3pm GMT.  Read below for details.

In the meantime, feel free to drop into the Skype Chat and post your ideas
for moving forward.  Even if no one's in there at the time, we keep a
transcript and are actively aggregating ideas.  As always, get an invite by
emailing your Skype name to <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">participationcamp at gmail.com</A> with &quot;Skype&quot; in the
subject.
Expanding Participation: Meeting on the OpenCollab Concept

In the time since PCamp, Suresh, Stephan, and Matt have been brainstorming
on how best to move forward.  As a group, we share an interest in the
intersection of collaboration and technology and how practices in this space
can scale up to a global level.

We see that there is already a healthy movement of self-organized camps and
conferences all over the world, but no thread that draws them together.
Presumably many of these camps and their participants share common interests
and goals, and a desire to contribute their discoveries to a larger pool of
knowledge.

There is of course, no shortage of online discussion groups and wikis.
While useful, these are no replacement for the energy and excitement
generated by real-time interaction.  We think that the best way to tie the
world's many camps together is to curate a series of open virtual sessions
that anyone can join and be a part of.

Our experiment, with the working title &quot;Open Collab&quot;, begins Wednesday July
15th at 15:00 GMT in our PCamp Skype Chat.  We'll focus on building out this
concept and a community to support it.  Our long- term vision is to build a
solid framework for cross-camp collaboration in time for Spring 2010, when
most camps gear up.

PCamp was primarily focused on Open Government, in part because better
government is necessary for improved collaboration in the face of shared
challenges such as climate change, poverty, and war.  Help us take our
efforts to the next level.
PCamp Archives and Documentation

We're still working to pull together all the information, recordings, and
archives from PCamp.  For this purpose, we've built our own wiki:

<A HREF="http://participationcamp.pbworks.com">http://participationcamp.pbworks.com</A>

There you'll find a copy of our schedule, and links to slideshows and
recordings (when available).  If you have recordings or photos, please post
them to the wiki or email them to <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">participationcamp at gmail.com.</A>
