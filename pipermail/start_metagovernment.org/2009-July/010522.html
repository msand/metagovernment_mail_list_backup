<PRE>Hi Michael,

first of all I too in general like an open architecture.

Still let me defend my proposal, as I feel it has reason to be.

You made a strict division into

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Brainstorming
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Discussion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3. Voting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
First of all I would like to ask you where do you put Vilfredo right now?
Let's not speak about the version with the comments, let us
concentrate on the version we have right now. Because you seem to be
envisioning to use it in conjunction with other tools. So would this
be a brainstorming tool, a discussion tool or a voting tool?

If you think carefully on it you will realise that Vilfredo, as it is
right now, defies this division.


In your question:
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=43</A>
You use it to start brainstorm something:
&quot;What's a better name than Metagovernment?
This is none of my business, but others have raised the question in
the list. So here it is for brainstorming. Can you improve on the
name?&quot;
(By the way, the question has now 7 suggestions from 4 people. But no
one is allowed to vote on it until You move it on. As the web designer
of Vilfredo I am really curious, why have you not moved it on? Did you
forgot about it? Have you not realised that the system required your
action at this point? Were you waiting for more input? Or were you
just uninterested about this topic? I am really asking, as your answer
might help me to design better the system)

So you use it in your question &quot;for brainstorming&quot;.

But then in your mail you write:
&gt;<i> Brainstormers are supposed to be non-judgemental.
</I>
And even more you say that:
&gt;<i> It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> and voting.
</I>
So you must see Vilfredo as a sub-optimal brainstorming device.
After all we vote on each other idea.

If this is the case I can see why you rebelled over the fact of me
adding the comment.
Not only I builded something which was half way between a
brainstorming tool and a voting tool.
But now I also wanted to add the discussion.

Is my analysis correct?

And now let me enter more in my defence.

&gt;<i> It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> and voting.
</I>
I am a mathematician. I recognise things as being &quot;known&quot; only if they
have been proved mathematically. If not they are &quot;believed&quot;, or
&quot;assumed&quot;, or &quot;supposed&quot;. And if I believed I could not improve on the
current state of knowledge, I would not be in the field of academic
research. All this to say that the fact that we &quot;believe&quot; something is
the only solution will not stop me from trying something else.

And something else I am trying, because Vilfredo is neither a pure
brainstorming device, nor a pure voting device, nor a pure discussion
device (of which, I admit, have little so far). Mine over here is not
actually that a revolutionary idea, I am just building a genetic
algorithm, only using human beings to generate the mutations and the
evaluations. Recently I discovere that there are already a couple of
papers on similar devices. Funny enough, one is just from one of my
collegues at the university, from a few years back. (google: Human
Based Genetic Algorithm, HBGA, I think). So this to give a
justification on the fact that this approach does effectively work.

And since I am using a Pareto Front, we can call this approach a PFHBGA.

I will avoid, for now, proving that the PFHBGA is better, in terms of
quality of the solutions, and speed in reaching theose , than keeping
the three tools separated because I think it is too early. Qualitative
comparison can only be made among estabilished practices. There is too
much optimisation to be done, at this stage.

But I will claim that the PFHBGA is ethically better. I will claim an
ethical superiority in the fact that when we keep the three tools
separated it is very common that the most smart, intelligent, or just
connected people dominate the discussions. And then impose, and define
the terms on which the others vote. And whoever defines what are the
voting possibilities is effectively in a position to decide the result
of the voting itself.

This, on the other side, does not happen on a PFHBGA (I swear, I like
more Vil). No one is in charge of defining the voting options. And the
intelligence and creativity only help you so far, since anybody can
copy your proposal, modify it to suit their needs, and then repropose
it.

Of course it is possible, and I agree that we should, use different
tools. But what I am trying to build is a system that permits to a
community to govern itself. Although I am a classical example of a
member of the creative class, I don't want a system that puts the
creative people in charge. I want a system where NO ONE is in charge.
Where ideas grow, but no one is adored and placed on a pedestal, and
given unbalanced power (or just more power), for having had some good
ideas in its life.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Respectfully, I favour an open architecture. &#160;It depends on keeping
</I>&gt;<i> the tools physically separate. &#160;I will explain. &#160;Here's the three
</I>&gt;<i> tools you mention:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;1. Brainstorming
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;2. Discussion
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;3. Voting
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's long been known that brainstorming does not mix with discussion
</I>&gt;<i> and voting. &#160;Brainstormers are supposed to be non-judgemental. &#160;Their
</I>&gt;<i> interaction is limited to statements like: &quot;What if X!&quot; &#160;and &quot;Yeah,
</I>&gt;<i> that's a great idea, then we could do Y!&quot; &#160;The point is to get a
</I>&gt;<i> positive storm of ideas, not to sort the good from the bad. &#160;In true
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming, no idea is ever better than another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion and voting, on the other hand, have a different relation.
</I>&gt;<i> They must be mixed together, or the one will be aimless and the other
</I>&gt;<i> irrational. &#160;But there is no reason why the discussion and voting
</I>&gt;<i> tools themselves must be welded together into a single system. &#160;One
</I>&gt;<i> can instead have an open architecture, in which people can pick up
</I>&gt;<i> different tools for different purposes, and different people are free
</I>&gt;<i> to make different choices. &#160;The choice to do a particular
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming session in Vilfredo should not preclude the choice to
</I>&gt;<i> discuss the resulting ideas in a mailing list; nor should the choice
</I>&gt;<i> of a mailing list by some of the participants, preclude the choice of
</I>&gt;<i> Debategraph by others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, there is no reason why the participants cannot interleave
</I>&gt;<i> these systems *procedurally*. &#160;They may be stuck in a discussion that
</I>&gt;<i> is going in circles, for example, and boring everyone to tears. &#160;So
</I>&gt;<i> they may decide to head back into a brainstorming session in order to
</I>&gt;<i> recharge their batteries and share perspectives. &#160;Meanwhile others are
</I>&gt;<i> separately voting on the same issue. &#160;In the birds-eye view, the
</I>&gt;<i> process is ongoing - parallel cycles of brainstorming, discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> vote shifting - and never ending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the participants will prefer to use these tools within an open
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, and that's how we ought to build them.
