<PRE>Ok, I agree, that we need something of a definition about our goals in 
order to formulate an invitation.
And I also agree, that it would be good to have a limiting factor 
concerning who we are going to invite.

I like your proposal:
&quot; ...(a project) to support the development of internet tools which 
enable the members of any community to fully participate in the 
governance of that community.&quot;

I just want to suggest additionally, that we approach them as a group of 
projects asking them to form the new Metagovernment together with us.
Instead of approaching them as the new Metagovernment looking for new 
members.

Right now in this small time-window both perspectives are possible. It 
is only a slight difference, but I see it as important.
The first one gives them more freedom, more room for development. And 
all that is needed on our side is our openness and our trust in them. 
After all, we are the ones who choose, who to invite.

So it could sound something like:
&quot;We would like to invite you to found together with us the new 
Metagovernment project with the mission to support the development of 
internet tools which enable the members of any community to fully 
participate in the governance of that community.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> what we should be telling them we are asking them to join.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially interested project further away from the co-founder-
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> status.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think, we should approach them right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Somehow like: &quot;We are now 5(?) e-dem-projects looking for better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ways to cooperate with each other and would also like to cooperate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with you. We think the founding of a metaorganization is a step
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> towards this goal and we would like to invite you to join us. We
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have no more precise Mission Statement yet, because for that your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> input would be necessary and hoped for. ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
