<PRE>Hi, Mark.

I welcome your participation and also your dissent over the edit policy.

The justification for the edit policy on the Main Page is that it is  
extremely public-facing. People who visit our project often only view  
the main page, and the impression they get from there may be all they  
get. If it is off-kilter for half a day, that's a bunch of people that  
see something which does not represent the project. I know it doesn't  
seem like the wiki way to have something be somewhat restricted, but  
consider that Wikipedia's Main Page is not even editable at all. The  
use of an alternate page as Mat&#237;as linked it a viable workaround that  
allows people to work on an improvement without losing the current  
version which is known to have consensus.

As for the Basic Principles... it just seems reasonable that our  
fundamental principles should not be particularly malleable, otherwise  
we lose our integrity.

That said... note that the pages in question are not protected by  
other than policy. Only the Copyright page is protected against  
editing, because it wouldn't be nice for someone to suddenly change  
the legal statement about the availability of the content. If you  
really think a page needs to be changed, you are still free to do so.  
For example, people have fixed typos and made other small edits from  
time to time. The main objection I have is about changing the tone or  
general idea of the Main Page without using the established suggested- 
page method.

In any event... welcome to the group. It looks like you've been  
keeping quite busy on the wiki. :)

&gt;<i> There's a bunch of other stuff I'd like to dialog about, but will hold
</I>&gt;<i> off for now and let the conversation continue via wiki edits....
</I>
Note that while we do engage in dialog through the wiki, this list  
server is often the more active method. For more complicated  
conversations, it is often helpful to hash them out in this venue,  
then to codify and refine them in the wiki.

P.S. The UCSC trust mechanism sounds fantastic. Do you have a link? I  
am traveling today so don't know when I'll be able to look at it, but  
it certainly sounds worth considering.

</PRE>
