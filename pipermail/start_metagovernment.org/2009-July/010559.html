<PRE> 
Would people be open to turning around Ed's draft mission statement as
follows:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to enable/empower the members
of any community to fully participate in the governance of that community
through their use of internet tools.&quot;

In our OpenStrategy work (www.openstrategies.com) we see far far too many
initiatives to 'develop tools' in the fond and usually na&#239;ve hope that
someone will pick them up and use them.  We encourage strategists to focus
first and foremost on what the &quot;Users&quot; will ACTUALLY do (in this case &quot;fully
participate in the governance of that community&quot;) before describing what
these users need (tools).

Therefore a primary consideration must be to determine exactly what Users
are ACTUALLY prepared to do and only then to develop systems/tools which
explicitly recognises the real behaviours of most users/citizens.

In our experience, only a modest percentage of users actually wish to
actively engage regularly in democratic processes - but almost all of them
will demand a RIGHT to participate and will demand that the participation
methods are ones that they are comfortable with.  Many citizens will be
happy to sit back and let others look after governance provided the
governance processes are transparent - they will only participate actively
when they strongly disagree with an existing governance activity.

So the RIGHT to participate, and the accessibility/appropriateness of
methods of participation, are more important to many (most?) people than
actually participating.  

We've found that for every 100 people we can get to participate
enthusiastically in a series of governance/strategy workshop, only about 3-5
are prepared to continue to participate on-line.

For every 100 people who say they are interested in the 'big picture' of an
issue, only about 3-5 are genuinely interested in the big picture, the rest
are primarily interested in their little bit and to a lesser extent how it
fits into the big picture.

So if we're going to develop on-line tools that will contribute to better
community governance (as distinct from 'government'), then we must start by
understanding the actual, realistic current and potential behaviour of
citizens and communities, hence why I would prefer a mission statement that
recognises that any form of improved community governance MUST start with
the realistic behaviours of users and citizens and communities, rather than
starting with tools.

Phil

OK, so... I'm just sort of playing referee here, trying to integrate all of
the suggestions since my last attempt. How about a return to some of the
verbiage about community self-governance instead of direct democracy, like:

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to support the development of
internet tools which enable the members of any community to govern
themselves.&quot;

or maybe

&quot;The mission of the Metagovernment project is to support the development of
internet tools which enable the members of any community to fully
participate in the governance of that community.&quot;

This still doesn't fully integrate Phil Diver's comments that it should
emphasize that we intend this sort of governance to be more effective than
existing methods. But it is very concise and seems to get across most of
what we are trying to say.

Michael, users would vote (and, if they choose, comment) on individual goal
and objective statements of which they are stakeholders.  

They would not necessarily vote on entire strategic plans and, presumably,
they would self-select themselves to vote (&amp;/or comment) only on goals and
objectives in which they have an interest -- either as potential
beneficiaries or as &quot;performers&quot; of the required tasks, e.g., paying taxes
or user fees.  However, to the degree necessary and appropriate, &quot;rules&quot;
could be applied to determine who is eligible to participate based upon the
attributes of individual stakeholders.

The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requires U.S. federal
agencies &quot;When developing a strategic plan [to] solicit and consider the
views and suggestions of those entities [stakeholders] potentially affected
by or interested in such a plan.&quot; [5 USC 306(d)]
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/mgmt-gpra_gplaw2m/#h3">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/mgmt-gpra_gplaw2m/#h3</A>  

One way or another, they all do so.  However, in my view, they do so poorly,
and regardless of how well they may do it, there is always room for
improvement ... which is how I hope MetaScore and similar software services
can add value.

When AIIM announces approval of the StratML standard (hopefully in a couple
months), it would be neat if Metagov could issue a statement announcing the
availability of and pointing to software and services enabling citizens more
easily, effectively, and &quot;directly&quot; provide feedback in the GPRA
consultation process.

P.S. It would also be good if the expectation could be established that all
candidates for elective office will document their &quot;platforms&quot; in StratML
format on their political action committee Web sites, so that interested
folks can vote directly on individual objectives rather than being forced to
vote only on the candidate him or herself.  Moreover, in the longer-term,
rather than merely using our votes to project our responsibilities onto
someone else, it would be good to redirect the focus toward achieving our
common objective using the resources and efforts that we ourselves are
willing and able to bring to bear, in partnership with those who share our
objectives.

Really, that's interesting.  So instead of voting up i) legislation or
policy statements, you vote up ii) StratML docs?

In that case, you probably won't be restricted to using Metascore.
Any public decision-making system that's reasonably flexible ought to
suffice.

Maybe the StratML community will be the first customer in line then - the
first to be served by the new, reformed Metagov.  Is it your hope to bring a
touch of direct democracy (so to speak) to enterprise management?  It might
have that effect.

Hi Michael,

Vilfredo is becoming open source soon.

There are some prerequisite, but I think by the end of this month they could
be all solved.

After that I will publish the algorithm.

I also would want to make the website opensource. I need to speak about it
with Chris, but being him a great supporter of open source I would be
surprised if he would not want it.

Still I don't know how to publish it.
I know I can't just &quot;publish&quot; the files, as they include details like the
password name for the DB, and similar sensitive data.

How do people usually solve this?

&gt;<i> (Vilfredo could play that trick too, if you could loosen up your 
</I>&gt;<i> definition of integration, and adopt the &quot;small tools&quot; philososphy of
</I>&gt;<i> Unix.)
</I>
Sorry, this just went over my head.

I think Vilfredo is a bit too simple to be further subdivided. But I am
interested to be proven wrong.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could, if:

</I>&gt;<i> By contrast, Votorola could interface with MixedInk even today, if

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; good  proposals.  What should I do?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe the proposal you have written have been rejected, but at least

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo. If you get this you get the selection process) In other

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By definition the Pareto Front ALWAYS include a proposal that have 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been endorsed by each user.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I even think (but I am not mathematically sure, yet), that a Pareto 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Front
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the smallest set that satisfy this requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you are so attached to your own proposal, then you just need to
</I>&gt;<i> endorse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only your own proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If everybody does this, the pareto front becomes the whole set of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And society unexistant :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, I understand.  If you think your proposal is a good one, then you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Somehow the system works on the assumption that although everybody

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and everybody endorses, people are not so attached to their own

</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; do it, just to remain in the pareto front. We had some cases in the
</I>past.
&gt;<i> &gt; Now the history clearly shows who writes what, and whoe endorses 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; what,
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is pretty easy to spot this kind of behaviour.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is the suggested action against this behaviour?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nothing. Keep on doing your thing. Keep on endorsing only what you 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree with.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually the whole system will still generate its own best proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the grandious kid (sorry, no better way to define such behaviour), 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will remain with its own unedited proposals, only endorse by himself.
