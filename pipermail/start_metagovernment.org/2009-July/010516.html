That's a good point, but it doesn't work for the elevator pitch. My  
objective in stating the original mission suggestion as I did was to  
make something which would:
1. be immediately understandable to someone outside the group
2. encompass the group of people we wanted to join

So instead of forming a group and trying to make a mission, it seems  
equally valid to make a mission and invite others who may share in  
that mission/vision to join in. Mission statements can change over  
time, but it would be easier to approach additional organizations if  
we first had some standard goal we could be inviting them to.

Sure, I proposed it, but it was the various input from members of  
other organizations, including yours, that inspired it. It is great  
that we have all these different approaches to roughly the same thing,  
but clearly there is also a desire among many of us to have some  
communication and intermingling. After all, we are all open source, so  
why not encourage ideas to flow as much as possible. Or as Pietro put  
it... this proposal is really just acknowledging what is already going  
on, since much of the traffic on this list is from people not working  
on Metascore.
