<PRE>Dear Ed and others: 

 

I am very excited by the ground-breaking work you are all doing. I am
working on producing a major feature film that will help inject the idea of
popular self government both at a local and global level. 

 

It is crucially important that you continue to evolve something that moves
way beyond archaic voting into a system that can draw out the highest and
best wisdom of every individual.  In the old archaic system, a person who
votes based on a 30 second ad has the same weight as a person who has
studied an issue for years or who is intimately effected by it. 

 

You can see more about our movie project at www.onefilms.com .

 

See also www.Earth-os.net &lt;<A HREF="http://www.earth-os.net/">http://www.earth-os.net/</A>&gt;  for my initial
proposal on designing a new wiki-based Earth Operating System. 

 

I have a fuller draft paper on this available if you'd like me to send a pdf
copy for your review, critique and collaboration.

 

Warmly,

 

Arthur Kanegis

PS  You might also enjoy my article at www.E-arth.com

beyond violence.

I personally share Owen's distaste for the word &quot;government&quot; in this

context.  I believe that we (everyday people) ought to be controlling

the administrative apparatus that goes by the name of &quot;government&quot;,

and not ourselves becoming that apparatus.  Elsewhere, and on a

related note, I have suggested that the name &quot;Metagovernment&quot; ought to

be changed (at least informally) to &quot;Metagov&quot;, which seems more

friendly.

 

My own work is (to state it as a mission) to develop the tools of a

direct democracy.  While I don't suggest adopting that as your mission

statement, it's not incompatible with anything else that was put

forward.

 

These are just personal thoughts, from the sidelines,

The point of the new mission statement is to be for a meta- 

organization that fosters communication and collaboration among the  

various projects which are working toward similar goals.

I hope that you will change your perspective from the sidelines to  

participant in this meta-project, Michael. After all, it was your  

significant input into the beginnings of the standardization process  

that brought about this idea. Hopefully your participation will help  

strengthen both Votorola and the meta-project.
