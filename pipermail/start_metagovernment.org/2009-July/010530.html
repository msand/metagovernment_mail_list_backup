My only complaint would be if anyone implemented nationbuilder such  
that one *had* to have a facebook account to join. Being required to  
give my personal information to FB in order to participate in any form  
of governance would be even worse than the status quo. Regardless of  
how they present themselves, FB is a great tool for selling your  
personal info to/for commercial interests.

</I>
Which is why I think the best option is to have the software be  
totally unconcerned with the identity of the user, instead making all  
of their identity internal to the software (ie, reputation-based).  
This of course assumes that governance is not subject to participation- 
restrictions, such as citizenship in a locality or membership in an  
organization. I think that anyone who is willing to build a reputation  
within a community should be allowed to participate in it.

And that again is another argument for starting in extremely small  
communities and scaling upward. That allows us to supplant traditional  
community-membership structures without substantial disruption. If we  
start in large governments, then the whole hairy identity issue is  
indeed unavoidable.
