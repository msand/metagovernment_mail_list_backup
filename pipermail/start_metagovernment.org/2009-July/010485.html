<PRE>Hello ,

I'm Mark Janssen, and while I've been tracking various &quot;open source
governance&quot; models for a few years, I've only lately started
participating.  Metagovernment seems like a great place to start.

I little about me (cf. [[User:StalkingTime]]).  I'm enormously
interested in codifying a system of governance so well-crafted as to
be inarguable, advancing society's evolution toward true
self-governance. Would love to find others and work out a system of
ranking and scoring to develop a true meritocracy and rich healthy
society with a well-defined reputation system.  I take many lessons in
this regard from evolution and nature itself (which seems to have
somehow already solved this problem of meaningfully organizing
trillions of individuals without overtly centralized control).  My
work specializes in self-generating, self-organizing systems made of
information and have been working on these topics deeply for over a
decade. Fluent programmer in Python and currently reside in Tucson,
Arizona.  So am glad to find an open community looking to create a
bottom-up foundation for a new model of governance.

I do feel the need to raise an objection regarding the suggestion that
edits to the [[main page]] as well as the [[basic principles]] need
special approval. These are important sections and they would do well
to have vigorous debate and crowdsourced refinement. I understand that
this is also the reason *for* such a decision, yet I believe the
decision to require pre-approval premature for such a nascent project
and a half-measure brought about by the lack of underdeveloped tools
and schema (such as metascore, etc.) in which to contain and evaluate
the debate, but also due to insufficient trust in &quot;the wiki way&quot;.
During any nascent period where the ideas in which to organize are
still being developed it is important to make the ability to discuss
and evaluate as fluid as possible, while making the ability to lose
track of the current progress on any given debate as difficult as
possible.  Better to deal with a few lousy edits than lose a good
contributor because of apparent inactivity or because the fleeting
spark of their creative impulse had no welcome spot to land.  Trust
the wiki way--it has already worked out much of these issues and
generally it is lack of the proper mindset which inhibits its
effectiveness (cf. Help:Editing and note below, however).  That being
said, the wiki way is still in process of evolution and I personally
find many areas to improve (some of which are roughly detailed on my
user page).

Even if you only revert a disputed edit and feel like an ogre, it's
better than shuffling people off to other sites:

   1. it brings in yet another, unintegrated tool which people must
learn how to access and signup for (it seems trivial for us computer
guys, but for regular folks it's a real barrier)
   2. it tends toward a sort of mediocre, apathetic complacency: &quot;well
I guess this works for now&quot; which is fine only to those who now have
adapted to the half-measure, but requires continued hill-climbing for
everyone else.  Effort on a new project is to be expected, but let
that effort be invested in making a *working* system, not adapting to
a non-working one (&quot;necessity is the mother of invention&quot; right?).

To be more specific in my case, I'm wanting to add a &quot;Why is this
project needed?&quot; link at the end of the first paragraph on the [[main
page]].  I think it will provide a greater context in which to give a
concise summary of what drives the project.  Otherwise it could just
look like someone's curiosity.  Also note, that wiki is made to be
redundant to some degree.  It allows many paths to similar information
and by monitoring stats one can find which paths ended up being used.

The other suggestion is to change the opening lede as suggested on the
[[main]] discussion page.

One other quick note for consideration, UCSC has developed a
wiki-trust extension to the MediaWiki software--would be interesting
to have it start building a reputation ranking for all the edits which
get done.  (Basically, it tracks revision histories to see which
user's edits tend to be preserved--no extra voting required! --the
edits themselves inform the metric!)

There's a bunch of other stuff I'd like to dialog about, but will hold
off for now and let the conversation continue via wiki edits....

Thoughts?
