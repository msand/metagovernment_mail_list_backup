PCamp's a Wrap!  What's Next?
June 2009
Hello PCampers,

The word is out that PCamp was the place to be.  New ideas took shape,  
new connections were made, and in general participants reported that  
they felt that something &quot;got done&quot;.  Thank you to everyone who  
participated in making this event great.

Of course, this is just the start.  During our wrap-up session, many  
participants expressed the desire to continue collaborating around the  
many ideas that bubbled up at PCamp.  PCamp's organizers are happy to  
oblige, and are holding our first post-PCamp session in the Skype chat  
next Wednesday July 15th at 8am PST/11am EST/3pm GMT.  Read below for  
details.

In the meantime, feel free to drop into the Skype Chat and post your  
ideas for moving forward.  Even if no one's in there at the time, we  
keep a transcript and are actively aggregating ideas.  As always, get  
an invite by emailing your Skype name to <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">participationcamp at gmail.com</A>  
with &quot;Skype&quot; in the subject.
Expanding Participation: Meeting on the OpenCollab Concept

In the time since PCamp, Suresh, Stephan, and Matt have been  
brainstorming on how best to move forward.  As a group, we share an  
interest in the intersection of collaboration and technology and how  
practices in this space can scale up to a global level.

We see that there is already a healthy movement of self-organized  
camps and conferences all over the world, but no thread that draws  
them together.  Presumably many of these camps and their participants  
share common interests and goals, and a desire to contribute their  
discoveries to a larger pool of knowledge.

There is of course, no shortage of online discussion groups and  
wikis.  While useful, these are no replacement for the energy and  
excitement generated by real-time interaction.  We think that the best  
way to tie the world's many camps together is to curate a series of  
open virtual sessions that anyone can join and be a part of.

Our experiment, with the working title &quot;Open Collab&quot;, begins Wednesday  
July 15th at 15:00 GMT in our PCamp Skype Chat.  We'll focus on  
building out this concept and a community to support it.  Our long- 
term vision is to build a solid framework for cross-camp collaboration  
in time for Spring 2010, when most camps gear up.

PCamp was primarily focused on Open Government, in part because better  
government is necessary for improved collaboration in the face of  
shared challenges such as climate change, poverty, and war.  Help us  
take our efforts to the next level.
PCamp Archives and Documentation

We're still working to pull together all the information, recordings,  
and archives from PCamp.  For this purpose, we've built our own wiki:

<A HREF="http://participationcamp.pbworks.com">http://participationcamp.pbworks.com</A>

There you'll find a copy of our schedule, and links to slideshows and  
recordings (when available).  If you have recordings or photos, please  
post them to the wiki or email them to <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">participationcamp at gmail.com.</A>
