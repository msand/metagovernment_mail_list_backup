It will be interesting to see how this develops. Looks like they intend to have some sort of crowdsourced policy-making platform.

The Civil Constitution

Civil is founded on the principle that a free and open press is an essential element of the foundation of a free, fair, and just society; and in the belief that global change in technology, economics, and politics have altered the basic conditions that provide for its fulfillment of that purpose.

Civil?s platform is intended to be operated and governed by its participants?citizens and journalists alike?while protecting Civil?s core values and purpose. Civil is a community with a specific purpose and an ethical position?these establish the side-constraints on the operational and governing power of the community over individuals and groups within it. Therefore the Civil Journalism Ethics Guideline, a constitution that lays out Civil?s core values and purpose.

Specific interpretations of the core values and purpose will be the work of the community, operating according to a transparent governing framework. That framework will include provisions for the community to change this document as needed to better promote the core values and purpose of Civil.

Argh: More blockchain hammers looking for nails.

I do agree that they've accurately identified one of the core problems
of modern civilization: Advertizing as funding model is inefficient,
ineffective, too susceptible to corruption, and IMHO immoral because
it relies on amateur social engineers whose job it is to manipulate
people without supervision, regulation, or even any sort of ethical
standards. But what they've proposed instead is just to turn
journalism into another type of charity which just makes the core
funding problem even worse.

My proposed solution is a government budgeting system that has the
ability to fund *all* types of organizations that The People decide
provide a community benefit. Journalism would of course be one of
these, but you don't need any baroque blockchain system to ensure that
the good ones get supported and the bad ones fade away, you just need
to have all of them shown in a list and have The People (and of course
in my system just a small subset of them) just pick those they want
some of their tax dollars to go to. This gets around the underfunded
charity problem because we will collectively decide what percentage of
the government budget goes to each class of charity and popularity and
*individual* citizen evaluation will be used to divvy up the pie. Sure
this means that some of your tax dollars are going to be going to
organizations that have an ideological slant that might differ from
yours, but at least you'll know that your fellow citizens are deciding
that and that its not just some oligarchs or activerts who have
figured out how to game the system. Plus it doesn't require all
existing organizations to change their entire operations to fit a new
model: All they have to do is fire their advertising/fundraising
departments...

It's also too bad that they cite Wikipedia as model of good
governance. My experience has been quite the opposite: IMHO overt
corruption and bias is a fundamental component of Wikipedia precisely
because there *is* no public input into the process and so it ends up
being the same kind of "government by the activerts" that I think has
been convincingly shown (by misrepresentative democracy) to not work.

This competition has moved on to the semi-finals. Not sure how many of us
entered but my entry was not selected. I'm interested in reading some of
the ones that were selected. Apparently, they will be posted at some point.
Someone from a facebook group I was in was selected, here is his entry
https://magwas.gitbooks.io/enumerati/content/en/

Haven't fully examined it yet but figured might be something worth
discussing.

Cheers Y'all

Mine either...

Me too although I expect that I'm going to find them very
disappointing based on who the judges are: Given that they're all
"work within the system" types their preferences are going to be far
too conservative and none of them are likely to have a
social-engineering perspective on things.

It's well done (albeit with too many typos and awkward phrasings, but
neither I nor the judges would be likely to hold that against them),
and I really like the way they've used the Gitbooks platform.

> Haven't fully examined it yet but figured might be something worth

Agreed.  Here's my take on it:

1) The deal breaker: Voluntary delegation with no assist in even
identifying appropriate proxies. We've already seen how that doesn't
work (both in the LQFB system and in the Google liquid voting system).

2) No correction for SDAPs and their much higher interest in being
"representatives" (i.e., the people who will end up running things are
the same people we have now).

3) I don't think I follow the required 1% "membership" fee. 1% of
average income should be more than enough to run the government itself
but does that mean that to join the "parks" group I've got to pony up
$300 (1% of the average income in the US)? If I don't come up with the
$300 I don't get to vote on anything?

4) The voting system is underspecified. Voting seems to be open (no
secret ballot), but there is no mention of this or who and how they do
the counts or the authentication.

All in all it seems to me to be no improvement over what we have now
other than sort of implying that the international level is a
representative democracy that works the same as all lower levels.

Oh well, at least it's not based on blockchain ;-)

I submit a mix of platform, and pass the semifinal but I still have very
large doubt it can go further up.
I even mention in my proposal proxyforme!
Attached for your review.
I spotted few error, please be considerate i learn English on my own.

 "although I expect that I'm going to find them very
disappointing based on who the judges are: Given that they're all
"work within the system" types "


I took the time to actually read what L?szl? Szombatfalvy had to say in his
first book and I think he'd be very dissapointed to know the actual judges
mostly all had such limited views on what he'd called "NEW shapes contest".

Rather than just whining about it, I want to gather participants who's
entries were disqualified for the wrong reasons, and write a group message
to Mr. Szombatfalvy

If you're interested in that shoot me an email directly

As well as claiming to be able to integrate several other projects.
Pretty ambitious ;-)

But I'm kind of surprised they didn't just disqualify you for
providing identifying information: I had to work pretty hard to scrub
my entry of this kind of thing (e.g., not being able to cite the
Matchism Manifesto or link to the papers on that site was a major
hurdle). The "enumerati" entry cited several on-line sources which is
something I scrupulously avoid doing (they're not refereed journals,
many of them have advertising that could be problematic, and sites
like those disappear or get reorganized frequently which leads to
broken links).

> Attached for your review.
> I spotted few error, please be considerate i learn English on my own.

It's no problem: The meaning is clear and I'd guess that the GCF saw a
lot entries with less than perfect English and so has had to make
accommodation for that (indeed most of the judges seem to be
non-native English speakers and so in many cases probably didn't even
notice the awkward patterns in these entries). Keep in mind that I'm
always happy to take a look at things like this and provide feedback
and/or editing.

My take on yours:
1) I go back and forth on using FB, G+, etc. credentials for login. It
does speed the early adoption process, but IMHO also taints even your
early results because everyone knows people with multiple accounts,
fake names, etc. and they should not be reminded of this *every time*
they use the system. It's also going to be a nightmare to add
independent authentication later (someone will have to manually go in
and approve each transition to an internal authentication system). I'm
still of the opinion that the way proxyfor.me works is the best: A
pseudonym is used, but it exists independently of the name used
elsewhere. Not only does this make adding true authentication later on
straightforward, it also affords people the option of true anonymity
if they decide to enforce this (by not sharing their screen name
outside the platform). In fact I'm working on an automatic generation
system for the names to even more firmly push for keeping your
proxyfor.me name separate from the names you use on social media
platforms.

2) Ooops, you used the blockchain buzzword ;-)

3) It doesn't seem to meet the "guaranteed decision" criteria. Both
proxyfor.me (which I called MPADD (Matched Proxy Augmented Direct
Democracy) in my entry) and the enumerati entry do meet this
requirement.

4) I don't see the path from local to global adoption and effect, and
you even explicitly state that your system cannot overcome
obstructionism from existing government officials. But wasn't this
path the *core* of what the competition was about?

The Global Challenges Foundation Newsletter states it "will make available a database of the top submissions for...the public to read, examine and improve.?

I?m anxious to review and evaluate the entries that are made available to see if they can be morphed, combined, or synthesized into some synergistic, single platform or system. (Unless of course by some stroke of genius one of them stands alone as being up to the task.) Beyond critiquing the *individual* submissions, perhaps it will be possible to cobble together bits and pieces of various entries into a single (more) comprehensive or workable design.

I believe that putting together the best ideas is the key, decisions must
be addressed with specific criteria depending on the subject matter.
lets say we need to generate a very articulate proposal, then I will
consider a platform based on Airesis. But the shortcoming in Airesis is
that it give to much power to the redactor, by using vilfredo I can have
redactors that need to go through a consensus process for the paragraph
that need to be integrated in the proposal, once the proposal is completed
with different solution and must go to the vote, people can choose to cast
their vote or having a proxyforme AI type of engine do it.
If the decision is an amount (example, a compensation for x service) a
median like algorithm engine can be used.
I envision also a  multilanguage real time translating service when the
decision is between two or more states.
Responding to some of Scott's remarks, I believe that even if participants
access with their G or FB account they must be registered unequivocal
users. The blockchain or other crypto is not necessary because the system
is centralized but it may be used as proof of identity.
I believe the system should be transparent and community controlled and the
state government as we know today will be outlaw.
Somewhere it must start and the process is not straight forward otherwise
will be a revolution and from a revolution cannot start the implementation
of a fully democratic process.
We must go stage by stage, regarding local to global this is also a process
and I believe will be happening once the model is proven doing good
somewhere, then people will start to demand to use it more and more. But we
are entering into fanta-politics and I prefer to concentrate in practical,
user-friendly,  well defined method, understandable by all, usable by all,
accessible platform, secure and faire.

I hope I answer to some doubt.
Ciao
jacopo

Dear Members of the Metagovernment list,

I would like to bring to your attention a liquid democracy project that is currently taking shape thanks to the effort of United Vote. I am in no way affiliated with this organization, but I do think it is a great and badly needed initiative. The project is very real, there are candidates who are running for office on a liquid democracy platform developed by United Vote. To my knowledge, this is the most significant attempt at infusing liquid democracy into the US politics. United Vote site lets you vote on any congressional bill, either directly or via proxies. The votes of constituents are used to grade their representatives with the goal of creating transparent accountability records. This is only the first phase of the project. The second phase will aim at making the votes binding by electing candidates that will pledge to follow the decisions of their constituencies.

I encourage you to take a look at the site, better yet register, better yet get ID verified to start voting, delegating or becoming a delegate representing other people. You can get a good idea of how the site works even without registration. If you are not a US citizen you can still register to see the system from a user perspective. However, to become an eligible proxy (delegate) you would need to go through the ID verification.

You can discuss the project with its founder, David Ernst, for example, on Reddit.

Please share your opinion about the project and experience with the site.

Hi Scott,
I forgot what a pain this list was. I just made a post with a bunch of links, but cannot see any of them on the Metagovernment archive site. Can you see them? I made a couple of follow up posts, first including links differently, then asking a question on how to include URLs, both messages were blocked.

Thanks for posting this. I've added support at united.vote to the CC list
as sort of an invite to participate here.

Unfortunately I ran into a couple of deal breakers before I even
finished registration:

1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house
representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I
realized this...

2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a
serious Catch-22 issue, but IMHO you have to err on the side of not
putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this
means making the system security very weak. There'll be plenty of time
to add security later on, especially if the upgrade path is designed
in.

3) This project reminds me a lot of http://placeavote.com/ (now
defunct) and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes
(prioritizing authentication rather than the social
media/participation aspects, relying on US house/senate bills (which
are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them) instead
of custom proposals, etc.). That failure was a damned shame because
they had more money to burn (over $500K) than any other EDD project
I've investigated.

Given that I've done a relatively fresh critique of "Liquid Democracy"
for the DemocracyEarth project, I'll just link to that. Again, IMHO if
you're working in this area but don't have that Kling paper completely
memorized, or if you haven't built specific remedies for the flaws
they found in LQFB into your project, you're just wasting everyone's
time:

#1 and #7)

Frankly, this list is too obscure to expect people to come here. True, there is a small number of prolific and eloquent posters here. But their effort would be much better spent by discussing DD and LD elsewhere. Reddit would be by far a better place.

> 1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I realized this...
Do you even go out and vote in elections? If so, you do have preferences, which means you can select a better representative. "I trust exactly zero" ? Sorry, this is just BS.

> 2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a serious Catch-22 issue
What is the problem? You do not want to pay $1 or you do not have a separate credit card with a small credit limit for situations like this? Sorry, this is just BS.

> but IMHO you have to err on the side of not putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this means making the system security very weak.
You should really talk to people outside of this list to learn what they think about such an attitude. Your site is polluted by bot votes. Is that your preference?

It means you do not get it. PlaceAVote had exactly zero LD implemented. LD is central to United Vote.

A real world aspect of the system is good, not bad. I do not want to vote on giving more rights to primates (your toy bill).

LD addresses this. And you are making a mistake of trying to change the world to fit your tool, as apposed to designing a tool suitable for the real world. I agree with Matteo on that.

Found this link on the DemocracyEarth Github project:
https://jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/download/471/404

It describes the operation of Rousseau by the Italian Five Star
Movement. Looks to me like despite managing to achieve significant
market penetration (140K+ users) participation rates are so low (on
the order 10-15%) that IMHO it is essentially useless as a means of
assessing The Will of The People. There are many other useful
criticisms of the tool in that paper, but I believe it misses what is
probably the most important one which I also consider to be the single
largest flaw in LQFB: It really only works on proposals generated from
within the party, not on proposals the party's elected representatives
must vote on that were introduced by members of other parties. This
IMHO is just one more nail in the coffin of the "work within the
system" philosophy.

Subject: [MG] Democratizing Blockchain Governance in Versioning
Message-ID: <4F569314-F78F-4524-A1FD-DA3F167B17EE@metagovernment.org>

There is an antidemocratic governance problem in cryptocurrencies as they exist now. When a new iteration of a cryptocurrency?s software is introduced, it becomes established when the majority of nodes switch to that new iteration. This node-based governance method biases the system toward monied influence because individuals and organizations with more financial capital can support a greater number of nodes, a problem that is compounded by increasing centralization of mining due to the advent of massive ASIC data centers.

Put simply, the problem is that the ?voting? rule for version-adoption is one vote per computer rather than one vote per individual. There is a need for a cryptocurrency governance system in which software evolves according to democratic will, i.e., the preferences of the majority or consensus of individual users.

I suspect that part of the solution is to build a mechanism for both decision-making and version-control that is programmed right into the blockchain?s code. Ideally this mechanism would be built so deeply into the code that it cannot be refused by nodes. But this is just my guess, and I can?t figure out how it would take shape while maintaining the decentralized and secure nature of crypto. I am hoping that this group might be able to hash out a better solution.

Ideas?


P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which details this exact problem:
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610018/bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-a-hidden-power-structure-and-its-just-been-revealed/ <https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610018/bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-a-hidden-power-structure-and-its-just-been-revealed/>

P.P.S. Sorry I haven?t been around much; but I am still caught up in my personal projects. Though I am increasingly convinced that cryptocurrency is the most promising avenue to democratizing governance. It just would help to figure out the above. :)

Brilliant! These are the kinds of marketing opportunities you just
can't buy. Unfortunately I'm not ready to take advantage of this one
because proxyfor.me is sleeping while I perform surgery on it...

The two big wins are:
1) It reinforces the belief in The People that you actually *can*
predict someone's preferences and behavior using data you collect
about them.

2) It clearly demonstrates why shared logins with social media
services are a really bad idea. In the case (though the article isn't
nearly as clear about this as it should have been) what the data
provided was a way to identify likely Trump voters so that the Trump
campaign could manipulate them into acting as "recruitment bots"
(using them to spread information (and in many cases disinformation)
about both of the presidential candidates).

I'll have to add this example to the documentation to help people
really understand why they'll want to use different names for the
proxyfor.me account any other service they use. It's going to be
pretty embarrassing for those who will come to be known as "Chumps for
Trump", especially when that looming shitstorm that will bring him
down hits...

Not at all: I can certainly pick "the lesser of two evils", but
expanding that to "the lesser of 535 evils" is hardly an improvement,
especially when if you did a cluster analysis on the voting records of
the 535 it would probably collapse down to less than a handful of
choices, none of which are anything like me (because people like me
don't run for office). Why should I have to settle for the "lesser of
4 evils" if we're going to all the trouble to create a new system?

Ever hear of "identity theft"? Who are these guys to ask for some of
my most sensitive financial information? And no, I don't have a "small
limit" card for something like this, and frankly I'd have to
discourage anyone else from doing things like that because it's just a
really bad idea: Having someone's full credit card info gives a lot
more capability than just maxing out that credit card. If I had to do
something like this I'd do what PayPal and the other on-line banks do
(make a small deposit into a person's bank account and require them to
verify the number). PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a
very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. I still
like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter
rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one
actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily
detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).

You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you
take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just
made-up data used for bootstrapping. But I will admit that bot attacks
from outside are a real problem and I struggled a bit before coming up
with a reliable solution to the attacks on the Matchism forums.
Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts
promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia,
BTW, but stopping the attacks was trivial once I figured out all
"captcha" tests had been cracked: All you have to is ask a very simple
question that the scripts that those bot farms use can't answer. Sure,
we'll need something more sophisticated once a site becomes popular
enough that people actually start to see real power in it, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it.

That's the only difference, though, and hardly enough to make it
usable by "normies". I really tried to use PlaceAVote but even I, a
real policy wonk, couldn't get past the horrible writing of the bills
that appeared on it. Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At
some point you have trust people elected using the old system to
follow the new one. I for one believe it's naive to think that will
ever actually happen: The only way we're going to get power is to take
it, not beg the existing governments to give it to us.

I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US
congress votes on. They're horrible! I've run some of them through
Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels
above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is
*two* PhDs ;-) The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate
enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied
the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really
interested in?

IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by
working inside the system. For example the entire technology business
is now based on the kind "disruption" that is impossible to achieve if
you're willing to accept the legal and social constraints The Powers
That Be would try to impose on you. A study of how the various
communist, fascist, anti-colonial, and Arab Spring revolutions were
achieved one comes away with a clear impression that toppling a
government is a lot easier than you'd think. And I imagine it'll be
even easier when you have a complete and functional replacement
already up and running when you ask people to make the switch.

Yeah, and that's really the least of the problems, the biggest one
being that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. I have yet
to see anyone answer even my most basic questions as why blockchain
provides anything useful at all to EDD:

1) Since you have to trust the executive branch to actually
*implement* any of the decisions made using the system, why is it so
much to ask to trust it to run the decisionmaking system itself?

2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
the vote data?

3) Even if you don't believe #2 is a requirement (and I'd like to see
the handwaving you'll need to do to come up with an alternative that
supports delegation), surely having the ability to verify your *own*
vote in a centrally managed system is sufficient to detect tampering
by the executive branch?

4) To operate at scale, the system must be able to manage billions of
transactions in a relatively short period of time (certainly less than
24 hours). No blockchain system can do this, a flaw that is
fundamental to the design of the architecture. How do you propose to
get around this?

And just to round out the collection, I *also* happen to believe that
blockchain is inappropriate to even use for "currency" for reasons #1
and #4 and furthermore because it effectively prohibits implementation
of "fiat currency", a tool that is necessary to manage the economy
(inflation, recession, etc.) IMHO blockchain's only use is as
commodity to be used for speculation (actually, I'd just call it
gambling), maybe as a way of reducing the risk of criminal activity,
and definitely as a way to waste a whole lot of energy thereby making
it a significant contributor to climate change. It's simply delusional
think about it as being "money".

Actually the *most* amazing thing about blockchain is how completely
obvious people are to the fact that it only has any value because we
*believe* it has value, and yet that is the very same belief process
that allows governments to exist. Why is it so hard to believe that we
can change or replace the government if you can believe in something
that is far more fantastical like the "value" of a bitcoin?

You probably only looked at r/liquiddemocracy and r/DirectDemocracy . They happened to be small, but the topics of LD and DD are often discussed in different subs: r/democracy and r/futuristparty . They have many more posts than this list. You guys sometimes are going for weeks without a message. I think their people are much more likely to stumble upon your sub and join a discussion. But maybe I am wrong. Do you have many newcomers here? I was not following for the last 1.5 years.


> Not at all: I can certainly pick "the lesser of two evils", but expanding that to "the lesser of 535 evils" is hardly an improvement,
You see no difference between 2 choices and 535 choices? That's new to me. I though that N+M choices are always better (or not worse) than N choices. Plus your delegates are not at all limited to the congress members. You can delegate to anyone. If you succeed in properly registering, I will include you in my list of delegates. Promise.

I absolutely see a huge difference between 2 and hundreds of choices. Many other people do too. Your opinion is a bit atypical.
You can also vote directly.

> Ever hear of "identity theft"? Who are these guys to ask for some of my most sensitive financial information? 

Should I stop using online banking and online purchasing now? Or what? I am using it all the time. Still doing fine.

> PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. 

I do not remember that. You may be confusing something. PlaceAVote did not have an ID verification, they only had plans for it.

> I still like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).
If you allow people to create multiple accounts it completely invalidate any results your system produces.

> You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just made-up data used for bootstrapping. 

Are the bots yours? Do you have trouble finding human users? I remember how you were predicting that you would have hundreds of user right after you launch your system. What happened?

> Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia, BTW, 

"BTW" :) Is it my fault somehow? You are the one who takes security as an afterthought.

> Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At some point you have trust people elected using the old system to

Far higher chances than for a matchism-like system succeeding, IMHO.

This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

> They're horrible! I've run some of them through Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is *two* PhDs ;-)
That is why you may need representatives who can explain the bills to other people. This happens all the time in real live. You resort to opinion of experts all the time (doctor office, car repair, etc), but you are free to choose an expert or change it at any time.

> The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really interested in?
You are again trying to change the world to fit your tool. Many bills are bound to be technical and hard to understand. Just like when doctors discuss among themselves how to treat your illness, you might not understand most of their conversation.

> IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by working inside the system. 

Lots of changes were achieved by evolution. I will live a revolution to you.

I am not asking for the solution to all the problems of blockchain. There are many. And that?s because it is in it's absolute infancy, compared to banking and government, which are extremely mature and nuanced. Blockchain has a lot of issues to work out, so the code needs to be able to evolve.

So for the code to evolve best, it should be done democratically. That?s why I asked my question. How can the evolution of the code happen through a democratic process, instead of being controlled by whomever controls the most nodes?


Regarding your points:
1. I don?t understand this. What does the executive branch have to do with cryptocurrency, which is inherently global?
2. Open voting isn?t necessarily a problem with governance of the versioning of crypto (share whatever ideas you have for this, please); but that is entirely separate from the trust relationships in currency exchanges.
3. This isn?t about some executive branch. It?s about who decides which version of software to run for any particular cryptocurrency.
4. Someone else?s problem. There are already more evolved chains like holochain in development.
As for the value of crypto; remember that gold was the standard for ages, and it has no inherent value either. There?s no point debating this; there are tons of articles about it and it?s not relevant to this question. I want to see crypto evolve in a democratic way so that it can turn into something that is much, much better than blockchain. That?s all I?m asking about.

This is a problem all open source developers face. AFAIK it always
comes down to a trusted individual/team that makes the final call. In
proxyfor.me ultimately it will be the executive branch and if the
people don't like they just vote up the "replace the manager" proposal
and start over with a new one.

It has to do with the supposed benefit primary benefit of blockchain
which is that it's distributed. But my claim is that is no benefit at
all because the *implementation* of a decision has to be accomplished
by the executive branch (i.e., a central authority). And if you trust
the executive to actually do what you tell them, why is it so hard to
trust them to run the decisionmaking system itself? Poof: the supposed
main advantage of blockchain disappears in a puff of smoke.

If you're not using encryption to hide the votes, why do you need
blockchain at all?

Are we talking about a monetary system or a decisionmaking system?

You don't worry even a little about investing a lot of time and effort
into something that has a huge fundamental flaw that turns out to be
unsolvable? I prefer to have the whole design in my head before I
start working on something, thank you very much...

r/democracy is busy, but mostly not related to decisionmaking systems.
The others are about as active as this list (which is to say, not very

You apparently didn't understand my comment: There *aren't* 535
choices as most of those people vote the equivalent of party line.
Other than a few wingnuts like Rand Paul and Bernie that I'd likely
each assign some weight to if I could split by topic area (Paul for
defense, Bernie for social program reform, Warren for regulation,
etc.) I don't see any benefit to being able to delegate to any of
them. Indeed, things would certainly be worse if I had to delegate all
my votes to any one of those three...

Braver man than I: I can count the number of companies that have my
credit card on one hand. I use Paypal for everything else, but even
then avoid buying anything from a site I don't already know (I buy a
lot of stuff through small-fry through ebay and amazon, of course, but
then, they never get my payment info). Life is too short to spend
weeks or months of it trying to undo an identity theft.

In a fully operational system, sure. But how do you get there if you
turn most people off before they even get to the main site? Do you
think Avaaz and change.org lose sleep over this? I don't plan to
either: As long as we avoid obvious gaming of the system we can have
both low barriers to entry *and* some faith in the outcome of the
decisions actually being representative. I expect to add challenges
gradually, like making people reply to one of the weekly emails or log
into the system to keep their account active, or maybe forcing them to
make a comment or citation once in awhile if they don't do this by
habit: Once they're on the site there's all kinds of things we can
check to make sure it's not a bot or hacker casting votes.

Mostly I stopped marketing it when I discovered some fundamental flaws
in the design of Angular 2 having to do with routing (it was basically
impossible to route people to specific proposals using a URL, a
necessary feature to market it to issue-based voters). That limitation
in Angular has been fixed now, but I haven't had the time to port to
the newest release of it yet.

Far higher chance of it becoming as popular (or more) than LQFB or
Rousseau, for sure. But history is littered with products and
movements that didn't actually ever really amount to anything because
of fundamental flaws that their creators didn't see or weren't able to
fix. Go big or go home, I say. If it takes me 20 or 30 years for all
these half-assed attempts to fail and proxyfor.me to rise to the top,
that's fine. My father (a social psychologist) actually ran a system
like proxyfor.me (albeit matching people to existing representatives
rather than to each other) back in the 1970s because he recognized
even back then that people are incapable of picking appropriate
representatives for themselves. He's helped me with this one some
because here it is more than 40 years later and he still hasn't given
up hope that eventually people will see the light ;-)

Ah, an elitist. Attitudes like that display a profound ignorance about
how the world actually works. Certainly anyone that trusts a doctor to
diagnose anything more complicated than the common cold is a fool:
They're certainly less trustworthy even than car mechanics are (and
that ain't saying much). Don't get me started on this because one of
the things that's been taking up enormous amount of my time the past
few months has been both my wife's and my doctor's failures to
properly diagnose and treat endocrine/hormone problems we have (e.g.,
in her case I believe that probably 90% of the cases of Hashimoto's
out there aren't diagnosed until too late and the thyroid has been
irreparably damaged or completely destroyed: My wife, on the other
hand, thanks to my insistence on going outside the insurance system to
get a proper diagnosis and treatment, is getting treatment early
enough that we're hoping that the damage can actually be completely
reversed). I've also had a few close friends die of cancer recently
that should have been diagnosed months or even years earlier but their
doctors dropped the ball.

But back to the writing of bills, I submit you're naive about them as
well: It's not that they're just inherently hard to understand, it's
that they're *intentionally* hard to understand because that's part of
how gaming the system works in misrepresentative democracy. The trick
is to make them so hard to follow that most people give up such that
the author can easily manipulate people into voting for something they
don't really understand based on trust/charm/log rolling/etc.

As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests
and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have
the time to invest in understanding them that I do. And on the rare
occasion they do order extra tests its invariably to cover their asses
in case I die rather than because they actually understand what is
required to diagnose or treat any particular disease.

And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you
think that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it
with an hour or so's effort. I've spent a *lot* of time doing this
kind of thing (my lawyers hate me as much as my doctors do ;-) and
haven't come across anything they've written that can't be vastly
simplified if they'd take the time (which of course not only do they
not have any incentive to do, they actually *benefit* by making things
more complicated because of the job security it provides).

In politics?  I can't think of anything, really. Certainly our current
governments work no better now than they did 200 years ago. And this
despite massive improvements in technology that should have made
everything much better.  Trump and our current polarized do-nothing
congress I think are convincing evidence that government is actually
*worse* now than it was 200 years ago, at least in the US.

Not everything has to be debated here. The issues you raise are debated all over the internet, and it?s pointless to overrun my question with these topics, when it is a legitimate and serious question. Please leave room for others to comment.

Most people know nothing of crypto. Many people such as your self are very skeptical to varying degrees. And many people are investing billions of dollars worth of resources and enormous effort into it. If you disagree with that last group of people, then I guess you don?t need to chime in on this thread. That?s okay.

That?s what I?m asking for: a better solution than benign authoritarianism. Crypto was designed to be decentralized and therefore democratized, and it faces an issue of not being able to democratize in how it evolves. People want to solve this, and I?m asking this group for help thinking of solutions to this. 

In other words, I?m asking for brainstorming, not debate on tangential issues.

i just do not believe Scott point number

2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
the vote data?

after the legislation and administrative decision are  done collectively
only administrator will be necessary
I believe that models like proxyforme can actually help make it easier to
streamline decision making and eliminate delegate.
AI delegation is the next big think not human

Hey, you were the one that brought up blockchain as if it had

don't have answers to fundamental questions about how it would work or

How big is the gambling industry? Is that any correlation with its

You gotta have a brain and at least some passing familiarity with the
technology to brainstorm about it. Since you can't respond to even my
most basic questions about how blockchain is relevant to
decisionmaking, I too wonder why you even brought it up...

Maybe, but we're a *long* way from having that technology so I believe
using other people as proxies is a necessary intermediate step. Plus,
even if we had the technology ready, jumping directly to "AI
benevolent dictator" would be a very difficult sell, marketingwise.
One step at a time...

So, even you can find it useful. Delegation by topics is not currently implemented, I think it should, and hope it will be. But again, it is not limited to the members of Congress. Anyone can be your delegate.

What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV? This may end in an embarassement.

Great story. Too bad such a system looks too opaque for me to ever want to use.

> And you're saying you prefer them to the example proposals in proxyfor.me? Who's a liar now?
I was not saying anything about proxyforme. I only said your statement of me never carefully looking at congressional bills was absolutely false. Basically, a lie.

> Don't get me started on this because one of the things that's been taking up enormous amount of my time the past few months has been both my wife's and my doctor's failures to properly diagnose and treat endocrine/hormone problems we have (e.g., in her case I believe that probably 90% of the cases of Hashimoto's out there aren't diagnosed until too late and the thyroid has been irreparably damaged or completely destroyed: My wife, on the other hand, thanks to my insistence on going outside the insurance system to get a proper diagnosis and treatment, is getting treatment early enough that we're hoping that the damage can actually be completely reversed). I've also had a few close friends die of cancer recently that should have been diagnosed months or even years earlier but their doctors dropped the ball.
Sorry to hear about your calamities, but very deep level of involvement is not suitable for most people. Even you were not running the tests on your own, though you had to switch (or nudge?) your doctor. More like switching a representative when you do not trust him/her.

> As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have the time to invest in understanding them that I do. And on the rare occasion they do order extra tests its invariably to cover their asses in case I die rather than because they actually understand what is required to diagnose or treat any particular disease.
Your are atypical. You would be a great delegate who is digging for truth and can help other people understand it.

> And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you think that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it with an hour or so's effort.
Do you see a difference between being able and wanting to do something? In most cases I will not have time to do it. Occasionally? Quite possible.

As I see it, following Cambridge Analytica's breach of the public trust, people are going to be even more reluctant to hand over their *personality* data to any online database. In another thread you mentioned how little you?re willing to trust anyone with your credit card data; how is this different from giving out your personality data? You can always change your credit card numbers...but once your personality data has been compromised, there?s no taking that back. It seems to me your entire design relies heavily on a level of public *trust* that just doesn?t exist, and likely won?t for some time to come.

It's *completely* different: If my identity is compromised I could
lose thousands of dollars, the ability to do anything that requires a
good credit score (buy a house or car, rent an apartment, etc.), and
will have to waste dozens or hundreds of hours trying to fix it. If my
personality profile gets out about all I have to fear is that Trump's
team (or the Russians, or whoever) will target me with ads that
encourage me to spread fake news.

No, it only requires that people realize that the rest of us already
know what your personality is (even if you don't take the test, I can
tell just by looking at your posts/likes/etc.) so there's no point in
even trying to hide this stuff. And there's really no danger to
disclosing it other than maybe making it easier for advertisers to
target you. In which case the problem is with our blind acceptance of
advertising as a social engineering tool and there's no point in
quibbling over minor tweaks in how effective it is...

But only if they vote, which was one of the problems that caused LQFB
to fail to work: Too few people delegated, and when they did, they
often delegated to people who didn't vote (dead end) or were simply
poor choices (because the delegate had a poor vote correlation).

Delegating by domain could potentially allow a smaller pool to provide
better representation, I'd agree, but at the expense of vastly more
complexity and even lower likelihood that the delegates you end up
choosing would actually cast a "correct vote" for you. It also
promotes the delusion that people are capable of choosing good
representatives when all the evidence says that they simply aren't
able to do this this (references in the proxyfor.me help system).

Not cowardice exactly, but I'm all about enjoying my leisure time
(i.e., just lazy enough to want to expend a little effort to save
myself a lot of work down the road).

Like FB (the matching algorithms for which are vastly more
complicated) or indeed the vast majority of our other technology you
don't have to understand it to find it useful. In your case I'd assume
that you'll just rely on others to actually take the time to
understand how it works and raise the red flag if there's something to
be worried about. Not that any of our efforts to show how dangerous FB
is have gained much traction...

Hey, it was you that made the comparison that they were "better"
somehow than the ones in proxyfor.me. If you want to walk that back,
no problem.

I did have to change doctors. Twice. And it is sort of similar to
changing representatives, but it's actually more like proxyfor.me
where the calculated vote is only a default suggestion that can be
easily overridden by casting a direct vote (take charge of your own
health!). This simply isn't an option in any of these "within the
system" proposals. Even in the Rousseau system (Italian Five Star
Movement) they have a lot of problem with "representatives" failing to
do what they're directed to do, and they even have a contract with a
$100K plus penalty to handle this situation.  United.vote doesn't even
have that, or any faint hope of gaining anything like it.

Great: That's exactly what all these delegate/representative systems
are designed to support. But (another) difference between proxyfor.me
and all the others is that there are social engineering techniques
applied to the bill/proposal creators to provide an incentive to make
the proposals the best they can be (both effective *and*
intelligible). The others seem to not even recognize that this is a
serious issue: LQFB proposals were of uniformly poor quality, as is
the case for most of the petitions on sites like change.org and
avaaz.org. US congressional bills are much better in the "effective"
area, but at the very high cost of being mostly unintelligible, even
if you're a lawyer.  You can have both, but you need to structure the
system such that it provides incentives to ensure this.

Imagine this: Every bill proposed in the US congress has a "score"
that everyone who reads it can contribute to. Maybe 50% on readability
50% on estimated effectiveness (number of loopholes, etc.). The author
of the top-rated proposal each month/session/whatever gets some sort
of bonus. It'd also be a great item to use in your re-election
campaign. But now we voters don't even keep track of how many bills
any member even introduces, let alone gets passed, let alone how often
a law needed to be revised because it had flaws that didn't become
apparent until they started implementing it...

Of course I read your paragraph. Do you understand difference between what people promise and what they do?
Now answer my questions, do not ignore them: What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV?

Again, do not be a liar. If you do not know how to quote I can do it for you:
Scott: > I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US congress votes on.

Me: This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

Sorry Scott, it is better just to stop this discussion.

PS: do not answer the questions I asked you to answer. It is pointless and only brings frustration.

I don't see why: It's mostly stuff that's directly relevant to that
project. But since apparently none of us has received a response I
think it's safe to assume that they're not interested in discussing
their project.

My recollection is that they did, mostly because I remember thinking
how expensive it must have been, but I'll admit that my recollection
is fuzzy because this was many years ago and I only spent an hour or
two playing with it. It's gone now anyway so it's kind of academic at
this point. They clearly *intended* to do snail-mail based
authentication. I intend to use public voter rolls. United.vote use of
credit cards seems to me to be worse than either of those because
many, if not most, people (including myself) simply won't do it. Even
worse, and I Iooked this up, even in the US fully 30% of adults don't
even *have* a credit card! By comparison less than 10% aren't
registered to vote and that percentage is significantly lower in some
states (those with same day registration, motor/voter, etc.) I've also
been thinking that getting teenagers involved is a crucial target
market: Even in the US less than 20% of people under the age of 18
have a credit card. Again, like voter fraud, obsessing about fake
accounts before it's even been shown to be an issue is just shooting
yourself in the foot IMHO.

Yeah, but you did it wrong: You didn't go back far enough. Here's the
relevant statement you made:

This clearly implies that you prefer the impenetrable bills the US
congress deals with to something simpler and yet still very relevant
to the operation of the modern world. This means you'd prefer
something like the following because it's "real world":
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text

Hint: It's the most recently passed bill by the US Senate. It's 30,132
words and according to MS Word's readability check has a reading ease
of 23 (out of 100) and a grade level of 16 (college graduate). And
that's after ignoring hundreds of grammatical errors. And I'll
guarantee you that not a single member of the House or Senate has or
will ever read the entire thing (they have staff for that, albeit most
of them will only check a few sections of it to make sure their pet
project isn't affected somehow). And this is far from the worst
example I could have picked (take a look at a budget bill sometime if
you really want to be horrified). Which is why I maintain that using
*anything* produced by our existing misrepresentative democracies as
input into an EDD will doom that project.

One problem I can think of is the deletion / censoring of data, this 
needs to be externally monitored and verified in a both centralized and 
decentralized systems. The crucial part being to witness in what order 
do additions to the immutable persistent storage happen, and maintain 
consensus of this. No proof of work needed, this is actually strange 
form of consistency, the cost of censoring/double-spend is merely 
related to the amount of money/hardware/energy you're willing to invest 
(probably within the budget of US/RUS military etc), rather than 
consensus on what changes happened when. I've made a proposal based on 
"proof of communicating witnesses" 
https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/issues/18#issuecomment-349709686 
but later on I found https://www.radixdlt.com/ which does essentially 
the same thing. Monitoring and maintaining consensus can be relatively 
fast and cheap, given the time it takes to calculate hashes and the 
round-trip-time latency of communicating this globally.

Alternatively, if simply distributed databases and a decentralized web 
is wanted, one can use https://datproject.org/ and 
https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/ as a gossip protocol. No blockchain needed. 
Can try it today with the https://beakerbrowser.com/

And I don't see a problem with distributed ledgers and democratic 
processes. Its up to people what system they use, not how many nodes a 
blockchain / consensus network has.

I hope the previous paragraph makes it clear that we need to monitor

Have you heard about directed acyclic graphs? E.g. the Tangle used in

They can scale much nicer than the traditional blockchain with nakamoto

Fiat currency or quite similar systems can for sure be built on 
distributed immutable log like systems as long as the participants agree 
on the rules. You can do it without any 
proof-of-work/stake/space/elapsed-time, if a web of trust exists among 
the actors taking part of the economy.
E.g. https://duniter.org/en/ implements the Universal Dividend, as 
specified by the theory called Relative Money Theory.

While something doesn't have universal acceptance as a method of 
payment, or sufficiently easy liquidity, it shouldn't be considered 
"actual" money. And in no case does it have any value like assets or 
commodities do, you cannot estimate the value of them or predict if the 
current irrational market price is above or below that value, only 
speculate on the future exchange rates of the limited collectible(s). 
Essentially the difference between investments and trading, the tools 
used in one fail miserably in the other.

Clearly the citizenry is capable of producing good and actionable ideas, as seen with the Lafontaine Park plan, and clearly it?s better to listen before than to deal with the firestorm of post-proposal punditry.

So why not take steps towards meaningful consultation, with a modern spin? For all the talk about technology and smartphones driving us apart, maybe we can finally find a way for them to make us more cohesive.

Oh, and if this sounds far-fetched and idyllic, a U.K.-based company has been toying with a similar concept for a few years. In Scandinavia, in-depth public consultation is the norm when it comes to urban planning.

It?s doable. The question is whether we as a society want to actively participate in shaping our city.

It will be interesting to see how this develops. Looks like they intend to have some sort of crowdsourced policy-making platform.

https://joincivil.com

The Civil Constitution

Civil is founded on the principle that a free and open press is an essential element of the foundation of a free, fair, and just society; and in the belief that global change in technology, economics, and politics have altered the basic conditions that provide for its fulfillment of that purpose.

Civil?s platform is intended to be operated and governed by its participants?citizens and journalists alike?while protecting Civil?s core values and purpose. Civil is a community with a specific purpose and an ethical position?these establish the side-constraints on the operational and governing power of the community over individuals and groups within it. Therefore the Civil Journalism Ethics Guideline, a constitution that lays out Civil?s core values and purpose.

Specific interpretations of the core values and purpose will be the work of the community, operating according to a transparent governing framework. That framework will include provisions for the community to change this document as needed to better promote the core values and purpose of Civil.

Argh: More blockchain hammers looking for nails.

I do agree that they've accurately identified one of the core problems
of modern civilization: Advertizing as funding model is inefficient,
ineffective, too susceptible to corruption, and IMHO immoral because
it relies on amateur social engineers whose job it is to manipulate
people without supervision, regulation, or even any sort of ethical
standards. But what they've proposed instead is just to turn
journalism into another type of charity which just makes the core
funding problem even worse.

My proposed solution is a government budgeting system that has the
ability to fund *all* types of organizations that The People decide
provide a community benefit. Journalism would of course be one of
these, but you don't need any baroque blockchain system to ensure that
the good ones get supported and the bad ones fade away, you just need
to have all of them shown in a list and have The People (and of course
in my system just a small subset of them) just pick those they want
some of their tax dollars to go to. This gets around the underfunded
charity problem because we will collectively decide what percentage of
the government budget goes to each class of charity and popularity and
*individual* citizen evaluation will be used to divvy up the pie. Sure
this means that some of your tax dollars are going to be going to
organizations that have an ideological slant that might differ from
yours, but at least you'll know that your fellow citizens are deciding
that and that its not just some oligarchs or activerts who have
figured out how to game the system. Plus it doesn't require all
existing organizations to change their entire operations to fit a new
model: All they have to do is fire their advertising/fundraising
departments...

It's also too bad that they cite Wikipedia as model of good
governance. My experience has been quite the opposite: IMHO overt
corruption and bias is a fundamental component of Wikipedia precisely
because there *is* no public input into the process and so it ends up
being the same kind of "government by the activerts" that I think has
been convincingly shown (by misrepresentative democracy) to not work.

    Scott

Mine either...

> I'm interested in reading some of the ones that were selected.

Me too although I expect that I'm going to find them very
disappointing based on who the judges are: Given that they're all
"work within the system" types their preferences are going to be far
too conservative and none of them are likely to have a
social-engineering perspective on things.

It's well done (albeit with too many typos and awkward phrasings, but
neither I nor the judges would be likely to hold that against them),
and I really like the way they've used the Gitbooks platform.

> Haven't fully examined it yet but figured might be something worth

Agreed.  Here's my take on it:

1) The deal breaker: Voluntary delegation with no assist in even
identifying appropriate proxies. We've already seen how that doesn't
work (both in the LQFB system and in the Google liquid voting system).

2) No correction for SDAPs and their much higher interest in being
"representatives" (i.e., the people who will end up running things are
the same people we have now).

3) I don't think I follow the required 1% "membership" fee. 1% of
average income should be more than enough to run the government itself
but does that mean that to join the "parks" group I've got to pony up
$300 (1% of the average income in the US)? If I don't come up with the
$300 I don't get to vote on anything?

4) The voting system is underspecified. Voting seems to be open (no
secret ballot), but there is no mention of this or who and how they do
the counts or the authentication.

All in all it seems to me to be no improvement over what we have now
other than sort of implying that the international level is a
representative democracy that works the same as all lower levels.

Oh well, at least it's not based on blockchain ;-)

I even mention in my proposal proxyforme!

 "although I expect that I'm going to find them very
disappointing based on who the judges are: Given that they're all
"work within the system" types "


I took the time to actually read what L?szl? Szombatfalvy had to say in his
first book and I think he'd be very dissapointed to know the actual judges
mostly all had such limited views on what he'd called "NEW shapes contest".

Rather than just whining about it, I want to gather participants who's
entries were disqualified for the wrong reasons, and write a group message
to Mr. Szombatfalvy

If you're interested in that shoot me an email directly

As well as claiming to be able to integrate several other projects.
Pretty ambitious ;-)

But I'm kind of surprised they didn't just disqualify you for
providing identifying information: I had to work pretty hard to scrub
my entry of this kind of thing (e.g., not being able to cite the
Matchism Manifesto or link to the papers on that site was a major
hurdle). The "enumerati" entry cited several on-line sources which is
something I scrupulously avoid doing (they're not refereed journals,
many of them have advertising that could be problematic, and sites
like those disappear or get reorganized frequently which leads to
broken links).

> Attached for your review.
> I spotted few error, please be considerate i learn English on my own.

It's no problem: The meaning is clear and I'd guess that the GCF saw a
lot entries with less than perfect English and so has had to make
accommodation for that (indeed most of the judges seem to be
non-native English speakers and so in many cases probably didn't even
notice the awkward patterns in these entries). Keep in mind that I'm
always happy to take a look at things like this and provide feedback
and/or editing.

My take on yours:
1) I go back and forth on using FB, G+, etc. credentials for login. It
does speed the early adoption process, but IMHO also taints even your
early results because everyone knows people with multiple accounts,
fake names, etc. and they should not be reminded of this *every time*
they use the system. It's also going to be a nightmare to add
independent authentication later (someone will have to manually go in
and approve each transition to an internal authentication system). I'm
still of the opinion that the way proxyfor.me works is the best: A
pseudonym is used, but it exists independently of the name used
elsewhere. Not only does this make adding true authentication later on
straightforward, it also affords people the option of true anonymity
if they decide to enforce this (by not sharing their screen name
outside the platform). In fact I'm working on an automatic generation
system for the names to even more firmly push for keeping your
proxyfor.me name separate from the names you use on social media
platforms.

2) Ooops, you used the blockchain buzzword ;-)

3) It doesn't seem to meet the "guaranteed decision" criteria. Both
proxyfor.me (which I called MPADD (Matched Proxy Augmented Direct
Democracy) in my entry) and the enumerati entry do meet this
requirement.

4) I don't see the path from local to global adoption and effect, and
you even explicitly state that your system cannot overcome
obstructionism from existing government officials. But wasn't this
path the *core* of what the competition was about?

    Scott

The Global Challenges Foundation Newsletter states it "will make available a database of the top submissions for...the public to read, examine and improve.?

I?m anxious to review and evaluate the entries that are made available to see if they can be morphed, combined, or synthesized into some synergistic, single platform or system. (Unless of course by some stroke of genius one of them stands alone as being up to the task.) Beyond critiquing the *individual* submissions, perhaps it will be possible to cobble together bits and pieces of various entries into a single (more) comprehensive or workable design.

I believe that putting together the best ideas is the key, decisions must
be addressed with specific criteria depending on the subject matter.
lets say we need to generate a very articulate proposal, then I will
consider a platform based on Airesis. But the shortcoming in Airesis is
that it give to much power to the redactor, by using vilfredo I can have
redactors that need to go through a consensus process for the paragraph
that need to be integrated in the proposal, once the proposal is completed
with different solution and must go to the vote, people can choose to cast
their vote or having a proxyforme AI type of engine do it.
If the decision is an amount (example, a compensation for x service) a
median like algorithm engine can be used.
I envision also a  multilanguage real time translating service when the
decision is between two or more states.
Responding to some of Scott's remarks, I believe that even if participants
access with their G or FB account they must be registered unequivocal
users. The blockchain or other crypto is not necessary because the system
is centralized but it may be used as proof of identity.
I believe the system should be transparent and community controlled and the
state government as we know today will be outlaw.
Somewhere it must start and the process is not straight forward otherwise
will be a revolution and from a revolution cannot start the implementation
of a fully democratic process.
We must go stage by stage, regarding local to global this is also a process
and I believe will be happening once the model is proven doing good
somewhere, then people will start to demand to use it more and more. But we
are entering into fanta-politics and I prefer to concentrate in practical,
user-friendly,  well defined method, understandable by all, usable by all,
accessible platform, secure and faire.

I hope I answer to some doubt.
Ciao
jacopo

Dear Members of the Metagovernment list,

I would like to bring to your attention a liquid democracy project that is currently taking shape thanks to the effort of United Vote. I am in no way affiliated with this organization, but I do think it is a great and badly needed initiative. The project is very real, there are candidates who are running for office on a liquid democracy platform developed by United Vote. To my knowledge, this is the most significant attempt at infusing liquid democracy into the US politics. United Vote site lets you vote on any congressional bill, either directly or via proxies. The votes of constituents are used to grade their representatives with the goal of creating transparent accountability records. This is only the first phase of the project. The second phase will aim at making the votes binding by electing candidates that will pledge to follow the decisions of their constituencies.

I encourage you to take a look at the site, better yet register, better yet get ID verified to start voting, delegating or becoming a delegate representing other people. You can get a good idea of how the site works even without registration. If you are not a US citizen you can still register to see the system from a user perspective. However, to become an eligible proxy (delegate) you would need to go through the ID verification.

You can discuss the project with its founder, David Ernst, for example, on Reddit.

Please share your opinion about the project and experience with the site.

Hi Scott,
I forgot what a pain this list was. I just made a post with a bunch of links, but cannot see any of them on the Metagovernment archive site. Can you see them? I made a couple of follow up posts, first including links differently, then asking a question on how to include URLs, both messages were blocked.

Thanks for posting this. I've added support at united.vote to the CC list
as sort of an invite to participate here.

Unfortunately I ran into a couple of deal breakers before I even
finished registration:

1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house
representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I
realized this...

2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a
serious Catch-22 issue, but IMHO you have to err on the side of not
putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this
means making the system security very weak. There'll be plenty of time
to add security later on, especially if the upgrade path is designed
in.

3) This project reminds me a lot of http://placeavote.com/ (now
defunct) and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes
(prioritizing authentication rather than the social
media/participation aspects, relying on US house/senate bills (which
are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them) instead
of custom proposals, etc.). That failure was a damned shame because
they had more money to burn (over $500K) than any other EDD project
I've investigated.

Given that I've done a relatively fresh critique of "Liquid Democracy"
for the DemocracyEarth project, I'll just link to that. Again, IMHO if
you're working in this area but don't have that Kling paper completely
memorized, or if you haven't built specific remedies for the flaws
they found in LQFB into your project, you're just wasting everyone's
time:

Frankly, this list is too obscure to expect people to come here. True, there is a small number of prolific and eloquent posters here. But their effort would be much better spent by discussing DD and LD elsewhere. Reddit would be by far a better place.

> 1) Turns out I trust exactly zero of our senate or house representatives with my proxy. Yeah, even I was surprised when I realized this...
Do you even go out and vote in elections? If so, you do have preferences, which means you can select a better representative. "I trust exactly zero" ? Sorry, this is just BS.

> 2) Giving them my credit card is a non-starter. I realize this a serious Catch-22 issue
What is the problem? You do not want to pay $1 or you do not have a separate credit card with a small credit limit for situations like this? Sorry, this is just BS.

> but IMHO you have to err on the side of not putting unnecessary hurdles in front of participants even if this means making the system security very weak.
You should really talk to people outside of this list to learn what they think about such an attitude. Your site is polluted by bot votes. Is that your preference?


> 3) This project reminds me a lot of http://placeavote.com/ (now defunct) 

It means you do not get it. PlaceAVote had exactly zero LD implemented. LD is central to United Vote.

> and it seems to me is making some of the same mistakes relying on US house/senate bills 

A real world aspect of the system is good, not bad. I do not want to vote on giving more rights to primates (your toy bill).

> (which are impenetrable even to many of the people who vote on them) 

LD addresses this. And you are making a mistake of trying to change the world to fit your tool, as apposed to designing a tool suitable for the real world. I agree with Matteo on that.

> Given that I've done a relatively fresh critique of "Liquid Democracy" for the DemocracyEarth project, I'll just link to that. 

Thanks, I will check it later.

Found this link on the DemocracyEarth Github project:
https://jedem.org/index.php/jedem/article/download/471/404

It describes the operation of Rousseau by the Italian Five Star
Movement. Looks to me like despite managing to achieve significant
market penetration (140K+ users) participation rates are so low (on
the order 10-15%) that IMHO it is essentially useless as a means of
assessing The Will of The People. There are many other useful
criticisms of the tool in that paper, but I believe it misses what is
probably the most important one which I also consider to be the single
largest flaw in LQFB: It really only works on proposals generated from
within the party, not on proposals the party's elected representatives
must vote on that were introduced by members of other parties. This
IMHO is just one more nail in the coffin of the "work within the
system" philosophy.

Subject: [MG] Democratizing Blockchain Governance in Versioning
Message-ID: <4F569314-F78F-4524-A1FD-DA3F167B17EE@metagovernment.org>

There is an antidemocratic governance problem in cryptocurrencies as they exist now. When a new iteration of a cryptocurrency?s software is introduced, it becomes established when the majority of nodes switch to that new iteration. This node-based governance method biases the system toward monied influence because individuals and organizations with more financial capital can support a greater number of nodes, a problem that is compounded by increasing centralization of mining due to the advent of massive ASIC data centers.

Put simply, the problem is that the ?voting? rule for version-adoption is one vote per computer rather than one vote per individual. There is a need for a cryptocurrency governance system in which software evolves according to democratic will, i.e., the preferences of the majority or consensus of individual users.

I suspect that part of the solution is to build a mechanism for both decision-making and version-control that is programmed right into the blockchain?s code. Ideally this mechanism would be built so deeply into the code that it cannot be refused by nodes. But this is just my guess, and I can?t figure out how it would take shape while maintaining the decentralized and secure nature of crypto. I am hoping that this group might be able to hash out a better solution.

Ideas?


P.S. Interestingly, as I was writing this, a friend sent me an article which details this exact problem:
https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610018/bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-a-hidden-power-structure-and-its-just-been-revealed/ <https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610018/bitcoin-and-ethereum-have-a-hidden-power-structure-and-its-just-been-revealed/>

P.P.S. Sorry I haven?t been around much; but I am still caught up in my personal projects. Though I am increasingly convinced that cryptocurrency is the most promising avenue to democratizing governance. It just would help to figure out the above. :)

Brilliant! These are the kinds of marketing opportunities you just
can't buy. Unfortunately I'm not ready to take advantage of this one
because proxyfor.me is sleeping while I perform surgery on it...

The two big wins are:
1) It reinforces the belief in The People that you actually *can*
predict someone's preferences and behavior using data you collect
about them.

2) It clearly demonstrates why shared logins with social media
services are a really bad idea. In the case (though the article isn't
nearly as clear about this as it should have been) what the data
provided was a way to identify likely Trump voters so that the Trump
campaign could manipulate them into acting as "recruitment bots"
(using them to spread information (and in many cases disinformation)
about both of the presidential candidates).

I'll have to add this example to the documentation to help people

proxyfor.me account any other service they use. It's going to be

Not at all: I can certainly pick "the lesser of two evils", but
expanding that to "the lesser of 535 evils" is hardly an improvement,
especially when if you did a cluster analysis on the voting records of
the 535 it would probably collapse down to less than a handful of
choices, none of which are anything like me (because people like me
don't run for office). Why should I have to settle for the "lesser of
4 evils" if we're going to all the trouble to create a new system?

Ever hear of "identity theft"? Who are these guys to ask for some of
my most sensitive financial information? And no, I don't have a "small
limit" card for something like this, and frankly I'd have to
discourage anyone else from doing things like that because it's just a
really bad idea: Having someone's full credit card info gives a lot
more capability than just maxing out that credit card. If I had to do
something like this I'd do what PayPal and the other on-line banks do
(make a small deposit into a person's bank account and require them to
verify the number). PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a
very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. I still
like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter
rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one
actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily
detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).

You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you
take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just
made-up data used for bootstrapping. But I will admit that bot attacks
from outside are a real problem and I struggled a bit before coming up
with a reliable solution to the attacks on the Matchism forums.
Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts
promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia,
BTW, but stopping the attacks was trivial once I figured out all
"captcha" tests had been cracked: All you have to is ask a very simple
question that the scripts that those bot farms use can't answer. Sure,
we'll need something more sophisticated once a site becomes popular
enough that people actually start to see real power in it, but we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it.

That's the only difference, though, and hardly enough to make it
usable by "normies". I really tried to use PlaceAVote but even I, a
real policy wonk, couldn't get past the horrible writing of the bills
that appeared on it. Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At
some point you have trust people elected using the old system to
follow the new one. I for one believe it's naive to think that will
ever actually happen: The only way we're going to get power is to take
it, not beg the existing governments to give it to us.

I submit you haven't actually tried to read any of the bills the US
congress votes on. They're horrible! I've run some of them through
Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels
above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is
*two* PhDs ;-) The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate
enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied
the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really
interested in?

IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by
working inside the system. For example the entire technology business
is now based on the kind "disruption" that is impossible to achieve if
you're willing to accept the legal and social constraints The Powers
That Be would try to impose on you. A study of how the various
communist, fascist, anti-colonial, and Arab Spring revolutions were
achieved one comes away with a clear impression that toppling a
government is a lot easier than you'd think. And I imagine it'll be
even easier when you have a complete and functional replacement
already up and running when you ask people to make the switch.

Yeah, and that's really the least of the problems, the biggest one
being that blockchain is a solution in search of a problem. I have yet
to see anyone answer even my most basic questions as why blockchain
provides anything useful at all to EDD:

1) Since you have to trust the executive branch to actually
*implement* any of the decisions made using the system, why is it so
much to ask to trust it to run the decisionmaking system itself?

2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
the vote data?

3) Even if you don't believe #2 is a requirement (and I'd like to see
the handwaving you'll need to do to come up with an alternative that
supports delegation), surely having the ability to verify your *own*
vote in a centrally managed system is sufficient to detect tampering
by the executive branch?

4) To operate at scale, the system must be able to manage billions of
transactions in a relatively short period of time (certainly less than
24 hours). No blockchain system can do this, a flaw that is
fundamental to the design of the architecture. How do you propose to
get around this?

And just to round out the collection, I *also* happen to believe that
blockchain is inappropriate to even use for "currency" for reasons #1
and #4 and furthermore because it effectively prohibits implementation
of "fiat currency", a tool that is necessary to manage the economy
(inflation, recession, etc.) IMHO blockchain's only use is as
commodity to be used for speculation (actually, I'd just call it
gambling), maybe as a way of reducing the risk of criminal activity,
and definitely as a way to waste a whole lot of energy thereby making
it a significant contributor to climate change. It's simply delusional
think about it as being "money".

Actually the *most* amazing thing about blockchain is how completely
obvious people are to the fact that it only has any value because we
*believe* it has value, and yet that is the very same belief process
that allows governments to exist. Why is it so hard to believe that we
can change or replace the government if you can believe in something
that is far more fantastical like the "value" of a bitcoin?

You probably only looked at r/liquiddemocracy and r/DirectDemocracy . They happened to be small, but the topics of LD and DD are often discussed in different subs: r/democracy and r/futuristparty . They have many more posts than this list. You guys sometimes are going for weeks without a message. I think their people are much more likely to stumble upon your sub and join a discussion. But maybe I am wrong. Do you have many newcomers here? I was not following for the last 1.5 years.


> Not at all: I can certainly pick "the lesser of two evils", but expanding that to "the lesser of 535 evils" is hardly an improvement,
You see no difference between 2 choices and 535 choices? That's new to me. I though that N+M choices are always better (or not worse) than N choices. Plus your delegates are not at all limited to the congress members. You can delegate to anyone. If you succeed in properly registering, I will include you in my list of delegates. Promise.

I absolutely see a huge difference between 2 and hundreds of choices. Many other people do too. Your opinion is a bit atypical.
You can also vote directly.

> Ever hear of "identity theft"? Who are these guys to ask for some of my most sensitive financial information? 

Should I stop using online banking and online purchasing now? Or what? I am using it all the time. Still doing fine.

> PlaceAVote actually sent out letters to people, a very expensive proposition and not even all that fraud-proof. 

I do not remember that. You may be confusing something. PlaceAVote did not have an ID verification, they only had plans for it.

> I still like my proposal to just let people claim names off the public voter rolls because that at least limits the numbers of fake accounts one actor can set up (I do track times and IP addresses and so can easily detect a systematic attempt to create bogus accounts).
If you allow people to create multiple accounts it completely invalidate any results your system produces.

> You apparently missed the point of the bots (i.e., I recommend you take more than 2 minutes to read the help system): They're just made-up data used for bootstrapping. 

Are the bots yours? Do you have trouble finding human users? I remember how you were predicting that you would have hundreds of user right after you launch your system. What happened?

> Thousands of fake accounts were created, then thousands of fake posts promoting one product or another. Nearly all of them came from Russia, BTW, 

"BTW" :) Is it my fault somehow? You are the one who takes security as an afterthought.

> Plus, the proposed transition is the same: At some point you have trust people elected using the old system to

Far higher chances than for a matchism-like system succeeding, IMHO.

This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

> They're horrible! I've run some of them through Word's analysis tools and they frequently come out at grade levels above 20 (that's a PhD). I found one that came out a 25, which is *two* PhDs ;-)
That is why you may need representatives who can explain the bills to other people. This happens all the time in real live. You resort to opinion of experts all the time (doctor office, car repair, etc), but you are free to choose an expert or change it at any time.

> The samples currently on proxyfor.me are legitimate enough and far more interesting to most people. Have you ever studied the petition sites (change.org, etc.) to see what people are really interested in?
You are again trying to change the world to fit your tool. Many bills are bound to be technical and hard to understand. Just like when doctors discuss among themselves how to treat your illness, you might not understand most of their conversation.

> IMHO you can't have it both ways: No revolution has ever succeeded by working inside the system. 

Lots of changes were achieved by evolution. I will live a revolution to you.

I am not asking for the solution to all the problems of blockchain. There are many. And that?s because it is in it's absolute infancy, compared to banking and government, which are extremely mature and nuanced. Blockchain has a lot of issues to work out, so the code needs to be able to evolve.

So for the code to evolve best, it should be done democratically. That?s why I asked my question. How can the evolution of the code happen through a democratic process, instead of being controlled by whomever controls the most nodes?


Regarding your points:
1. I don?t understand this. What does the executive branch have to do with cryptocurrency, which is inherently global?
2. Open voting isn?t necessarily a problem with governance of the versioning of crypto (share whatever ideas you have for this, please); but that is entirely separate from the trust relationships in currency exchanges.
3. This isn?t about some executive branch. It?s about who decides which version of software to run for any particular cryptocurrency.
4. Someone else?s problem. There are already more evolved chains like holochain in development.
As for the value of crypto; remember that gold was the standard for ages, and it has no inherent value either. There?s no point debating this; there are tons of articles about it and it?s not relevant to this question. I want to see crypto evolve in a democratic way so that it can turn into something that is much, much better than blockchain. That?s all I?m asking about.

This is a problem all open source developers face. AFAIK it always
comes down to a trusted individual/team that makes the final call. In
proxyfor.me ultimately it will be the executive branch and if the
people don't like they just vote up the "replace the manager" proposal
and start over with a new one.

It has to do with the supposed benefit primary benefit of blockchain
which is that it's distributed. But my claim is that is no benefit at
all because the *implementation* of a decision has to be accomplished
by the executive branch (i.e., a central authority). And if you trust
the executive to actually do what you tell them, why is it so hard to
trust them to run the decisionmaking system itself? Poof: the supposed
main advantage of blockchain disappears in a puff of smoke.

> 2. Open voting isn?t necessarily a problem with governance of the versioning of crypto (share whatever ideas you have for this, please); but that is entirely separate from the trust relationships in currency exchanges.

If you're not using encryption to hide the votes, why do you need
blockchain at all?

Are we talking about a monetary system or a decisionmaking system?

You don't worry even a little about investing a lot of time and effort
into something that has a huge fundamental flaw that turns out to be
unsolvable? I prefer to have the whole design in my head before I
start working on something, thank you very much...

r/democracy is busy, but mostly not related to decisionmaking systems.
The others are about as active as this list (which is to say, not very
;-)

You apparently didn't understand my comment: There *aren't* 535
choices as most of those people vote the equivalent of party line.
Other than a few wingnuts like Rand Paul and Bernie that I'd likely
each assign some weight to if I could split by topic area (Paul for
defense, Bernie for social program reform, Warren for regulation,
etc.) I don't see any benefit to being able to delegate to any of
them. Indeed, things would certainly be worse if I had to delegate all
my votes to any one of those three...

Braver man than I: I can count the number of companies that have my
credit card on one hand. I use Paypal for everything else, but even
then avoid buying anything from a site I don't already know (I buy a
lot of stuff through small-fry through ebay and amazon, of course, but
then, they never get my payment info). Life is too short to spend
weeks or months of it trying to undo an identity theft.

In a fully operational system, sure. But how do you get there if you
turn most people off before they even get to the main site? Do you
think Avaaz and change.org lose sleep over this? I don't plan to
either: As long as we avoid obvious gaming of the system we can have
both low barriers to entry *and* some faith in the outcome of the
decisions actually being representative. I expect to add challenges
gradually, like making people reply to one of the weekly emails or log
into the system to keep their account active, or maybe forcing them to
make a comment or citation once in awhile if they don't do this by
habit: Once they're on the site there's all kinds of things we can
check to make sure it's not a bot or hacker casting votes.

Mostly I stopped marketing it when I discovered some fundamental flaws
in the design of Angular 2 having to do with routing (it was basically
impossible to route people to specific proposals using a URL, a
necessary feature to market it to issue-based voters). That limitation
in Angular has been fixed now, but I haven't had the time to port to
the newest release of it yet.

No offense intended, I was just pointing out that Facebook and the

Far higher chance of it becoming as popular (or more) than LQFB or
Rousseau, for sure. But history is littered with products and
movements that didn't actually ever really amount to anything because
of fundamental flaws that their creators didn't see or weren't able to
fix. Go big or go home, I say. If it takes me 20 or 30 years for all
these half-assed attempts to fail and proxyfor.me to rise to the top,
that's fine. My father (a social psychologist) actually ran a system
like proxyfor.me (albeit matching people to existing representatives
rather than to each other) back in the 1970s because he recognized
even back then that people are incapable of picking appropriate
representatives for themselves. He's helped me with this one some
because here it is more than 40 years later and he still hasn't given
up hope that eventually people will see the light ;-)

Ah, an elitist. Attitudes like that display a profound ignorance about
how the world actually works. Certainly anyone that trusts a doctor to
diagnose anything more complicated than the common cold is a fool:
They're certainly less trustworthy even than car mechanics are (and
that ain't saying much). Don't get me started on this because one of
the things that's been taking up enormous amount of my time the past
few months has been both my wife's and my doctor's failures to
properly diagnose and treat endocrine/hormone problems we have (e.g.,
in her case I believe that probably 90% of the cases of Hashimoto's
out there aren't diagnosed until too late and the thyroid has been
irreparably damaged or completely destroyed: My wife, on the other
hand, thanks to my insistence on going outside the insurance system to
get a proper diagnosis and treatment, is getting treatment early
enough that we're hoping that the damage can actually be completely
reversed). I've also had a few close friends die of cancer recently
that should have been diagnosed months or even years earlier but their
doctors dropped the ball.

But back to the writing of bills, I submit you're naive about them as
well: It's not that they're just inherently hard to understand, it's
that they're *intentionally* hard to understand because that's part of
how gaming the system works in misrepresentative democracy. The trick
is to make them so hard to follow that most people give up such that
the author can easily manipulate people into voting for something they
don't really understand based on trust/charm/log rolling/etc.

As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests
and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have
the time to invest in understanding them that I do. And on the rare
occasion they do order extra tests its invariably to cover their asses
in case I die rather than because they actually understand what is
required to diagnose or treat any particular disease.

And again, you're a fool (or maybe just severely insecure) if you
think that *any* bill can't be written such that you can understand it
with an hour or so's effort. I've spent a *lot* of time doing this
kind of thing (my lawyers hate me as much as my doctors do ;-) and
haven't come across anything they've written that can't be vastly
simplified if they'd take the time (which of course not only do they
not have any incentive to do, they actually *benefit* by making things
more complicated because of the job security it provides).

In politics?  I can't think of anything, really. Certainly our current
governments work no better now than they did 200 years ago. And this
despite massive improvements in technology that should have made
everything much better.  Trump and our current polarized do-nothing
congress I think are convincing evidence that government is actually
*worse* now than it was 200 years ago, at least in the US.

Not everything has to be debated here. The issues you raise are debated all over the internet, and it?s pointless to overrun my question with these topics, when it is a legitimate and serious question. Please leave room for others to comment.

Most people know nothing of crypto. Many people such as your self are very skeptical to varying degrees. And many people are investing billions of dollars worth of resources and enormous effort into it. If you disagree with that last group of people, then I guess you don?t need to chime in on this thread. That?s okay.

That?s what I?m asking for: a better solution than benign authoritarianism. Crypto was designed to be decentralized and therefore democratized, and it faces an issue of not being able to democratize in how it evolves. People want to solve this, and I?m asking this group for help thinking of solutions to this. 

In other words, I?m asking for brainstorming, not debate on tangential issues.

i just do not believe Scott point number

2) Since I think we all agree that some sort of
delegation/representation system is required doesn't that require open
voting, eliminating the need or even the ability to use encryption on
the vote data?

after the legislation and administrative decision are  done collectively
only administrator will be necessary
I believe that models like proxyforme can actually help make it easier to
streamline decision making and eliminate delegate.
AI delegation is the next big think not human

Hey, you were the one that brought up blockchain as if it had
something to do with public policy decisionmaking. Now you admit you
don't have answers to fundamental questions about how it would work or
even what relevance it has to what this list is for?

And I'm helping you with that: I say don't think about it because it's

zero to offer toward solving any the problems we face...

You gotta have a brain and at least some passing familiarity with the
technology to brainstorm about it. Since you can't respond to even my
most basic questions about how blockchain is relevant to
decisionmaking, I too wonder why you even brought it up...

Maybe, but we're a *long* way from having that technology so I believe
using other people as proxies is a necessary intermediate step. Plus,
even if we had the technology ready, jumping directly to "AI
benevolent dictator" would be a very difficult sell, marketingwise.
One step at a time...

So, even you can find it useful. Delegation by topics is not currently implemented, I think it should, and hope it will be. But again, it is not limited to the members of Congress. Anyone can be your delegate.

What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV? This may end in an embarassement.

Great story. Too bad such a system looks too opaque for me to ever want to use.

> And you're saying you prefer them to the example proposals in proxyfor.me? Who's a liar now?
I was not saying anything about proxyforme. I only said your statement of me never carefully looking at congressional bills was absolutely false. Basically, a lie.

Sorry to hear about your calamities, but very deep level of involvement is not suitable for most people. Even you were not running the tests on your own, though you had to switch (or nudge?) your doctor. More like switching a representative when you do not trust him/her.

> As above, I have the opposite experience: I order my own blood tests and then tell the doctors what they say because they simply don't have the time to invest in understanding them that I do.

Your are atypical. You would be a great delegate who is digging for truth and can help other people understand it.

Do you see a difference between being able and wanting to do something? In most cases I will not have time to do it. Occasionally? Quite possible.

As I see it, following Cambridge Analytica's breach of the public trust, people are going to be even more reluctant to hand over their *personality* data to any online database. In another thread you mentioned how little you?re willing to trust anyone with your credit card data; how is this different from giving out your personality data? You can always change your credit card numbers...but once your personality data has been compromised, there?s no taking that back. It seems to me your entire design relies heavily on a level of public *trust* that just doesn?t exist, and likely won?t for some time to come.

This is quite ironic, isn't it?

It's *completely* different: If my identity is compromised I could
lose thousands of dollars, the ability to do anything that requires a
good credit score (buy a house or car, rent an apartment, etc.), and
will have to waste dozens or hundreds of hours trying to fix it. If my
personality profile gets out about all I have to fear is that Trump's
team (or the Russians, or whoever) will target me with ads that
encourage me to spread fake news.

No, it only requires that people realize that the rest of us already
know what your personality is (even if you don't take the test, I can
tell just by looking at your posts/likes/etc.) so there's no point in
even trying to hide this stuff. And there's really no danger to
disclosing it other than maybe making it easier for advertisers to
target you. In which case the problem is with our blind acceptance of
advertising as a social engineering tool and there's no point in
quibbling over minor tweaks in how effective it is...

But only if they vote, which was one of the problems that caused LQFB
to fail to work: Too few people delegated, and when they did, they
often delegated to people who didn't vote (dead end) or were simply
poor choices (because the delegate had a poor vote correlation).

Delegating by domain could potentially allow a smaller pool to provide
better representation, I'd agree, but at the expense of vastly more
complexity and even lower likelihood that the delegates you end up
choosing would actually cast a "correct vote" for you. It also
promotes the delusion that people are capable of choosing good
representatives when all the evidence says that they simply aren't
able to do this this (references in the proxyfor.me help system).

Not cowardice exactly, but I'm all about enjoying my leisure time

Like FB (the matching algorithms for which are vastly more
complicated) or indeed the vast majority of our other technology you
don't have to understand it to find it useful. In your case I'd assume
that you'll just rely on others to actually take the time to
understand how it works and raise the red flag if there's something to
be worried about. Not that any of our efforts to show how dangerous FB
is have gained much traction...

Hey, it was you that made the comparison that they were "better"
somehow than the ones in proxyfor.me. If you want to walk that back,
no problem.

I did have to change doctors. Twice. And it is sort of similar to
changing representatives, but it's actually more like proxyfor.me
where the calculated vote is only a default suggestion that can be
easily overridden by casting a direct vote (take charge of your own
health!). This simply isn't an option in any of these "within the
system" proposals. Even in the Rousseau system (Italian Five Star
Movement) they have a lot of problem with "representatives" failing to
do what they're directed to do, and they even have a contract with a
$100K plus penalty to handle this situation.  United.vote doesn't even
have that, or any faint hope of gaining anything like it.

Great: That's exactly what all these delegate/representative systems
are designed to support. But (another) difference between proxyfor.me
and all the others is that there are social engineering techniques
applied to the bill/proposal creators to provide an incentive to make
the proposals the best they can be (both effective *and*
intelligible). The others seem to not even recognize that this is a
serious issue: LQFB proposals were of uniformly poor quality, as is
the case for most of the petitions on sites like change.org and
avaaz.org. US congressional bills are much better in the "effective"
area, but at the very high cost of being mostly unintelligible, even
if you're a lawyer.  You can have both, but you need to structure the
system such that it provides incentives to ensure this.

Imagine this: Every bill proposed in the US congress has a "score"
that everyone who reads it can contribute to. Maybe 50% on readability
50% on estimated effectiveness (number of loopholes, etc.). The author
of the top-rated proposal each month/session/whatever gets some sort
of bonus. It'd also be a great item to use in your re-election
campaign. But now we voters don't even keep track of how many bills
any member even introduces, let alone gets passed, let alone how often
a law needed to be revised because it had flaws that didn't become
apparent until they started implementing it...

Of course I read your paragraph. Do you understand difference between what people promise and what they do?
Now answer my questions, do not ignore them: What does this article have to do with your experience with PaV? Why do you keep insisting they had ID verification? Did you really use PaV?

Again, do not be a liar. If you do not know how to quote I can do it for you:

Me: This is, actually, a lie. Do not be a liar.

Sorry Scott, it is better just to stop this discussion.

I don't see why: It's mostly stuff that's directly relevant to that
project. But since apparently none of us has received a response I
think it's safe to assume that they're not interested in discussing
their project.

My recollection is that they did, mostly because I remember thinking
how expensive it must have been, but I'll admit that my recollection
is fuzzy because this was many years ago and I only spent an hour or
two playing with it. It's gone now anyway so it's kind of academic at
this point. They clearly *intended* to do snail-mail based
authentication. I intend to use public voter rolls. United.vote use of
credit cards seems to me to be worse than either of those because
many, if not most, people (including myself) simply won't do it. Even
worse, and I Iooked this up, even in the US fully 30% of adults don't
even *have* a credit card! By comparison less than 10% aren't
registered to vote and that percentage is significantly lower in some
states (those with same day registration, motor/voter, etc.) I've also
been thinking that getting teenagers involved is a crucial target
market: Even in the US less than 20% of people under the age of 18
have a credit card. Again, like voter fraud, obsessing about fake
accounts before it's even been shown to be an issue is just shooting
yourself in the foot IMHO.

Yeah, but you did it wrong: You didn't go back far enough. Here's the
relevant statement you made:

This clearly implies that you prefer the impenetrable bills the US
congress deals with to something simpler and yet still very relevant
to the operation of the modern world. This means you'd prefer
something like the following because it's "real world":
https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text

Hint: It's the most recently passed bill by the US Senate. It's 30,132
words and according to MS Word's readability check has a reading ease
of 23 (out of 100) and a grade level of 16 (college graduate). And
that's after ignoring hundreds of grammatical errors. And I'll
guarantee you that not a single member of the House or Senate has or
will ever read the entire thing (they have staff for that, albeit most
of them will only check a few sections of it to make sure their pet
project isn't affected somehow). And this is far from the worst
example I could have picked (take a look at a budget bill sometime if
you really want to be horrified). Which is why I maintain that using
*anything* produced by our existing misrepresentative democracies as
input into an EDD will doom that project.

One problem I can think of is the deletion / censoring of data, this 
needs to be externally monitored and verified in a both centralized and 
decentralized systems. The crucial part being to witness in what order 
do additions to the immutable persistent storage happen, and maintain 
consensus of this. No proof of work needed, this is actually strange 
form of consistency, the cost of censoring/double-spend is merely 
related to the amount of money/hardware/energy you're willing to invest 
(probably within the budget of US/RUS military etc), rather than 
consensus on what changes happened when. I've made a proposal based on 
"proof of communicating witnesses" 
https://github.com/hyperledger/hyperledger/issues/18#issuecomment-349709686 
but later on I found https://www.radixdlt.com/ which does essentially 
the same thing. Monitoring and maintaining consensus can be relatively 
fast and cheap, given the time it takes to calculate hashes and the 
round-trip-time latency of communicating this globally.

Alternatively, if simply distributed databases and a decentralized web 
is wanted, one can use https://datproject.org/ and 
https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/ as a gossip protocol. No blockchain needed. 
Can try it today with the https://beakerbrowser.com/

And I don't see a problem with distributed ledgers and democratic 
processes. Its up to people what system they use, not how many nodes a 
blockchain / consensus network has.

Have you heard about directed acyclic graphs? E.g. the Tangle used in

They can scale much nicer than the traditional blockchain with nakamoto

Fiat currency or quite similar systems can for sure be built on 
distributed immutable log like systems as long as the participants agree 
on the rules. You can do it without any 
proof-of-work/stake/space/elapsed-time, if a web of trust exists among 
the actors taking part of the economy.

While something doesn't have universal acceptance as a method of 
payment, or sufficiently easy liquidity, it shouldn't be considered 
"actual" money. And in no case does it have any value like assets or 
commodities do, you cannot estimate the value of them or predict if the 
current irrational market price is above or below that value, only 
speculate on the future exchange rates of the limited collectible(s). 
Essentially the difference between investments and trading, the tools 
used in one fail miserably in the other.

Clearly the citizenry is capable of producing good and actionable ideas, as seen with the Lafontaine Park plan, and clearly it?s better to listen before than to deal with the firestorm of post-proposal punditry.

So why not take steps towards meaningful consultation, with a modern spin? For all the talk about technology and smartphones driving us apart, maybe we can finally find a way for them to make us more cohesive.

Oh, and if this sounds far-fetched and idyllic, a U.K.-based company has been toying with a similar concept for a few years. In Scandinavia, in-depth public consultation is the norm when it comes to urban planning.

It?s doable. The question is whether we as a society want to actively participate in shaping our city.
