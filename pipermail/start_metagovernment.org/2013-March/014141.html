<PRE>Hi Mitch,

I watched the video and browsed your site.  We share a common concern
about the danger of a monopoly.  <A HREF="http://everyvote.org/about/goals/">http://everyvote.org/about/goals/</A>

  Help create and participate in a federated opinion sharing platform
  (OSP) network. Today, if you vote to Support a bill on OpenCongress,
  you need to resubmit that same vote if you later use a site like
  POPVOX.  If you declare on ISideWith that you are Pro-Life and in
  favor of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, you will have to
  resubmit those same stances again if you later use LoveGov.  It
  would save you time and energy if you could submit these decisions
  one time, and submit your profile information just one time, and
  then have them transferred to any other site that tracks this same
  information.  That&#8217;s exactly what OSP federation would allow you to
  do.  In order to make OSP federation possible, OSPs like
  OpenCongress, POPVOX, ISideWith, LoveGov, and the proposed
  EveryVote.org platform would need to agree to identical open
  standards, which ensure our data is transferable and
  cross-compatible.

Have you made further progress on this, since last we spoke?

Have you seen our Knight proposal for free-range voting?  We appear to
have the same goal, so I hope we can collaborate.  We already have two
providers (Agora Voting and Votorola), plus Metagov as facilitator.
Adding more providers might increase our chance of winning funds.
Would you consider joining with EveryVote?

&gt;<i> Hi Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The EveryVote Facebook app is a free (open source) technology to increase
</I>&gt;<i> voter turnout in university student government elections by helping
</I>&gt;<i> students learn about, share their opinion on, and interact with all of
</I>&gt;<i> their candidates on one convenient page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our goal over these next 4 months is to pursue additional volunteers and
</I>&gt;<i> grant funding so that we can release an improved Facebook app, a
</I>&gt;<i> stand-alone (non-Facebook) platform, a mobile, and tablet version for Fall
</I>&gt;<i> 2013 university student government and campus activities board elections.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *To watch a video intro to the app, please visit** **everyvote.org/fbintro.*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Furthermore, EveryVote.org is dedicated to accomplishing 2 long-range goals
</I>&gt;<i> we believe are essential to a healthy democracy, yet too few people are
</I>&gt;<i> talking about. They are: 1) Advocate for the creation of a
</I>&gt;<i> publicly-accessible comprehensive candidate database, so that any developer
</I>&gt;<i> can make a tool that provides you with factual information about every
</I>&gt;<i> candidate in every election you can vote for on a single page, and 2)
</I>&gt;<i> participate in a federated civic data sharing network, which allows users
</I>&gt;<i> to transfer their civic data to any site they want in the network, so no
</I>&gt;<i> one website can monopolize our public election data.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You can watch a 2:30 cartoon summary of these 2 aforementioned goals here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN85p5oSbb4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN85p5oSbb4</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If any Metagov would like to learn more, or can offer feedback on the
</I>&gt;<i> EveryVote project, we'd be excited to hear from you at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">contactus at everyvote.org.</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks so much for your consideration,
</I>&gt;<i>
