<PRE>Hi Roger,

Thanks for answering my questions.

&gt;<i> Good idea.  I would be happy to join with you in the Vote Mirroring
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.  Is there anything I need to do at this point beyond
</I>&gt;<i> sending you this information?:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> InterMix Voices of Humanity Software &lt;<A HREF="http://intermix.org">http://intermix.org</A>&gt;.  Giving
</I>&gt;<i> collective voices to groups, and to the genders and ages of
</I>&gt;<i> humanity.  Contact Roger Eaton +1 415 933-0153 - intermix.org.
</I>
I've wanted to invite InterMix, and there's still time.  But first I
need to understand the voting facility.  Free-range voting only
applies to primary votes, you see.  And as I mentioned earlier, I had
the impression that InterMix was more for micro-decisions, sort of
like Vilfredo.  So, back to our other thread:

&gt;<i> Thanks, for logging in Mike.  Wasn't your password emailed to you in
</I>&gt;<i> the message that had the confirmation link?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will forward your message to the programmer.  If you had a
</I>&gt;<i> problem, then there is a problem.
</I>
Yes, now I see it.  That explains the problem.  The confirmation
message was sent in HTML only, but I have a plain text mail client:
<A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/">http://www.mutt.org/</A>

(Hi Flemming: When mailing HTML, which is somewhat non-standard, it's
recommend to send multi-part HTML and text.  Not HTML alone.)

&gt;<i> InterMix messages have two rating settings on the upper right border of
</I>&gt;<i> each message, for interest and for approval.  Average interest times
</I>&gt;<i> average approval is calculated as the &quot;value&quot; of the message.
</I>
But the message might be something more than &quot;eggs big-end up&quot;, ofc.
It might be something like, &quot;We should impose a ban on whaling,&quot; or
&quot;The UN should move its headquarters to Antarctica.&quot;  Right?

And to my question:
&gt;<i> &gt; ...  Is it my membership in the big-endian group, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which means a vote for big end up?
</I>
You seem to be answering, &quot;No.  Approvals (primary votes) for messages
such as &quot;big-end up&quot;, &quot;UN to Antarctica&quot; and so forth are
independent of group membership.  Membership is not a vote.

&gt;<i> At the group level, we are going to implement automatic tweeting and
</I>&gt;<i> facebook posting of the messages with the highest  value on an ongoing
</I>&gt;<i> basis.  This we call the &quot;voice&quot; of the group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Groups join discussions and discussions can have &quot;decision periods&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> There can be multiple groups in the same discussion.  Currently both
</I>&gt;<i> discussions and decision periods are set by the admin, but down the
</I>&gt;<i> road we want to have a bottom-up mechanism to do that.
</I>
May I withdraw my approval after having second thoughts?  Or extend my
approval to a message that I'd earlier disapproved of, or ignored?

Mike


&gt;<i> Within a decision period there are two phases, again controlled by the
</I>&gt;<i> admin at this point.  In the first, the default sort for the forum shows
</I>&gt;<i> only messages not yet rated by the user from the decision period in date
</I>&gt;<i> order, newest first.  In the second phase, the default sort still shows
</I>&gt;<i> only unrated messages, but now they are in descending value order (with
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate regression to the mean for messages that have fewer ratings).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The above setup is meant to be a rough workaround of the problem that there
</I>&gt;<i> are too many messages for everyone to read them all.  We are not trying to
</I>&gt;<i> be scientific, just to find an agreeable collective expression for the
</I>&gt;<i> members of all the groups together in the discussion.  The method just has
</I>&gt;<i> to be reasonable so it is not too burdensome, yet the group members feel
</I>&gt;<i> the process is fair.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At the end of each decision period, the &quot;results&quot; of the decision are
</I>&gt;<i> listed on the &quot;results&quot; page, with an overall winner and also a winner for
</I>&gt;<i> each group and for each of the voices of humanity: women, men, youth,
</I>&gt;<i> middle-age (voice of experience) and seniors (voice of wisdom).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a lot more - we think we can allow groups and networks to choose
</I>&gt;<i> their place in a bottom-up hierarchy without anyone being offended or
</I>&gt;<i> feeling misused.  Likewise we might - just might - be able to put together
</I>&gt;<i> a bottom-up hierarchy of subjects.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The larger idea is to bring in NGOs generally and then by mixing their
</I>&gt;<i> memberships together, create a global village where the nations and
</I>&gt;<i> religions each have a voice, and the six voices of humanity, including the
</I>&gt;<i> voice of humanity as one, create a global collective consciousness.  I
</I>&gt;<i> believe a collective global consciousness is the starting point for any
</I>&gt;<i> kind of effective global action.  The nation-state system is not working
</I>&gt;<i> well enough and needs to be supplemented by a global system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Anyways, thanks, for taking a look!  I think we will have to consider the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of the user specifying a password at signup instead of having
</I>&gt;<i> one assigned automatically, just to reduce confusion.  I bet you will find
</I>&gt;<i> the password on the email we sent, but you didn't notice it.  And if you
</I>&gt;<i> didn't notice it, others will also not see it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For anyone who would like to take a look - just go to intermix.org and read
</I>&gt;<i> the first paragraph - it explains how to join up the alpha testing we are
</I>&gt;<i> doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am copying InterMix programmer Flemming Funch.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The UN scenario does sound like an example of primary voting, but what

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't have much time to participate, but I wanted to have a look.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The sign up process took my email address and mailed me a challenge

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had no apparent effect.  Also, I see that I'm &quot;logged in&quot; even though
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did not set a password.  I could set one now, I suppose, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; asking me for the old one.
