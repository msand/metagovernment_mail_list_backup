<PRE>Hi Roger,

I was thinking InterMix was more for micro-decisions like Vilfredo.
The UN scenario does sound like an example of primary voting, but what
form does a vote take?  Is it my membership in the big-endian group,
for example, which means a vote for big end up?

I like the whimsical atmosphere of InterMix.  E-democracy often takes
itself too seriously. :^)

I don't have much time to participate, but I wanted to have a look.
The sign up process took my email address and mailed me a challenge
URL (HTML only, should also be a text part) which I visited.  But it
had no apparent effect.  Also, I see that I'm &quot;logged in&quot; even though
I did not set a password.  I could set one now, I suppose, but it's
asking me for the old one.

Mike

&gt;<i> Mike,

</I>&gt;<i> Please add intermix.org to the list of primary voting projects - I did also
</I>&gt;<i> go the wiki, but truth is I am not that familiar with wikis and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> quite see how best to add InterMix.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For all on this list, you are more than welcome to participate in the alpha
</I>&gt;<i> test of InterMix.  Please sign up either as a Big-Endian (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://bigend.intermix.cr8.com">http://bigend.intermix.cr8.com</A>) or a Little-Endian (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://littleend.intermix.cr8.com">http://littleend.intermix.cr8.com</A>).  In our alpha test we are debating
</I>&gt;<i> whether the big end of the egg should be up in the egg cup or the little
</I>&gt;<i> end.  OK, so maybe it is a little simple-minded, but it is all meant in
</I>&gt;<i> fun.  Please do sign up and help.  We are proceeding in three stages.
</I>&gt;<i> Until Wednesday, March 27, we are having open-ended discussion.  Then for
</I>&gt;<i> one week until Wednesday April 3, we will collectively set a particular
</I>&gt;<i> topic for discussion.  Finally until Wednesday April 10, we will discuss
</I>&gt;<i> the topic we set and expect to see resulting &quot;winning&quot; messages for each of
</I>&gt;<i> the six voices of humanity as well as for the two &quot;Endian&quot; groups.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks much,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I define &quot;primary voting&quot; as a more-or-less continuous process of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting in which the results are not decisive.  Its purpose is to build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up a normative consensus or mutual understanding prior to a decision.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The decision itself is usually expressed through a separate mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as with an election, voting assembly or other authority.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please let me know if I missed any projects.  Or just edit the list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directly (it's in a wiki).
