<PRE>Thanks, for logging in Mike.  Wasn't your password emailed to you in the
message that had the confirmation link?

I will forward your message to the programmer.  If you had a problem, then
there is a problem.

InterMix messages have two rating settings on the upper right border of
each message, for interest and for approval.  Average interest times
average approval is calculated as the &quot;value&quot; of the message.

At the group level, we are going to implement automatic tweeting and
facebook posting of the messages with the highest  value on an ongoing
basis.  This we call the &quot;voice&quot; of the group.

Groups join discussions and discussions can have &quot;decision periods&quot;.  There
can be multiple groups in the same discussion.  Currently both discussions
and decision periods are set by the admin, but down the road we want to
have a bottom-up mechanism to do that.

Within a decision period there are two phases, again controlled by the
admin at this point.  In the first, the default sort for the forum shows
only messages not yet rated by the user from the decision period in date
order, newest first.  In the second phase, the default sort still shows
only unrated messages, but now they are in descending value order (with
appropriate regression to the mean for messages that have fewer ratings).

The above setup is meant to be a rough workaround of the problem that there
are too many messages for everyone to read them all.  We are not trying to
be scientific, just to find an agreeable collective expression for the
members of all the groups together in the discussion.  The method just has
to be reasonable so it is not too burdensome, yet the group members feel
the process is fair.

At the end of each decision period, the &quot;results&quot; of the decision are
listed on the &quot;results&quot; page, with an overall winner and also a winner for
each group and for each of the voices of humanity: women, men, youth,
middle-age (voice of experience) and seniors (voice of wisdom).

There is a lot more - we think we can allow groups and networks to choose
their place in a bottom-up hierarchy without anyone being offended or
feeling misused.  Likewise we might - just might - be able to put together
a bottom-up hierarchy of subjects.

The larger idea is to bring in NGOs generally and then by mixing their
memberships together, create a global village where the nations and
religions each have a voice, and the six voices of humanity, including the
voice of humanity as one, create a global collective consciousness.  I
believe a collective global consciousness is the starting point for any
kind of effective global action.  The nation-state system is not working
well enough and needs to be supplemented by a global system.

Anyways, thanks, for taking a look!  I think we will have to consider the
possibility of the user specifying a password at signup instead of having
one assigned automatically, just to reduce confusion.  I bet you will find
the password on the email we sent, but you didn't notice it.  And if you
didn't notice it, others will also not see it.

For anyone who would like to take a look - just go to intermix.org and read
the first paragraph - it explains how to join up the alpha testing we are
doing.

I am copying InterMix programmer Flemming Funch.

&gt;<i> Hi Roger,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking InterMix was more for micro-decisions like Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> The UN scenario does sound like an example of primary voting, but what
</I>&gt;<i> form does a vote take?  Is it my membership in the big-endian group,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, which means a vote for big end up?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the whimsical atmosphere of InterMix.  E-democracy often takes
</I>&gt;<i> itself too seriously. :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't have much time to participate, but I wanted to have a look.
</I>&gt;<i> The sign up process took my email address and mailed me a challenge
</I>&gt;<i> URL (HTML only, should also be a text part) which I visited.  But it
</I>&gt;<i> had no apparent effect.  Also, I see that I'm &quot;logged in&quot; even though
</I>&gt;<i> I did not set a password.  I could set one now, I suppose, but it's
</I>&gt;<i> asking me for the old one.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please add intermix.org to the list of primary voting projects - I did
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go the wiki, but truth is I am not that familiar with wikis and didn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quite see how best to add InterMix.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For all on this list, you are more than welcome to participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> alpha
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; test of InterMix.  Please sign up either as a Big-Endian (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://bigend.intermix.cr8.com">http://bigend.intermix.cr8.com</A>) or a Little-Endian (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://littleend.intermix.cr8.com">http://littleend.intermix.cr8.com</A>).  In our alpha test we are debating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; whether the big end of the egg should be up in the egg cup or the little
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end.  OK, so maybe it is a little simple-minded, but it is all meant in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fun.  Please do sign up and help.  We are proceeding in three stages.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Until Wednesday, March 27, we are having open-ended discussion.  Then for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one week until Wednesday April 3, we will collectively set a particular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; topic for discussion.  Finally until Wednesday April 10, we will discuss
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the topic we set and expect to see resulting &quot;winning&quot; messages for each
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the six voices of humanity as well as for the two &quot;Endian&quot; groups.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks much,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I define &quot;primary voting&quot; as a more-or-less continuous process of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; up a normative consensus or mutual understanding prior to a decision.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The decision itself is usually expressed through a separate mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; as with an election, voting assembly or other authority.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Please let me know if I missed any projects.  Or just edit the list
