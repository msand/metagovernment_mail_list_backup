nop problem, didnt see an offense :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directing power is power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Directing power often requires power.  Let me concede this much and
</I>&gt;<i> try to explain my point in a different way.  &quot;We the people&quot; already
</I>&gt;<i> have constitutional electoral power.  We have the power to turn over
</I>&gt;<i> whole governments.  Great sacrifices were made to bring this to us,
</I>&gt;<i> but we've yet to meet the responsiblities that go with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1.  Control our own electoral power.  Discuss amongst ourselves and
</I>&gt;<i>       agree on the best course of action before the election.  Then go
</I>&gt;<i>       to the polls on election day and make the decision that was
</I>&gt;<i>       agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2.  Provide the government with directions that it can understand.
</I>&gt;<i>       Discuss amongst ourselves and agree on particular things that
</I>&gt;<i>       the government ought to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3.  Watch and see what the government does in response.  Give it a
</I>&gt;<i>       chance to follow the direction we provide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are our responsiblities.  The point I want to make is that,
</I>&gt;<i> until we deliver on them, we should refrain from threatening to sieze
</I>&gt;<i> more power and breaking up the institutions of government.  The design
</I>&gt;<i> of those institutions may very well be sound.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>i didnt intend it as a threat. i dont see a threat in that.
Sure, as long as the tools aren't mature enough, it will never change
anything.
If they tools reach maturity and are used more, then it will become de
facto control of government.
...but not so much because the time span between two elections is long and
people might choose to elect a government thats willing to pass laws that
will reduce it until permanent elections are possible or maybe other
mechanisms will be changed as well or pushed to change as well in order to
expand control.
This will happen every time the government does not behave the way the
citizens would like it to behave, but until that can happen the tools have
to grow a lot and probably goverment will not make a very bad job because
it doesnt want to be under more direct control by citizens.

On the other hand, u could privatize stuff which is currently done by the
public sector and only set interfaces/contracts which have to be
fullfilled, so the more mature tools will become, the less needed is public
institutions because it can be outsourced to private companies controlled
through the interfaces/contracts and transparency, so that citizens itself
can watch over it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'll start modifying the text shortly on the theme of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;   metagovernment = governing the government, leading the government
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I think Ed has to be editor given the time constraints, so I hope he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; deletes/modifies my own contributions (which might be slight,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; depending on how much time I can free) mercilessly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And you guys, too.  If you want a bureaucracy &quot;of, by and for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; people&quot;, where political power is placed in the hands of ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; folks, folks who use that power instead of their powerless reason to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; get their own way in society (picture clenched fist), then I can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remove my edits to a parallel draft.  I think we have enough aimless,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; out-of-control power in society.  What's needed is direction, and only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; what's outside of power can legitimately direct it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; directing power is power.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For me it makes no sense to say, that which is outside of power directs
</I>&gt;<i> ....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i dont know what bureaucracy refers too and for me it has not negative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; conotation beside what is meant by bureaucracy in everyday lifes talk,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because there it is only mentioned, when people realize some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organization doesnt work efficiently.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ordinary folks can use that power, yes, but ordinary folks have to build
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus first, otherwise, they have no power.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, i think the picture of &quot;clenched fist&quot; and the negative image of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; someone powerless wanting his personal revenge is a bit clichee ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But I'm not picky and i like your wording.
