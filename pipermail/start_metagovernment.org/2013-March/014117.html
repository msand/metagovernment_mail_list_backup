<PRE>Hi Ed,

Unfortunately, I can't attend.  But I'm willing to help in
preparation, wherever I best can.

Waiting to see your draft,

Mike

&gt;<i> I had seen this posting on another list, and have been planning on submitting a proposal for the Metagovernment project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, I would like to present several related concepts:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The concept of collaborative governance, and how it can (inevitably will) come to fruition
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Introductions to several member projects
</I>&gt;<i> 3. An overview of vote mirroring and related cross-project initiatives
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to post a draft proposal on the wiki this week. In the meantime, project which may like to participate (either in having me describe them, or in also coming to Strasbourg and presenting themselves as part of #2 above), please chime in. Also, if travel to France is not feasible for you, I could include in the proposal that you attend virtually.

</PRE>
