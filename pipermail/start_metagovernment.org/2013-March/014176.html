</I>&gt;<i> If government is &quot;that which guides&quot;, or &quot;that which controls&quot;, then I
</I>&gt;<i> agree 100% that The Government ought not to govern. The citizens ought to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But don't we still need the machine for action? Even in tiny Metagov, we
</I>&gt;<i> still need administrators for the mailing list, and the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I dont think so. In the long run, that is not needed anymore. It's needed
currently, because the tooling is not mature enough yet.
Think about the Internet as such or maybe email service to be more
specific. There is not admin that controls it.
People might use services that are under control of admins they trust or do
not trust, but they can change if they want and over time it's becoming
simpler to even run ur own services.
Because fundamentally things will be transparent and the open source nature
allows anyone to fork anything anytime they like, that will render
administrators powerless.
They are not needed or can be easily routed around if they dont do their
job well.



&gt;<i> I don't think of adminstration as being &quot;of, by, and for the people&quot;. I
</I>&gt;<i> really do picture the Government (the ultimate in adminstration) as a big,
</I>&gt;<i> dumb and powerful machine (a steam shovel to be precise). I can't reconcile
</I>&gt;<i> that picture with something that is people oriented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hopefully u will in the future, because i know its possible, because i dont
have that picture in mind anymore and its constantly fading away even more.
So all u seem to lack is some inspiration :-) I dont know how to give that,
i've tried very hard and very often in the past, but never succeeded, maybe
it just needs time until more examples show up and stuff gets visualized in
more vivid ways by some marketing experts :P ...



&gt;<i> I hardly think of it as human at all. I certainly don't want to get close
</I>&gt;<i> and comfortable with it. Only the people *as such* are &quot;of, by, and for the
</I>&gt;<i> people&quot;, but they lose that quality immediately when they start shoveling
</I>&gt;<i> with any kind of power. [/Mike]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Ned said to Mike]
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Democracy can *effectively* exist only to the extent that power is not
</I>&gt;<i> concentrated (by any means). (Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
concentrated power is like conscioussness. So yes, democracy will
concentrate power and it has to, but whats important is that its never
about people but always about ideas.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Anything that can be accomplished by giant hierarchically ordered
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucracies (with oligarchies at the top) can also (instead) be
</I>&gt;<i> accomplished by coordinated sets and strings of small single-partnership
</I>&gt;<i> projects, with each partnership working to satisfy its own individual
</I>&gt;<i> project contract. &quot;Oversight&quot; can be accomplished through independent
</I>&gt;<i> appraisal (by peers) upon completion of each project. (Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1, but its not easy to do, but its possible, thats what i feel more and
more :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. The advent of computers and electronic communications makes it possible
</I>&gt;<i> for even the largest and most complex of projects to be successfully
</I>&gt;<i> undertaken without the necessity of there being any &quot;bosses&quot; vested with
</I>&gt;<i> coercive power over others (i.e., without there being any distinctions
</I>&gt;<i> between governors and governed). (Yes?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest that giant hierarchically ordered bureaucracies (with
</I>&gt;<i> oligarchies at the top) are not usefully seen to be steam shovels. (For
</I>&gt;<i> example, steam shovels don't have &quot;minds of their own&quot;. They actually
</I>&gt;<i> perform as directed sometimes.) I would suggest that you need to look for a
</I>&gt;<i> better visualization through which to try to understand central governments
</I>&gt;<i> (and corporations, and oligarchies generally). (You may be making a
</I>&gt;<i> category error here ... {:^) [/Ned]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Ed said to Metagov]
</I>&gt;<i> I will try to work more on it [the draft] soon, but any input is welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> [/Ed]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Mike said to Ed]
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if I could do much with the text except on these terms. And
</I>&gt;<i> the March 31 deadline (again I didn't realize) doesn't leave much time for
</I>&gt;<i> anything, least of all discussion. But let me know what you think. Even as
</I>&gt;<i> it stands, I'll help with proof reading and redacting. [/Mike]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Ned said to Ed]
</I>&gt;<i> I concur with Mike that a week is not enough time to work through the vast
</I>&gt;<i> gulfs of understanding and intent that currently exist within the
</I>&gt;<i> community. But, these sorts of events will keep happening. If we start now,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe we can be ready for the next one.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In reading through the draft, I see these &quot;difference issues&quot; to be
</I>&gt;<i> addressed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The Metagovernment project is building online tools for
</I>&gt;<i>    collaborative governance: enabling citizens not to influence
</I>&gt;<i>    decision-making, but to control it.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Some in the community (including you and me) want a democracy with
</I>&gt;<i> teeth, in which the /demos/ actually *controls* governance (decisively
</I>&gt;<i> makes the governance decisions). Others (including the Votorola crew) are
</I>&gt;<i> adamant that the /demos/ must *only have influence*, and must *not* control
</I>&gt;<i> governance. (The view as I currently understand it is that the separate,
</I>&gt;<i> centralized Government should control governance, and the /demos/, using
</I>&gt;<i> pixie dust and Votorola, should only seek to *influence* the Government in
</I>&gt;<i> its decision making, with fingers crossed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1 for the pixie dust ftw!  :-)
the votorola crew is adamant in its view that /demos/ should only
influence, not control the governance?
i dont think so.
the thing is, its still a long way to go and until tools are able to
actually overtake and controll government are just not there yet and will
not be there any time soon.
its more like a long term vision that guides, but i can see it on the
horizon, its just one step after another :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;The advent of new technologies allows us to expand beyond the
</I>&gt;<i>    limitations and drawbacks of traditional direct democracy.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Not all of us are seeking direct democracy. The projects of the
</I>&gt;<i> community run the full gamut from no delegation or representation, to
</I>&gt;<i> optional delegation, to forced representation. My view is that we would be
</I>&gt;<i> doing the world a favor if we would discuss these differences, and
</I>&gt;<i> seriously try to rationally/synthetically resolve them. (There have
</I>&gt;<i> recently been some excellent interactions on various threads relevant to
</I>&gt;<i> this topic. I very much hope that those keep going to resolution, and I am
</I>&gt;<i> looking forward to reading what Pietro has to say about
</I>&gt;<i> delegation/representation.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;By creating new democratic institutions at a community level, we
</I>&gt;<i>    expect to gradually transform human governance from the ground up.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Strategies for change that are being used across projects also run the
</I>&gt;<i> full gamut of possibilities, from local community work to creating virtual
</I>&gt;<i> civilizations. (The Metagovernment listserv is like the bar in the Star
</I>&gt;<i> Wars movie -- all shapes and sizes represented.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>+1 cool

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;(In this sense, we mean &quot;government&quot; to be the decision-making
</I>&gt;<i>    aspect of government. The bureaucratic institutions of government --
</I>&gt;<i>    those that carry out the details of decisions -- are not within our
</I>&gt;<i>    scope.)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1, but they will become a target later on, because that's the direction
things will evolve later on. it just takes time.


&gt;<i> &#183; I consider &quot;the bureaucratic instititions of government&quot; to be among the
</I>&gt;<i> archaic arrangements that must be rendered obsolete if we are to have a
</I>&gt;<i> democracy in which there are no distinctions between governors and
</I>&gt;<i> governed. Bureaucracy inevitably displaces democracy. To have robust,
</I>&gt;<i> sustainable democracy, we must do away with bureaucracy. (And that is
</I>&gt;<i> possible.) The scope of our work must include this aspect, if the work is
</I>&gt;<i> to make a significant and lasting difference. (Rebuttals to these points
</I>&gt;<i> are welcome ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
+1, but can u give a definition of bureaucracy, because i dont think
bureaucracy is a bad thing as such, but as all things, can become a problem
if its done the wrong way.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;... those who do [participate] must come to a consensus or no
</I>&gt;<i>    action is taken.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; Not all of the projects of the Metagovernment community are in accord
</I>&gt;<i> with this criterion. Blinap is. Which others are? Which others are not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;One of our vanguard projects, vote-mirroring, allows us to try all
</I>&gt;<i>    approaches.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &#183; I am shocked (shocked!) to see that you continue to implicitly assume
</I>&gt;<i> that voting is the *only* means through which democracy can be effected.
</I>&gt;<i> /Au contraire/. Blinap (for example) does not use voting, and is altogether
</I>&gt;<i> democratic (even direct democratic). In the sentence above, I would suggest
</I>&gt;<i> replacing &quot;all approaches&quot; with &quot;some approaches that use voting&quot;. {:^)
</I>&gt;<i> [/Ned]
</I>

whats voting at all? in its smallest form its just some kind of
communication or interaction if u want, so u shouldnt probably put so much
weight into wording.
correct me someone if u feel i'm wrong on this. is there a definition that
we could use? should we craft one?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thanks.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Yes I should send an update.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here is a fast one:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo is progressing very well.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And we are slowly learning how to make people interact while keeping
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the math solid. It is not easy, but it is doable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The most recent progress was to let people see the result of their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vote (in terms of graph), so they could change their vote looking for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a Nash equilibrium. This made many people understand the graph much
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> better. And many who used Vilfredo before and after said that it is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> much better now. The next main jump will be to let people ask
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> clarifications about proposals, and respond to them. Considering that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> in Vilfredo every body must vote for every proposal, and most people
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> do not understand many proposals, this is also considered very
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> important.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime I am aving more and more requests for help in Italy.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In Italy one of the three main parties is the M5S which advocates an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> e-democracy approach. But they still don't have their platform. So the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discussion about how to implement eDemocracy just went over the roof.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My input in this has been a series of comments, but mostly few, well
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> thought entries in my italian blog. One of them I have translated in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> English, where I present White House 2 and its derivative works (Open
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Active Democracy, yrpri.org, Better Reykjavik, ... ).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think people who are not familiar with White House 2 might find it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> interesting.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For me it was important to write it up, because most people don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about Jim Gilliam important contribution, and they all keep repeating
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;liquid feedback&quot; as a sort of mantra.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> has not been translated but is in my todo list.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
