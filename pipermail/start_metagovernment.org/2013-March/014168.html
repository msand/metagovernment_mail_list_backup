<PRE>Pietro and Ed,

Thanks for translating this Pietro.
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/03/20/from-white-house-2-to-betri-reykjavik/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/03/20/from-white-house-2-to-betri-reykjavik/</A>
It's sad to read that Jim has gone over to the e-government side.

&gt;<i> I have started a proposal here:

If government is &quot;that which guides&quot;, or &quot;that which controls&quot;, then I
agree 100% that The Government ought not to govern.  The citizens
ought to govern.  The Government is a big, dumb and powerful machine
that needs guiding and controlling by the citizens.  So here I agree.

But don't we still need the machine for action?  Even in tiny Metagov,
we still need administrators for the mailing list, and the wiki.

I don't think of adminstration as being &quot;of, by, and for the people&quot;.
I really do picture the Government (the ultimate in adminstration) as
a big, dumb and powerful machine (a steam shovel to be precise).  I
can't reconcile that picture with something that is people oriented.
I hardly think of it as human at all.  I certainly don't want to get
close and comfortable with it.  Only the people *as such* are &quot;of, by,
and for the people&quot;, but they lose that quality immediately when they
start shoveling with any kind of power.

I don't know if I could do much with the text except on these terms.
And the March 31 deadline (again I didn't realize) doesn't leave much
time for anything, least of all discussion.  But let me know what you
think.  Even as it stands, I'll help with proof reading and redacting.

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I should send an update.
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a fast one:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo is progressing very well.
</I>&gt;<i> And we are slowly learning how to make people interact while keeping
</I>&gt;<i> the math solid. It is not easy, but it is doable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The most recent progress was to let people see the result of their
</I>&gt;<i> vote (in terms of graph), so they could change their vote looking for
</I>&gt;<i> a Nash equilibrium. This made many people understand the graph much
</I>&gt;<i> better. And many who used Vilfredo before and after said that it is
</I>&gt;<i> much better now. The next main jump will be to let people ask
</I>&gt;<i> clarifications about proposals, and respond to them. Considering that
</I>&gt;<i> in Vilfredo every body must vote for every proposal, and most people
</I>&gt;<i> do not understand many proposals, this is also considered very
</I>&gt;<i> important.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the meantime I am aving more and more requests for help in Italy.
</I>&gt;<i> In Italy one of the three main parties is the M5S which advocates an
</I>&gt;<i> e-democracy approach. But they still don't have their platform. So the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion about how to implement eDemocracy just went over the roof.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My input in this has been a series of comments, but mostly few, well
</I>&gt;<i> thought entries in my italian blog. One of them I have translated in
</I>&gt;<i> English, where I present White House 2 and its derivative works (Open
</I>&gt;<i> Active Democracy, yrpri.org, Better Reykjavik, ... ).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think people who are not familiar with White House 2 might find it
</I>&gt;<i> interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/03/20/from-white-house-2-to-betri-reykjavik/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2013/03/20/from-white-house-2-to-betri-reykjavik/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me it was important to write it up, because most people don't know
</I>&gt;<i> about Jim Gilliam important contribution, and they all keep repeating
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;liquid feedback&quot; as a sort of mantra.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My second post was then a thorough critic to delegated voting. This
</I>&gt;<i> has not been translated but is in my todo list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And then other posts. I will let you know when I translate them, so
</I>&gt;<i> you can read them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro, Irena posted to our list but had not joined it. I simply allowed her
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; post through. Just want you to know she hasn't actually seen your reply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I do hope you'll share more progress on Vilfredo. I think many here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would like to hear it.
