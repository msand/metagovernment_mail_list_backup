&gt;<i> This sounds good to me, Michael. Though the winners receive real
</I>&gt;<i> cash awards. Presumably part of the proposal would be for Metagov to
</I>&gt;<i> set up a non-profit to manage the funds (and the project), right?
</I>
Yes, at least for the non-profits.  Here's what the FAQ says,
<A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/faq">https://www.newschallenge.org/faq</A>

  * What are the funding options for a non-profit organization?
    We offer charitable grants to registered US nonprofit
    organizations with 501(c)3 status.

  * I&#8217;m a for-profit company. Can I enter?
    Yes. There are several funding options. Don&#8217;t worry too much about
    those specifics before applying.  If you&#8217;re selected to move
    forward as a semifinalist, we&#8217;ll communicate with you about the
    details.
    - Grants to for-profits (for charitable activity, such as
      open-source development)
    - Program Related Investments (no-interest five year loan, usually
      as convertible notes) [sample PRI Term Sheet]

  * Can two organizations/people submit a collaborative project?
    Yes. We have funding mechanisms to make partnership projects
    possible.

I guess we land on all three points, because Wadobo is a business
firm, wheras Votorola and Metagov are non-profits.

&gt;<i> Regardless, if Metagov is to be the umbrella org for the proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> it should be at least mentioned somewhere in the proposal. :)
</I>
I forgot to mention... but yes ofc.  If you're okay with submitting,
please add Metagov and submit.  (Or I can add something tonight.)  I
figure we can always review the wording afterwards.  We use the wiki
page as an open front-end for any mods, then transfer the mods to the
Knight site.  (The submission form *says* we can modify, so hopefully
that's true. :-&gt;

Mike
