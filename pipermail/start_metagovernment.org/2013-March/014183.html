<PRE>Yes, then InterMix is definitely a primary system.  The point is to
generate consensus while maintaining diversity.

Generally you can change your approval and interest ratings.  Even during a
decision period, you can change your ratings for candidate messages.
However for candidate messages in completed decision periods, you cannot
change your ratings.  Results for decison periods are frozen when the
period ends.

Candidate messages are always the root message of a thread within a
decision period.  Replies to candidate messages are not limited and even
after the end of a decision period, you can still add new replies.  Also
you can continue to change your evaluation of replies indefinitely.

I am glad to see CiviQ and GenAssem and all the primary systems on your
list and feel it an excellent idea to try vote mirroring, though clearly it
is going to be tough, since each primary system has its own approach.

On a separate issue, I discussed with Flemming the question of html vs text
email and we have added giving the participant the option of receiving text
or html to our list of things to do.  It's down the list, tho.  As far as
we know, almost everyone (clearly yourself excepted) uses an email reader
that handles html as a matter of course.

Thanks again, Mike.   If I am passing through Toronto, I will look you up
for sure.

</I>&gt;<i> If InterMix can be used to express approval or disapproval of
</I>&gt;<i> macro-decisions *before* those decisions are made, and thus serve to
</I>&gt;<i> guide those decisions, then it's a primary system.  But I still have a
</I>&gt;<i> question that relates to this.  May I freely change my expression of
</I>&gt;<i> approval after submitting it?  Or what are the restrictions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And do these on-the-fly changes of approval work differently in
</I>&gt;<i> different contexts.  Say for ordinary messages vs. messages in
</I>&gt;<i> decision periods?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for the hint about text vs html messages.  I will discuss with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Flemming and we will see what we can do.  Perhaps we should have a choice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up front whether the new participant prefers text or html.  Or perhaps we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should adopt your idea of always sending both.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Group membership is not a vote.  Rather every message can be rated for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approval (-3 to +3) and for interest (0 to +4).  The system calculates
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;value&quot; of each message as its average approval times its average
</I>&gt;<i> interest,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so the value can run from -12 to +12.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a facility built into InterMix which can be used as a voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism.  The basics are that individuals join groups and groups join
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open-ended discussions and discussions may have &quot;decision periods&quot;.  It
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in the decision periods that something like primary voting occurs.
</I>&gt;<i>  However
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; InterMix is not a yes or no voting system, so perhaps it doesn't qualify.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For instance, each of the mailing lists in this email could be a group.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then the groups could join together in a discussion on &quot;Primary Voting&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Within that discussion, there might be a &quot;Decision Period&quot; on the topic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Should we implement Vote Mirroring?&quot;.  Within the decision period, each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participant can enter one candidate message and there is free-form
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion by replying to eachothers messages.  At the end of the
</I>&gt;<i> decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; period, the candidate message with the highest value wins.  The elected
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message is not necessarily going to say yes or no to Vote Mirroring.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Someone might say, first we have to have preliminary analysis.  That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message could be elected and so in that case, we do not get a yes or no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answer.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by micro-decision.  The discussion might be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about nuclear disarmament and the decision period might be on the
</I>&gt;<i> question
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of adopting a nuclear convention.  Theoretically there is no limit to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; number of people who can participate.  Not exactly a micro issue, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clearly InterMix is not a yes-no voting system.  It is more a way of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; creating a consensus building collective stream of consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So if you think InterMix not suitable for inclusion, no problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks for responding,
