<PRE>Well, it was no loss.  As a dress rehearsal, I think it was a success.
Thanks to everyone who helped, we now have:

  1. Metagov plus 4 technical providers signed on to the idea:
     <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Knight_News_Challenge/Free-range_voting#Who_are_you.3F">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Knight_News_Challenge/Free-range_voting#Who_are_you.3F</A>
     The latest providers are InterMix (thanks Roger) and Agreedis
     (thanks Steven).

     We had zero before, so this is an improvement.

  2. Exposure and potentially useful contacts.  We discovered that
     EveryVote (Mitch Downey and Vincent Schramer) are concerned with
     the same kind of monopoly problem.  Again they're uncommitted to
     the particular solution we're proposing, but not unfriendly.
     <A HREF="http://www.everyvote.org/about/goals/">http://www.everyvote.org/about/goals/</A> (see also their cartoon
     video with Lincoln and Washington)

     One of the projects that made the cut (the only primary voting
     project) is Civic IQ.  Robert Girling (founder and designer)
     replies positively to the idea, though he's uncommitted.
     <A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/civic-iq-a-digital-platform-for-creative-collaboration-and-civic-engagement-#c-ef3716c13735f797e27d9d1bb3f2bfdd">https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/civic-iq-a-digital-platform-for-creative-collaboration-and-civic-engagement-#c-ef3716c13735f797e27d9d1bb3f2bfdd</A>

     Other promising contacts, too.

  3. A list of 43 providers who are more-or-less eligible to sign on:
     <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:List_of_primary_voting_projects">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:List_of_primary_voting_projects</A>

     So now we know who we are, and how many.

  4. The text of the submission.
      <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Knight_News_Challenge/Free-range_voting">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Knight_News_Challenge/Free-range_voting</A>

     So next time we won't have to start from scratch.

We don't necessarily need funding to get started.  Any money that's
required will materialize once we have a basic inter-network running.
We know that each of the 43 projects on the list (if it survives) will
eventually be joining us; we can't see how a project could possibly
survive outside an inter-network.  And we know that multiple
inter-networks cannot be isolated from each other (effectively they
are one, which is the whole idea).  So although we don't have Knight
on board yet, we have time on our side. :-)

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dear Knight News Challenge Applicant,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you so much for submitting your idea to the Knight News Challenge: Open
</I>&gt;<i> Gov. We are writing to let you know that, after careful review, your project has
</I>&gt;<i> not been selected as a semifinalist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please be assured that this isn&#8217;t a reflection on the quality of your idea. We
</I>&gt;<i> received more than 880 entries for 40 semifinalist slots.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This contest is only part of [1]Knight Foundation&#8217;s broader support of open
</I>&gt;<i> government work. We&#8217;ll let you know as we announce new projects and initiatives
</I>&gt;<i> and hope you&#8217;ll continue to be a part of our community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This contest was the first that we have run using our new platform, and we want
</I>&gt;<i> to thank you for participating with us. We created the platform to make the
</I>&gt;<i> process more open and participatory, and we hope you will continue to share,
</I>&gt;<i> discuss and collaborate. We&#8217;ve already seen new partnerships and ideas come from
</I>&gt;<i> many of the submissions. Your proposal will stay on the site unless you choose
</I>&gt;<i> to unpublish it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Over the next week, semifinalists will post brief videos and more detailed
</I>&gt;<i> information about their projects. We hope that you will check back on April 5 to
</I>&gt;<i> see how their ideas have evolved and to offer thoughts and questions for them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for joining us, and we hope to see you soon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Kindly,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Chris Sopher, Chris Barr &amp; the News Challenge team
