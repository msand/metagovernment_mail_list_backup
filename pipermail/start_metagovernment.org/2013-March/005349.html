<PRE>Hi Metagov,



The EveryVote Facebook app is a free (open source) technology to increase
voter turnout in university student government elections by helping
students learn about, share their opinion on, and interact with all of
their candidates on one convenient page.



Our goal over these next 4 months is to pursue additional volunteers and
grant funding so that we can release an improved Facebook app, a
stand-alone (non-Facebook) platform, a mobile, and tablet version for Fall
2013 university student government and campus activities board elections.



*To watch a video intro to the app, please visit** **everyvote.org/fbintro.*



Furthermore, EveryVote.org is dedicated to accomplishing 2 long-range goals
we believe are essential to a healthy democracy, yet too few people are
talking about. They are: 1) Advocate for the creation of a
publicly-accessible comprehensive candidate database, so that any developer
can make a tool that provides you with factual information about every
candidate in every election you can vote for on a single page, and 2)
participate in a federated civic data sharing network, which allows users
to transfer their civic data to any site they want in the network, so no
one website can monopolize our public election data.



You can watch a 2:30 cartoon summary of these 2 aforementioned goals here:

If any Metagov would like to learn more, or can offer feedback on the
EveryVote project, we'd be excited to hear from you at

Thanks so much for your consideration,



Mitch Downey
