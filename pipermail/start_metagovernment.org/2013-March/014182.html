<PRE>Alex, I apologize.  I shouldn't have pressed the point so hard.
Thanks for not taking offence.

&gt;<i> directing power is power.
</I>
Directing power often requires power.  Let me concede this much and
try to explain my point in a different way.  &quot;We the people&quot; already
have constitutional electoral power.  We have the power to turn over
whole governments.  Great sacrifices were made to bring this to us,
but we've yet to meet the responsiblities that go with it.

  1.  Control our own electoral power.  Discuss amongst ourselves and
      agree on the best course of action before the election.  Then go
      to the polls on election day and make the decision that was
      agreed.

  2.  Provide the government with directions that it can understand.
      Discuss amongst ourselves and agree on particular things that
      the government ought to do.

  3.  Watch and see what the government does in response.  Give it a
      chance to follow the direction we provide.

These are our responsiblities.  The point I want to make is that,
until we deliver on them, we should refrain from threatening to sieze
more power and breaking up the institutions of government.  The design
of those institutions may very well be sound.

Mike
