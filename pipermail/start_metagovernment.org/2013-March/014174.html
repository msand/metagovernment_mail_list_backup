<PRE>[Ed said to Metagov]
I have started a proposal here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013</A>
but have not had much time to work on it. [/Ed]

[Mike said to Ed]
If government is &quot;that which guides&quot;, or &quot;that which controls&quot;, then I 
agree 100% that The Government ought not to govern. The citizens ought 
to govern. The Government is a big, dumb and powerful machine that needs 
guiding and controlling by the citizens. So here I agree.

But don't we still need the machine for action? Even in tiny Metagov, we 
still need administrators for the mailing list, and the wiki.

I don't think of adminstration as being &quot;of, by, and for the people&quot;. I 
really do picture the Government (the ultimate in adminstration) as a 
big, dumb and powerful machine (a steam shovel to be precise). I can't 
reconcile that picture with something that is people oriented. I hardly 
think of it as human at all. I certainly don't want to get close and 
comfortable with it. Only the people *as such* are &quot;of, by, and for the 
people&quot;, but they lose that quality immediately when they start 
shoveling with any kind of power. [/Mike]

[Ned said to Mike]
1. Democracy can *effectively* exist only to the extent that power is 
not concentrated (by any means). (Yes?)

2. Anything that can be accomplished by giant hierarchically ordered 
bureaucracies (with oligarchies at the top) can also (instead) be 
accomplished by coordinated sets and strings of small single-partnership 
projects, with each partnership working to satisfy its own individual 
project contract. &quot;Oversight&quot; can be accomplished through independent 
appraisal (by peers) upon completion of each project. (Yes?)

3. The advent of computers and electronic communications makes it 
possible for even the largest and most complex of projects to be 
successfully undertaken without the necessity of there being any 
&quot;bosses&quot; vested with coercive power over others (i.e., without there 
being any distinctions between governors and governed). (Yes?)

I would suggest that giant hierarchically ordered bureaucracies (with 
oligarchies at the top) are not usefully seen to be steam shovels. (For 
example, steam shovels don't have &quot;minds of their own&quot;. They actually 
perform as directed sometimes.) I would suggest that you need to look 
for a better visualization through which to try to understand central 
governments (and corporations, and oligarchies generally). (You may be 
making a category error here ... {:^) [/Ned]

[Ed said to Metagov]
I will try to work more on it [the draft] soon, but any input is 
welcome. [/Ed]

[Mike said to Ed]
I don't know if I could do much with the text except on these terms. And 
the March 31 deadline (again I didn't realize) doesn't leave much time 
for anything, least of all discussion. But let me know what you think. 
Even as it stands, I'll help with proof reading and redacting. [/Mike]

[Ned said to Ed]
I concur with Mike that a week is not enough time to work through the 
vast gulfs of understanding and intent that currently exist within the 
community. But, these sorts of events will keep happening. If we start 
now, maybe we can be ready for the next one.

In reading through the draft, I see these &quot;difference issues&quot; to be 
addressed.

    &quot;The Metagovernment project is building online tools for
    collaborative governance: enabling citizens not to influence
    decision-making, but to control it.&quot; 

&#183; Some in the community (including you and me) want a democracy with 
teeth, in which the /demos/ actually *controls* governance (decisively 
makes the governance decisions). Others (including the Votorola crew) 
are adamant that the /demos/ must *only have influence*, and must *not* 
control governance. (The view as I currently understand it is that the 
separate, centralized Government should control governance, and the 
/demos/, using pixie dust and Votorola, should only seek to *influence* 
the Government in its decision making, with fingers crossed.)

    &quot;The advent of new technologies allows us to expand beyond the
    limitations and drawbacks of traditional direct democracy.&quot; 

&#183; Not all of us are seeking direct democracy. The projects of the 
community run the full gamut from no delegation or representation, to 
optional delegation, to forced representation. My view is that we would 
be doing the world a favor if we would discuss these differences, and 
seriously try to rationally/synthetically resolve them. (There have 
recently been some excellent interactions on various threads relevant to 
this topic. I very much hope that those keep going to resolution, and I 
am looking forward to reading what Pietro has to say about 
delegation/representation.)

    &quot;By creating new democratic institutions at a community level, we
    expect to gradually transform human governance from the ground up.&quot; 

&#183; Strategies for change that are being used across projects also run the 
full gamut of possibilities, from local community work to creating 
virtual civilizations. (The Metagovernment listserv is like the bar in 
the Star Wars movie -- all shapes and sizes represented.)

    &quot;(In this sense, we mean &quot;government&quot; to be the decision-making
    aspect of government. The bureaucratic institutions of government --
    those that carry out the details of decisions -- are not within our
    scope.)&quot; 

&#183; I consider &quot;the bureaucratic instititions of government&quot; to be among 
the archaic arrangements that must be rendered obsolete if we are to 
have a democracy in which there are no distinctions between governors 
and governed. Bureaucracy inevitably displaces democracy. To have 
robust, sustainable democracy, we must do away with bureaucracy. (And 
that is possible.) The scope of our work must include this aspect, if 
the work is to make a significant and lasting difference. (Rebuttals to 
these points are welcome ...)

    &quot;... those who do [participate] must come to a consensus or no
    action is taken.&quot; 

&#183; Not all of the projects of the Metagovernment community are in accord 
with this criterion. Blinap is. Which others are? Which others are not?

    &quot;One of our vanguard projects, vote-mirroring, allows us to try all
    approaches.&quot; 

&#183; I am shocked (shocked!) to see that you continue to implicitly assume 
that voting is the *only* means through which democracy can be effected. 
/Au contraire/. Blinap (for example) does not use voting, and is 
altogether democratic (even direct democratic). In the sentence above, I 
would suggest replacing &quot;all approaches&quot; with &quot;some approaches that use 
voting&quot;. {:^) [/Ned]

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thanks.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes I should send an update.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here is a fast one:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo is progressing very well.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And we are slowly learning how to make people interact while keeping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the math solid. It is not easy, but it is doable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The most recent progress was to let people see the result of their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote (in terms of graph), so they could change their vote looking for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a Nash equilibrium. This made many people understand the graph much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better. And many who used Vilfredo before and after said that it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much better now. The next main jump will be to let people ask
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarifications about proposals, and respond to them. Considering that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in Vilfredo every body must vote for every proposal, and most people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do not understand many proposals, this is also considered very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime I am aving more and more requests for help in Italy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In Italy one of the three main parties is the M5S which advocates an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> e-democracy approach. But they still don't have their platform. So the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion about how to implement eDemocracy just went over the roof.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My input in this has been a series of comments, but mostly few, well
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thought entries in my italian blog. One of them I have translated in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> English, where I present White House 2 and its derivative works (Open
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Active Democracy, yrpri.org, Better Reykjavik, ... ).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think people who are not familiar with White House 2 might find it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interesting.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For me it was important to write it up, because most people don't know
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about Jim Gilliam important contribution, and they all keep repeating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;liquid feedback&quot; as a sort of mantra.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My second post was then a thorough critic to delegated voting. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> has not been translated but is in my todo list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And then other posts. I will let you know when I translate them, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you can read them.
