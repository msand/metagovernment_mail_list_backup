</I>&gt;<i> Please read this:
</I>&gt;<i> Sponsoring organisations will be responsible for identifying the initiative(s) to be presented, and inviting the presenter(s), preparing the lab content jointly with the Council of Europe, and if possible for financing the participation of the presenters. The Council of Europe will identify moderators, as well as discussants and &#8220;challengers&#8221; for each lab.

</I>Oh! Well, I did say I have been very pressed for time recently. Apparently I had not even read the application very thoroughly. I also did not notice the last two sections of it. I will say yes to the video. And I will say no to the bit about sponsoring the lab presenters (travel, board and lodging). Perhaps I'll add a comment to that as well, that we might be able to pay our own way, but that it would be personal out-of-pocket (at least for me), and that assistance with that would be helpful. But in other regards, yes, I will certainly list us as a sponsor. Thanks, Pietro.
