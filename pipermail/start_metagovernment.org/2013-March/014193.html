<PRE>Hello, all.

I apologize that I have had so little time to contribute to this (or really to anything recently). I have added in some content to the remaining sections:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013</A>

Unfortunately, there won't be much time for feedback: I will need to submit it tomorrow. But please do tell me anything you may want to address if possible.

Concerning the debate in this thread about democratizing the bureaucracy, for now I am leaving that as &quot;out of scope&quot; at least for the topic of this forum. I'm for it in the long run, but I think the decision-making is the central fail and the place where we need to concentrate our efforts. A lot of other projects focus only on the bureaucratic aspects: what sets us apart is that we seek to change not just the mechanisms of government but the power-centers. Let those other projects do that other work for us, and let's stay focused on the hard fight. That's my take, at least.
