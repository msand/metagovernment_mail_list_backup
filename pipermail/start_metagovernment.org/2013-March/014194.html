<PRE>I can at least do a proof tomorrow (just prose) if that's needed.

Please warn on IRC before submitting, so I can save if editing.  Use
the irc.lc web client here: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/metagov/">http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/metagov/</A>

&gt;<i> Hello, all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize that I have had so little time to contribute to this (or really to anything recently). I have added in some content to the remaining sections:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/World_Forum_for_Democracy_2013</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, there won't be much time for feedback: I will need to submit it tomorrow. But please do tell me anything you may want to address if possible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the debate in this thread about democratizing the bureaucracy, for now I am leaving that as &quot;out of scope&quot; at least for the topic of this forum. I'm for it in the long run, but I think the decision-making is the central fail and the place where we need to concentrate our efforts. A lot of other projects focus only on the bureaucratic aspects: what sets us apart is that we seek to change not just the mechanisms of government but the power-centers. Let those other projects do that other work for us, and let's stay focused on the hard fight. That's my take, at least.
