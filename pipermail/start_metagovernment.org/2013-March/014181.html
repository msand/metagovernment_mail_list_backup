&quot;Micro&quot; here refers not to the scale of participation, but rather to
the granularity of issue.  A full nuclear convention is definitely a
macro-decision.  For more on micro vs. macro-scale granularity, please
see these discussions:
<A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/genassem-public-debate-of-legislation-and-caselaw-in-a-way-that-just-makes-sense/">https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/genassem-public-debate-of-legislation-and-caselaw-in-a-way-that-just-makes-sense/</A>
<A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/civiq-shows-structure-in-natural-opinion-flow-and-visualises-opinion-change-in-public-deliberations/">https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/civiq-shows-structure-in-natural-opinion-flow-and-visualises-opinion-change-in-public-deliberations/</A>

If InterMix can be used to express approval or disapproval of
macro-decisions *before* those decisions are made, and thus serve to
guide those decisions, then it's a primary system.  But I still have a
question that relates to this.  May I freely change my expression of
approval after submitting it?  Or what are the restrictions?

And do these on-the-fly changes of approval work differently in
different contexts.  Say for ordinary messages vs. messages in
decision periods?

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the hint about text vs html messages.  I will discuss with
</I>&gt;<i> Flemming and we will see what we can do.  Perhaps we should have a choice
</I>&gt;<i> up front whether the new participant prefers text or html.  Or perhaps we
</I>&gt;<i> should adopt your idea of always sending both.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Group membership is not a vote.  Rather every message can be rated for
</I>&gt;<i> approval (-3 to +3) and for interest (0 to +4).  The system calculates the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;value&quot; of each message as its average approval times its average interest,
</I>&gt;<i> so the value can run from -12 to +12.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is a facility built into InterMix which can be used as a voting
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism.  The basics are that individuals join groups and groups join
</I>&gt;<i> open-ended discussions and discussions may have &quot;decision periods&quot;.  It is
</I>&gt;<i> in the decision periods that something like primary voting occurs.  However
</I>&gt;<i> InterMix is not a yes or no voting system, so perhaps it doesn't qualify.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For instance, each of the mailing lists in this email could be a group.
</I>&gt;<i> Then the groups could join together in a discussion on &quot;Primary Voting&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Within that discussion, there might be a &quot;Decision Period&quot; on the topic
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Should we implement Vote Mirroring?&quot;.  Within the decision period, each
</I>&gt;<i> participant can enter one candidate message and there is free-form
</I>&gt;<i> discussion by replying to eachothers messages.  At the end of the decision
</I>&gt;<i> period, the candidate message with the highest value wins.  The elected
</I>&gt;<i> message is not necessarily going to say yes or no to Vote Mirroring.
</I>&gt;<i> Someone might say, first we have to have preliminary analysis.  That
</I>&gt;<i> message could be elected and so in that case, we do not get a yes or no
</I>&gt;<i> answer.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure what you mean by micro-decision.  The discussion might be
</I>&gt;<i> about nuclear disarmament and the decision period might be on the question
</I>&gt;<i> of adopting a nuclear convention.  Theoretically there is no limit to the
</I>&gt;<i> number of people who can participate.  Not exactly a micro issue, but
</I>&gt;<i> clearly InterMix is not a yes-no voting system.  It is more a way of
</I>&gt;<i> creating a consensus building collective stream of consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So if you think InterMix not suitable for inclusion, no problem.
