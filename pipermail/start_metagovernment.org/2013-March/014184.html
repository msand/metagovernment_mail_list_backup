&gt;<i> Yes, then InterMix is definitely a primary system.  The point is to
</I>&gt;<i> generate consensus while maintaining diversity.
</I>
Thanks for explaining Roger, I've added InterMix to the list:

&gt;<i> Generally you can change your approval and interest ratings.  Even during a
</I>&gt;<i> decision period, you can change your ratings for candidate messages.
</I>&gt;<i> However for candidate messages in completed decision periods, you cannot
</I>&gt;<i> change your ratings.  Results for decison periods are frozen when the
</I>&gt;<i> period ends.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Candidate messages are always the root message of a thread within a
</I>&gt;<i> decision period.  Replies to candidate messages are not limited and even
</I>&gt;<i> after the end of a decision period, you can still add new replies.  Also
</I>&gt;<i> you can continue to change your evaluation of replies indefinitely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am glad to see CiviQ and GenAssem and all the primary systems on your
</I>&gt;<i> list and feel it an excellent idea to try vote mirroring, though clearly it
</I>&gt;<i> is going to be tough, since each primary system has its own approach.
</I>
In one sense, it's easy to do vote translations.  They only have to be
best effort, because a best effort at a vote image is always a better
reflection of reality than no image at all.

Please consider joining us in our submission:
<A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/free-range-voting/">https://www.newschallenge.org/open/open-government/submission/free-range-voting/</A>
If you agree, we can add InterMix to the list of providers.  If any of
the judges are hovering, it might push us over the top. :-)

&gt;<i> On a separate issue, I discussed with Flemming the question of html vs text
</I>&gt;<i> email and we have added giving the participant the option of receiving text
</I>&gt;<i> or html to our list of things to do.  It's down the list, tho.  As far as
</I>&gt;<i> we know, almost everyone (clearly yourself excepted) uses an email reader
</I>&gt;<i> that handles html as a matter of course.
</I>
IMHO, it's better to send text alone, or multi-part.  That's what most
everyone does.  It's easier and generally it's better to follow
standards unless there's a good reason to deviate.

Many technical folks (admins, devs) who spend big time in text
terminals use Mutt.  It does not render HTML.  <A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/">http://www.mutt.org/</A>
None of the TUI-only clients render HTML:

&gt;<i> Thanks again, Mike.   If I am passing through Toronto, I will look you up
</I>&gt;<i> for sure.
</I>
Thanks Roger, I'd be pleased to meet you!

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure what you mean by micro-decision.  The discussion might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be about nuclear disarmament and the decision period might be on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; question of adopting a nuclear convention.  Theoretically there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; no limit to the number of people who can participate.  Not exactly a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; micro issue, but clearly InterMix is not a yes-no voting system.  It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; is more a way of creating a consensus building collective stream of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; consciousness.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Micro&quot; here refers not to the scale of participation, but rather to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the granularity of issue.  A full nuclear convention is definitely a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; macro-decision.  For more on micro vs. macro-scale granularity, please
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; see these discussions:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If InterMix can be used to express approval or disapproval of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; macro-decisions *before* those decisions are made, and thus serve to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guide those decisions, then it's a primary system.  But I still have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; question that relates to this.  May I freely change my expression of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approval after submitting it?  Or what are the restrictions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And do these on-the-fly changes of approval work differently in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different contexts.  Say for ordinary messages vs. messages in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision periods?
