<PRE>Steven, Jill and Sandy, (cc Metagov)

I replied to Steven separately (thanks Steven):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-March/005401.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-March/005401.html</A>


Jill, I extend the same invitation to Civic Commons. :-) I don't know
the details of your petitioning system yet, but most are primary
systems and probably the votes (signatures) can be mirrored somehow.

True, that wouldn't be primary voting.  The definition is here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:List_of_primary_voting_projects">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:List_of_primary_voting_projects</A>

It's just the petitions I was looking at: <A HREF="http://theciviccommons.com/">http://theciviccommons.com/</A>

I guess Civic Commons is trying to put healthy discussion in front of
the petitioning process.  Petitions alone aren't conducive to healthy
discussion, of course; and without that they haven't much legitimacy.
(Nor have the results of any vote.)  So here the voting system needs
the support of the discussion system.

We don't often think how the reverse might be true.  But imagine the
voting system one day said &quot;Thank you ma'am!&quot; and turned around to
support to the discussion system.  The two are going to be married
anyway, so why shouldn't they get along?

That's why I keep this list of primary voting projects.  I think
something's going to happen here in the not-too-distant future.
Although we don't have all the moves down yet, we're trying hard to
reach out to you D&amp;D folks.  When we succeed, I think you'll see that
you need us just as badly as we need you.

&gt;<i> What are the other categories you're sorting tools into?
</I>
It's only the primary voting.  The pollwiki (where the list is) is
designed for that kind of tool.  But if anyone wants to start a
different list, then I might be able to suggest a place.

Mike

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hey, ODDI folks!  I started a thread yesterday on TheCivicCommons.com, and I wanted to invite all of you to participate.  We're talking about tips and tactics for online facilitation -- but I'm also testing out the tool to see what it's like.  I thought the people in this group would be interested in both of those things as well.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Just so you know, the Civic Commons code is open source.  The Civic Commons is a new organizational member of NCDD, and some of you might have met Jill Miller Zimon (their director of partnerships) at the NCDD Seattle conference.
