Non-elitist is good, but I am also looking for effective and responsible. I think we could do better than sortition from an undefined pool. Since we're small and the potential pool is enormous, there is a very real possibility that any random group of people could insert themselves into our pool and effectively take over the organization for their own ends.

My idea is that the company itself would have employees who act as regular staff: making management decisions, doing bureaucratic tasks, etc. (e.g., filing papers, applying for grants, managing accounts). I would be the first employee (with no or deferred salary until such time as the company had a grant to pay one).

In nonprofits I have worked with in the past, the employees were relatively &quot;powerful&quot; compared to the board. But the board was still ultimately responsible for governance, and could remove any employee.

Since one of the major functions of this company would be to take in funds and disburse them; the governance becomes critically relevant. We need to be able to ensure that those funds are disbursed sensibly and responsibly.

Also, I am hopeful that if we can come up with an alternative corporate governance structure; we would provide a model that other nonprofits could use for their governance. After all, representative democracy is a poor form of governance for a charity.
