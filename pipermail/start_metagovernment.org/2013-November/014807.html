<PRE>Will there be someone in charge of keeping minutes, and someone responsible for dispersing funds that the group has decided to pay out?
If so, then they could be the secretary and the treasurer. Then we would just need a 'puppet' president to run any meetings the group decides are necessary.

It seems to me the real issue is deciding how management decisions will be made outside of having elected representatives.

</I>&gt;<i> I think the question I am asking (in order to conform to the norms here) is: how can I define a &quot;board of directors&quot; to be the group of whomever wishes to participate, and further how can that &quot;board&quot; be constructed such that it acts responsibly in controlling the company and disbursing funds?
