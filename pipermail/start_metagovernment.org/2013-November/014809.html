<PRE>Hi Ed,

I'll try to get some information from our IT gurus regarding the sync forum 
lessons learned.
Please be patient...

Cheers
Marc

Alex, in this post you mention a list synced to a forum. We've had a very 
hard time getting that to work here. If the Pirate Party has the technology 
worked out, would you/they be willing to share?

No, it can't.
It can be done &quot;for fun&quot; or &quot;symbolically&quot; for a short period of time to 
&quot;inspire&quot; or to do a &quot;proof of concept&quot;,
but otherwise it will not work.
Think of it in terms of &quot;path of least resistance&quot;.
People have
1. a life
2. there is many people on this mailinglist
3. manual processes are error-prone

thus
1. will cause people to increase their time spent on metagov and reduce 
activity in other domains
2. will need ALL participants to do so, OR else it WONT WORK
3. if not all of us who do it, do it in the exact same way, the inaccuracies 
will cause more missunderstanding and further discussion about correting the 
manual process all the time


I have real experience with this over 12 months of daily activity in a 
pirate party working group called &quot;AG GOuFP&quot;.
They have a wiki and everyone has its own profile page and they have a wiki 
where they post their summaries and they have a mailinglist which is 
automatically SYNCED to a forum.

It just does not work if you do not have the tools to &quot;reduce resistance&quot; to 
a degree, so that the &quot;path of least resistance&quot; changes.

I heartily agree (emails like this are killing us ...) lI made my suggestion 
at the bottom of the previous email of the thread (after proposal #28), and 
Alex promptly ignored my suggestion. So, my suggestion didn't work. What do 
we do?

Well, that's pretty much my point. A proposal that occurs after inline 
responses to 28 other proposals is a little difficult to notice. Could you 
perhaps present it as a standalone thread? Or perhaps present it on the wiki 
with an email pointing to it? Or perhaps this would be a good topic of 
discussion for Mike's No7 thread? I'm open to suggestion.

And apologies if you have already re-posted it and I didn't notice; I 
continue to struggle with the volume of messages, the size of the messages, 
the multiple threads, and my own sparse time. This is in itself an 
incredibly crucial issue. Good decision-making can't be done in 
sound-bytes -- but also, it can't be inclusive when it is overwhelming. I 
think unwinding this problem is key to our progress.

Still, i believe the most important thing is:
1. Start with improving email, because thats where people are (we discuss on 
this mailinglist)
2. Create an easy mechanism to &quot;copy text&quot; from the mailinglist discussion 
(a message flow) to maybe a wiki or user profile website (a static page) and 
make it possible to link the context back into the discussion.


Can this be done manually for now? The wiki has served well as a focal point 
/ summary of complex discussions. Can't we just manually work on summaries 
of complex threads there, so others can orient themselves quickly to the 
discussion, regardless of where it has moved?
