<PRE>Hi, folks.

I have been continuing to mull over the details of how to form a U.S. nonprofit to serve the interests of this global group. I am ironically stuck at the concept of governance, since the expectations here are so antithetical to our objectives.

The bylaws for a typical American nonprofit define a board of directors, and those directors typically are elected by the society membership. In other words -- representative democracy. 

Can some of you help me brainstorm/research some other ways that bylaws could be defined? I don't think there is any hard requirement for a board of directors; but as far as I know, there also is no other way it is done.

I think the question I am asking (in order to conform to the norms here) is: how can I define a &quot;board of directors&quot; to be the group of whomever wishes to participate, and further how can that &quot;board&quot; be constructed such that it acts responsibly in controlling the company and disbursing funds?
</PRE>
