<PRE>Hi Ed,

maybe the board can be appointed by sortition out of the members who want to 
participate in a board, such as in Athens some 2000 years ago ;-).  The 
board then can &quot;elect&quot; the chair, or it can be by &quot;rotation&quot; . Anyway, 
representation by sortition is not an (elitist) elected representative 
system.

Subject: [MG] Corporate governance structure

Hi, folks.

I have been continuing to mull over the details of how to form a U.S. 
nonprofit to serve the interests of this global group. I am ironically stuck 
at the concept of governance, since the expectations here are so 
antithetical to our objectives.

The bylaws for a typical American nonprofit define a board of directors, and 
those directors typically are elected by the society membership. In other 
words -- representative democracy.

Can some of you help me brainstorm/research some other ways that bylaws 
could be defined? I don't think there is any hard requirement for a board of 
directors; but as far as I know, there also is no other way it is done.

I think the question I am asking (in order to conform to the norms here) is: 
how can I define a &quot;board of directors&quot; to be the group of whomever wishes 
to participate, and further how can that &quot;board&quot; be constructed such that it 
acts responsibly in controlling the company and disbursing funds?
