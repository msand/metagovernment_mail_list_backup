<PRE>Hi Ed, Paul, Stephen,

    Ed&gt; Can some of you help me brainstorm/research some other ways that
    bylaws could be defined? I don't think there is any hard requirement
    for a board of directors; but as far as I know, there also is no
    other way it is done.

Ned&gt; Ed, back in July ...
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-July/005532.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-July/005532.html</A>
... you had the idea of having the corporate entities (including the USA 
corporate entity) be &quot;more like servants&quot; to a global group. In that 
vision, the design and operation of decision making of the global group 
can be whatever we (in the global group) agree that it should be. The 
various national corporate entities then can have &quot;standard&quot; bylaws and 
structure, since they are just rubber-stamping what the global group 
decides.

Following this vision, we then have two entirely distinct governance 
structures that we need to create: the governance structure of the 
global group, and then the governance structure of the first (of many) 
national corporate entities that will serve the global group.

So, the first order of business is to conceive/design the governance 
structure of the global group -- yes?

</I>&gt;<i> I think the question I am asking (in order to conform to the norms here) is: how can I define a &quot;board of directors&quot; to be the group of whomever wishes to participate, and further how can that &quot;board&quot; be constructed such that it acts responsibly in controlling the company and disbursing funds?
