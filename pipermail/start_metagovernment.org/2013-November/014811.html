<PRE>Try this.

The board of directors in a US corporation have the Liability.  I treat
this as centered around writing checks and voting on contracts.  If you
keep yourself covered by errors and ommisions insurance then you are
personally okay.  Well, try not to get caught in a crime redhanded.  You
probably also want a way to get a good lawyer to avoid responsibility if
your members do torts or crimes or are the targets of such.  IANAL.

So figure out who is going to  be liable.  If you are not to be clearly
liable, then there should be a clear statement in your bylaws that you do
not get to vote on some things.

At that point you can then decide what state to incorporate in and see what
the details are.  The above seems to be doable in my state at least.

Off-topic.

You are trying to do a top down.  Yah, we like to try that around here.
Everything you are trying is nonstandard and as a whole too complicated to
keep in your head.   In my state doing a nonprofit is maybe 150$.  Getting
501c3 is about 500$.  That last will give you three years to make it work.
Also you have a coop that is nonprofit or otherwise and members who may be
other corporations.  Anyway, if you are sustainable but not making a
profit, 501c3 only matters to the giver and then maybe not.  This is in my
scheme the second item to be dealt with.

Blessings,

Max
