<PRE>People,

I thought to forward this.  I note that it is US centric.  I do not support
the particular fancy voting schemes people speak about herein.   But the
document reference to Mr. Smith I think is a key local yearning of the
99%.  In that light, I am reminded of &quot;transitive voting&quot; as well as the
directionality of the possibility of again eliminating political parties.

Blessings,

Max

</I>&gt;<i> Opinion: Want to fix Washington? Change the way we vote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Published: November 1, 2013 3:16 PM
</I>&gt;<i> By ROB RICHIE AND DEVIN McCARTHY, MCT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In shutting down the government, Congress reached a new level of
</I>&gt;<i> dysfunction. While many pundits castigated individuals and parties, others
</I>&gt;<i> more insightfully focused on institutional rules, such as the role of
</I>&gt;<i> gerrymandering, closed primaries and campaign spending.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Others went further. Comparative politics scholar Juan Linz famously
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrated that presidential democracies are prone to dysfunction, which
</I>&gt;<i> the United States has largely avoided by having big tent parties that are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;diffuse&quot; and allow for internal dissent. Most healthy democracies instead
</I>&gt;<i> combine parliamentary government with legislatures elected via party list
</I>&gt;<i> forms of proportional representation. Under such rules, Germany, possessor
</I>&gt;<i> of Europe's strongest economy, just elected a broadly representative
</I>&gt;<i> legislature and is forming a functional coalition government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the shutdown underscoring the incompatibility of rigid parties with
</I>&gt;<i> our system of strong checks and balances, the Washington Post's Dylan
</I>&gt;<i> Matthews, Salon's Alex Pareene, New York Magazine's Jonathan Chait, and
</I>&gt;<i> Slate's Matthew Yglesias all blamed presidentialism or suggested switching
</I>&gt;<i> to parliamentary government. But not only does this drastic step require
</I>&gt;<i> unrealistic constitutional change, it also clashes with what makes our
</I>&gt;<i> politics truly exceptional - diffuse parties where individual legislators
</I>&gt;<i> don't just toe a party line. Most Americans dislike Congress so much today
</I>&gt;<i> because they yearn for more examples of the idealism of Mr. Smith Goes to
</I>&gt;<i> Washington.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even though we vote for individuals for Congress, we now have de facto
</I>&gt;<i> party-based elections. Ticket-splitting has all but disappeared, reflecting
</I>&gt;<i> a widening cultural and ideological gap between the parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result is a sharp decline in the number of competitive congressional
</I>&gt;<i> districts and fewer internal differences within parties. The parties'
</I>&gt;<i> traditional big tents have collapsed, leaving few remaining
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bridgebuilders&quot; able to forge compromises.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we accept such politics as inevitable, parliamentary government with
</I>&gt;<i> party lists makes sense. But rather than abandon James Madison, we call for
</I>&gt;<i> the restoration of the quintessentially American ideal of a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate-centric federal republic. With a simple statute, Congress can
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate the root cause of our party-dominated politics: winner-take-all
</I>&gt;<i> voting rules that silence the minority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The essential reform is electing House members with ranked choice voting
</I>&gt;<i> in multi-member districts. As simple as voting 1-2-3 and proven in local
</I>&gt;<i> elections, ranked choice voting rewards voters who cast sincere ballots and
</I>&gt;<i> candidates who reach out to more voters. When used in multi-member
</I>&gt;<i> districts, it guarantees more diverse representation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As shown in our 50-state plan at FairVoting.us, the House would have
</I>&gt;<i> fewer and larger districts drawn by independent commissions. Each voter
</I>&gt;<i> would have one potent vote in elections for between three and five
</I>&gt;<i> representatives, according to the district's population. Like-minded voters
</I>&gt;<i> could elect someone with about a quarter of the vote, meaning that most
</I>&gt;<i> voters would first help nominate someone in a primary and then help elect a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate in the general election.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Under our plan, every single multi-member district would likely elect
</I>&gt;<i> representatives of both major parties. When parties are more geographically
</I>&gt;<i> and ideologically diverse and when nearly all House Members share
</I>&gt;<i> constituents with representatives of the opposing party, Congress will have
</I>&gt;<i> new incentives and opportunities for cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That these changes would reduce gridlock and foster better dialogue is not
</I>&gt;<i> just conjecture. Illinois used a similar system for a century to elect its
</I>&gt;<i> House of Representatives. A 2001 commission led by former Congressman Abner
</I>&gt;<i> Mikva (D) and governor Jim Edger (R) recommended its return, lauding the
</I>&gt;<i> benefits of shared representation and more independent legislators. Former
</I>&gt;<i> Illinois comptroller Dawn Clark Netsch observed that &quot;The House had lots
</I>&gt;<i> more free-wheeling, innovative people, and (the Senate) was just like a
</I>&gt;<i> prison practically. Multi-member districts were responsible for that
</I>&gt;<i> difference.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Congressional leaders often praise the Constitution. But the best way to
</I>&gt;<i> honor the Constitution is through statutory reforms that would allow the
</I>&gt;<i> Founders' vision to work in modern politics. Let's take the bold step of
</I>&gt;<i> ending gerrymandering through the adoption of ranked choice voting by the
</I>&gt;<i> start of the new decade.
