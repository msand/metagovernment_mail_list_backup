<PRE>This is in response to David Bovill's questions to me on another thread
(Scientific Method) but I suggest this needs a new thread of its own

David,

I said I might expand on my previous. Here is the threatened expansion.

&#147;What would you say to someone (like me), who feels that they can express
their moral/ethical/political beliefs more fully, effectively and
accurately by delegating my vote to someone I trust, truly &quot;know&quot; and can
communicate with over these issues - on certain topics at least. That is I
feel, a greater sense of empowerment in terms of my beliefs, through the
act of transferring my vote this way.&#148;

My first observation is that it is suspiciously close to the self
justifying excuse provided by the authoritarians who benefit from the
existing system. These are similare to the words they attempt to put into
the mouths of their &quot;supporters&quot;. But I shall take it at face value that
you are asking the more focussed question in regard to a citizen who
genuinely prefers to delegate.

First off, there are a couple of possible interpretations of that passage.


1 You could be implying that on some issues you feel so ignorant that you
can&#146;t even trust your own opinion, and, therefore you would rather someone
else took the decisions on such issues on your behalf. Or:

2 You trust them for other reasons (shared history or whatever) and you
merely wish them to speak on your behalf because you already share their
views and opinions and have an assurance that they will vote as you
instruct.

These are, of course dramatically different situations. The first scenario
literally describes an &#147;idiot&#148;. Nothing personal here, but &#147;idiot&#148;, which
today we equate with stupidity, was originally the Athenian Greek word for
a citizen who chose not to participate in the democratic process. (Look it
up. They may refer to &#147;public life&#148; or &#147;public affairs&#148; but, in Athens,
that meant the democratic process) I&#146;m hereby reclaiming the word for use
in its proper context!

I have no problem with &#147;idiots&#148; choosing not to participate. (I strongly
oppose mandatory voting like they have in Australia. Coercive selection of
your dictator certainly doesn&#146;t render the dictatorship democratic) but
the idiot&#146;s apathy, ignorance or simple lack of self-esteem is no excuse
to prevent MY participation. Hence  the real problem with your suggestion
is the implication that because YOU (or others) may be happy to delegate I
HAVE TO delegate as well.

If you do not intend that implication and merely wish to be able &#150; as I
said in my short answer - to delegate on a personal and ad hoc basis, I
may not respect your decision, but at least you won&#146;t be finessing mine.

The second interpretation describes a pragmatic arrangement where you
trust someone to act on your behalf and can apply sanctions if they don&#146;t.
I see no philosophical objection to that providing that the citizen can
revoke their delegation without notice. The &#147;Recall&#148; systems available in
some States gets close but not close enough.

There are a couple of ways we could implement meaningful &#147;Representative&#148;
Democracy along those lines.

1 Elect &#147;Mandated Delegates&#148; (think &#147;party caucus&#148;) rather than
&#147;Representatives&#148; who are obliged, on every issue, to canvas their
constituency for opinions and then cast precisely the number of votes for
each side of the argument as they received in response. (e.g. 123.456
votes in favour, 234,567 votes against) and global decisions are made by
tallying up the totals.

This still requires/encourages direct participation in the decision making
process by the citizen, even if it is limited to an occasional online
ballot, and is the weakest form I would personally find acceptable. It has
the advantage that decisions will not be impeded by lack of participation.
If, for example, no one responds to the canvassing, then the Delegate is
free to make up his own mind. But they can only cast a single vote!

2 Elect &#147;Representatives&#148; who have slightly more leeway. We allow them to
vote in line with a pre-election manifesto, without further consultation.
Oblige them to canvas as above in the event of issues arising which
weren&#146;t covered by their manifesto.

In either case, have a mechanism for instant recall if the majority of
citizens can be persuaded that the Delegate/Representative has either
failed to obey those simple rules or, even though they have obey the
rules, they&#146;re seen to be ineffective representatives of the citizens.

So yes, I would say you ARE at least one third &#147;wrong to see this as
better, more democratic, more effective way for me to express my political
opinion?&#148; It might be, for you, &#147;better&#148; and &#147;more effective&#148; but it can&#146;t
be argued to be &#147;more democratic&#148;.

However, that's nit picking. What matters are that if and when you make
such a decision to delegate, you do so without coercion and on the basis
of informed consent; that you do so on an ad hoc basis which you can
revoke at any time for any reason, and that your decision to delegate
doesn&#146;t require MY compliance. If you can meet those conditions, then a)
you would still be making a choice I would disapprove of but it would
clearly be your free and informed choice and b) it wouldn't constrain
anyone else's choice.

I concede that arrangements along the above lines might be easier to
achieve mass support for than a full blown switch to genuine participatory
democracy, but there is no reason why we can&#146;t build both systems
simultaneously. Even small scale participation would be useful in
influencing the mass opinions (which would be reflected in the
canvassing), especially in this medium (the web) and, when it is seen to
have such influence, we can expect the levels of participation to grow
quite naturally.

I also concede that there may even be a long term role for &#147;Politicians&#148;
whose principle role in life is leading the public debate on a wide
variety of issues. Merely &#147;leading the debate&#148; is uncontentious, so long
as We The People always get the last word.

Finally, with regard to your second question: &#147;Have you seen any positive
consequences of voting in small groups around a table - that is an
intrinsic value for the act of voting rather than debate, discussion and
consensus forming?&#148;

The second part of the question is ambiguous (&quot;that&quot; confuses the
meaning), but I can most certainly endorse the first. As you may already
be aware, I am a strong advocate of the Jury System (Athenian style, not
modern) and have argued for radical revision of the Powers of a Jury as a
&#147;a
href=<A HREF="http://stottle.blogspot.com/2006/02/shortcut-to-democracy.html">http://stottle.blogspot.com/2006/02/shortcut-to-democracy.html</A>&gt;Shortcut
to Democracy&lt;/a&gt;&#148;

Small groups are where we get the most involvement. There is evidence
somewhere I can&#146;t be arsed to trace that the perfect group size for
&#147;maximum involvement&#148; is just 6. In other words, almost no one is so &#147;shy&#148;
they&#146;re inhibited within a group of 6, so if we allow for groups that
small, and citizens can choose the group size that suits them, we&#146;ll
mazimise the meaningful direct participation in the decision making
process.

Personally I prefer debating in a group of about 10 or 12, I think you get
a wider range of opinions and experience without sacrificing the &#147;cosy&#148;
and comforting aspect of the small group. Not everybody would be satisfied
but the vast majority could form ad hoc or persistent groups of whatever
size they preferred, in which to conduct whatever intensity of debate they
felt comfortable with.

Then they need to transmit their questions or conclusions to the wider
group. This would logically take place on the web, probably in some kind
of pyramid structure which allowed through the best expressions of each
unique proposal, for discussion in other groups. I would imagine debates
would &#147;cycle&#148; for a few days or weeks, depending on the significance of
what was being discussed. Ideas from all directions would be discussed up,
down and across the pyramid with a view to forming consensus.

I think that may cover the second part of your question: &#147;that is an
intrinsic value for the act of voting rather than debate, discussion and
consensus forming?&#148; but you'll have to confirm that for me.

Cheers

Harry



&gt;<i> Harry, you triggered my interest here. I've a question for you, designed
</I>to
&gt;<i> redirect the debate away from historical, and larger scale political
</I>analysis, and towards a more direct, personal and human scale - as such it
&gt;<i> is also a way of thinking that can help explore how to design better
</I>tools,
&gt;<i> how they look, feel and are used by an individual. Just a shift - not
</I>everything.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact there are two questions I have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. What would you say to someone (like me), who feels that they can
</I>express their moral/ethical/political beliefs more fully, effectively
&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>    accurately by delegating my vote to someone I trust, truly &quot;know&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i>    communicate with over these issues - on certain topics at least. That
</I>&gt;<i> is I
</I>&gt;<i>    feel, a greater sense of empowerment in terms of my beliefs, through
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>    act of transferring my vote this way. This is only in part because i
</I>&gt;<i> know
</I>&gt;<i>    my practical limitations - I don't have the time to get as familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i>    the debate as i would like, but largely because I respect the
</I>qualities
&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>    deep knowledge of the person I met, and am happy to use him as a tool
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i>    my political expression. Am I deluded? Am I wrong to see this as
</I>&gt;<i> better,
</I>&gt;<i>    more democratic, more effective way for me to express my political
</I>&gt;<i> opinion?
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Have you seen any positive consequences of voting in small groups
</I>around a table - that is an intrinsic value for the act of voting
&gt;<i> rather
</I>&gt;<i>    than debate, discussion and consensus forming?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best, and look forward to hearing your thoughts,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David
