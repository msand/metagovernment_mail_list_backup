<PRE>Not quite :)

I was the one of the first people to use the term along side a guy called
John Donoso who coined it independently in the States. I'd been working on
the theory and software implementations since around 1989, in which I was
interested initially in using LD to reform peer review in science, and
later worked exclusively on it for a few years around 2003 (when I
registered the LD domains), and gave a number of presentations in Vienna,
Berlin, Sweden and London.

Form me the theory, and software side is not my emphasis - it's the social,
physical meeting space, and legal aspects that I'm concentrating on - they
are the areas I think need cracking first - the small scale local factors.

I asked the question because I would like to know how someone passionate
about direct democracy feels / fears / doubts about the act of delegation
in it's purist form, and secondly how someone feels about the act of voting
if they are a passionate advocate of consensus.
