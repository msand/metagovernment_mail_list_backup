<PRE>Dear Harry and Russell,

&gt;<i> that's made it a bit clearer but still not quite crystal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You appear to be saying that the issue of timing - when the vote is
</I>&gt;<i> put - is critical. My initial impression was that you were concerned
</I>&gt;<i> with content - the actual question being put.
</I>
I mean the form of the vote - time, place, method, etc. - is critical.
More precisely, the imposition of any particular form will invalidate
the content for purposes of decision making.  I think formal voting is
necessary (see below), but it is also necessary that no particular
form be imposed on anyone.

&gt;<i> You also, however, appear to be alluding to some means of
</I>&gt;<i> structuring the debate where voting becomes an integral part of that
</I>&gt;<i> structure. You've probably explained that in some detail in previous
</I>&gt;<i> posts which I haven't read but I suspect we're not that far apart.
</I>
We both emphasize the centrality of communication among the decision
makers, and so our thoughts seem to run in parallel here.  But I think
we are still some distance apart.  I see no likelihood of such
communication happening without the structural support of the formal
vote.  By this I do not mean support for any particular process of
decision making (you spoke of &quot;process votes&quot;) but rather personal
support for the individual in society at large.  Without a vote firmly
in hand, the individual will find little opportunity to communicate
with others on matters of politics.  It may appear to us that the
citizen abstains from politics out of apathy (as in contemporary
democracies) or is forcefully excluded (as in tyrannies), but the
technical cause in both cases is the same and the political result is
the same; the individual is dispossessed of the vote and is thereby
dispossessed of political freedom.

I hope to research and develop this argument here, at some point:

&gt;<i> Politics is a process by which groups of people make collective

</I>&gt;<i> political decisions become much more autocratic. However if that
</I>&gt;<i> decisions can make cooperative manner with the consensus of

</I>&gt;<i> mean sharing the resources. Share culture lead to fairer world.
</I>&gt;<i> There are some societies have those sharing culture.
</I>
Applying scientific methods of resource management will make us more
like small groups of hunter gatherers?  I agree that the competences
of small groups are what we need to develop and harness, but I'm
doubtful that the practices of science can bring this about.  They can
help to us reach an understanding of nature, but that is not the same
thing as a mutual understanding with our social fellows.  Small groups
can already accomplish this, and they do it without science.

Anyway, here are some more video essays by Curtis.  These are not as
artful as his latest, but they concern historical attempts at the
restructuring of society using methods that were inspired by a faith
or enthusiasm for science: <A HREF="http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/pandoras-box">http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/pandoras-box</A>

</I>&gt;<i> content - the actual question being put.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Generally speaking, in those democratic forums which actually work (from
</I>&gt;<i> the Spanish Anarchist Trade Union assemblies through to Capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> boardrooms) the aim is not to &quot;need&quot; a vote at all because the debating
</I>&gt;<i> process achieves consensus. Thus voting only takes place when it becomes
</I>&gt;<i> clear that agreement cannot be reached but there remains a consensus that,
</I>&gt;<i> nevertheless, a formal decision needs to be made. In other words &quot;timing&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> falls out of the debating process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You also, however, appear to be alluding to some means of structuring the
</I>&gt;<i> debate where voting becomes an integral part of that structure. You've
</I>&gt;<i> probably explained that in some detail in previous posts which I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> read but I suspect we're not that far apart.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have no objection to &quot;process votes&quot; which take place along the way.
</I>&gt;<i> They are implied by my draft algorithm. If, for instance, an objection is
</I>&gt;<i> raised to minor aspects of a proposal, my &quot;priority of dissent&quot; rule would
</I>&gt;<i> ensure that the objection is heard and must be addressed with a suitable
</I>&gt;<i> answer. I would imagine that, on many occasions, despite overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> assent that the objection has been satisfactorily answered, the objector
</I>&gt;<i> may fail to accept the obvious and continue to repeat the objection.
</I>&gt;<i> Process voting would be a necessary mechanism to ensure the debating
</I>&gt;<i> process could not be hijacked by obsessive individuals.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key issue then arises of what level of support a process vote would
</I>&gt;<i> require to move the debate along. I would make the same case for that
</I>&gt;<i> hurdle being a high number (90% ish) as I would for final adoption of any
</I>&gt;<i> democratic policy, on the basis that if you cannot even be sure that the
</I>&gt;<i> vast majority are content with the fairness of the process, you've got no
</I>&gt;<i> chance of having a vast majority content with the policy which emerges at
</I>&gt;<i> the end of the process...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [Michael Allan said:]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks Harry, for your frank reply.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with the relatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; straightforward requirement, within the decision making process, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; describe might help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that's a good example in itself: we simply ask the participants
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to declare a preference from time to time.  This might require a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formalization of the process (voting) and this is where the danger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would come in, that we formalize the process in such a manner that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restrict its timing, say.  So we choose when to ask the question and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when to receive the answer, and the subject does not.  By removing the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; form of expression from the subject's hands, the content (his or her
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressed preference) is drained of meaning.  It is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legitimate as a basis of decision.  And yet we take it for that very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purpose.  This is a mild example of what I mean.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The loss of legitimacy mirrors the subject's loss of control over the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content.  Speaking more generally, he or she becomes less like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; subject of the process and more like an object to be manipulated by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.  These manipulations actually occur, of course, and where the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fruits of power are at stake, as in elections, they occur to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; extreme.  Their force rests on an equally extreme technical flaw in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the formalization of the vote, namely its physical removal from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voter's hands.  Do you see what I mean?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; More importantly, I'm focussed (in this context) on the principle of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; appropriate use of the &quot;scientific method&quot; and it's role in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision making process. The point is to ensure that the debating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; process (which is vastly more important than the voting process) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;forced&quot; to include all intelligent aspects of the debate, including
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all shades and sources of dissent, (even the irrational) before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decisions are made, optimally by consensus. (Voting is &quot;only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; necessary where we fail to achieve consensus and thus represents a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;failure&quot; of the debating process)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I fear that we have no hope of equal access to such debates without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the structural guarantees of the vote, in particular its guarantees of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ubiquity and equality.  I would even argue that the proper purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the vote (held by each of us like a key) is to unlock access to all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those areas and aspects of society in which equal opportunity is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; paramount, most especially to political communications.  It is not a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fallback, but rather a first step.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For witness, consider that the political decisions in today's society
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are *already* made on the basis of elaborate discussion and debate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is not the internal conduct of those communications but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the lack of access to them.  The doors to the &quot;debate hall&quot; are well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; guarded and even the vast majority of elected politicians are barred,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to say nothing of electors.  Isn't that a fact?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I haven't read Curtis' essay, but I have got (and watched) his 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; part TV series of the same name. Does his essay say anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; different?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I did mean the video.  I think it says a lot about the hazards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of objectivity and the scientific method in the context of politics.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's the link again, in case others want to watch it:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We (just as we are) must discuss (just as we do) what future we want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The reason we fail to do this, the reason we cannot even imagine doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it, is that we lack the necessary vote to formalize our right to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As a consequence, our future is in the hands of uncontrollable forces
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which (since we no longer believe in gods) we see as machines.

</I>&gt;<i> culture. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you will get clear idea by reading bellow
</I>&gt;<i> article from Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropological overview 
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropologists&#160;have found that social stratification
</I>&gt;<i> is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, &quot;Assumptions
</I>&gt;<i> about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal,
</I>&gt;<i> that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social
</I>&gt;<i> stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples.&quot;[14]&#160;Non-stratified&#160;egalitarian&#160;or&#160;acephalous&#160;(&quot;headless&quot;) societies exist
</I>&gt;<i> which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic
</I>&gt;<i> status, class, or even permanent leadership.
</I>&gt;<i> [edit]Kinship-orientation
</I>&gt;<i> Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as &quot;kinship-oriented,&quot; because they appear to
</I>&gt;<i> value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted
</I>&gt;<i> with economically oriented cultures (including&#160;states) in which status
</I>&gt;<i> and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and conflict
</I>&gt;<i> are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social
</I>&gt;<i> hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could
</I>&gt;<i> lead to conflict and instability.[citation
</I>&gt;<i> needed]&#160;Reciprocal
</I>&gt;<i> altruism&#160;is one
</I>&gt;<i> process by which this is accomplished.
</I>&gt;<i> A good example is given by&#160;Richard Borshay
</I>&gt;<i> Lee&#160;in his account of
</I>&gt;<i> the&#160;Khoisan, who practices&#160;&quot;insulting the meat.&quot;&#160;Whenever a hunter makes a kill, he is
</I>&gt;<i> ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to prevent him
</I>&gt;<i> from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then distributed
</I>&gt;<i> evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter. The level
</I>&gt;<i> of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out when he
</I>&gt;<i> purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and was
</I>&gt;<i> teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat could be
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted as showing off).[15]
</I>&gt;<i> Another example is the&#160;Indigenous
</I>&gt;<i> Australians&#160;of&#160;Groote Eylandt&#160;and&#160;Bickerton Island, off
</I>&gt;<i> the coast of&#160;Arnhem Land, who have
</I>&gt;<i> arranged their entire society, spirituality, and economy around a kind of&#160;gift economy&#160;called&#160;renunciation.&#160;According to&#160;David H. Turner, in
</I>&gt;<i> this arrangement, every person is expected to give&#160;everything&#160;of any resource they have to any other
</I>&gt;<i> person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely
</I>&gt;<i> eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However,
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal&#160;renunciative economics&#160;with the competition/scarcity-oriented&#160;economics&#160;introduced
</I>&gt;<i> to Australia by Anglo-European colonists.[16]&#160;See also the&#160;Original affluent society.
</I>&gt;<i> [edit]Social impact
</I>&gt;<i> Social stratification has been shown to cause many social
</I>&gt;<i> problems. A comprehensive study of major world economies revealed that
</I>&gt;<i> homicide, infant mortality, obesity, teenage pregnancies, emotional depression,&#160;teen suicide, and
</I>&gt;<i> prison population all correlate with higher social inequality.[17]
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;
</I>&gt;<i> So once we stop
</I>&gt;<i> stratification process by removing the scarcity with the basic needs fulfillment
</I>&gt;<i> lead to less social problems. Less social problems mean less politics. 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. I think
</I>&gt;<i> most common concern problem for people are basic needs. Once we full filled
</I>&gt;<i> that challenge, then there are less common concern problems. If there are any
</I>&gt;<i> common concern problems, we have to address that issue. For that we have to
</I>&gt;<i> have a mechanism such as electronic direct democracy.
