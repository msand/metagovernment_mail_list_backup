<PRE>Ed,

I think you're over complicating things.

The key thing is that the decision making infrastructure is in place and
available for use by anyone who gives a shit. As I said in my previous, I
have no problem with &quot;idiots&quot; (those who choose not to participate in the
democratic process) providing their choice to abstain doesn't preclude my
choice to participate.

But those occasions on which we choose to participate will vary hugely.
The only mandatory requirement is that anyone proposing change MUST
publicise it in such a way that anyone who might be affected by the change
has time and opportunity to participate if they wish.


&gt;<i> Hi, folks. Sorry for my low participation. I'd like to step into this
</I>&gt;<i> conversation around the point where Michael and Harry are discussing the
</I>&gt;<i> development of consensus, the participation process, and the voting
</I>&gt;<i> process. (Sorry, there is nothing I can directly quote which is
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate to my reply.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where I get lost in this conversation is in the idea of consensus as an
</I>&gt;<i> active process for all members of society. This is a wonderful idea, and
</I>&gt;<i> something that makes a lot of sense for major issues like &quot;should we go to
</I>&gt;<i> war,&quot; but I fail to see how it applies in the grand scale that we envision
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any person's daily life, there are societal and governance decisions
</I>&gt;<i> being made at many levels many times a day. Think of all of the levels of
</I>&gt;<i> government (township, city, county, province, country, and more) and then
</I>&gt;<i> all of the decision-making bodies within each one of those: people
</I>&gt;<i> deciding where to build a bridge, what tax to levy on imports of rice,
</I>&gt;<i> which shrubs to plant in a park, what level of benefits to extend to
</I>&gt;<i> veterans, and so on. (Then of course, there are the non-governmental
</I>&gt;<i> organizations/decisions that also may have significant influence on your
</I>&gt;<i> life.) The number of decisions is functionally equivalent to infinite:
</I>&gt;<i> there is no possible way any individual can participate in every decision
</I>&gt;<i> that affects them, let alone give it deep thought and work toward a
</I>&gt;<i> universal consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense is that we are focused on enabling and encouraging any individual
</I>&gt;<i> to participate in decisions whenever the related issues rise to the level
</I>&gt;<i> of significance that that individual wishes to influence the decision. In
</I>&gt;<i> every other case, individuals need to be content with letting others
</I>&gt;<i> manage those decisions... taking comfort from the fact that if they don't
</I>&gt;<i> like the way it is going, they can hop into the discussion and immediately
</I>&gt;<i> be empowered to influence it.
