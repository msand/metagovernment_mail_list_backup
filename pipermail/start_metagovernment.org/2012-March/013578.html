<PRE>Dear Harry, Russell and Ed,

Harry and Russell, my argument in this thread is that we cannot (in
fact or right) dictate the form of voting, any more than we could
dictate the form of free speech.  Whatever decision system we employ
(whether of your design or another) it will remain open to the dissent
and contradiction of free subjects.

I would then expand on this and claim that no decision system in a
modern society (one that values freedom) can be decisive in itself.
It must always depend on the ratifying legitimacy of a public that
stands freely *outside of it*.  More generally, no authority in that
society is exempt from overrule in the court of public opinion, and
there is no getting around this fact (this right) except by the
illegitimate use of force to suppress free expression.  Do you see
what I mean?

Harry, I could answer your critique of my other ideas at length in a
separate thread, if you wish.  Here I answer only briefly:

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;It was only ever a technical design flaw that precluded this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; development in the first place, and brought us instead to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; present situation where the organized parties make the decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and exercise the rightful power and political freedom that were
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intended for the citizens.&quot;
</I>
Harry said:
&gt;<i> This suggests you believe that the designers intended the citizens
</I>&gt;<i> to have their &quot;rightful power and political freedom&quot;. ...
</I>
Partly I do, but I do not believe that our traditional electoral
systems were designed in any deliberate sense.  Certain modifications
were deliberate, such as the secret ballot, but those deliberations
were conducted in public (more so than today).  More generally, there
is far too much human folly on display in history to lend credence to
the notion of a plot by a conspiracy of competent designers.  I think
we are all just stumbling forward and learning by our mistakes.

The right of freedom that I mention is one that is widely recognized
and respected in modern societies.  This is one of the characteristics
that distinguish these societies from others, past and present.

&gt;<i> ... This impression is strengthened by your frequent implied
</I>&gt;<i> conflation of &quot;decision&quot; with &quot;election result&quot;.
</I>
I think that equating &quot;decision&quot; with &quot;election result&quot; is a flaw of
the electoral system, or better yet, of how we employ it.  I say that
&quot;no valid decision may be extracted from its results&quot;:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht#fla">http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht#fla</A>

&gt;<i> I trod a similar route nearly 40 years ago when I too believed the
</I>&gt;<i> problem was with the electoral system and all we needed to do was
</I>&gt;<i> tweak that. ...
</I>
I do not speak of solutions in that thesis.  Its implication that the
electoral system is flawed in itself and could be fixed is misleading.
I agree that the solution lies outside of it.  (So perhaps does the
flaw, if only by omission.)

Russell said:
&gt;<i> Scientific method is a solution to avoid the human interference on
</I>&gt;<i> technical issues. What are the reasons people cannot always
</I>&gt;<i> interfere in technical issues?  1. Nobody can master all technical
</I>&gt;<i> issues (lack of knowledge) 2. People are bias and irrational
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Apathy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway technical issues must subject to basic moral value
</I>&gt;<i> framework. Basic value frame work of course we people must create
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Once we have the basic value framework, people interference on
</I>&gt;<i> technical issues no longer necessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other problem is we cannot trust experts.  Therefore we should have
</I>&gt;<i> system to analyze technical issues independent from technocrats and
</I>&gt;<i> the human opinion. Both problems, we can easily overcome by
</I>&gt;<i> independent scientific method software for analyze the technical
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>
As long as people generally agree to such a system and are happy with
the resulting distribution of resources, then I think it has a good
chance of success.  It might be independent of subjective interference
in its daily operations, but overall it cannot escape the judgement of
public opinion.  Right?

Further, if public opinion judges the system to be good and society
decides therefore to keep it, then it would disprove the notion that
people are ignorant, irrational or apathetic by nature.  I think much
depends on disproving this.

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> In any person's daily life, there are societal and governance
</I>&gt;<i> decisions being made at many levels many times a day. Think of all
</I>&gt;<i> of the levels of government (township, city, county, province,
</I>&gt;<i> country, and more) and then all of the decision-making bodies within
</I>&gt;<i> each one of those: people deciding where to build a bridge, what tax
</I>&gt;<i> to levy on imports of rice, which shrubs to plant in a park, what
</I>&gt;<i> level of benefits to extend to veterans, and so on. (Then of course,
</I>&gt;<i> there are the non-governmental organizations/decisions that also may
</I>&gt;<i> have significant influence on your life.) The number of decisions is
</I>&gt;<i> functionally equivalent to infinite: there is no possible way any
</I>&gt;<i> individual can participate in every decision that affects them, let
</I>&gt;<i> alone give it deep thought and work toward a universal consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My sense is that we are focused on enabling and encouraging any
</I>&gt;<i> individual to participate in decisions whenever the related issues
</I>&gt;<i> rise to the level of significance that that individual wishes to
</I>&gt;<i> influence the decision. In every other case, individuals need to be
</I>&gt;<i> content with letting others manage those decisions... taking comfort
</I>&gt;<i> from the fact that if they don't like the way it is going, they can
</I>&gt;<i> hop into the discussion and immediately be empowered to influence
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
I think this is exactly right.  Our current arrangements restrict the
crucial discussions to groups who are not themselves the most affected
or concerned by the issues, and therefore not the most qualified by
right to influence them.  This is essentially a problem of access.

Maybe such access is the true purpose of voting.  Political issues
cannot be decided by voting, to be sure, neither in the first place
nor in the end.  They can only be decided by prior and subsequent
communications.  Yet the vote is ideally suited to serve as a key to
the entry of those communications.  Its essential strengths in this
regard are its equality and its ubiquity, which are exactly what is
missing in terms of access (it being unequal and localized).  But if
the vote is to convey these missing properties to the doorstep of the
discussion, then it must be a vote that is actually held in one's
hands, almost like a key is held.  The vote that I receive at the
polling station, hold briefly, and then hand back will not suffice
here; it provides for nothing but its own entry to the ballot box
where it then has no influence on the decision.  It is largely
worthless except as the symbol of an ideal.

So this is one way of underwriting the trust that your model of
participation requires.  We each take the &quot;key&quot; of access into our own
hands.  Combined with all the other freedoms and conveniences that
modern society offers to the individual, each of us can then be
confident of discovering a personally suitable means of entering the
discussion.  The vote's ubiquity (like putting change in everybody's
pockets) is the guarantor of eventually finding a suitable means of
entry for each person, while its equality is the assurance of therein
finding political freedom.

This last point connects back to the topic of the thread.  No freedom
is ever partial, but it always depends on recognizing an equal freedom
in each and every other.  What results from this inter-subjective
attitude is a communicative form of reason that transcends all
narrower forms (the objectifying cognitive-instrumental, the norm
conformative moral-practical and the expressive aesthetic-practical).
This communicative reason cannot be objectified and systematically
captured, which is why no decision system can be legitimately decisive
in itself.  It always depends on ratification in the independent court
of public opinion, which is the sphere of political freedom.
