<PRE>Hello David,

I have the impression that you are not familiar with the &#8220;Liquid democracy&#8221; idea? (part 1 of your question)

Harry, you triggered my interest here. I've a question for you, designed to redirect the debate away from historical, and larger scale political analysis, and towards a more direct, personal and human scale - as such it is also a way of thinking that can help explore how to design better tools, how they look, feel and are used by an individual. Just a shift - not everything.  

In fact there are two questions I have: 
  1.. What would you say to someone (like me), who feels that they can express their moral/ethical/political beliefs more fully, effectively and accurately by delegating my vote to someone I trust, truly &quot;know&quot; and can communicate with over these issues - on certain topics at least. That is I feel, a greater sense of empowerment in terms of my beliefs, through the act of transferring my vote this way. This is only in part because i know my practical limitations - I don't have the time to get as familiar with the debate as i would like, but largely because I respect the qualities and deep knowledge of the person I met, and am happy to use him as a tool for my political expression. Am I deluded? Am I wrong to see this as better, more democratic, more effective way for me to express my political opinion?

  2.. Have you seen any positive consequences of voting in small groups around a table - that is an intrinsic value for the act of voting rather than debate, discussion and consensus forming?
All the best, and look forward to hearing your thoughts,

David
