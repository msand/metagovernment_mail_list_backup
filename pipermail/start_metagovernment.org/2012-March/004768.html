<PRE>Greetings Harry,

&gt;<i> &quot;... a large part of the personal ethical decision making process - after
</I>&gt;<i> all the evidence has been digested - is still subjective ...
</I>
I guess the subjective component is essential to any agreement because
the subject is the sole authority.  Nobody can say whether I agree or
disagree, only I the subject.

&gt;<i> ... and the only way we can &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to
</I>&gt;<i> measure it. The only fair way to treat the results of such
</I>&gt;<i> measurement is to give them equal weight, regardless of how each
</I>&gt;<i> opinion was arrived at.&quot;
</I>
One danger in objectifying assent (or dissent) is the illusion that we
can hold the resulting object in hand.  It might tempt the technician
to physically remove the *form* of assent from the subject's hands in
order to get a better grasp of it.  At that point, however, the
reality of the content dissolves.  (I believe this is our current
predicament in society.)  Conversely, if the objectification or
formalization of assent has the effect of putting it more firmly in
the subject's hands, then its reality is strengthened.

&gt;<i> What I think I'd like you to focus on is my proposed algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> because the point of that is to prioritise Dissent. i.e.to make it a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;constitutional requirement&quot; a) to allow (and to hear dissent) and
</I>&gt;<i> b) to answer it and establish agreement that it has been answered
</I>&gt;<i> satisfactorily before moving on to any decisions about the base
</I>&gt;<i> proposition.
</I>

I agree that expressions of dissent ought not to be suppressed.  By
the same token, expressions of dissent and assent ought positively to
be enabled in the first place.  Currently they are not enabled and I
think the best way forward is to put the means of their expression in
the hands of individual subjects.  Do you agree?

I want to recommend this essay by Adam Curtis, if you haven't seen it.
It's about looking at others and ourselves objectively:

&gt;<i> Comrades, greetings,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I rarely stick my oar in (not least because you're still conducting the
</I>&gt;<i> debate in this bizarre format rather than a proper forum) but this title
</I>&gt;<i> grabbed my attention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I may have pointed this out in earlier days as I notice that it refers to
</I>&gt;<i> to the Metascore project.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please take some time to check out
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.fullmoon.nu/rtpforum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=868#868">http://www.fullmoon.nu/rtpforum/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=868#868</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is the lengthy reply I made to an ex Anarchist professor who is a
</I>&gt;<i> member of my own forum, when he argued that human beings are not suited to
</I>&gt;<i> democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The piece deals with a number of the fundamental issues at the core of the
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment project. Here are some headline issues:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * variation in intellect and ability
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * hard wiring to follow the herd
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * the dangers of meritocracy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * the Real problem with Democracy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Formal structures for deciding propositions
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Prioritisation of Dissent
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Debating Algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Why Revolutions/revolutionaries fail
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Ethical basis of democracy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But specifically it deals with the &quot;Scientific Method&quot; issue as
</I>&gt;<i> illustrated by this quote:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Democracy falls out of that ethical system because it exposes the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that a large part of the personal ethical decision making process - after
</I>&gt;<i> all the evidence has been digested - is still subjective; and the only way
</I>&gt;<i> we can &quot;objectify&quot; subjective opinion is to measure it. The only fair way
</I>&gt;<i> to treat the results of such measurement is to give them equal weight,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of how each opinion was arrived at.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and explains why an agreed policy is more important than a &quot;correct&quot; one,
</I>&gt;<i> thus:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Even the consensus I advocate doesn't detect &quot;right answers&quot;. All we can
</I>&gt;<i> detect is agreement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By definition, Democracy produces greater levels of agreement than the
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives and the Consensual Democracy I'm advocating will produce the
</I>&gt;<i> highest achievable levels of agreement. And agreement is MUCH more
</I>&gt;<i> important than being &quot;correct&quot;. The absence of agreement is, after all,
</I>&gt;<i> what produces Conflict.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I think I'd like you to focus on is my proposed algorithm because the
</I>&gt;<i> point of that is to prioritise Dissent. i.e.to make it a &quot;constitutional
</I>&gt;<i> requirement&quot; a) to allow (and to hear dissent) and b) to answer it and
</I>&gt;<i> establish agreement that it has been answered satisfactorily before moving
</I>&gt;<i> on to any decisions about the base proposition.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dissent is where the empirical arguments (scientific method) should be
</I>&gt;<i> focussed. It should be a mandatory requirement to seek scientific
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge regarding a proposition; to mandate research where such
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge does not yet exist and to ensure that propositions do not
</I>&gt;<i> conflict with the scientific knowledge. And please note that I am
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately using the phrase &quot;scientific knowledge&quot; as opposed to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;scientific opinion&quot;. The science that forms part of a democratic debate
</I>&gt;<i> should be that which has already achieved consensus in the scientific
</I>&gt;<i> community, otherwise their &quot;opinion&quot; is no more valid than anyone elses.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Russel,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Before looking at your proposed solution, I want to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem as you see it.  Is it the following?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   A. Political decisions are based on opinion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   B. Opinion is a poor basis for political decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If so, what is your evidence for A?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; arrive at decision instead of human opinion. However present world we

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use human opinion for decision making process because we are so familiar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opinion based decision making process, but gradual introduction
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; scientific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; method of decision making process to replace the human opinion based
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decision
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; making process will lead to have more accurate and fair resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Even in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; classical resource based economic model human opinion may relevant for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; extend for advance research programs. We cannot use scientific method in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; current representative democratic system because that will lead to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; dictatorship. Therefore we must have participatory democracy, before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; even think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; about resource based economy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; My thinking is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; transition from plutocratic capitalist political system to more humane
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; resource
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; based economy that not use money can be done through digital direct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; democratic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; platform.&#194;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First let the people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; decide what kind of challenges get opinion base decision making process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; which challenges are arrive at decision by scientific method. For
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; example
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; foreign policy, security must need a human opinion based decision making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; process. However food, water, transportation and housing can be managed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; intelligent resource management through scientific method with minimal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Scientific method of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; social concern:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#194;&#183;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160; State the problem- Recognizing a new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; idea or problem that needs to be resolved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &#194;&#183;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160;&#194;&#160; Gather information- The use of logical

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; world through observation and state the conclusion. &#194;&#160;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opinion is biased, irrational and sometime no common sense. On the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; hand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; scientific method is easy, no biases at all and logical conclusion can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; achieved very effective and efficient manner. The main advantage that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the scientific method on direct democracy is majority of the issues can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; resolved by simple scientific method software platform. As a result it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; reduce the complexity of direct democracy process. Most of human
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; challenges are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; technical. So scientific method is the best tool to resolve our

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Governance
