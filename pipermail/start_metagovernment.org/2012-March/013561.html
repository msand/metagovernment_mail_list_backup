<PRE>Hi Michael,
Politics is a process by which groups of people make
collective decisions, according to Wikipedia meaning. If that group is small,
political decisions become much more autocratic. However if that decisions can
make cooperative manner with the consensus of majority, then politics become
much more democratic. 
Anthropologically we had less stratified societies as
hunter gathers. The main method to remove the stratification is sharing. I mean
sharing the resources. Share culture lead to fairer world.&#160; There are some societies have those sharing
culture. 
I think you will get clear idea by reading bellow
article from Wikipedia.
Anthropological overview 
Anthropologists&#160;have found that social stratification
is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes, &quot;Assumptions
about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be universal,
that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social
stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer peoples.&quot;[14]&#160;Non-stratified&#160;egalitarian&#160;or&#160;acephalous&#160;(&quot;headless&quot;) societies exist
which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic
status, class, or even permanent leadership.
[edit]Kinship-orientation
Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as &quot;kinship-oriented,&quot; because they appear to
value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are contrasted
with economically oriented cultures (including&#160;states) in which status
and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and conflict
are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social
hierarchies from developing because they believe that such stratification could
lead to conflict and instability.[citation
needed]&#160;Reciprocal
altruism&#160;is one
process by which this is accomplished.
A good example is given by&#160;Richard Borshay
Lee&#160;in his account of
the&#160;Khoisan, who practices&#160;&quot;insulting the meat.&quot;&#160;Whenever a hunter makes a kill, he is
ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to prevent him
from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then distributed
evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter. The level
of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out when he
purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and was
teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat could be
interpreted as showing off).[15]
Another example is the&#160;Indigenous
Australians&#160;of&#160;Groote Eylandt&#160;and&#160;Bickerton Island, off
the coast of&#160;Arnhem Land, who have
arranged their entire society, spirituality, and economy around a kind of&#160;gift economy&#160;called&#160;renunciation.&#160;According to&#160;David H. Turner, in
this arrangement, every person is expected to give&#160;everything&#160;of any resource they have to any other
person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely
eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However,
misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile Aboriginal&#160;renunciative economics&#160;with the competition/scarcity-oriented&#160;economics&#160;introduced
to Australia by Anglo-European colonists.[16]&#160;See also the&#160;Original affluent society.
[edit]Social impact
Social stratification has been shown to cause many social
problems. A comprehensive study of major world economies revealed that
homicide, infant mortality, obesity, teenage pregnancies, emotional depression,&#160;teen suicide, and
prison population all correlate with higher social inequality.[17]
&#160;
So once we stop
stratification process by removing the scarcity with the basic needs fulfillment
lead to less social problems. Less social problems mean less politics. 
2. I think
most common concern problem for people are basic needs. Once we full filled
that challenge, then there are less common concern problems. If there are any
common concern problems, we have to address that issue. For that we have to
have a mechanism such as electronic direct democracy.

Hi Russel,

&gt;<i> I just want to emphasize that scientific method in resource
</I>&gt;<i> management and scientific method use in politics as a system
</I>&gt;<i> approach is different. Scientific theories use for our politics are
</I>&gt;<i> dangerous and counterproductive.&#160; When people basic needs are met
</I>&gt;<i> politics is less important. Once resources manage according to
</I>&gt;<i> scientific method and basic needs of the people are fulfill, then
</I>&gt;<i> politics become less and less important matter for the people. Our
</I>&gt;<i> most of challenges are technical, not political. Present political
</I>&gt;<i> systems want to show everything is political. That is not true. Our
</I>&gt;<i> politics is fail due to resource management failure rather than
</I>&gt;<i> political failure.
</I>
Politics is about power, which means force and threat of force.&#160; This
is brought out in Curtis's video essay, for example.&#160; Do you know of
an example where people's basic needs were fulfilled and politics
became less important in their society?

What about decision making on issues of common concern?&#160; Would there
be less need of that, too?

</I>&gt;<i>&#160; 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks Harry, for your frank reply.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with the relatively
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; straightforward requirement, within the decision making process, to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference (which
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; describe might help.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that's a good example in itself: we simply ask the participants
</I>&gt;<i> to declare a preference from time to time.&#160; This might require a
</I>&gt;<i> formalization of the process (voting) and this is where the danger
</I>&gt;<i> would come in, that we formalize the process in such a manner that we
</I>&gt;<i> restrict its timing, say.&#160; So we choose when to ask the question and
</I>&gt;<i> when to receive the answer, and the subject does not.&#160; By removing the
</I>&gt;<i> form of expression from the subject's hands, the content (his or her
</I>&gt;<i> expressed preference) is drained of meaning.&#160; It is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate as a basis of decision.&#160; And yet we take it for that very
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.&#160; This is a mild example of what I mean.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The loss of legitimacy mirrors the subject's loss of control over the
</I>&gt;<i> content.&#160; Speaking more generally, he or she becomes less like a
</I>&gt;<i> subject of the process and more like an object to be manipulated by
</I>&gt;<i> it.&#160; These manipulations actually occur, of course, and where the
</I>&gt;<i> fruits of power are at stake, as in elections, they occur to the
</I>&gt;<i> extreme.&#160; Their force rests on an equally extreme technical flaw in
</I>&gt;<i> the formalization of the vote, namely its physical removal from the
</I>&gt;<i> voter's hands.&#160; Do you see what I mean?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; More importantly, I'm focussed (in this context) on the principle of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appropriate use of the &quot;scientific method&quot; and it's role in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision making process. The point is to ensure that the debating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process (which is vastly more important than the voting process) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;forced&quot; to include all intelligent aspects of the debate, including
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all shades and sources of dissent, (even the irrational) before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisions are made, optimally by consensus. (Voting is &quot;only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary where we fail to achieve consensus and thus represents a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;failure&quot; of the debating process)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I fear that we have no hope of equal access to such debates without
</I>&gt;<i> the structural guarantees of the vote, in particular its guarantees of
</I>&gt;<i> ubiquity and equality.&#160; I would even argue that the proper purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the vote (held by each of us like a key) is to unlock access to all
</I>&gt;<i> those areas and aspects of society in which equal opportunity is
</I>&gt;<i> paramount, most especially to political communications.&#160; It is not a
</I>&gt;<i> fallback, but rather a first step.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For witness, consider that the political decisions in today's society
</I>&gt;<i> are *already* made on the basis of elaborate discussion and debate.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is not the internal conduct of those communications but
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of access to them.&#160; The doors to the &quot;debate hall&quot; are well
</I>&gt;<i> guarded and even the vast majority of elected politicians are barred,
</I>&gt;<i> to say nothing of electors.&#160; Isn't that a fact?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I haven't read Curtis' essay, but I have got (and watched) his 3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; part TV series of the same name. Does his essay say anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I did mean the video.&#160; I think it says a lot about the hazards
</I>&gt;<i> of objectivity and the scientific method in the context of politics.
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the link again, in case others want to watch it:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace">http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/all-watched-over-by-machines-of-loving-grace</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We (just as we are) must discuss (just as we do) what future we want.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason we fail to do this, the reason we cannot even imagine doing
</I>&gt;<i> it, is that we lack the necessary vote to formalize our right to it.
</I>&gt;<i> As a consequence, our future is in the hands of uncontrollable forces
</I>&gt;<i> which (since we no longer believe in gods) we see as machines.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know what:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; One danger in objectifying assent (or dissent) is the illusion that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; can hold the resulting object in hand.&#160; It might tempt the technician
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to physically remove the *form* of assent from the subject's hands in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; order to get a better grasp of it.&#160; At that point, however, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reality of the content dissolves.&#160; (I believe this is our current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; predicament in society.)&#160; Conversely, if the objectification or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; formalization of assent has the effect of putting it more firmly in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the subject's hands, then its reality is strengthened.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the one hand it sounds like my own attempts at describing the &quot;Limits
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of Perception&quot; (Chapters 3/4 of my book) and, on the other it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quasi-quantum mechanics. Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the relatively straightforward requirement, within the decision making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process, to ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (which is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
