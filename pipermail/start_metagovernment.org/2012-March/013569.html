<PRE>David,

short answer (I'm currently on one of my customer sites):

I have no problem at all with delegation provided a) it's ad hoc and b)
conscious.

For example, ask me to pronounce on the merits of a proposed new anti
cancer treatment, and I'll happily defer to an appropriately experienced
medic with a proven track record in the field. But a) I'm only delegating
to that specified individual for that specified question and b) I
understand and accept the consequences which may flow from that
delegation.

I'll probably expand on that later...

&gt;<i> Harry, you triggered my interest here. I've a question for you, designed
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> redirect the debate away from historical, and larger scale political
</I>&gt;<i> analysis, and towards a more direct, personal and human scale - as such it
</I>&gt;<i> is also a way of thinking that can help explore how to design better
</I>&gt;<i> tools,
</I>&gt;<i> how they look, feel and are used by an individual. Just a shift - not
</I>&gt;<i> everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In fact there are two questions I have:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. What would you say to someone (like me), who feels that they can
</I>&gt;<i>    express their moral/ethical/political beliefs more fully, effectively
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>    accurately by delegating my vote to someone I trust, truly &quot;know&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i>    communicate with over these issues - on certain topics at least. That
</I>&gt;<i> is I
</I>&gt;<i>    feel, a greater sense of empowerment in terms of my beliefs, through
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i>    act of transferring my vote this way. This is only in part because i
</I>&gt;<i> know
</I>&gt;<i>    my practical limitations - I don't have the time to get as familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i>    the debate as i would like, but largely because I respect the qualities
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>    deep knowledge of the person I met, and am happy to use him as a tool
</I>&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;<i>    my political expression. Am I deluded? Am I wrong to see this as
</I>&gt;<i> better,
</I>&gt;<i>    more democratic, more effective way for me to express my political
</I>&gt;<i> opinion?
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Have you seen any positive consequences of voting in small groups
</I>&gt;<i>    around a table - that is an intrinsic value for the act of voting
</I>&gt;<i> rather
</I>&gt;<i>    than debate, discussion and consensus forming?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All the best, and look forward to hearing your thoughts,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> David
