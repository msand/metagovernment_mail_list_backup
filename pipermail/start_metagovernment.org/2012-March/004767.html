<PRE>This was posted to the Metagovernment Community Page:

Hi
We have prepared a Proposal for launching an Institute-Website for
promoting Democracy in Iran. The Institute will work more in the field of
Introducing the Parties, Surveying and Polling.
The Information that will be published through the website, is for polling
from 3 categories: General Public, Parties and Experts. In fact, the main
basis of the proposal is the following:

One: Declaring the clear and the accurate positions and Opinions by Parties
about Policies for Iran&#8217;s ideal governmence, such as:
Constitution
Governence Framework
Economic
Social
Cultural and Religius
Scientific and Artistic
Military and Security Policies

Two: Polling based on these declared opinions.

Some Moduels of the Proposal are:
1. &#8220;Constitution&#8217;s Editor&#8221; that is provided to Parties and faciliates
documanting the Constitution.
2. &#8220;User Match Test&#8221; with the declared positions of the Parties
3. &#8220;Per Day Question Poll&#8221;
4. &#8220;Constitution Poll&#8221;
5. Poll Tracker
6. ...
As you may know, there is not any Institute to provide such services to
Iranians and I made sure about that after consultation with some expert.
Success Factor of the Proposal is in participation and involvement of the
whole Iranian Parties and groups and undoubtedly it will not happen without
cooperation and association of Political Parties and International
Institutes and Organizations.
For this reason, I intend to introduce the Plan to you in addition to get
consults in order to better implimentation.
Business Plan and Strategic Plan is prepared and I can sent it to you if
interested.
For reviewing the Business Model and more information please use these
links:

&#183; Screen-shots and Information are in Persian.
&#183; For graphical representation and better understanding, as well as
specifying the activity field, I used a prestigious Website in this field.

If possible please tell me what is your opinion about this plan?
What kind of Professional, Technological or other kind of assistance is
possible for your organization?
