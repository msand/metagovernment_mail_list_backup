<PRE>Hi, folks. Sorry for my low participation. I'd like to step into this conversation around the point where Michael and Harry are discussing the development of consensus, the participation process, and the voting process. (Sorry, there is nothing I can directly quote which is appropriate to my reply.)

Where I get lost in this conversation is in the idea of consensus as an active process for all members of society. This is a wonderful idea, and something that makes a lot of sense for major issues like &quot;should we go to war,&quot; but I fail to see how it applies in the grand scale that we envision collaborative governance.

In any person's daily life, there are societal and governance decisions being made at many levels many times a day. Think of all of the levels of government (township, city, county, province, country, and more) and then all of the decision-making bodies within each one of those: people deciding where to build a bridge, what tax to levy on imports of rice, which shrubs to plant in a park, what level of benefits to extend to veterans, and so on. (Then of course, there are the non-governmental organizations/decisions that also may have significant influence on your life.) The number of decisions is functionally equivalent to infinite: there is no possible way any individual can participate in every decision that affects them, let alone give it deep thought and work toward a universal consensus.

My sense is that we are focused on enabling and encouraging any individual to participate in decisions whenever the related issues rise to the level of significance that that individual wishes to influence the decision. In every other case, individuals need to be content with letting others manage those decisions... taking comfort from the fact that if they don't like the way it is going, they can hop into the discussion and immediately be empowered to influence it.

</PRE>
