<PRE>Thanks Harry, for your frank reply.

&gt;<i> ... Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with the relatively
</I>&gt;<i> straightforward requirement, within the decision making process, to
</I>&gt;<i> ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference (which
</I>&gt;<i> is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
</I>&gt;<i> describe might help.
</I>
Maybe that's a good example in itself: we simply ask the participants
to declare a preference from time to time.  This might require a
formalization of the process (voting) and this is where the danger
would come in, that we formalize the process in such a manner that we
restrict its timing, say.  So we choose when to ask the question and
when to receive the answer, and the subject does not.  By removing the
form of expression from the subject's hands, the content (his or her
expressed preference) is drained of meaning.  It is no longer
legitimate as a basis of decision.  And yet we take it for that very
purpose.  This is a mild example of what I mean.

The loss of legitimacy mirrors the subject's loss of control over the
content.  Speaking more generally, he or she becomes less like a
subject of the process and more like an object to be manipulated by
it.  These manipulations actually occur, of course, and where the
fruits of power are at stake, as in elections, they occur to the
extreme.  Their force rests on an equally extreme technical flaw in
the formalization of the vote, namely its physical removal from the
voter's hands.  Do you see what I mean?

&gt;<i> More importantly, I'm focussed (in this context) on the principle of
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate use of the &quot;scientific method&quot; and it's role in the
</I>&gt;<i> decision making process. The point is to ensure that the debating
</I>&gt;<i> process (which is vastly more important than the voting process) is
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;forced&quot; to include all intelligent aspects of the debate, including
</I>&gt;<i> all shades and sources of dissent, (even the irrational) before
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are made, optimally by consensus. (Voting is &quot;only&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> necessary where we fail to achieve consensus and thus represents a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;failure&quot; of the debating process)
</I>
I fear that we have no hope of equal access to such debates without
the structural guarantees of the vote, in particular its guarantees of
ubiquity and equality.  I would even argue that the proper purpose of
the vote (held by each of us like a key) is to unlock access to all
those areas and aspects of society in which equal opportunity is
paramount, most especially to political communications.  It is not a
fallback, but rather a first step.

For witness, consider that the political decisions in today's society
are *already* made on the basis of elaborate discussion and debate.
The problem is not the internal conduct of those communications but
the lack of access to them.  The doors to the &quot;debate hall&quot; are well
guarded and even the vast majority of elected politicians are barred,
to say nothing of electors.  Isn't that a fact?

&gt;<i> I haven't read Curtis' essay, but I have got (and watched) his 3
</I>&gt;<i> part TV series of the same name. Does his essay say anything
</I>&gt;<i> different?
</I>
Sorry, I did mean the video.  I think it says a lot about the hazards
of objectivity and the scientific method in the context of politics.
Here's the link again, in case others want to watch it:

We (just as we are) must discuss (just as we do) what future we want.
The reason we fail to do this, the reason we cannot even imagine doing
it, is that we lack the necessary vote to formalize our right to it.
As a consequence, our future is in the hands of uncontrollable forces
which (since we no longer believe in gods) we see as machines.

&gt;<i> Michael greetings

</I>&gt;<i> I don't know what:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One danger in objectifying assent (or dissent) is the illusion that we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can hold the resulting object in hand.  It might tempt the technician
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to physically remove the *form* of assent from the subject's hands in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to get a better grasp of it.  At that point, however, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reality of the content dissolves.  (I believe this is our current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; predicament in society.)  Conversely, if the objectification or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; formalization of assent has the effect of putting it more firmly in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the subject's hands, then its reality is strengthened.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> means!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> On the one hand it sounds like my own attempts at describing the &quot;Limits
</I>&gt;<i> of Perception&quot; (Chapters 3/4 of my book) and, on the other it sounds like
</I>&gt;<i> quasi-quantum mechanics. Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with
</I>&gt;<i> the relatively straightforward requirement, within the decision making
</I>&gt;<i> process, to ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference
