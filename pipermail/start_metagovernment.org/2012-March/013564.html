<PRE>Greetings Michael

I read your &quot;Structural Fault&quot; page. Now I understand the confusion
between us over the importance of &quot;the vote&quot;.

I agree with your sentiments but not your analysis. The chief flaw is
historical:

&quot;It was only ever a technical design flaw that precluded this   
development in the first place, and brought us instead to the present
situation where the organized parties make the decisions and exercise the
rightful power and political freedom that were intended for the citizens.&quot;

This suggests you believe that the designers intended the citizens to have
their &quot;rightful power and political freedom&quot;. This impression is
strengthened by your frequent implied conflation of &quot;decision&quot; with
&quot;election result&quot;.

This belief is not just misplaced in the United States, but in every
country on the planet with the notable and sole exception of Switzerland
which, though not perfect by any stretch, does allow its citizens to make
REAL decisions - not just play bit parts in elections.

ALL other existing national political systems are designed to prevent
democracy. (The US Constitution explicitly so) And part of the means of
prevention is to label those existing systems democratic. Whether that is
done in genuine ignorance of what democracy is, or, more cynically, as a
routine Platonist mechanism to try to fool citizens into believing they
already live in democracies we can leave as an exercise for the class.

In any case what we're up against is NOT a &quot;technical design flaw&quot; but a
political strategy and we will get nowhere trying to modify their design.

I trod a similar route nearly 40 years ago when I too believed the problem
was with the electoral system and all we needed to do was tweak that. As a
result, I spent several years campaigning for electoral reform.

Then I began to learn about democracy and realised that the electoral
system was primarily designed to prevent it, or, in historical terms, to
resist any pressure to implement it.

What we have seen over the past couple of thousand years is the VERY slow
spread of power from absolute monarchs, to elite bodies which retain ALL
the powers of the absolute monarchs. The membership of those elite bodies
(parliaments, congresses, knessets etc) has expanded from dozens to a few
hundreds and the means of elevation to those bodies has varied from
nomination to elections, but when you compare that tiny progress in the
equalisation of power to the progress we've made in other social areas,
you begin to understand how well the ruling classes have maintained their
grip on society.

Democracy has absolutely NOTHING to do with elections. Elections only
decide membership of the elite bodies who retain absolute power. Democracy
is ONLY about &quot;We The People&quot; being the decision makers - NOT electing
people to make decisions on our behalf. Which is not to say that you can't
have elections within a democracy, but those elections are for people to
IMPLEMENT the policy not to DECIDE it.

I rather thought that was the whole point of the meta government project
and why I became interested in it in the first place.

Now, you can make very strong arguments against the implementation of
Democracy as a social decision making process, but this is not an issue
for us as, presumably, we're all signed up to this project because we've
accepted the case for democracy rather than against.

I am, therefore, no longer remotely interested in the electoral voting
procedure. Society's continual focus on that is merely a distraction from
the Social Decision Making process we should be talking about - where
voting is actually a sign of failure, though occasionally necessary
because we have failed to reach any consensus other than &quot;a decision is
required.&quot;

That, I thought, was the chief aim of the meta-government project. If I'm
wrong about that, I apologise for wasting yours or anyone else's time!

Regards

Harry


&gt;<i> Dear Harry and Russell,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Harry said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that's made it a bit clearer but still not quite crystal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You appear to be saying that the issue of timing - when the vote is put
</I>- is critical. My initial impression was that you were concerned with
content - the actual question being put.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I mean the form of the vote - time, place, method, etc. - is critical.
</I>More precisely, the imposition of any particular form will invalidate
the content for purposes of decision making.  I think formal voting is
necessary (see below), but it is also necessary that no particular form
be imposed on anyone.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You also, however, appear to be alluding to some means of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structuring the debate where voting becomes an integral part of that
</I>structure. You've probably explained that in some detail in previous
posts which I haven't read but I suspect we're not that far apart.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We both emphasize the centrality of communication among the decision
</I>makers, and so our thoughts seem to run in parallel here.  But I think
we are still some distance apart.  I see no likelihood of such
&gt;<i> communication happening without the structural support of the formal
</I>vote.  By this I do not mean support for any particular process of
decision making (you spoke of &quot;process votes&quot;) but rather personal
support for the individual in society at large.  Without a vote firmly
in hand, the individual will find little opportunity to communicate with
others on matters of politics.  It may appear to us that the citizen
abstains from politics out of apathy (as in contemporary democracies) or
is forcefully excluded (as in tyrannies), but the technical cause in
both cases is the same and the political result is the same; the
individual is dispossessed of the vote and is thereby dispossessed of
political freedom.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope to research and develop this argument here, at some point:
</I><A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht">http://zelea.com/project/autonomy/a/fau/fau.xht</A>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Russell said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Politics is a process by which groups of people make collective
</I>decisions, according to Wikipedia meaning. If that group is small,
political decisions become much more autocratic. However if that
decisions can make cooperative manner with the consensus of
&gt;&gt;<i> majority, then politics become much more democratic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthropologically we had less stratified societies as hunter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gathers. The main method to remove the stratification is sharing. I
</I>mean sharing the resources. Share culture lead to fairer world. There
are some societies have those sharing culture.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Applying scientific methods of resource management will make us more
</I>like small groups of hunter gatherers?  I agree that the competences of
small groups are what we need to develop and harness, but I'm doubtful
that the practices of science can bring this about.  They can help to us
reach an understanding of nature, but that is not the same thing as a
mutual understanding with our social fellows.  Small groups can already
accomplish this, and they do it without science.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, here are some more video essays by Curtis.  These are not as
</I>artful as his latest, but they concern historical attempts at the
restructuring of society using methods that were inspired by a faith or
enthusiasm for science: <A HREF="http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/pandoras-box">http://thoughtmaybe.com/video/pandoras-box</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is critical. My initial impression was that you were concerned with
</I>content - the actual question being put.
&gt;&gt;<i> Generally speaking, in those democratic forums which actually work
</I>(from
&gt;&gt;<i> the Spanish Anarchist Trade Union assemblies through to Capitalist
</I>boardrooms) the aim is not to &quot;need&quot; a vote at all because the debating
process achieves consensus. Thus voting only takes place when it
becomes
&gt;&gt;<i> clear that agreement cannot be reached but there remains a consensus that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nevertheless, a formal decision needs to be made. In other words &quot;timing&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> falls out of the debating process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You also, however, appear to be alluding to some means of structuring the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debate where voting becomes an integral part of that structure. You've
</I>probably explained that in some detail in previous posts which I
haven't
&gt;&gt;<i> read but I suspect we're not that far apart.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have no objection to &quot;process votes&quot; which take place along the way.
</I>They are implied by my draft algorithm. If, for instance, an objection
is
&gt;&gt;<i> raised to minor aspects of a proposal, my &quot;priority of dissent&quot; rule would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ensure that the objection is heard and must be addressed with a
</I>suitable
&gt;&gt;<i> answer. I would imagine that, on many occasions, despite overwhelming
</I>assent that the objection has been satisfactorily answered, the
objector
&gt;&gt;<i> may fail to accept the obvious and continue to repeat the objection.
</I>Process voting would be a necessary mechanism to ensure the debating
process could not be hijacked by obsessive individuals.
&gt;&gt;<i> The key issue then arises of what level of support a process vote would
</I>require to move the debate along. I would make the same case for that
hurdle being a high number (90% ish) as I would for final adoption of
any
&gt;&gt;<i> democratic policy, on the basis that if you cannot even be sure that
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> vast majority are content with the fairness of the process, you've got no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chance of having a vast majority content with the policy which emerges at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the end of the process...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [Michael Allan said:]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks Harry, for your frank reply.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ... Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with the relatively
</I>straightforward requirement, within the decision making process, to
ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference (which
is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
describe might help.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that's a good example in itself: we simply ask the participants
</I>to declare a preference from time to time.  This might require a
formalization of the process (voting) and this is where the danger
would come in, that we formalize the process in such a manner that we
restrict its timing, say.  So we choose when to ask the question and
when to receive the answer, and the subject does not.  By removing
the
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; form of expression from the subject's hands, the content (his or her
</I>expressed preference) is drained of meaning.  It is no longer
legitimate as a basis of decision.  And yet we take it for that very
purpose.  This is a mild example of what I mean.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The loss of legitimacy mirrors the subject's loss of control over the
</I>content.  Speaking more generally, he or she becomes less like a
subject of the process and more like an object to be manipulated by
it.  These manipulations actually occur, of course, and where the
fruits of power are at stake, as in elections, they occur to the
extreme.  Their force rests on an equally extreme technical flaw in
the formalization of the vote, namely its physical removal from the
voter's hands.  Do you see what I mean?
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; More importantly, I'm focussed (in this context) on the principle of
</I>appropriate use of the &quot;scientific method&quot; and it's role in the
decision making process. The point is to ensure that the debating
process (which is vastly more important than the voting process) is
&quot;forced&quot; to include all intelligent aspects of the debate, including
all shades and sources of dissent, (even the irrational) before
decisions are made, optimally by consensus. (Voting is &quot;only&quot;
necessary where we fail to achieve consensus and thus represents a
&quot;failure&quot; of the debating process)
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I fear that we have no hope of equal access to such debates without
</I>the structural guarantees of the vote, in particular its guarantees
of
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ubiquity and equality.  I would even argue that the proper purpose of
</I>the vote (held by each of us like a key) is to unlock access to all
those areas and aspects of society in which equal opportunity is
paramount, most especially to political communications.  It is not a
fallback, but rather a first step.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; For witness, consider that the political decisions in today's society
</I>are *already* made on the basis of elaborate discussion and debate.
The problem is not the internal conduct of those communications but
the lack of access to them.  The doors to the &quot;debate hall&quot; are well
guarded and even the vast majority of elected politicians are barred,
to say nothing of electors.  Isn't that a fact?
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I haven't read Curtis' essay, but I have got (and watched) his 3
</I>part TV series of the same name. Does his essay say anything
different?
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry, I did mean the video.  I think it says a lot about the hazards
</I>of objectivity and the scientific method in the context of politics.
Here's the link again, in case others want to watch it:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; We (just as we are) must discuss (just as we do) what future we want.
</I>The reason we fail to do this, the reason we cannot even imagine
doing
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it, is that we lack the necessary vote to formalize our right to it.
</I>As a consequence, our future is in the hands of uncontrollable forces
which (since we no longer believe in gods) we see as machines.

</I>some societies have those sharing
&gt;&gt;<i> culture.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think you will get clear idea by reading bellow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> article from Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthropological overview
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthropologists&#160;have found that social stratification
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not the standard among all societies. John Gowdy writes,
</I>&quot;Assumptions
&gt;&gt;<i> about human behaviour that members of market societies believe to be
</I>universal,
&gt;&gt;<i> that humans are naturally competitive and acquisitive, and that social
</I>stratification is natural, do not apply to many hunter-gatherer
peoples.&quot;[14]&#160;Non-stratified&#160;egalitarian&#160;or&#160;acephalous&#160;(&quot;headless&quot;)
societies exist
&gt;&gt;<i> which have little or no concept of social hierarchy, political or economic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> status, class, or even permanent leadership.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [edit]Kinship-orientation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anthropologists identify egalitarian cultures as &quot;kinship-oriented,&quot;
</I>because they appear to
&gt;&gt;<i> value social harmony more than wealth or status. These cultures are
</I>contrasted
&gt;&gt;<i> with economically oriented cultures (including&#160;states) in which status
</I>and material wealth are prized, and stratification, competition, and
conflict
&gt;&gt;<i> are common. Kinship-oriented cultures actively work to prevent social
</I>hierarchies from developing because they believe that such
&gt;&gt;<i> stratification could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lead to conflict and instability.[citation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed]&#160;Reciprocal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> altruism&#160;is one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process by which this is accomplished.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A good example is given by&#160;Richard Borshay
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Lee&#160;in his account of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the&#160;Khoisan, who practices&#160;&quot;insulting the meat.&quot;&#160;Whenever a hunter
</I>makes
&gt;&gt;<i> a kill, he is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ceaselessly teased and ridiculed (in a friendly, joking fashion) to
</I>prevent him
&gt;&gt;<i> from becoming too proud or egotistical. The meat itself is then
</I>distributed
&gt;&gt;<i> evenly among the entire social group, rather than kept by the hunter.
</I>The level
&gt;&gt;<i> of teasing is proportional to the size of the kill. Lee found this out
</I>when he
&gt;&gt;<i> purchased an entire cow as a gift for the group he was living with, and
</I>was
&gt;&gt;<i> teased for weeks afterward about it (since obtaining that much meat
</I>could be
&gt;&gt;<i> interpreted as showing off).[15]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Another example is the&#160;Indigenous
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Australians&#160;of&#160;Groote Eylandt&#160;and&#160;Bickerton Island, off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the coast of&#160;Arnhem Land, who have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> arranged their entire society, spirituality, and economy around a kind
</I>of&#160;gift economy&#160;called&#160;renunciation.&#160;According to&#160;David H. Turner, in
this arrangement, every person is expected to give&#160;everything&#160;of any
resource they have to any other
&gt;&gt;<i> person who needs or lacks it at the time. This has the benefit of largely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> eliminating social problems like theft and relative poverty. However,
</I>misunderstandings obviously arise when attempting to reconcile
&gt;&gt;<i> Aboriginal&#160;renunciative economics&#160;with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> competition/scarcity-oriented&#160;economics&#160;introduced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Australia by Anglo-European colonists.[16]&#160;See also the&#160;Original
</I>affluent society.
&gt;&gt;<i> [edit]Social impact
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Social stratification has been shown to cause many social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems. A comprehensive study of major world economies revealed that
</I>homicide, infant mortality, obesity, teenage pregnancies, emotional
depression,&#160;teen suicide, and
&gt;&gt;<i> prison population all correlate with higher social inequality.[17] &#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So once we stop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stratification process by removing the scarcity with the basic needs
</I>fulfillment
&gt;&gt;<i> lead to less social problems. Less social problems mean less politics.
</I>2. I think
&gt;&gt;<i> most common concern problem for people are basic needs. Once we full
</I>filled
&gt;&gt;<i> that challenge, then there are less common concern problems. If there
</I>are any
&gt;&gt;<i> common concern problems, we have to address that issue. For that we
</I>have
&gt;&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have a mechanism such as electronic direct democracy.
