<PRE>It sounds like we are basically agreeing: at least I agree with most of what you say below. Earlier in your and Michael's writing, I thought I saw references to consensus as if it were a society-wide thing. And I just want to make sure that you acknowledge that that's not really possible for any but the largest issues.

In most cases, consensus is mostly about consent of the passive majority and consensus of the active minority. Even within a small group (I see this even in a 5-member group I participate in), it is often the case that on many issues, most of the group members are willing to go along with the thought-leader. We both agree (right?) that there's no problem with that, as long as that leader is not empowered to rule over the others, but is only empowered by their temporary and easily-withdrawable consent.

In any event, I would not agree with the characterization of non-participants as &quot;idiots.&quot; Some people are passionate about economics... many more are passionate about football. I may not understand the motivations of others, but if they want to spend their social participation capital on arguing over which team is the best, that's their right. If all we did as a society was make society perfect and efficient, we'd not have much to live for.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, folks. Sorry for my low participation. I'd like to step into this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> conversation around the point where Michael and Harry are discussing the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development of consensus, the participation process, and the voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. (Sorry, there is nothing I can directly quote which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate to my reply.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Where I get lost in this conversation is in the idea of consensus as an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> active process for all members of society. This is a wonderful idea, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that makes a lot of sense for major issues like &quot;should we go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> war,&quot; but I fail to see how it applies in the grand scale that we envision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any person's daily life, there are societal and governance decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being made at many levels many times a day. Think of all of the levels of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government (township, city, county, province, country, and more) and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all of the decision-making bodies within each one of those: people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deciding where to build a bridge, what tax to levy on imports of rice,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which shrubs to plant in a park, what level of benefits to extend to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> veterans, and so on. (Then of course, there are the non-governmental
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organizations/decisions that also may have significant influence on your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> life.) The number of decisions is functionally equivalent to infinite:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no possible way any individual can participate in every decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that affects them, let alone give it deep thought and work toward a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> universal consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My sense is that we are focused on enabling and encouraging any individual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to participate in decisions whenever the related issues rise to the level
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of significance that that individual wishes to influence the decision. In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every other case, individuals need to be content with letting others
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manage those decisions... taking comfort from the fact that if they don't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like the way it is going, they can hop into the discussion and immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be empowered to influence it.
