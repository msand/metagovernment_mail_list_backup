<PRE>Harry, you triggered my interest here. I've a question for you, designed to
redirect the debate away from historical, and larger scale political
analysis, and towards a more direct, personal and human scale - as such it
is also a way of thinking that can help explore how to design better tools,
how they look, feel and are used by an individual. Just a shift - not
everything.

In fact there are two questions I have:

   1. What would you say to someone (like me), who feels that they can
   express their moral/ethical/political beliefs more fully, effectively and
   accurately by delegating my vote to someone I trust, truly &quot;know&quot; and can
   communicate with over these issues - on certain topics at least. That is I
   feel, a greater sense of empowerment in terms of my beliefs, through the
   act of transferring my vote this way. This is only in part because i know
   my practical limitations - I don't have the time to get as familiar with
   the debate as i would like, but largely because I respect the qualities and
   deep knowledge of the person I met, and am happy to use him as a tool for
   my political expression. Am I deluded? Am I wrong to see this as better,
   more democratic, more effective way for me to express my political opinion?
   2. Have you seen any positive consequences of voting in small groups
   around a table - that is an intrinsic value for the act of voting rather
   than debate, discussion and consensus forming?

All the best, and look forward to hearing your thoughts,

David
