<PRE>Michael

that's made it a bit clearer but still not quite crystal.

You appear to be saying that the issue of timing  - when the vote is put -
is critical. My initial impression was that you were concerned with
content - the actual question being put.

Generally speaking, in those democratic forums which actually work (from
the Spanish Anarchist Trade Union assemblies through to Capitalist
boardrooms) the aim is not to &quot;need&quot; a vote at all because the debating
process achieves consensus. Thus voting only takes place when it becomes
clear that agreement cannot be reached but there remains a consensus that,
nevertheless, a formal decision needs to be made. In other words &quot;timing&quot;
falls out of the debating process.

You also, however, appear to be alluding to some means of structuring the
debate where voting becomes an integral part of that structure. You've
probably explained that in some detail in previous posts which I haven't
read but I suspect we're not that far apart.

I have no objection to &quot;process votes&quot; which take place along the way.
They are implied by my draft algorithm. If, for instance, an objection is
raised to minor aspects of a proposal, my &quot;priority of dissent&quot; rule would
ensure that the objection is heard and must be addressed with a suitable
answer. I would imagine that, on many occasions, despite overwhelming
assent that the objection has been satisfactorily answered, the objector
may fail to accept the obvious and continue to repeat the objection.
Process voting would be a necessary mechanism to ensure the debating
process could not be hijacked by obsessive individuals.

The key issue then arises of what level of support a process vote would
require to move the debate along. I would make the same case for that
hurdle being a high number (90% ish) as I would for final adoption of any
democratic policy, on the basis that if you cannot even be sure that the
vast majority are content with the fairness of the process, you've got no
chance of having a vast majority content with the policy which emerges at
the end of the process...



&gt;<i> Thanks Harry, for your frank reply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with the relatively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> straightforward requirement, within the decision making process, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> describe might help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that's a good example in itself: we simply ask the participants
</I>&gt;<i> to declare a preference from time to time.  This might require a
</I>&gt;<i> formalization of the process (voting) and this is where the danger
</I>&gt;<i> would come in, that we formalize the process in such a manner that we
</I>&gt;<i> restrict its timing, say.  So we choose when to ask the question and
</I>&gt;<i> when to receive the answer, and the subject does not.  By removing the
</I>&gt;<i> form of expression from the subject's hands, the content (his or her
</I>&gt;<i> expressed preference) is drained of meaning.  It is no longer
</I>&gt;<i> legitimate as a basis of decision.  And yet we take it for that very
</I>&gt;<i> purpose.  This is a mild example of what I mean.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The loss of legitimacy mirrors the subject's loss of control over the
</I>&gt;<i> content.  Speaking more generally, he or she becomes less like a
</I>&gt;<i> subject of the process and more like an object to be manipulated by
</I>&gt;<i> it.  These manipulations actually occur, of course, and where the
</I>&gt;<i> fruits of power are at stake, as in elections, they occur to the
</I>&gt;<i> extreme.  Their force rests on an equally extreme technical flaw in
</I>&gt;<i> the formalization of the vote, namely its physical removal from the
</I>&gt;<i> voter's hands.  Do you see what I mean?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> More importantly, I'm focussed (in this context) on the principle of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate use of the &quot;scientific method&quot; and it's role in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision making process. The point is to ensure that the debating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process (which is vastly more important than the voting process) is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;forced&quot; to include all intelligent aspects of the debate, including
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all shades and sources of dissent, (even the irrational) before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions are made, optimally by consensus. (Voting is &quot;only&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary where we fail to achieve consensus and thus represents a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;failure&quot; of the debating process)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I fear that we have no hope of equal access to such debates without
</I>&gt;<i> the structural guarantees of the vote, in particular its guarantees of
</I>&gt;<i> ubiquity and equality.  I would even argue that the proper purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the vote (held by each of us like a key) is to unlock access to all
</I>&gt;<i> those areas and aspects of society in which equal opportunity is
</I>&gt;<i> paramount, most especially to political communications.  It is not a
</I>&gt;<i> fallback, but rather a first step.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For witness, consider that the political decisions in today's society
</I>&gt;<i> are *already* made on the basis of elaborate discussion and debate.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is not the internal conduct of those communications but
</I>&gt;<i> the lack of access to them.  The doors to the &quot;debate hall&quot; are well
</I>&gt;<i> guarded and even the vast majority of elected politicians are barred,
</I>&gt;<i> to say nothing of electors.  Isn't that a fact?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I haven't read Curtis' essay, but I have got (and watched) his 3
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> part TV series of the same name. Does his essay say anything
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry, I did mean the video.  I think it says a lot about the hazards
</I>&gt;<i> of objectivity and the scientific method in the context of politics.
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the link again, in case others want to watch it:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We (just as we are) must discuss (just as we do) what future we want.
</I>&gt;<i> The reason we fail to do this, the reason we cannot even imagine doing
</I>&gt;<i> it, is that we lack the necessary vote to formalize our right to it.
</I>&gt;<i> As a consequence, our future is in the hands of uncontrollable forces
</I>&gt;<i> which (since we no longer believe in gods) we see as machines.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know what:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; One danger in objectifying assent (or dissent) is the illusion that we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; can hold the resulting object in hand.  It might tempt the technician
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to physically remove the *form* of assent from the subject's hands in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; order to get a better grasp of it.  At that point, however, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; reality of the content dissolves.  (I believe this is our current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; predicament in society.)  Conversely, if the objectification or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; formalization of assent has the effect of putting it more firmly in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the subject's hands, then its reality is strengthened.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> means!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the one hand it sounds like my own attempts at describing the &quot;Limits
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of Perception&quot; (Chapters 3/4 of my book) and, on the other it sounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> quasi-quantum mechanics. Specifically I can't grasp it's connection with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the relatively straightforward requirement, within the decision making
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process, to ask participants, from time to time, to declare a preference
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which is all &quot;voting&quot; is about). Examples of what you're trying to
