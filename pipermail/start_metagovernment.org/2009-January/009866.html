It is difficult to compare Metascore here since it is on early Alpha,  
but we have discussed several authentication mechanisms.

However, if we use recursive user scoring (admittedly still in  
dispute), then no authentication is needed at all. In a reputocratic  
system, sock puppets are allowable, as they can only work if they can  
build their own reputation.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, you did not really substantiate the claim that &quot;Votorola is

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the options are many, it's unlikely that a single round of voting

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the system must often encourage consensus, in some way.  But this

</I>
Metagovernment does not force consensus at all. One of our basic  
principles is &quot;without consensus, there is no law.&quot; We prefer that a  
proposal die (or be synthesized) if it cannot garner consensus. This  
allows us to have no limit on the number of proposals, with the  
expectation that most proposals will fail.
