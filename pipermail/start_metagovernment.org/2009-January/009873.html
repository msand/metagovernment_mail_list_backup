I would guess the answer is somewhere in-between. I imagine synthesis  
scores will take a little away from the original proposal and lend a  
little to the new one. But again, the new one still has to get a good  
consensus to become a law. And yes, they certainly can be used for  
signaling more than (but not necessarily exclusive to) changing scores.

&gt;&gt;<i> It fails to pass in the larger community, for the time being.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> However, by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their shared support of a proposal, those 4,000 people have defined

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> methods of convincing the larger community to pass the resolution.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do the latter would most likely be to synthesize the original into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that has larger support. Thus we expect proposals to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> migrate up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and down communities of different sizes until they find their  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> natural fit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Beware of balkanization.  Just because people agree/disagree in one
</I>&gt;<i> category of proposals (urban transit plans) does not mean they will
</I>&gt;<i> think the same in a second category (foreign policy, or marriage law).
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe I misunderstand how it works...
</I>
The internet is shifting people away from geographic communities and  
into interest communities. We are trying to build something that is  
flexible enough to govern communities of any composition. And that  
will mean far more non-geographic communities than ones which are  
inherently geographic. If someone doesn't want to be a part of an  
interest community, they simply stop participating and/or start a  
different one.

Of course, there are things which are inherently geographic such as,  
as you mention, urban transit. But allowing for sub-communities in the  
realm of urban transit doesn't create balkanization. Think of it more  
as an analog to what we now call political parties. If 4,000 people  
support a train system and the larger community does not, then those  
4,000 are the &quot;train party&quot; (but be clear that I am not advocating  
official parties... there could be many interest groups for any  
particular issue). It is now their job as a community to try to talk  
the larger community into building a train. Most likely the way they  
are going to do this is by changing the original proposal.

&gt;<i> Is the support of the subgroup (4,000 people) for the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> formally measured *prior* to its rejection by the whole group
</I>&gt;<i> (40,000)?  So (1) we know there's a proposal, and (2) we know it's
</I>&gt;<i> currently supported by 4,000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If so, is the formal measure of support (as such) lost as a
</I>&gt;<i> consequence of rejection?  So, after rejection, the only way to
</I>&gt;<i> preserve the expression of the subgroup's agreement (sub-consensus)
</I>&gt;<i> is, as you say, to create a formal &quot;sub-community&quot;.  Therefore a new
</I>&gt;<i> sub-community must be created following every rejection, else the
</I>&gt;<i> sub-consensus would be lost - it would become nothing more than a
</I>&gt;<i> memory to those who had participated in it.  Is this true?
</I>
The proposal advocated by the smaller community doesn't go away. It  
just sits there waiting for more support or for something to come  
along and synthesize it. We are trying to encourage synthesis in every  
case, such that the original proposal eventually becomes obsolete as  
those 4,000 create a better proposal which can gain a consensus in the  
larger community.
