<PRE>Here's an idea that's been kicking around in my head:

In an attempt to make the forestry industry more ecologically responsible,
several organizations have been set up that offer 'certification' to the
forestry product.  Criteria for this certification varies, but generally
consists of the wood being taken from sustainable forests in an
environmentally responsible way.  This certified wood product cannot be
mixed with any non-certified wood, and must be auditable from beginning to
end.  Manufacturers pay for the certification, pay to track the wood
product, and pay to be audited.  In return, they get to put the
organization's certification on their wood product, and consumers know they
are purchasing sustainable wood products.

This system has been used with good effect in many different industries
(fishing, mining)

Could such a system be applied to politics?

We draw up criteria that would allow a candidate to meet our 'Open
Government Certification', they pay to be certified, they get audited while
in office, and we give them our certification.  I believe that if there were
two candidates standing for election, voters would choose the certified one
over the un-certified, in the same way that consumers will generally choose
the sustainable products over then non-sustainable.

Thoughts?

Kind regards,
Robert
