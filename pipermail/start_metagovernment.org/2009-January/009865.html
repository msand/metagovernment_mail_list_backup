<PRE>&gt;<i> Your article was translated into Russian

Thanks Dmitri, I hope we can share updates etc.
 
&gt;<i> I also feel it is slightly biased. I did not check out all other
</I>&gt;<i> systems, but it is hard to believe that &quot;Votorola is currently the
</I>&gt;<i> only system that supports voter authentication.&quot;
</I>
It's hard to do.  The system must enforce a single vote per person -
no sock puppets.

Votorola has a neighbourhood trust network for this.  Aside from
guarding against sock puppets, it ensures that the voters are human
(not bots), and local residents (not outsiders).

&gt;<i> Also, you did not really substantiate the claim that &quot;Votorola is
</I>&gt;<i> the only system in which a consensus is guaranteed to be
</I>&gt;<i> unforced&quot;. I would think that a simple majority vote preeceded by a
</I>&gt;<i> public debate, let's say in a form of an online forum, satisties
</I>&gt;<i> your criteria for the ideal unforced consensus.
</I>
It's usually not so simple.  It depends on the issue to be decided.
The requirement is that all options be on the table during the vote.
Usually the options are many.  If the issue is a law, for example, the
options are infinite - a law may take *any* form.

When the options are many, it's unlikely that a single round of voting
will yield a consensus.  Multiple rounds are usually required.  In
fact, even with multiple rounds, there is no guarantee that people
will *ever* reach agreement...

So the system must often encourage consensus, in some way.  But this
is difficult.  In most systems, the &quot;encouragement&quot; amounts to force.
Typically the freedom of the voter is progressively restricted in
subsequent rounds of voting.  But then the consensus is forced (like
driving cattle into a pen).

As far as I know, Votorola is the only system that doesn't employ
force.  The voters are free to vote for all options, and that freedom
is never taken away.  BTW, I finally have a complete description:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht</A>

  (please point out flaws, omissions, etc.)

Maybe MixedInk is unforced too?  They seem to be using recombinant
text as a drafting medium.  And that's where the ideas for Votorola
came from.  I'll ask them for a preview, and let you know...

Best,
