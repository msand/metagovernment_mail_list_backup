<PRE>Dear all,

I will appreciate a grammar review by a native English speaker before I send this to the Wall Street Journal tomorrow. I also invite anyone agreeing with this position to co-sign.

Thank you

Dmitri

In their article &#8220;Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point&#8221; published in WSJ on January 16, 2009, Peter Werhner and Paul Ryan wrote the following &#8220;we might be approaching a tipping point for democratic capitalism... a public accustomed to iTunes, Facebook, Google, eBay, Amazon and WebMD is not clamoring for centralized, bureaucratic government....  Instead, Americans want efficient government &#8211; one that is modern, responsive and adaptive.&#8221; Then the authors went on building an argument why a private health care system may still be better than a public one. While this may or may not be the case, focus on health care misses the bigger picture &#8211; how to improve efficiency of the government overall. Yet, the article lists all the ingredients of the solution: democracy, modern communication technologies and individualistic, entrepreneurial population. 

Yes, the democratic capitalism is on its way to be replaced. Which part of it is going away? In American context democracy typically means representative democracy &#8211; heads of executive branches of power and legislators are elected, their actions are rarely controlled by the public, which essentially has only one recourse &#8211; deny their election to a subsequent term, and for most of the nation referendum remains a curiosity rather than a practical political institution. Analysis of easily-observable technology trends suggests that the archaic representative democracy is going to be replaced by a direct democracy.

Direct democracy means direct participation of citizens in approving controversial laws, judging performance of government leaders of all levels, deciding on major ways the public resources are used. The laws would still be drafted and pre-approved the usual way - by elected legislators and their expert aids. Only those laws that appear controversial to a certain fraction of the population would be brought to a popular referendum. Performance of government officials (&#8220;bureaucrats&#8221;) is judged constantly, those failing to meet needs of the citizens are dismissed immediately, rewards (and punishments) are directly tied to official&#8217;s performance. Levels of federal and local taxation, funding split between major government programs is also decided by a popular vote.

Why would this make for an efficient government? One component of efficiency is that government always acts in the interest of the majority of the citizens. Bringing controversial laws and fiscal proposals for a public vote before they are fulfilled ensures that government&#8217;s intents are consistent with desires of the public. Constant real-time public control over actions of the executive powers assures that society&#8217;s goals are achieved with the minimum expenditure of public resources. 

What would make direct democracy possible? The key ingredient is the wide spread use of the mobile communication technology. These days we trust these technologies with online banking, supplying us with information and connecting with friends and families. Why would not we use these technologies to express our opinions on relevant matters of public life and then make sure that our demands are fulfilled? The technological trend of secure mobile communications penetrating every aspect of our life is clear and unstoppable. Technical and financial possibility of creating an efficient feedback loop between government and the citizens exist. What is still missing is a political will and wisdom.

Is this another utopia? Utopia is something that can&#8217;t exist. Direct democracy exists now. If fact, it had existed in Switzerland since 1848 contributing to prosperity, social peace and efficient use of resources in this country. Switzerland has held more  nationwide referendums than all other countries combined. Australia holds a distant second place. In the US, only in California do referendums play a noticeable role in political life.Despite a common objection that bringing laws for a public vote will put too much burden on people so they would loose interest in voting, Swiss experience proves that people consistently continue to vote on what they perceive to be important issues. Furthermore, legislators have learned to avoid drafting laws violating public interests out of the fear of loosing face or even a parliamentary seat if their proposals would be struck down by a referendum. Swiss experience proves feasibility of a direct democracy with a traditional voting system based on paper ballots. The modern communication technology will allow for people to vote anytime, anywhere thus attracting more voters and increasing the degree of their political engagement. This is also not just a theoretical concept as parliamentary elections in Estonia have allowed for internet voting using secure ID cards since 2005.

American political system was a progressive one at the time it was designed. Given the much more complex society with so many new changeless to handle, the technology advancements, and educated and engaged public, this system is becoming archaic. So much more can be accomplished by freeing up peoples&#8217; initiative not only in the economic, but also in the political arena. Direct democracy will resolve the everlasting dispute on preference of individual freedoms vs. &#8220;tyranny&#8221; of a strong government. It will enforce a truly people&#8217;s government, which always acts in the interests and under direct control of the people.
