<PRE>A similar idea has been done in Italy.

The person doing it is Beppe Grillo, comedian, among the 10 more read
blogger IN THE WORLD.

<A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/">http://www.beppegrillo.it/</A>

 His blog is now in English too.

In italy we don't chose the politicians but just the party. And they
then decide who goes to power. So the certification had to be done at
the party level. So he promoted civic lists:
<A HREF="http://www2.beppegrillo.it/listeciviche/">http://www2.beppegrillo.it/listeciviche/</A>

and he clarified how to have a certification:
<A HREF="http://www2.beppegrillo.it/listeciviche//certifica.php">http://www2.beppegrillo.it/listeciviche//certifica.php</A>

Among those things he requires:
that each politician in the list has never been elected for more than
one time (he is making a battle so that politicians are only elected 2
times. A max of 10 years). No politician in the list had any penal
problem in the past.

Note that Beppe himself was involved in a tragic car crash, and
following that he was accused, and declared guilty, of having killed
someone. As such he himself could not pass his own test. and in fact
he never tried to be elected.

No politician, of the list, must be part of any other political organization.

He does not require the list to be on the right or on the left. But
with the latest version of this certificate, he does give the
certification to only one party for each town. In the previous version
he said he was going to give the certificate to any one who passed the
requirements. I don't know why he changed this, but I suppose he must
have realised that this was going to disperse his influence too much.


What was the effect?
SO far they did succeed i  n getting someone at the local level in
some places, I think in Rome. But mostly Beppe is being treated
(certifaied?) as antipolitic from the italian political system. And as
such his actions are dismissed, when they don't sue him.


Hmm,
it is a nice idea, but so far it does not seem to have suceeded.
