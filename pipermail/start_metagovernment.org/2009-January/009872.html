OK.  I've put you down as undecided:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/compare.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/compare.xht</A>

  (see category of discrimination)

But don't rely exclusively on trial and error.  Don't throw the
hypothetical out the window.  It helps to meet problems on paper,
before you meet them in reality!  And you can meet opportunities
too. :)

&gt;<i> People will be free to change their ratings at any time. If someone thinks 
</I>&gt;<i> a new proposal does not synthesize their support of the old one, then they 
</I>&gt;<i> can give a negative score to the synthesizing proposal; or alternately

</I>&gt;<i> the old proposal against the new one.
</I>
Be careful with negative signals.  They can be used as weapons.  You
wish to encourage open consensus and not open warfare.  (So I was
advised by a political scientist, when I first described my ideas for
authenticating voters in a neighbourhood trust network.)

&gt;<i> But more importantly, synthesis scores are meant to bring synthesizing 
</I>&gt;<i> proposals to peoples' attention, not to force them into acceptance. 
</I>&gt;<i> Synthesis scores should help good proposals rise to prominence, but they 
</I>&gt;<i> still have to garner a broad consensus to become policy. Simply getting a 
</I>&gt;<i> high synthesis score won't be enough.
</I>
Then it's better if synthesis scores do *not* &quot;steal&quot; points from
competing proposals - i.e. from the separate components they
synthesize.  It's better if the synthesis scores are merely signals
for humans to act on, signals that say &quot;By the way, here's a separate
proposal that incorporates this one, and you may want to look at it&quot;.

So instead of the system *forcing* a shift of points, people discuss
and think about it, and then do the shifting themselves.  Do you agree
this would be better?

&gt;<i> It fails to pass in the larger community, for the time being. However, by 
</I>&gt;<i> their shared support of a proposal, those 4,000 people have defined 
</I>&gt;<i> themselves as a potentially distinct sub-community. They can make the 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal a policy of their smaller community and/or they can work on new 
</I>&gt;<i> methods of convincing the larger community to pass the resolution. The way 
</I>&gt;<i> to do the latter would most likely be to synthesize the original into 
</I>&gt;<i> something that has larger support. Thus we expect proposals to migrate up 
</I>&gt;<i> and down communities of different sizes until they find their natural fit.
</I>
Beware of balkanization.  Just because people agree/disagree in one
category of proposals (urban transit plans) does not mean they will
think the same in a second category (foreign policy, or marriage law).
But maybe I misunderstand how it works...

Is the support of the subgroup (4,000 people) for the proposal
formally measured *prior* to its rejection by the whole group
(40,000)?  So (1) we know there's a proposal, and (2) we know it's
currently supported by 4,000.

If so, is the formal measure of support (as such) lost as a
consequence of rejection?  So, after rejection, the only way to
preserve the expression of the subgroup's agreement (sub-consensus)
is, as you say, to create a formal &quot;sub-community&quot;.  Therefore a new
sub-community must be created following every rejection, else the
sub-consensus would be lost - it would become nothing more than a
memory to those who had participated in it.  Is this true?
