I have been looking into a similar issue for the metagovernment.org  
website. I want to allow people to mirror it without permission... so  
that mirrors (especially at different top-level domains,  
e.g., .uk, .il, etc.) can pop up without any effort on my part. I  
found that MediaWiki has a simple mechanism for this: publish the  
content as XML. It doesn't support the other database features (users,  
design, etc.), but the general idea may be of use for allowing porting  
of contents as you mention. Here is the MediaWiki tool:

(I have yet to implement it... have yet to even figure out if I can do  
it on a hosting account.)

As long as it is relatively easy for a community to split off into its  
own separate instance (or vice versa).
