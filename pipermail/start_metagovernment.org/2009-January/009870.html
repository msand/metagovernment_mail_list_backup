So (if you go that route) participants may have multiple identities
via sock puppets, but they must build up separate reputations for each
of them?  In that case, they could gain an advantage in pushing their
own interests, at the expense of others?

What if sock puppets were to cross-rate each other, and so generate
their own reputations?  Then you might have an army of them, run by
bots, all controlled by a single person or organization?

</I>
I might misunderstand how it works.  Here, I've tried to clarify my
critique by splitting it into two parts (9 and 10).

    (9). Discrimination.

    Systematic discrimination may arise from the employment of
    reputation systems.  Reputation systems assign ratings to
    participants on the basis of peer evaluations.  The ratings are
    not generated in the same way as real, social reputation.  Social
    reputation has spatial and dynamic patterns of great complexity,
    which are generated and renewed in processes of everyday
    communication.  A system generated rating will inevitably function
    as a substitute for the complexities of this
    communication. Technically speaking, it will therefore function as
    a steering medium (like money or power).

    A reputation system is therefore liable to strategic use.
    Participants may employ it as a weapon against their political
    opponents.  If successful, they could skew the results into a
    forced consensus.  Or, the conflict might escalate to the point
    where the losers had no choice but to depart from the process.
    The remaining participants would then amount to a self-selected
    interest group, unrepresentative of the wider public.  Any
    consensus they reached could no longer be characterized as a
    public consensus.
    
    Both DemocracyLab and Metascore rely on reputation systems.  The
    details are undocumented, but it would appear they are liable to
    systematic discrimination.

    (10). Forced Consensus

    Ideally consensus is unforced.  This requires that each
    participant have the freedom to put forward candidates and
    proposals, to discuss the merits of each, and to express assent or
    dissent.  All of the participants must have equal voices, and no
    dissenting voices may be hidden or suppressed.  When it comes time
    to vote, all of the proposed options must be on the table, and
    none may be eliminated from consideration.  The measure of
    consensus is then the quantity of votes for each.  If these
    requirements cannot be met, then the reported consensus is liable
    to be something of an artifact; arising, not from the choice of
    the participants, but from the constraints and pressures of the
    system.
    
    Metascore has a synthetic consensus facility in which &quot;a
    synthesizing resolution effectively 'steals' points from the
    resolutions that it synthesizes&quot;.  The intent is to encourage
    consensus.  But the component's formal loss of points has no basis
    in an actual loss of support; its supporters may continue to think
    that the component is the better proposal.  In that case, actual
    support for the component is suppressed, and a false support is
    generated for the synthesis.  In this way, an artificial consensus
    may eventually be forced.

&gt;<i> ... We prefer that a proposal die (or be synthesized) if it cannot
</I>&gt;<i> garner consensus. This allows us to have no limit on the number of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, with the expectation that most proposals will fail.
</I>
So a proposal that fails to garner a consensus ends up dead?  Let's
say a sub-group of 4,000 people supports a proposal - and would agree
to it if they had the chance - but the rest of the 40,000 participants
do not agree.  Then the proposal ends up dead (in some sense).

If the proposal dies, what happens to its formal support?  Suppose it
still has the assent of 4,000 people.  Is that information lost to the
system?  Is that what &quot;death&quot; means for proposals?
