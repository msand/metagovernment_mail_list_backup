There is a lot of good stuff going on, not just with the Obama  
administration, but in some other governments as well. The term that  
seems to be quickly gaining momentum is &quot;Government 2.0.&quot; (Do a search  
for it, and you'll get a surprisingly huge number of results...  
there's even a dedicated page about it on Microsoft.com.)

While all of this is truly wonderful, it still has very firm roots in  
the ancient forms of ruler-subject government. Obama might be making  
government transparent and he might be inviting citizen input, but he  
is still firmly in control. If he felt like it, he could easily  
reverse all this and become a near tyrant, and there would be nothing  
the people could do to stop him.

Given all that, I would say this project is more like Government 3.0  
(not that I really like buzz-word creep). Representative democracy can  
be repaired and tweaked only so much... at some point democracy needs  
to be totally transformed.

Yesterday, I saw a great example of the flaw in the status quo, no  
matter how open it becomes. There was a large abortion demonstration  
here in Washington. Half the people there were demonstrating against  
abortion. The other half were demonstrating for it (or more precisely  
against making it illegal). So what is the point? What could any sane  
policy-maker do but ignore ALL of those people?

I feel that as long as we're stuck in rule-by-the-51% and/or rule-by- 
the-elected-few, we have no chance to make real, transformative  
progress.
