I like the basic idea, but I have some problems with this particular  
project dealing with it. One objection being that we have no money and  
no formal organization. The other being that this idea perpetuates the  
institution of representative democracy, while ours is working to  
eventually replace it.

That said, it could be a viable spin-off/sister/daughter (or whatever)  
project. Assuming it isn't already underway... as I noted in my  
previous post, there is an enormous amount of recent activity under  
the banner of &quot;government 2.0.&quot;

On another note and speaking of related projects, it has also occurred  
to me that an existing secondary function of this list is to act as a  
point of coordination for national mixdemocracy projects, such as these:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>

We already have members of at least six of these projects on this  
list, and I have been wondering if we should actively work to expand  
that umbrella to become a place where all these projects can meet and  
bounce ideas off each other. The main question here is whether it  
would be beneficial to invite more projects into this list, or if we  
should start up a new list specifically for related projects...
