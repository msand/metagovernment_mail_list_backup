<PRE>Hi Dmitri,

What's the purpose of the letter?  Are you hoping for it to be published, or
just to provide feedback to the editors?

I think the grammar is in general quite good, but I would suggest trying to
make it more succinct, making your points as efficiently as possible.  I did
notice a typo in the last paragraph.  You meant to say 'challenges', not
'changeless'.

Good luck,

Mark

</I>&gt;<i>Dear all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I will appreciate a grammar review by a native English speaker before I
</I>send this to the Wall
&gt;<i>Street Journal tomorrow. I also invite anyone agreeing with this position
</I>to co-sign.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you

</I>&gt;<i>-----------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>In their article &quot;Beware of the Big-Government Tipping Point&quot; published in
</I>WSJ on January
&gt;<i>16, 2009, Peter Werhner and Paul Ryan wrote the following &quot;we might be
</I>approaching a
&gt;<i>tipping point for democratic capitalism... a public accustomed to iTunes,
</I>Facebook, Google,
&gt;<i>eBay, Amazon and WebMD is not clamoring for centralized, bureaucratic
</I>government....
&gt;<i>Instead, Americans want efficient government - one that is modern,
</I>responsive and
&gt;<i>adaptive.&quot; Then the authors went on building an argument why a private
</I>health care system
&gt;<i>may still be better than a public one. While this may or may not be the
</I>case, focus on health
&gt;<i>care misses the bigger picture - how to improve efficiency of the
</I>government overall. Yet,
&gt;<i>the article lists all the ingredients of the solution: democracy, modern
</I>communication
&gt;<i>technologies and individualistic, entrepreneurial population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Yes, the democratic capitalism is on its way to be replaced. Which part of
</I>it is going away?
&gt;<i>In American context democracy typically means representative democracy -
</I>heads of
&gt;<i>executive branches of power and legislators are elected, their actions are
</I>rarely controlled by
&gt;<i>the public, which essentially has only one recourse - deny their election
</I>to a subsequent
&gt;<i>term, and for most of the nation referendum remains a curiosity rather than
</I>a practical
&gt;<i>political institution. Analysis of easily-observable technology trends
</I>suggests that the archaic
&gt;<i>representative democracy is going to be replaced by a direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Direct democracy means direct participation of citizens in approving
</I>controversial laws,
&gt;<i>judging performance of government leaders of all levels, deciding on major
</I>ways the public
&gt;<i>resources are used. The laws would still be drafted and pre-approved the
</I>usual way - by
&gt;<i>elected legislators and their expert aids. Only those laws that appear
</I>controversial to a certain
&gt;<i>fraction of the population would be brought to a popular referendum.
</I>Performance of
&gt;<i>government officials (&quot;bureaucrats&quot;) is judged constantly, those failing to
</I>meet needs of the
&gt;<i>citizens are dismissed immediately, rewards (and punishments) are directly
</I>tied to official's
&gt;<i>performance. Levels of federal and local taxation, funding split between
</I>major government
&gt;<i>programs is also decided by a popular vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Why would this make for an efficient government? One component of
</I>efficiency is that
&gt;<i>government always acts in the interest of the majority of the citizens.
</I>Bringing controversial
&gt;<i>laws and fiscal proposals for a public vote before they are fulfilled
</I>ensures that government's
&gt;<i>intents are consistent with desires of the public. Constant real-time
</I>public control over
&gt;<i>actions of the executive powers assures that society's goals are achieved
</I>with the minimum
&gt;<i>expenditure of public resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>What would make direct democracy possible? The key ingredient is the wide
</I>spread use of
&gt;<i>the mobile communication technology. These days we trust these technologies
</I>with online
&gt;<i>banking, supplying us with information and connecting with friends and
</I>families. Why
&gt;<i>would not we use these technologies to express our opinions on relevant
</I>matters of public
&gt;<i>life and then make sure that our demands are fulfilled? The technological
</I>trend of secure
&gt;<i>mobile communications penetrating every aspect of our life is clear and
</I>unstoppable.
&gt;<i>Technical and financial possibility of creating an efficient feedback loop
</I>between
&gt;<i>government and the citizens exist. What is still missing is a political
</I>will and wisdom.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is this another utopia? Utopia is something that can't exist. Direct
</I>democracy exists now. If
&gt;<i>fact, it had existed in Switzerland since 1848 contributing to prosperity,
</I>social peace and
&gt;<i>efficient use of resources in this country. Switzerland has held more
</I>nationwide referendums
&gt;<i>than all other countries combined. Australia holds a distant second place.
</I>In the US, only in
&gt;<i>California do referendums play a noticeable role in political life.Despite
</I>a common objection
&gt;<i>that bringing laws for a public vote will put too much burden on people so
</I>they would loose
&gt;<i>interest in voting, Swiss experience proves that people consistently
</I>continue to vote on what
&gt;<i>they perceive to be important issues. Furthermore, legislators have learned
</I>to avoid drafting
&gt;<i>laws violating public interests out of the fear of loosing face or even a
</I>parliamentary seat if
&gt;<i>their proposals would be struck down by a referendum. Swiss experience
</I>proves feasibility of
&gt;<i>a direct democracy with a traditional voting system based on paper ballots.
</I>The modern
&gt;<i>communication technology will allow for people to vote anytime, anywhere
</I>thus attracting
&gt;<i>more voters and increasing the degree of their political engagement. This
</I>is also not just a
&gt;<i>theoretical concept as parliamentary elections in Estonia have allowed for
</I>internet voting
&gt;<i>using secure ID cards since 2005.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>American political system was a progressive one at the time it was
</I>designed. Given the much
&gt;<i>more complex society with so many new changeless to handle, the technology
</I>advancements,
&gt;<i>and educated and engaged public, this system is becoming archaic. So much
</I>more can be
&gt;<i>accomplished by freeing up peoples' initiative not only in the economic,
</I>but also in the
&gt;<i>political arena. Direct democracy will resolve the everlasting dispute on
</I>preference of
&gt;<i>individual freedoms vs. &quot;tyranny&quot; of a strong government. It will enforce a
</I>truly people's
&gt;<i>government, which always acts in the interests and under direct control of
</I>the people.
