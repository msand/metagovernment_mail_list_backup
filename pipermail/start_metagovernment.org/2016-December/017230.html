<PRE>Hi Scott and all,

Responding to Scott's query is in my work-queue, but the queue is long 
and that item has low priority, so it may be awhile.

The Isonomea design does not have any taxes. What it does have are 
lease-payments, fees for services rendered, and other such 
business-style transactions. Any objections that Libertarians may have 
to taxes are a non-issue for Isonomea.

Scott's claim that majority-rule voting will &quot;work better than&quot; Blinap 
(which uses &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as its decision criterion) is an 
empirical claim. As such, it needs to be tested empirically. I intend to 
do that.

One useful thing we might accomplish on this list would be to 
objectively define what &quot;work better than&quot; means -- how do we 
objectively measure the betterness of population-scale public-matter 
decision systems?

</I>&gt;<i> activists commonly voted against legalization simply *because* of
</I>&gt;<i> these new taxes and the creation of that new government department
</I>&gt;<i> (cutting off their noses to spite their faces in the case of the

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) The libertarians are all declared &quot;unreasonable&quot; and their
