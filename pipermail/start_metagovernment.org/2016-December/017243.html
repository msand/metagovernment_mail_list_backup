<PRE>&gt;<i> My model here is HOA managers (management companies): They can be
</I>&gt;<i> fired like this, but almost never are because it's such a nightmare to
</I>&gt;<i> replace them (I know because I've served on boards and committees
</I>&gt;<i> charged with doing this).
</I>
But it wouldn't be a nightmare for the public, all they have to do it vote
the new one in. It would be the committee that has to go through all the
trouble to find new candidates, there's a disconnect so there's no
incentive to hold off.

&gt;<i> &gt; How the firing process would take place isn't covered but presumably a
</I>small
&gt;<i> &gt; group would be able to file a motion to remove the manager from office
</I>and
&gt;<i> &gt; then only the most vocal (SDAP's) would cast a vote and get them
</I>replaced.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course not: It'd have to be a general population vote, which under
</I>&gt;<i> AutoMatch would specifically preclude any minority from achieving this
</I>&gt;<i> alone. It would have to get on the ballot via some citizen route,
</I>&gt;<i> though, which is one of the big reasons I still believe we need one
</I>&gt;<i> even though it should only rarely be used.
</I>
Alright, I guess I'll ask what the citizen route is? Is there a running
poll on their approval rating and once it drops below the threshold, the
ballot is an option?

&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On that list only Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Roosevelt would have likely
</I>&gt;<i> survived their full terms (and under matchism the first two probably
</I>&gt;<i> much longer). Which IMHO is exactly as is should be
</I>
So 77% of presidents would have been replaced, That doesn't seem like an
'almost never' type of situation. People get influenced easily, doesn't
take much to start thinking they could get better.

(big snip)

To me, there's still the issue of zany proposals that although maybe
shouldn't be passed initially need to be put out there to start a
conversation. With one person in charge of deciding what people get to vote
on, everyone's thinking gets limited.

</I>&gt;<i> I has been now, thanks ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My main problem with the executives/managers and having them be elected
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fired by the people is that I think it leads to paralyses from the
</I>&gt;<i> managers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If they're completely at the whim of the people any decision they make
</I>&gt;<i> might
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; end up with them being fired, if a group of people have a problem with
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision. So they would be extra cautious posting any proposal and this
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stagnate meaningful change.

</I>&gt;<i> fired like this, but almost never are because it's such a nightmare to
</I>&gt;<i> replace them (I know because I've served on boards and committees

</I>&gt;<i> city managers, which are also very hard to get rid of (I know this
</I>&gt;<i> too, because I've tried ;-) My experience leads me to believe that the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite of your prediction is true: Managers at both of these levels
</I>&gt;<i> currently don't change their behavior *at all* in fear of being
</I>&gt;<i> second-guessed and replaced (this is classic SDAP behavior, if that
</I>&gt;<i> helps to explain it). If the pendulum swings too far to the other
</I>&gt;<i> direction we can always constrain it a little (golden parachute
</I>&gt;<i> contract clauses, requiring supermajority votes,
</I>&gt;<i> trial/waiting/probation periods, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> even though it should only rarely be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Eventually, when the system grows there will need to be a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> managers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working in different areas, too many for the public to pay attention to
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; defend every time one is on the chopping block. I see this as causing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problems, sometimes the unpopular proposal will need to be made and if
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manager is afraid of losing their job at every post those unpopular
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals will never see the light of day.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can't see any manager *ever* being replaced because one of their
</I>&gt;<i> proposals goes down at a public vote.  Maybe if they waste our time
</I>&gt;<i> and the majority of their proposals fail...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Managers (and other employees) will get replaced only when the
</I>&gt;<i> *majority* of people think they're screwing up. Take a look at the
</I>&gt;<i> following data on presidential approval ratings:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On that list only Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Roosevelt would have likely
</I>&gt;<i> survived their full terms (and under matchism the first two probably
</I>&gt;<i> much longer). Which IMHO is exactly as is should be because I
</I>&gt;<i> personally don't think any of the rest of them were worth a damn and
</I>&gt;<i> certainly GW Bush, Nixon, and Truman (the bottom three) were just
</I>&gt;<i> grossly incompetent.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe you see very few safe proposals as better than more wide-ranging
</I>&gt;<i> ones.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I see it as needing to sit in the middle, allowing anyone to post
</I>&gt;<i> proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but limiting them in their range, making it a process to properly present
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one for viewing by the general public.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly you'll see the first batch of proposals (I've got about 50
</I>&gt;<i> of them queued up already) won't have that characteristic. Maybe that
</I>&gt;<i> will set the tone for future sources as people won't tolerate
</I>&gt;<i> wishy-washy stuff after cutting their teeth on substantive issues (a
</I>&gt;<i> *real* abortion policy, nuclear weapons, carbon tax, recreational drug
</I>&gt;<i> policy, etc.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also don't think you put enough emphasis on discussion, seems like once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the proposal is posted voting begins right away, without any ability to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; alter the proposal. The public should be able to interfere and have the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ability to change certain aspects of a proposal they don't agree with to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make it more acceptable. That way we don't have to throw out or
</I>&gt;<i> begrudgingly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accept the whole proposal just because one thing in it bothers us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do see it as an iterative process. As explained in that paper (and
</I>&gt;<i> on the MatchSys page on matchism.org) there will be &quot;post votes&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> that people can change their mind and force a bill to be revoted if
</I>&gt;<i> enough of them do. I've also got versioning built into the data
</I>&gt;<i> structures to enable a kind of alpha/beta test period for bills before
</I>&gt;<i> they come to the general-vote stage. For example the queue might have
</I>&gt;<i> dozens of bills in it, stretching out for months ahead, and might get
</I>&gt;<i> re-sorted depending on how many people vote on them, how big the
</I>&gt;<i> yes/no differential is, whether the Q&amp;A section on each bill indicates
</I>&gt;<i> there are unresolved issues, etc. The big hurdle is the UI: when a new
</I>&gt;<i> version of a proposal comes up the people who have voted or commented
</I>&gt;<i> on it previously shouldn't have to start from scratch, which means a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of programming work hiliting the diffs, allowing them to confirm
</I>&gt;<i> or update their comments, etc. Maybe for version 2.0...
