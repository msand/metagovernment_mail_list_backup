Exactly no: It's exactly the *same* as what we have today, where the
&quot;activerts&quot; are the ones that end up making the decisions for all of
us. I don't know what the personality profile of an &quot;activert&quot; is
necessarily, but I do know that it's not likely to be Neurotypical
because they'll be on the extremes on one or more of the personality
dimensions. Keep in mind that the bots are strictly for bootstrap: To
get the system running until the user base grows to the point where we
have at least several hundred regular early voters (proxies), at which
point they'll be removed (we'll need more real people than bots to get
sufficiently good matches because the bot personalities are uniformly
distributed whereas people aren't (should be a normal (Gaussian)
distribution, although I can't find any data that anyone has even
looked at that issue and so am assuming that the fact that no one has
mentioned anything about corrections means that none were necessary)).
I would expect that this will probably be partially offset by the fact
that the early adopters are going to be predominantly extremists, but
that this won't be enough to eliminate the need for bootstrap bots
entirely.

On the other hand, the whole bot system may all be unnecessary except
for QA because my hope is that the proposals will be sufficiently
compelling, the self-selected early adopters will be more likely to
vote than the general population, and that the system will grow
quickly enough that only a few proposals will rely primarily on the
bots. But we're still probably facing the problem that the majority of
the early voters will be extremists and any truly neurotypical voters
will need the bots to match to for a bit longer (maybe into the tens
of thousands of users). The worst thing would be to match a
neurotypical to an extremist, particularly a SDAP: It'd be better to
just calculate a random vote for them than to rely on those extremists
to represent them or just assign them the global average (because,
again, turnout is correlated with at least two of the big 5 dimensions
and SDAPs are far more likely to cast a vote).

    Scott
