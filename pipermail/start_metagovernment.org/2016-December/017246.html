An odd thing, this one. Entry is in the form of a maximum 8250 word
essay plus a maximum 1000 word abstract. Note that although the
deadline is 24 May 2017 you have to *register* before February 15th or
they may refuse your entry (no cost for entry, so I recommend anyone
even considering this do so now:
<A HREF="https://globalchallenges.org/en/application/register">https://globalchallenges.org/en/application/register</A>). Curiously,
multiple entries per person are allowed. The prize schedule is also
rather &quot;creative&quot;: First they whittle the submissions down to 3 for
the judging round. The &quot;winner&quot; is guaranteed $1M USD, but the jury
reserves the right not to declare a winner. The remaining $4M can
either be given to the &quot;winner&quot;, or to any combination of the other
entries, or not given out at all.

IMHO they're on the completely wrong track by proposing the solution
as being a &quot;new UN&quot; (which would clearly be a case of &quot;out of the
frying pan into the fire&quot;, if you ask me). Worse, there's a potential
deal breaker buried in the rules:

&quot;...The governance model must also be such that it can be implemented
within the foreseeable future. This requires for it to be acceptable
to major states and the wider international community. A significant
measure of civic acceptance is also required.&quot;

Which I think rules out pretty much all the proposals we've discussed
on this list: Requiring the cooperation of the existing government of
not only your own country but of all the others seems to me to only
guaranty that the status quo can't be changed. Granted I see the
difficultly of their position: Without that clause they're essentially
proposing to finance a revolution. Still, I would have hoped for a
little more bravery out of a group that obviously considers themselves
at least somewhat &quot;revolutionary&quot;...

I'm definitely going to enter, though, even though it's going to mean
trimming down even more (I've submitted my Next System entry, which
was close to the 15K word limit for that). I just hope they decide not
to be a stickler for enforcing that &quot;acceptability&quot; clause...
  Regards,
    Scott
