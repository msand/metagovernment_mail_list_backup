<PRE>&gt;<i> There is a section on Managers in the main manifesto that specifies
</I>&gt;<i> who they are and how they get selected (e.g., they don't &quot;run&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> office, they're selected like employees (including the CEO) of
</I>&gt;<i> corporations, i.e., based on their qualifications, not their
</I>&gt;<i> likability):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/managers/">http://www.matchism.org/managers/</A> &#8206;
</I>
Alright, I think I got the idea now. The page is still making reference to
people choosing their proxies rather than being assigned, but I imagine
that's just because you haven't updated that yet?

My main problem with the executives/managers and having them be elected and
fired by the people is that I think it leads to paralyses from the
managers. If they're completely at the whim of the people any decision they
make might end up with them being fired, if a group of people have a
problem with the decision. So they would be extra cautious posting any
proposal and this will stagnate meaningful change.

How the firing process would take place isn't covered but presumably a
small group would be able to file a motion to remove the manager from
office and then only the most vocal (SDAP's) would cast a vote and get them
replaced.

Eventually, when the system grows there will need to be a bunch of managers
working in different areas, too many for the public to pay attention to and
defend every time one is on the chopping block. I see this as causing
problems, sometimes the unpopular proposal will need to be made and if the
manager is afraid of losing their job at every post those unpopular
proposals will never see the light of day.

Maybe you see very few safe proposals as better than more wide-ranging
ones. I see it as needing to sit in the middle, allowing anyone to post
proposals but limiting them in their range, making it a process to properly
present one for viewing by the general public.

I also don't think you put enough emphasis on discussion, seems like once
the proposal is posted voting begins right away, without any ability to
alter the proposal. The public should be able to interfere and have the
ability to change certain aspects of a proposal they don't agree with to
make it more acceptable. That way we don't have to throw out or
begrudgingly accept the whole proposal just because one thing in it bothers
us.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> Exactly no: It's exactly the *same* as what we have today, where the

</I>&gt;<i> us. I don't know what the personality profile of an &quot;activert&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily, but I do know that it's not likely to be Neurotypical
</I>&gt;<i> because they'll be on the extremes on one or more of the personality
</I>&gt;<i> dimensions. Keep in mind that the bots are strictly for bootstrap: To
</I>&gt;<i> get the system running until the user base grows to the point where we
</I>&gt;<i> have at least several hundred regular early voters (proxies), at which
</I>&gt;<i> point they'll be removed (we'll need more real people than bots to get
</I>&gt;<i> sufficiently good matches because the bot personalities are uniformly
</I>&gt;<i> distributed whereas people aren't (should be a normal (Gaussian)
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, although I can't find any data that anyone has even
</I>&gt;<i> looked at that issue and so am assuming that the fact that no one has
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned anything about corrections means that none were necessary)).
</I>&gt;<i> I would expect that this will probably be partially offset by the fact
</I>&gt;<i> that the early adopters are going to be predominantly extremists, but
</I>&gt;<i> that this won't be enough to eliminate the need for bootstrap bots
</I>&gt;<i> entirely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, the whole bot system may all be unnecessary except
</I>&gt;<i> for QA because my hope is that the proposals will be sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> compelling, the self-selected early adopters will be more likely to
</I>&gt;<i> vote than the general population, and that the system will grow
</I>&gt;<i> quickly enough that only a few proposals will rely primarily on the
</I>&gt;<i> bots. But we're still probably facing the problem that the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> the early voters will be extremists and any truly neurotypical voters
</I>&gt;<i> will need the bots to match to for a bit longer (maybe into the tens
</I>&gt;<i> of thousands of users). The worst thing would be to match a
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypical to an extremist, particularly a SDAP: It'd be better to
</I>&gt;<i> just calculate a random vote for them than to rely on those extremists
</I>&gt;<i> to represent them or just assign them the global average (because,
</I>&gt;<i> again, turnout is correlated with at least two of the big 5 dimensions
</I>&gt;<i> and SDAPs are far more likely to cast a vote).
