<PRE>I've put a draft of my submission to that TheNextSystemProject essay
competition up as:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/SocialEngineeringTheFuture.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/SocialEngineeringTheFuture.pdf</A>

If you've never tried to read the Matchism manifesto before (or tried
and gave up ;-) this is a highly digested version of that. It's still
14K words, but I can't see where I can cut any more without losing
coherence (but if you have any suggestions, by all means speak up!)
The section on the voting system has been completely rewritten to
reflect my current thinking and proposal for AutoMatch of proxies.
Don't mind the formatting (it is just a draft), but if you get lost or
find any accuracy problems, by all means please let me know.

I can also recommend a couple of new references I found to back up the
AutoMatch design that are cited in this paper (and now in the
manifesto). The first is a good overview of how the big 5 personality
profile predicts political orientation, voter turnout, etc. Especially
see Table 2, which shows that there are correlates with all 5 of the
big 5, not just Openness and Conscientiousness as most other analyses
have concluded:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Gerber_2011_Big5Political.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Gerber_2011_Big5Political.pdf</A>

The second is a paper on whether or not one can determine people's
personality profiles by reading their on-line posts (in Facebook in
this example). Turns out you can, although again it's Openness and
Conscientiousness that are most reliably determined. Which works for
my purposes ;-)
