Naw, we Americans do it all the time. In last month's election the
City of Boulder passed a 2 cents-per-ounce tax on sugary drinks
(Berkeley was the first to pass one of these) but failed to extend a
current tax to purchase and maintain Open Space, and the state failed
to pass yet another increase in the cigarette tax, but did pass an
arts and cultural tax (all are limited-term sales taxes). There have
been a wide range of other tax increases/decreases approved directly
by the voters here (none affecting income tax AFAIK, but property
taxes and excise taxes have been changed many times). None of these
kinds of things could even be on the ballot in a &quot;no reasonable
objection&quot; or &quot;rough consensus&quot; system because there's a hard-core of
libertarian and tea-party voters (probably 25% of the electorate) who
will *always* vote against anything that increases taxes even if it's
just to shift from one source to another: The example I was actually
thinking of was the 22% tax on marijuana here that was approved as
part of the law that legalized it. It was necessary not (only) as a
&quot;sin tax&quot; but to fund the fairly massive infrastructure that had to be
created to regulate that new industry. Libertarians and tea-party
activists commonly voted against legalization simply *because* of
these new taxes and the creation of that new government department
(cutting off their noses to spite their faces in the case of the
libertarians IMHO).

It's been two months, so I'm thinking that none of the consensusists
on this list have even a clue as to how to deal with this under their
philosophies, so majority-rules it is...
