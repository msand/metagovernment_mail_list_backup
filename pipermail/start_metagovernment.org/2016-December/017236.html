A good case of &quot;proofreaders eye&quot; you've got there, thanks ;-)

Agreed. The main motivation was to show that there was more than one
direct application of the results of those &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;
experiments I already had to move in from another section to address
the anticapitalism bias I saw on most of the articles on that site.
I've already beefed-up the introduction paragraph to that section to
make this connection clearer and since I'm still under the limit I'm
incline to leave it in...

&gt;<i> And I'll bring up the question I am still not clear on. You say that most

</I>&gt;<i> those executive positions are the exact thing SDAP's would go after? Isn't

</I>&gt;<i> That whole process is lost to me and seems like might need some explanation.

There's no direct conflict here: Most bills now come from &quot;special
interests&quot; (i.e., extremists like the military industrial complex,
corporations, the religious, gunnnies, environmentalists, etc.), and
pass through the legislature who essentially just endorse them with
relatively minor modifications (because they're pretty much required
to do that if they want to get reelected or employed after they leave
office). I would expect that original source to remain the same,
although I'd hope the Executive branch to be a little more selective
in deciding what gets through (no more renaming bridges and post
offices, which makes up almost half of what the US congress does
now!). There's not much risk of SDAP Managers proposing anything like
&quot;the jew relocation act&quot; because they'll realize a blacklash resulting
in their removal is likely if they did (Donald Trump, on the other
hand, would be impossible to remove from office merely for proposing
relocating muslims). The relatively few bills that originate from the
Executive branch generally address specific needs that it discovered
in the course of running the government (mostly spending bills but a
fair amount of regulatory rules). All those will pass through just as
they do now, as will most &quot;executive orders&quot; that the legislative
branch has very little control over now. But again the Executive
branch will have to learn how to tweak the proposals to balance the
desires of the people and the needs of government (i.e., giving The
People direct control allows them to enforce the &quot;benevolent&quot; aspect
of the benevolent dictator).

But I understand your confusion: It's going to be hard for us to start
thinking of ourselves as the boss and the mayor/governor/president as
just another employee in an organization we're in charge of running.
Calling them &quot;managers&quot; instead of the titles they have now will help,
but it still will take a little getting used to.

I'd like to eventually have a citizen-route to getting bills on the
ballot, but I've seen a lot of very poorly written initiatives (not to
mention the vast majority of petitions on the slacktivism sites) and
so definitely consider this a distant second as a source of policy.
IMHO the executive branch generally knows what needs to be done to
satisfy the needs of the people because they run into these policy
problems on a daily basis. The main reason they don't do that now is
because there is so much influence from the &quot;special interests&quot; that
are jerking around the legislative branch that the executive branch
ends up serving those squeaky wheels instead of doing what they
already know needs to be done.

There is a section on Managers in the main manifesto that specifies
who they are and how they get selected (e.g., they don't &quot;run&quot; for
office, they're selected like employees (including the CEO) of
corporations, i.e., based on their qualifications, not their
likability):
