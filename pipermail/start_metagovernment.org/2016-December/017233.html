Add to that list needing to get the spec up to date and back up on a
publicly accessible server...

&gt;<i> The Isonomea design does not have any taxes. What it does have are
</I>&gt;<i> lease-payments, fees for services rendered, and other such business-style
</I>&gt;<i> transactions. Any objections that Libertarians may have to taxes are a
</I>&gt;<i> non-issue for Isonomea.
</I>
I look forward to understanding how that would work: I've had a lot of
debates with radical libertarians on this issue and can sort of
understand how they believe that infrastructure (roads, utilities,
police and fire protection, etc.) will get paid for, but I've yet to
have any of them display anything but pure religious delusion when it
comes to things like universal health care or wealth redistribution,
all of which are a requirement of Neurotypical nature in an era of
non-scarce resources. Until I see an update of Isonomea, I'm afraid
I'll have to put it in the same category: You might try to finesse the
issue by making people pay &quot;fees&quot; for what are essentially government
services rather than &quot;taxes&quot;, but my prediction is that they wouldn't
be fooled for long...

&gt;<i> Scott's claim that majority-rule voting will &quot;work better than&quot; Blinap
</I>&gt;<i> (which uses &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as its decision criterion) is an
</I>&gt;<i> empirical claim. As such, it needs to be tested empirically. I intend to do
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
Just for the record I never said &quot;works better&quot;: My claim is that any
no-unresolved-objection/rough consensus rule will simply fail to work
at all as a component of a general-purpose decisionmaking system.

&gt;<i> One useful thing we might accomplish on this list would be to objectively
</I>&gt;<i> define what &quot;work better than&quot; means -- how do we objectively measure the
</I>&gt;<i> betterness of population-scale public-matter decision systems?
</I>
Again, I take that as an exercise akin to answering the question &quot;How
many angels can dance on the head of the pin?&quot;: If you get a majority
of the population (and not just counting registered voters or the
subset of that who actually bother to cast a vote) to cast an informed
vote &quot;yes&quot; on a proposal, that is the *only* acceptable decision
because it reflects The Will of the People. I do realize that this
means that we have to consider voting to make Hitler dictator to be a
&quot;good&quot; decision, but given the state of the economy of Germany in 1934
and human nature it *was* a completely natural and predictable result.
IMHO the fault for WWII and the Holocaust lies with the amateur social
engineers who wrote the Treaty of Versailles (or indeed with the SDAPs
who started WWI in the first place), not with the German people. You
can go off and philosophize about alternative definitions of &quot;good&quot;
and how to measure it, but all that's going to lead you to is to try
to justify some sort of oligarchy, which not only are a poor fit for
human nature (as it has been shaped by millions of years of evolution)
but have all proven to be unworkable in the experiments we have been
running on ourselves over the last several thousand years.

    Scott
