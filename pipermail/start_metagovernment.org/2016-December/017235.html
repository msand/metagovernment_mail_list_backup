<PRE>Got through most of it. Interested to see if you get any acknowledgement
from it when you do submit. Couple errors noticed:
pg. 16, middle of second paragraph - 'this this'.
pg. 23, after the list - 'dislike like'.
Also, I don't know if the entire 'Standard (Minimum) Wage' section is
necessary, seems like that would be something that would be established
after the fact, not necessary in your explanation of the concept.

And I'll bring up the question I am still not clear on. You say that most
proposals are going to come from the executive branch, but aren't you
saying those executive positions are the exact thing SDAP's would go after?
Isn't that a problem? Then it's going to be up to the public to vote out
and then vote back in new executives? Will there be campaigns for these
positions? That whole process is lost to me and seems like might need some
explanation.

Cheers

</I>&gt;<i> The section on the voting system has been completely rewritten to

</I>&gt;<i> Don't mind the formatting (it is just a draft), but if you get lost or

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can also recommend a couple of new references I found to back up the
</I>&gt;<i> AutoMatch design that are cited in this paper (and now in the
</I>&gt;<i> manifesto). The first is a good overview of how the big 5 personality

</I>&gt;<i> see Table 2, which shows that there are correlates with all 5 of the
</I>&gt;<i> big 5, not just Openness and Conscientiousness as most other analyses
</I>&gt;<i> have concluded:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second is a paper on whether or not one can determine people's
</I>&gt;<i> personality profiles by reading their on-line posts (in Facebook in
</I>&gt;<i> this example). Turns out you can, although again it's Openness and
</I>&gt;<i> Conscientiousness that are most reliably determined. Which works for
</I>&gt;<i> my purposes ;-)
