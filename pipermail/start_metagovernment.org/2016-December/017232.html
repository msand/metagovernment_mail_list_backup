<PRE>Hi,



I am just working on something very similar to Ned's question.



I imagine it like this. First of all, the system must be reliable. Principally, a decision is better than no decision.
So your system must be truly reliable or you should make it subsystem and back it with some stable form (where your subsystem is stable intermediate form). A system is all the forms together.

Now we may compare just reliable systems.
The best system produces best decisions and effects.
Measuring &quot;best&quot; &quot;good&quot; or &quot;goodness&quot; is tricky.
What is the best
decision nobody never knows. What decision might have been better is speculation. What was a good decision is relatively available.

You may ask about effects on individual lives. People are experts on their lives. But should also ask about overall evaluation (It is not good for me, but I think it is good for the world, contry, etc.)
Not every decision is the same. Some are more important. Importance may be also surveyed e.g. 0 to 10 scale. 
I think it is possible to measure the systems this way.
What do you think?

My docyment is messy right now, still the link is here <A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjQ46EYr9bWSF30RAaEn0p_lvyLGxyAXigTZrWKxQa8/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjQ46EYr9bWSF30RAaEn0p_lvyLGxyAXigTZrWKxQa8/edit?usp=sharing</A>

Cheers
m.

PS: Sorry, it is late here, I would like to finish the email quickly and go to bed.

Hi Scott and all, 

 

Responding to Scott's query is in my work-queue, but the queue is long 

and that item has low priority, so it may be awhile. 

 

The Isonomea design does not have any taxes. What it does have are 

lease-payments, fees for services rendered, and other such 

business-style transactions. Any objections that Libertarians may have 

to taxes are a non-issue for Isonomea. 

 

Scott's claim that majority-rule voting will &quot;work better than&quot; Blinap 

(which uses &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as its decision criterion) is an 

empirical claim. As such, it needs to be tested empirically. I intend to 

do that. 

 

One useful thing we might accomplish on this list would be to 

objectively define what &quot;work better than&quot; means -- how do we 

objectively measure the betterness of population-scale public-matter 

decision systems?
