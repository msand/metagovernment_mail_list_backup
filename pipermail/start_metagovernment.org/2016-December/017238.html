The primary way is &quot;not at all&quot;:  If the system has been properly
designed and implemented after signing up and filling out their
profiles in most cases they'll just read the email or text message
they'll get on Friday night that tells them what that week's proposal
is about along with what vote has been calculated for them based on
how their matched proxies voted. Then they'll do *nothing* and that
vote will be recorded for them. If they want to interact, they'll be
able to do that via an app and/or the web site that will show them the
details of the proposal, the details of *why* their proxies voted the
way they did, the early vote counts, etc. They'll then have the option
of overriding their proxies (or optionally confirming with a direct
vote, or abstaining).

The &quot;activerts&quot; will be able to use that same app and web site to cast
an early vote to make themselves available as proxies, though they'll
actually have to read and understand the proposal themselves because
there will be relatively few votes and comments from other voters to
use. The proxy-matching system will still be available and depending
on how active people are *may* give them good proxy representation,
but it will have to include a &quot;goodness of fit&quot; estimate to give them
some idea about how close the matches really were.

Bootstrapping is going to be an issue: For now I've got &quot;bots&quot; that
will be used as proxies when there aren't enough real voters available
and have found that it takes relatively few of them to cover the
domain: Surprising to me was that around 100 gives the required 5
close-enough matches for all personality types. This result also gives
a ballpark estimate as to how small of an organization will be able to
use this system (i.e., it's probably *not* going to be suitable for
decisionmaking for HOAs or neighborhoods, which is actually how I got
started on this project). Unfortunately it's kind of an AI problem to
make those bots *vote* like humans with similar personality
characteristics. For now I'm just using a relatively coarse 2D scale
on Openness and Conscientiousness, which at least is a step up from
just using a liberal/conservative orientation scale like most
political scientists seem content to use when making voting
predictions (turnout, party affiliation, etc.)
  Regards,
    Scott
