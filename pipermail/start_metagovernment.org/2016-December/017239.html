<PRE>That's cool. Why involve the bots though. If only 5 people showed up to
vote then why not just let that be obvious? Theoretically as long as those
5 people actually cared about the issue and the people it impacts then it's
automatically better than today's garbage right?

</I>&gt;<i> details of the proposal, the details of *why* their proxies voted the
</I>&gt;<i> way they did, the early vote counts, etc. They'll then have the option
</I>&gt;<i> of overriding their proxies (or optionally confirming with a direct
</I>&gt;<i> vote, or abstaining).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The &quot;activerts&quot; will be able to use that same app and web site to cast
</I>&gt;<i> an early vote to make themselves available as proxies, though they'll
</I>&gt;<i> actually have to read and understand the proposal themselves because
</I>&gt;<i> there will be relatively few votes and comments from other voters to
</I>&gt;<i> use. The proxy-matching system will still be available and depending
</I>&gt;<i> on how active people are *may* give them good proxy representation,
</I>&gt;<i> but it will have to include a &quot;goodness of fit&quot; estimate to give them
</I>&gt;<i> some idea about how close the matches really were.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bootstrapping is going to be an issue: For now I've got &quot;bots&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> will be used as proxies when there aren't enough real voters available
</I>&gt;<i> and have found that it takes relatively few of them to cover the
</I>&gt;<i> domain: Surprising to me was that around 100 gives the required 5
</I>&gt;<i> close-enough matches for all personality types. This result also gives
</I>&gt;<i> a ballpark estimate as to how small of an organization will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> use this system (i.e., it's probably *not* going to be suitable for
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking for HOAs or neighborhoods, which is actually how I got
</I>&gt;<i> started on this project). Unfortunately it's kind of an AI problem to
</I>&gt;<i> make those bots *vote* like humans with similar personality
</I>&gt;<i> characteristics. For now I'm just using a relatively coarse 2D scale
</I>&gt;<i> on Openness and Conscientiousness, which at least is a step up from
</I>&gt;<i> just using a liberal/conservative orientation scale like most
</I>&gt;<i> political scientists seem content to use when making voting
</I>&gt;<i> predictions (turnout, party affiliation, etc.)
