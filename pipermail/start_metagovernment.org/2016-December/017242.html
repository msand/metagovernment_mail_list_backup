</I>
My model here is HOA managers (management companies): They can be
fired like this, but almost never are because it's such a nightmare to
replace them (I know because I've served on boards and committees
charged with doing this). Another directly comparable situation is
city managers, which are also very hard to get rid of (I know this
too, because I've tried ;-) My experience leads me to believe that the
opposite of your prediction is true: Managers at both of these levels
currently don't change their behavior *at all* in fear of being
second-guessed and replaced (this is classic SDAP behavior, if that
helps to explain it). If the pendulum swings too far to the other
direction we can always constrain it a little (golden parachute
contract clauses, requiring supermajority votes,
trial/waiting/probation periods, etc.)

&gt;<i> How the firing process would take place isn't covered but presumably a small
</I>&gt;<i> group would be able to file a motion to remove the manager from office and
</I>&gt;<i> then only the most vocal (SDAP's) would cast a vote and get them replaced.
</I>
Of course not: It'd have to be a general population vote, which under
AutoMatch would specifically preclude any minority from achieving this
alone. It would have to get on the ballot via some citizen route,
though, which is one of the big reasons I still believe we need one
even though it should only rarely be used.

&gt;<i> Eventually, when the system grows there will need to be a bunch of managers
</I>&gt;<i> working in different areas, too many for the public to pay attention to and
</I>&gt;<i> defend every time one is on the chopping block. I see this as causing
</I>&gt;<i> problems, sometimes the unpopular proposal will need to be made and if the
</I>&gt;<i> manager is afraid of losing their job at every post those unpopular
</I>&gt;<i> proposals will never see the light of day.
</I>
I can't see any manager *ever* being replaced because one of their
proposals goes down at a public vote.  Maybe if they waste our time
and the majority of their proposals fail...

Managers (and other employees) will get replaced only when the
*majority* of people think they're screwing up. Take a look at the
following data on presidential approval ratings:
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating</A>

On that list only Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Roosevelt would have likely
survived their full terms (and under matchism the first two probably
much longer). Which IMHO is exactly as is should be because I
personally don't think any of the rest of them were worth a damn and
certainly GW Bush, Nixon, and Truman (the bottom three) were just
grossly incompetent.

&gt;<i> Maybe you see very few safe proposals as better than more wide-ranging ones.
</I>&gt;<i> I see it as needing to sit in the middle, allowing anyone to post proposals
</I>&gt;<i> but limiting them in their range, making it a process to properly present
</I>&gt;<i> one for viewing by the general public.
</I>
Certainly you'll see the first batch of proposals (I've got about 50
of them queued up already) won't have that characteristic. Maybe that
will set the tone for future sources as people won't tolerate
wishy-washy stuff after cutting their teeth on substantive issues (a
*real* abortion policy, nuclear weapons, carbon tax, recreational drug
policy, etc.)

&gt;<i> I also don't think you put enough emphasis on discussion, seems like once
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal is posted voting begins right away, without any ability to
</I>&gt;<i> alter the proposal. The public should be able to interfere and have the
</I>&gt;<i> ability to change certain aspects of a proposal they don't agree with to
</I>&gt;<i> make it more acceptable. That way we don't have to throw out or begrudgingly
</I>&gt;<i> accept the whole proposal just because one thing in it bothers us.
</I>
I do see it as an iterative process. As explained in that paper (and
on the MatchSys page on matchism.org) there will be &quot;post votes&quot; so
that people can change their mind and force a bill to be revoted if
enough of them do. I've also got versioning built into the data
structures to enable a kind of alpha/beta test period for bills before
they come to the general-vote stage. For example the queue might have
dozens of bills in it, stretching out for months ahead, and might get
re-sorted depending on how many people vote on them, how big the
yes/no differential is, whether the Q&amp;A section on each bill indicates
there are unresolved issues, etc. The big hurdle is the UI: when a new
version of a proposal comes up the people who have voted or commented
on it previously shouldn't have to start from scratch, which means a
lot of programming work hiliting the diffs, allowing them to confirm
or update their comments, etc. Maybe for version 2.0...
  Regards,
    Scott
