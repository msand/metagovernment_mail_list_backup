<PRE>I found myself agreeing with the content but wondering what you're actually
proposing people do exactly. How do people interface with the system and
make laws?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Got through most of it. Interested to see if you get any acknowledgement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from it when you do submit. Couple errors noticed:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pg. 16, middle of second paragraph - 'this this'.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pg. 23, after the list - 'dislike like'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A good case of &quot;proofreaders eye&quot; you've got there, thanks ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I don't know if the entire 'Standard (Minimum) Wage' section is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary, seems like that would be something that would be established
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after the fact, not necessary in your explanation of the concept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed. The main motivation was to show that there was more than one
</I>&gt;<i> direct application of the results of those &quot;veil of ignorance&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> experiments I already had to move in from another section to address
</I>&gt;<i> the anticapitalism bias I saw on most of the articles on that site.
</I>&gt;<i> I've already beefed-up the introduction paragraph to that section to
</I>&gt;<i> make this connection clearer and since I'm still under the limit I'm
</I>&gt;<i> incline to leave it in...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And I'll bring up the question I am still not clear on. You say that most
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals are going to come from the executive branch, but aren't you
</I>&gt;<i> saying
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those executive positions are the exact thing SDAP's would go after?
</I>&gt;<i> Isn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that a problem? Then it's going to be up to the public to vote out and
</I>&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote back in new executives? Will there be campaigns for these positions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That whole process is lost to me and seems like might need some
</I>&gt;<i> explanation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's no direct conflict here: Most bills now come from &quot;special
</I>&gt;<i> interests&quot; (i.e., extremists like the military industrial complex,
</I>&gt;<i> corporations, the religious, gunnnies, environmentalists, etc.), and
</I>&gt;<i> pass through the legislature who essentially just endorse them with
</I>&gt;<i> relatively minor modifications (because they're pretty much required
</I>&gt;<i> to do that if they want to get reelected or employed after they leave
</I>&gt;<i> office). I would expect that original source to remain the same,
</I>&gt;<i> although I'd hope the Executive branch to be a little more selective
</I>&gt;<i> in deciding what gets through (no more renaming bridges and post
</I>&gt;<i> offices, which makes up almost half of what the US congress does
</I>&gt;<i> now!). There's not much risk of SDAP Managers proposing anything like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the jew relocation act&quot; because they'll realize a blacklash resulting
</I>&gt;<i> in their removal is likely if they did (Donald Trump, on the other
</I>&gt;<i> hand, would be impossible to remove from office merely for proposing
</I>&gt;<i> relocating muslims). The relatively few bills that originate from the
</I>&gt;<i> Executive branch generally address specific needs that it discovered
</I>&gt;<i> in the course of running the government (mostly spending bills but a
</I>&gt;<i> fair amount of regulatory rules). All those will pass through just as
</I>&gt;<i> they do now, as will most &quot;executive orders&quot; that the legislative
</I>&gt;<i> branch has very little control over now. But again the Executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch will have to learn how to tweak the proposals to balance the
</I>&gt;<i> desires of the people and the needs of government (i.e., giving The
</I>&gt;<i> People direct control allows them to enforce the &quot;benevolent&quot; aspect
</I>&gt;<i> of the benevolent dictator).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I understand your confusion: It's going to be hard for us to start
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of ourselves as the boss and the mayor/governor/president as
</I>&gt;<i> just another employee in an organization we're in charge of running.
</I>&gt;<i> Calling them &quot;managers&quot; instead of the titles they have now will help,
</I>&gt;<i> but it still will take a little getting used to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to eventually have a citizen-route to getting bills on the
</I>&gt;<i> ballot, but I've seen a lot of very poorly written initiatives (not to
</I>&gt;<i> mention the vast majority of petitions on the slacktivism sites) and
</I>&gt;<i> so definitely consider this a distant second as a source of policy.
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO the executive branch generally knows what needs to be done to
</I>&gt;<i> satisfy the needs of the people because they run into these policy
</I>&gt;<i> problems on a daily basis. The main reason they don't do that now is
</I>&gt;<i> because there is so much influence from the &quot;special interests&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> are jerking around the legislative branch that the executive branch
</I>&gt;<i> ends up serving those squeaky wheels instead of doing what they
</I>&gt;<i> already know needs to be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a section on Managers in the main manifesto that specifies
</I>&gt;<i> who they are and how they get selected (e.g., they don't &quot;run&quot; for
</I>&gt;<i> office, they're selected like employees (including the CEO) of
</I>&gt;<i> corporations, i.e., based on their qualifications, not their
</I>&gt;<i> likability):
