</I>
They're *still* going to have to vote in a replacement manager (to
replace the removed manager: A removed employee at any other level
would simply be replaced by the level of management above them). And
people realize that there's no such thing as a free lunch: While the
manager is out operations will suffer and it will cost them tax
dollars to do the search and train up the replacement. You're
apparently one of those cynics who believe that The People can't be
trusted to make rational decisions, I figure you're wrong (albeit
along with probably the majority of other people) but submit that it's
an empirical question and we won't know until we actually try it. Even
if I am overly optimistic, corrections for this potential problem are
legion and relatively easy to implement.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How the firing process would take place isn't covered but presumably a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; group would be able to file a motion to remove the manager from office
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then only the most vocal (SDAP's) would cast a vote and get them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; replaced.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course not: It'd have to be a general population vote, which under
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> AutoMatch would specifically preclude any minority from achieving this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alone. It would have to get on the ballot via some citizen route,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though, which is one of the big reasons I still believe we need one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even though it should only rarely be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alright, I guess I'll ask what the citizen route is? Is there a running poll
</I>&gt;<i> on their approval rating and once it drops below the threshold, the ballot
</I>&gt;<i> is an option?
</I>
That could work. Or maybe there's just *always* a proposal in the
queue to remove the manager and it just never makes it up to the
actual general (binding) voting phase unless a sufficient number of
people start pushing it up the queue, displacing the other proposals
ahead of it.

&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_approval_rating</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On that list only Kennedy, Eisenhower, and Roosevelt would have likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> survived their full terms (and under matchism the first two probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much longer). Which IMHO is exactly as is should be
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So 77% of presidents would have been replaced, That doesn't seem like an
</I>&gt;<i> 'almost never' type of situation. People get influenced easily, doesn't take
</I>&gt;<i> much to start thinking they could get better.
</I>
It'd only be an &quot;almost never&quot; situation in a social engineered system
where corrupt and incompetent people would never make it into
positions like that in the first place. The way we (and everyone else)
picks their presidents is a social-engineering nightmare because it
virtually guarantees that the most competent people never make it
anywhere near the office and so what you end up with are people who
merely have mastered (or are simply born with) skills that they use to
game the system. I still say you've got the wrong end of the stick:
The problem isn't that people will be trigger-happy in firing someone
if you give them the power to, it's that they're *way* too hesitant to
make a change when it should be obvious to them that one is needed.
Incumbent reelection rates are around 90% in the US and you're worried
that too many managers will get replaced? Makes no sense to me...

&gt;<i> (big snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me, there's still the issue of zany proposals that although maybe
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be passed initially need to be put out there to start a
</I>&gt;<i> conversation. With one person in charge of deciding what people get to vote
</I>&gt;<i> on, everyone's thinking gets limited.
</I>
Meh, I doubt we'll have any shortage of things to vote on and believe
that the far bigger problem is poorly written proposals that just
waste everyone's time. But it's an easy problem to solve, should it
become necessary or even desirable. To see both sides of the issue
(lots of pointless proposals, but also the government's total
rejection of the idea that they have any obligation to follow through
on the good ones) please see:
