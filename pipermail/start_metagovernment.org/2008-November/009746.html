<PRE>I'm sorry Ed, in this case I believe the devil is in the details...

It's all fine and good to say 'Without consensus there is no law&quot;, but
the value of consensus depends entirely on how consensus is defined.

Requiring a 67%, 95% or even 99% approval will not mitigate the risks
of majority overruling the minority, to the detriment of their basic
or otherwise personal rights. This is particularly true if and when
things as 'huge' as the United States become obsolete, since the
population sizes will be that much larger and thus the minority 1%
that much more numerous. Defining consensus as 100% approval (or, lack
of objection) in such an enormous population is, unfortunately, not
likely to be feasible.

So far, we have heard many proposals as to how consensus may be
defined, but the definition of consensus in theory must also work in
practice. I think, here, the Prop 8 example provides a good
theoretical exercise. How might consensus be defined in this scenario?

I would suggest that the debate start with (1) the identification of
interested parties (ie, stakeholders -- groups or individuals who have
an interest in the outcome of the legislation proposed). In the case
of Prop 8, these may include the Mormon Church, the homosexual
community, etc. I would suggest that potential interested parties
would make their case as to why they have a stake in the outcome, and
the population (stakeholders and all citizens) can debate the validity
of their arguments.

(2) All interested parties must agree (irrespective of their sizes) on
the proposed legislation (hence, consensus is assured).

(3) The proposed legislation is open for debate / open voting /
approval by whatever general consensus mechanism is agreed upon. By
analogy, the 67% or 50% threshold mentioned above might be applied to
this general consensus process.


Such an approval process would, in this particular case, assure that
an appropriate consensus is reached *before* any such bill could pass.
But, it may not work for all scenarios.

Any thoughts from the group?
