<PRE>I would like to add to what has been said that it is possible to have
things which are elegant, simple and yet capture the complexity of the
problem.

Think how slashdot presents why posts are selected: funny, interesting, etc.

And I agree you can have a slide that you will relate very easily.
We have had this discussion before, and someone pointed out that the
more something is like a continuous slide the more people will vote
with their belly, the more something is like a 0/1 the more people
will vote with their head.

I like the belly.


If someone claim that something is a summ of two different proposals,
we can have a vote to answer the question:
Does this claim really sinthesize truthfully this proposal (shown on
the right) and this proposal (shown on the left).
And if it gets enough votes it inherits the votes of the above.

But then the next question:
Do you agree with this can be asked later.

I personally would not feel scared to have more than one question
coming up to understand where does a single person stands respect to a
proposal.
Yes I like it.
No I don't think it is complete.
Yes I think it correctly represents the problem.

Each question can be posed simply. But for an important topic we
should not have a problem with asking 3 or 5 questions.


Although it is true that things that are easy are sold better, but in
this topic people are tired of seeing things to be so simple, thatthey
obviously have no real power anymore. They are only given the choise
between two equivalent parties, equivalent people, and they only can
say this or that.
