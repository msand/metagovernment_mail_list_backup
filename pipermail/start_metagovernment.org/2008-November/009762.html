I don't really much agree with this. I like those &quot;universal
declarations&quot; as general light push in  a direction, not as enforcing
laws. For once they often were written in a different historical time
than the one they are enforced. Although they are often general, as
time goes by their field of application changes with society, culture,
law and scientific understanding.

Some examples in history were really good. I think in the UK the
rights of free men were at the beginning something that only few
people had. As more people became free men, and less were slaves or
serves, the right naturally extended. Those are examples of great
positive applications. But I am not satisfied that this will always be
the case (and even _one_ case that goes bad, can do an awful lot of
damage).

Please consider the bible, for example. For many people is ok as a
general book on morality and ethics (don't do to others, etc....) .
Yet some people take it litteraly. And I see the amount of damages
that has been done over the years because of this, as really bad. But
what I really am afraid of is a group of people who assume that a
document, any document, written in an age, MUST have a final binding
effect on people in a future, different age.

Think about the problems that we are having on all the life and death
situations (abortions, suicide, euthanasia, ...) because much of our
morality and do's and dont's is taken (sometimes litteraly) from a
time where life and death were strict, clear lines. And not fuzzy
concepts. We need to have the room to adapt the laws to those changing
times.

Instead I suggest that those declarations remain a gentle push, but
the declaration itself is subject to a very slow change. I am not sure
how, though.
