&gt;<i> Do I understand this correctly, that each individual line written in a

</I>&gt;<i> twist.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, I believe that we could utilize a simple interface like BackpackIt to
build the separate sections of a Proposal. Here is an example that took two
seconds to create:

<A HREF="http://metagovernment.backpackit.com/pages">http://metagovernment.backpackit.com/pages</A>
Username: metagovernment
Password: metascore

I'm still not sure I see the need for extra controls at the &quot;superficial
vote&quot; level. Again, if they wanted to cast a more specific vote, then they
can interact with the Proposal by voting on or discussing specific sections,
or by adding their own Amendments.

The interaction you describe for User 2 seems to imply that a proposal can
&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> edited in place like a Wikipedia page. Since there can be multiple
</I>&gt;<i> competing edits
</I>&gt;<i> that follow up on this proposal, it should probably spawn a new
</I>&gt;<i> (related) proposal
</I>&gt;<i> which can be scored separatly.
</I>

While I do believe that cloning a Proposal would be a helpful way to find a
Consensus, I imagine that automatically spawning a new Proposal could be
confusing, and create an infinite number of clones that would be nearly
impossible for a human to track.

Instead, I think that popular Amendments would rise to the bottom, and
conversely with unpopular Amendments, such that once a Proposal has earned a
certain percentage of Approval from the Community, only the Popular
Amendments will remain.

I guess I shouldn't see that too harsh on User 1 though, since everybody's
&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;<i> is limited. It just means that those who make the effort maybe have more
</I>&gt;<i> control. I'm not sure that's good or bad, I guess it depends on the people
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> wikipedia gives me hope that it's good.
</I>

I don't believe that people who make more effort earn an extra vote. The
value of their contribution is contained within their Amendments, along with
the effort to be more specific with their vote. Ultimately, a User is voting
to Approve or Veto the Proposal. If the Member Vetos more than they Approve,
then the User has effectively cast a Veto vote.

Even if I'm repeating myself (I'm not even sure anybody was against
&gt;<i> it), I'd really
</I>&gt;<i> like to press for a veto option. It just allows those who do read the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, to
</I>&gt;<i> raise a flag and slow down a proposal even though it may have enough
</I>&gt;<i> support to
</I>&gt;<i> become policy (possibly because of a mob effect).
</I>

I'm simply looking for positives and negatives. Assuming that a Veto is
simply a negative vote, I say we go with Veto! (It has a much stronger value
in my mind than Deny).

Finally, I believe that the mob effect is resolved by the Percentages acting
as the Clock. I've read recommendations that put a 72 hour clock on the
vote, which seems to invite mobs to move as quickly as possible. When you're
counting on a certain percentage, the process would necessarily spread to
everyone, and not be driven by the mob mentality.
