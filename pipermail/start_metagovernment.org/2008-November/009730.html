<PRE>I have a rather large problem with the &quot;anarchist&quot; section of the video.
None of those people identified as anarchists, often they outright attacked
anarchist groups, and they did not advocate anarchism, they advocated
violence of an organized nature, which is different than anarchism despite
the fact that anarchism has and does sometimes advocate violence.  The
primary difference is that anarchists who advocate violence advocate it
against a specific group of people and only those people, the ruling class.
They do so not as a method of getting people to follow them, but as a method
of getting people to not follow the ruling class.

It is certainly arguable whether or not a society without a ruling class is
sustainable, I'd say it is, but if I didn't think so I would be an
anarchist.

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In the midst of plenty, however, the Roman people forgot what Freedom
</I>&gt;<i> entailed. They forgot that the essence of Freedom is the proper limitation
</I>&gt;<i> of Government. When Government power grows, people's Freedoms recedes. Once
</I>&gt;<i> the Romans dropped their guards, power-seeking politicians began to exceed
</I>&gt;<i> the powers granted to them in the Roman Constitution. Some learned that they
</I>&gt;<i> could elect politicians who would use Government power to take property from
</I>&gt;<i> some and give it to others. Agriculture subsidies were introduced, followed
</I>&gt;<i> by housing and welfare programs. Inevitably, taxes rose, and controls over
</I>&gt;<i> the private sectors were imposed. Soon, a number of Rome's producers could
</I>&gt;<i> no longer make ends meet, and they went on the dole. Productivity declined,
</I>&gt;<i> shortages developed, and mobs began roaming the streets demanding Bread and
</I>&gt;<i> Circuses from the Government. Many were induced to trade Freedom for
</I>&gt;<i> Security. Eventually the whole system came crashing down.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While this does sound similar to the current state of affairs in the United
</I>&gt;<i> States, I must admit that the video had a greater impact on my views of
</I>&gt;<i> Socialism vs. the Republic. Oftentimes people question my commitment to Open
</I>&gt;<i> Government, and warn of the mob mentality that used to hang cattle thieves
</I>&gt;<i> before the Sheriff managed to haul the offender off to trial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've stated before in this list that the phrase &quot;Open&quot; could be applied to
</I>&gt;<i> any form of Government, but I wonder if it might be more prudent to focus on
</I>&gt;<i> the original definition of the Republic, which translates into The Law?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should we focus our efforts on an Open Republic, in order to give the
</I>&gt;<i> people a way to protect The Law? This sounds quite radical to my way of
</I>&gt;<i> thinking, and I wanted to hear some thoughts before I go changing the way I
</I>&gt;<i> look at the world!
