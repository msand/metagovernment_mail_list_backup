Hi Jacki,

Still, it was done centuries ago.  Legislative info was openly
published with the advent of newspapers in London, in 1700.  By 1770,
the popular dailies were reporting verbatim the debates of Parliament.
So publication is not the hurdle.

</I>&gt;<i>

It was the first step for them, anyway.  And it may have been
sufficient.  They had a lively public sphere in the 18th and early
19th centuries.  But times have changed.  Our legislatures no longer
debate in public.  Private deals are hammered out among political
parties, and between the parties and their backing organizations -
lobbies, business firms, financeers, and so forth.

(Maybe there is an exception at the local level.  Not all of the
regional and city councils are caught up in the political &quot;machine&quot;.
Some of them may be debating things the old fashioned, human way.  I
don't know, their debates are not much reported.)

The next step might be a non-binding vote, as you originally
suggested.  Maybe they couldn't do that in 1700.  They had mass
petitions beginning about 1680, but organizing a separate petition for
each bill might have been difficult.  It became easy only around 1950.
The exapnsion of the telephone network gave us the enabling technology
for a simple Yes/No vote on legislative bills.  Apparently, there was
no demand for that, or we'd be voting today.  So voting is not the
hurdle.

I think we need something more interesting to vote *for*.  The
official legislative agenda is not sufficient (at least not for a
non-binding vote).  I think it would be more interesting to vote for a
*public* legislative agenda.  Rather than just shadow-voting, we'd
have a shadow legislature complete with its own proposals and
counter-proposals.  That's the hurdle.  And it's just within our
technical reach, today.
