<PRE>To Jacki Buros and Michael Allan:

I am not sure there is a topic for dispute. A system should allow for:
- aggregation of existing norms and making those available to the public
- voting on existing norms
- voting on alternatives, including alternatives to existing norms.

To  Michael Allan:

I have looked over the links you gave. Well it will be interesting to see the beta when it comes out. I would be interested to test it. Regarding the development, did you try to outsource into countries with lower labor costs.

Jacki brought up a good point: how would one aggregate existing norms or proposals from a local government for which alternatives can be developed. It would be neat for an individual to be able to 
- install the Votorola software on her website, 
- point to a local government site (assumes the local government publishes norms and proposals) and parse the norms and proposals
- promote site to the local community and organize voting and development of alternatives.

I am also curious where you are raising the funds. I do not see a donate button on <A HREF="http://zelea.com/">http://zelea.com/</A> 


To Pietro Speroni di Fenizio:

1) Limiting time of access to the system will not alleviate the differences arising from the differences in time different people have to devot&#1091; to analysis of the alternatives. It can be done off-line.

2) Political systems and society structures are based on believes, which are subjective. There were times when people were already talking about freedom and democracy, but it was perfectly OK to deny slaves and/or blacks of such freedoms. Some consider the private property on the means of production as &quot;sacred&quot; while others are convinced it is a legalized robbery.

My belief with respect to the issue you raised is that every citizen should have equal rights to a) vote on legislature, b) judge performance of executive powers (bureaucrats) and c) assess the mass media.

3) Also on the issue of free time. The fight for 8 hours work days has started about 100 years ago and it has been in place for dozens of years. Since then the productivity has risen by about 2 orders of magnitude, yet many people still struggling to have ends meet (or simply die from hanger). How is that possible?
