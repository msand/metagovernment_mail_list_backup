<PRE>This brings to mind an idea I had to include the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights into the Metagovernment Agreements.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights</A>

In relation to Jacki's comments, I believe any Nation within the United
Nation who denies Homosexuals the right to marry should lose their
membership for violating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 16th
Article of which states:

&quot;Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality
or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are
entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its
dissolution.&quot;

In relation to Metagovernment, if every human being does not have the same
rights to access our software, then its not Open Government -- its a
Proprietary Government, which I hope to see come to an end in my lifetime.

Furthermore, not only should everyone have equal access, every access must
be treated as equal. I believe the best way to define our equality on
Metagovernment is through the Artices of the Declaration of Human Rights.

And then we can start adding all of our Problems and Solutions from that
point on... Such as Compulsory Education and Socialized Health Care -- or
whatever your particular gripe might be.
