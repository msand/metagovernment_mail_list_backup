I just want to point out that Jacki proposed this sort of sectionated  
voting more than once, very early in the history of this list. E.g.:
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/232">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/232</A>

What has changed that now more people seem to think this is a viable  
option? (I'm still uncertain.)

&gt;<i> I guess I shouldn't see that too harsh on User 1 though, since

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
The vast breadth of communities and proposals should be a self- 
limiting factor against both superficial voters and mobs. If Metascore  
(or some other system) catches on and becomes a governance mechanism  
of all kinds of communities large and small, and if each community has  
many proposals, then it seems unlikely that many people will go around  
randomly voting on things they don't care much about. Instead, I  
suspect people will specialize into areas they care about.
