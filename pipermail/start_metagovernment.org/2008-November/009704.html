<PRE>Actually, in a non binding way the telephone is being used to gather
information about bills.

They are called polls. Now polls are generally much better (if done
well) then just letting anybody vote, because they are supposed to
poll the citizens in a way that is representative of the population.
Same ratio of male vs female, same ratio of people at different level
of education, same ratio of people at different level of wealth, etc.

We need to decide if it is better to have a system that tries to take
a representative sample of the population, and then uses that, or a
system that lets everybody play along with all the bias that this
means (for example people who have more free time have a bigger
political weight).

This problem of the bias is actually huge. And I am not sure how to handle it.
I mean, we are all pro &quot;everybody should be allowed to vote and
interact&quot;, but someone could accuse us of just trying to make a
democracy that fits ourselves. Think about it, although we are busy we
either have the time or the passion for internet politics. And we are
making a system where people who have this time and passion will have
an effective bigger weight.

I can see a very serious critic that someone could launch us. Anybody
has a ready answer?

Going back with the idea of the bias, you can look back at ancient
greece. Yes all the citizens were allowed to participate and vote, but
only the wealthy had the time to devote to it.

I am wondering if it wouldn't make sense to have a max time that
anyone can pass connected to the System. SOmething like: everybody can
join, but no one (no ONE!!) can participate more than x time per day
(like half an hour). Enough to vote, and to propose something. Every
concerned citizen can spend half an hour for the community. But in
this way no citizen would become boss simply because he has more time
to devote to it. This would also avoid the growth of a caste of
professional politicians.

I am in this moment thinking also to wikipedia, and how the people who
stayed there longer eventually are running it (although the claim that
is all bottom up).

Hmm, any thought on the topic?
Pietro
