That's a great synthesis, and what I had thought made sense. But  
apparently many people are offended by that idea too. &quot;Separate but  
equal&quot; was the justification for racial segregation of American  
schools in the middle of the 20th century, and it was a generally bad  
idea.

What possibly may be better would be a slight tweak to that idea,  
which is to not let anyone get married: not in the eyes of the state,  
anyway. Instead, the state can only recognize civil unions between any  
two people. Then, completely separate from that, churches can decide  
if people can get &quot;married,&quot; and they can decide what, in their  
religion, defines a marriage.

I think people would still have problems with that proposal too, but  
what we are doing here is an informal example of what synthesis  
scoring is supposed to bring about. If there really is enough  
sentiment that something needs to be done about this issue, people  
should be able to build toward a consensus through more and more  
clever syntheses.
