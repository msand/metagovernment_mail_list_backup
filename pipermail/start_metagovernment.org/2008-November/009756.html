<PRE>I would consider that &quot;not letting anyone get married&quot; to be a failure of
the system.

When I look at an open system of governance, I use the web as a model --
specifically where knowledge building is concerned. At the moment I'm
developing the user interface for knowledge building in a medical management
system, and I see a lot of similarities.

&gt;<i>From my perspective, knowledge is simply a particular order of language:
</I>what word follows another, what paragraph stacks upon another, and so forth.
This process should be reflected in the Interface, allowing everyone to +/-
1 whatever section they deem [in]appropriate.

When I hear the word &quot;synthesis&quot; being mentioned on the list, I read this to
mean that everyone gets to revise any given Resolution, and the more people
+/- 1 a particular Resolution, the more is is accepted by a larger body of
people, thus, synthesis.

This is very much how the web works today, and should be regarded as the
model on which Open Governance is constructed.

&gt;<i> What possibly may be better would be a slight tweak to that idea, which is
</I>&gt;<i> to not let anyone get married: not in the eyes of the state, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, the state can only recognize civil unions between any two people.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, completely separate from that, churches can decide if people can get
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;married,&quot; and they can decide what, in their religion, defines a marriage.
