<PRE>I just stumbled across the Metascore Alpha last night and am happy to see
that we've started off with Digg-like discussions.

I've been trying to work on the beginnings of a design document based off
what I see, but I'm having issues determining the &quot;end result.&quot;

In Digg, there is no end result. When you Digg something, the stories with
the most activity appear on the homepage. Once a story is no longer
recording activity, it simply disappears from the homepage, and only becomes
accessable through a direct link or a search result.

In MetaScore, we're working on a system of rules that govern a particular
organization. This requires the identification of both the primary
organization and the complete set of rule, correct?

My initial thoughts are to look at MetaScore like a living book, unlike
Wikipedia, whereby members contribute new paragraphs that are rated by the
community.

Here is a potential list of &quot;tabs&quot; that could drive the primary user
interface (in no particular order):

A. Home - Displays an Overview of MetaScore.
B. Issues - Lists all of the Issues that have been raised by Members.
C. Topics - Primary categorization of the Issues (aka Tags).
D. Proposals - Displays the Proposals to Issues.
E. Resolutions - List of Proposals that have been accepted by the Members.
F. Amendments - List of Resolutions that have been added to the Charter.
F. Charter - Outlines the official rules of the Organization.
G. Members - Individual ranking of most visible members.
H. Groups - Unofficial groups of Members.
I. Organizations - Official groups of Members.
J. Causes - Unofficial groups of Topics.

The idea is not to have all of these stretching across the top of every
screen, but to identify what is missing, what is unnecessary, what is vital
on every screen, and what can be grouped together below a subheader.

Ultimately, the goal is to paint a picture that clearly identifies what the
user has come to do and how to go about doing it.

What does everyone else have in mind in respect to the MetaScore User
Experience?
