<PRE>I stumbled across an old article on Lifehacker which extends the idea of
Open Source to many different areas of our lives, apart from software and
sites such as Wikipedia. Some examples include Education, and Corporations,
and even Money (yes, Money!) -- but most importantly, Government:

&quot;Our governments are controlled by a relatively small number of people (the
politicians and technocrats), who control many aspects of our lives, from
taxes and government spending to regulation of the Internet and commerce.
But imagine that open-source alternatives for these functions, perhaps one
at a time, are created and grow in acceptance.

This may be difficult to imagine, but the example of schools given above are
just one way this could happen. Email is another example of how a government
function can be co-opted, as the postal system is less necessary than before
&#8212; fewer people use the postal system to write letters, and the days of
getting bills in the mail may soon be a thing of the past.

Perhaps not every government function can be co-opted (although it's
possible), but if enough government services become obsolete because of
better alternatives, the justification of taxes becomes weaker. Open-source
helping of the poor, instead of government welfare. Open-source medical
help, instead of the government's public health system. There are many
possibilities.&quot;
