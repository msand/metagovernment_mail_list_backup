<PRE>&gt;<i> However, the strange chart that lumped Socialism and Fascism together
</I>&gt;<i> highlighted something quite clear: Government Regulations (on the Left)
</I>&gt;<i> vs. Personal Freedom (on the Right).
</I>
&quot;Strange chart&quot; indeed. Try the more useful one here
<A HREF="http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2">http://politicalcompass.org/analysis2</A>

The traditional &quot;Left Right&quot; chart is based on the distinction between
individual and collectivist economics.

The much more useful political chart devised by Anarchists sometime in the
30s (sorry, don't have a source) maps that parameter on the left right
scale and Authoritarianism on a vertical scale. The original actually
shows the Libertarians at the top and the bully boys at the bottom, which
I prefer. (Calling myself Top Left is somehow better than Bottom Left)

What Stalin and Hitler had in common was their Authoritarianism; despite
being on different sides of the &quot;traditional&quot; left right spectrum. Hitler
wasn't actually all the way to the Right. They did maintain some State
controls, but they did permit free rein to those Capitalist enterprises
which funded them. But then neither was Stalin all the way over to the
left either - allowing a small percentage of privately own business to
continue under the Soviet system.

I'm doing a substantial piece on Authoritarianism as we speak. It is based
on the brilliant work of Bob Altemayer and his online book - The
Authoritarians  <A HREF="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/">http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~altemey/</A>

They are the &quot;real&quot; enemy. Whether they come from the left or right...
