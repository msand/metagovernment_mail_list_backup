It requires no special technology to open up normative voting, per se.
That raises the question, Why isn't it already happening?  People
could have shadow-voted bills and bylaw proposals centuries ago.

Maybe something more than a Yes/No poll is needed?  It's not very
exciting to vote Yes/No to a budget proposal, for example.  Especially
when the vote is non-binding.

It gets more exciting if there are *alternative* proposals, and you
can vote for one or the other.  Especially when the alternatives are
proposed by the voters.  That only became possible after 1993, when
Internet access was widened.  So maybe we're just a little slow to
realize the possibility...

&gt;<i> I propose we develop an international system (social network) around
</I>&gt;<i> informal voting on local laws\bill proposals. It seems that software
</I>&gt;<i> can be developed. The biggest problem is probably the promotion of

</I>
Votorola can do this.  As part of the beta promotion, I plan to shadow
vote municipal bylaws.

&gt;<i> ... Here I think it would be valuable to enable voting using mobile
</I>&gt;<i> phones.
</I>
We currently have UI interfaces for command line, Web and email
clients.  We can add one for mobile devices.
