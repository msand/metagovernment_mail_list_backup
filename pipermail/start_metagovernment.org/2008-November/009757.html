<PRE>&gt;<i> Manuel,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for allowing me to participate in this project in such a
</I>&gt;<i> meaningful way.  Although I have some experience in this realm, I have not
</I>&gt;<i> 'worked' in this capacity before.  I recognize the value &amp; importance of
</I>&gt;<i> this position, though, and would like to contribute.  This is a very valid
</I>&gt;<i> point as the Resolution (texts) are at the very heart and guts of the system
</I>&gt;<i> when it comes to participation from the general public who will make it all
</I>&gt;<i> a viable effort.  We want peoples input and we want their ability to become
</I>&gt;<i> knowledgeable of the facts to be facilitated as much as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, while I don't think that the wikipedia approach is altogether bad for
</I>&gt;<i> now, I will certainly attempt to take on the task of evaluating alternatives
</I>&gt;<i> and seeking a more facilitative solution.  One possible improvement may just
</I>&gt;<i> be to take what we (all?) know in that a simple search for keyword
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;resolutions&quot; eliminates at least one click (excluding the click/enter to
</I>&gt;<i> enact the search query).  Perhaps by merely mentioning that in order to
</I>&gt;<i> quickly review the topics for proposed resolutions, one can simply search
</I>&gt;<i> for it, we could eliminate the 'search-for-it' hassle??  Any thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly support the concept of visibility of the topics and a logical
</I>&gt;<i> system for forums, etc., but it will take some thought as to what type of
</I>&gt;<i> software is best for groupthink/consensus-forming.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am thrilled to have this opportunity!! Please let me know if at any point
</I>&gt;<i> you think I am off-the-mark on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. is the best thing that I had found at the time to facilitate similar
</I>&gt;<i> endeavors (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://chriscargile.com/mediawiki/index.php/USA_EMP-ower!:About">http://chriscargile.com/mediawiki/index.php/USA_EMP-ower!:About</A>).  I am
</I>&gt;<i> somewhat of the opinion that wordpress and wikimedia software need to come
</I>&gt;<i> together to create the most useful community-driven possible.  I'm sure you
</I>&gt;<i> have utilized wordpress at some other time, but are you familiar with it?
</I>&gt;<i> (visit mine if you'd like : )    <A HREF="http://chriscargile.com/wordpress/?p=4">http://chriscargile.com/wordpress/?p=4</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best,
</I>&gt;<i> Chris
</I>
I've included your original text, because you mailed to me directly,
we like to keep as much as possible on in the open and on the
mailinglist.

&gt;<i> So, while I don't think that the wikipedia approach is altogether bad for now, I will
</I>&gt;<i> certainly attempt to take on the task of evaluating alternatives and seeking a more
</I>&gt;<i> facilitative solution.

That sounds great. So far we've just organized the layout around the
relations as they are represented in the code, because that seemed the
most straight forward way. There have been a few interface ideas for
specific areas such as tagging and navigating discussions, but the
overall concept of the site is still ill defined. I'm looking forward
to what you come up with.

For reference here are the previous discussions I could find:
<A HREF="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/589">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/589</A>
<A HREF="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/590">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/590</A>

The only things in terms of interface I've given any thought to so
far, are to keep the layout flexible. That is, the content scales
across a wide range of resolutions and is not fixed width. I also hate
this notion of a &quot;modern&quot; 8pt gray on slightly lighter gray layout.
I've also taken care to separate xhtml, css and javascript so
hopefully we can swap styles and enable access with mobile
devices/screen readers/printers etc.

&gt;<i> I strongly support the concept of visibility of the topics and a logical system for
</I>&gt;<i> forums, etc., but it will take some thought as to what type of software is best for
</I>&gt;<i> groupthink/consensus-forming.
</I>
I think, and am sure pietro would agree, that we should see if we can
organize the content in a more dynamic fashion using tags, relations
between resolutions and scores to filter and rank content, rather than
imposing an organization or taxonomy on the content.

Christoph D. Ritter mentioned that he has some experience with user
interfaces, maybe you two can find a way to work together?

p.s:
&gt;<i> Thank you for allowing me to participate
</I>
It's not as if I could &quot;allow&quot; anything in this project. I do feel
ownership for the code mainly because I wrote a good portion of it,
but there's nothing stopping you or anybody from just taking it and
running with it. Certainly I would merge anything you do for the user
interface, if you just pointed me to your branch, even if I hadn't
asked you to contribute.


Manuel
