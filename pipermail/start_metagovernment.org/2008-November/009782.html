<PRE>I'm not sure we should treat all content so uniformly and simply. I
can see how it might be preferable for proposals to just have two
options, though I would prefer them to be &quot;approve&quot; and &quot;veto&quot;. Maybe
also &quot;disapprove&quot; and &quot;abstain&quot; since that would allow people to
express their opinion but not stop a proposal in its tracks if they
can't offer a good reason.

Since we're talking about proposals here, which is something you
should probably read before you express an opinion, I don't think it's
such a good idea to put the rating controls beside the headline where
people don't even have to read the summary of the proposal. Of course
we can't force people to read anything, but we shouldn't make it too
easy for them to be careless.

For discussions though, I think a more nuanced approach may be
appropriate. When I look at slashdot it's nice to see what people
think about what somebody has written, beyond thumbs up thumbs down.
The difference in the interface, is a dropdown menu with the different
rating options, which makes a maximum of two clicks. Particularly it
would be nice to be able to mark something as spam.

When viewing a proposal, it would be appropriate to display alternate
and related versions, at which point it would be good to think about
introducing the interface for the synthesis scores.
