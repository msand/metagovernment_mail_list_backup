<PRE>I wasn't sure about this video until I reached the end, when they explained:

&quot;In the midst of plenty, however, the Roman people forgot what Freedom
entailed. They forgot that the essence of Freedom is the proper limitation
of Government. When Government power grows, people's Freedoms recedes. Once
the Romans dropped their guards, power-seeking politicians began to exceed
the powers granted to them in the Roman Constitution. Some learned that they
could elect politicians who would use Government power to take property from
some and give it to others. Agriculture subsidies were introduced, followed
by housing and welfare programs. Inevitably, taxes rose, and controls over
the private sectors were imposed. Soon, a number of Rome's producers could
no longer make ends meet, and they went on the dole. Productivity declined,
shortages developed, and mobs began roaming the streets demanding Bread and
Circuses from the Government. Many were induced to trade Freedom for
Security. Eventually the whole system came crashing down.&quot;

While this does sound similar to the current state of affairs in the United
States, I must admit that the video had a greater impact on my views of
Socialism vs. the Republic. Oftentimes people question my commitment to Open
Government, and warn of the mob mentality that used to hang cattle thieves
before the Sheriff managed to haul the offender off to trial.

I've stated before in this list that the phrase &quot;Open&quot; could be applied to
any form of Government, but I wonder if it might be more prudent to focus on
the original definition of the Republic, which translates into The Law?

Should we focus our efforts on an Open Republic, in order to give the people
a way to protect The Law? This sounds quite radical to my way of thinking,
and I wanted to hear some thoughts before I go changing the way I look at
the world!
