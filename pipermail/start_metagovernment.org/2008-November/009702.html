srmo&gt; It requires no special technology to open up normative voting, per se.
srmo&gt; That raises the question, Why isn't it already happening?  People
srmo&gt; could have shadow-voted bills and bylaw proposals centuries ago.

&quot;Centuries ago&quot; sounds a little overstating (on the other hand, Switzerland has not just shadow, but real referendums for centuries), but, of course, technology does exist. Only a) special applications have to be written and b) the idea has to be promoted.

srmo&gt; Maybe something more than a Yes/No poll is needed?  It's not very
srmo&gt; exciting to vote Yes/No to a budget proposal, for example.  Especially
srmo&gt; when the vote is non-binding.

srmo&gt; It gets more exciting if there are *alternative* proposals, and you
srmo&gt; can vote for one or the other.  Especially when the alternatives are
srmo&gt; proposed by the voters.  That only became possible after 1993, when
srmo&gt; Internet access was widened.  So maybe we're just a little slow to
srmo&gt; realize the possibility...

I see two types of transition:  a) from voting on existing legislature to voting on alternative proposals and b) from voting on local legislature to voting on state legislature (including specific budget items). 

Of course the possibility has to be realized by the public. Realizing the possibility is a prerequisite for a transition from a non-binding to a binding vote (actually approving legislative proposals by a popular vote).

What is more attractive - voting on state o&#1082; local legislature? This tread was started on the suggestion that voting on local issues will stimulate more interest. Might be so. We just need to try.

&gt;&gt;<i> I propose we develop an international system (social network) around
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> informal voting on local laws\bill proposals. It seems that software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> can be developed. The biggest problem is probably the promotion of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a system.
</I>
srmo&gt; Votorola can do this.  As part of the beta promotion, I plan to shadow
srmo&gt; vote municipal bylaws.

How are you planning to promote? As I understood from your site, Votorola works on your server. This is not something that you plan to freely distribute to local governments or any activist who would like to setup voting in his/her community. Right? 

I guess here can be 2 models: 
- one central site/system that would allow local communities to setup voting on their local laws etc. (including alternatives)
- a piece of software that every enthusiast or local government can install on a server of their choosing/

What do you think?

2nd point I gathered from your site is that &quot;The technical backbone of Votorola is a delegate-cascade voting mechanism that is open to recasting.&quot; I did not get a clear understanding of how Votorola allows to vote on legislative proposals. Is there a place to see such a demo?

&gt;&gt;<i> ... Here I think it would be valuable to enable voting using mobile
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> phones.
</I>
srmo&gt; We currently have UI interfaces for command line, Web and email
srmo&gt; clients.  We can add one for mobile devices.

Great! When would it be possible to try it?

Thank you

Dmitry
