<PRE>Well,
I think that we are here still thinking inside the box.

What our system could bring out is exactly the out of the box thinking
that could be useful here.

Why does the right wing not want marriage between two men or two women?
Because of the sacrality of marriage in their tradition.

So why not have a similar institution, but with a different name.

It is not called marriage. It is Newmarriage. Or LegalUnion. Or
RainbowUnion. But just chose one :).

It is like the flag. Every nation has their own, and any nation would
not approve another nation have one which is similar to the first one
(except italy and ireland :) ). So the new name should be decided by
the group of people who do marry people of the same sex. But the
rights (ability to inherit, ability to have a say when the partner
goes to the hospital unconscious, etc), would be the same.

A potential problem I can see is with the kids. Can a &quot;RainbowUnion&quot;
couple adopt a child?

Because here we are not dealing anymore with the rights of people do
decide of their life, but with the rights of people to influence
outside the government the rights of others.

I have the sensation that Christoph here had the assumption that the
correct thing was for proposition 8 to pass. Maybe it was. But
regarding adoptions I am not sure. For example, I consider very
important that in a house there is a person of the same sex of the
baby to give the baby a role model. So I would find it easier to
accept to women adopting a baby-girl, and to men adopting a baby-boy.
But I do see how many people would absolutely panic at this prospect.
I probably would still vote in favor of adoption because the
alternative (foster homes) are IMO much worse. Now we can discuss
this, or we can discuss how a position like this could be integrated,
and respected.

Maybe the law would favor an adoption from a  traditional marriage to
the adoption from a non traditional marriage. Especially for kids of a
different gender than the parents. But I can see how people might see
this as profoundly unjoust.


I think this issue is a great example.

Pietro
