I figure that Metagovernment is an end-goal, and there very well may  
be intermediate steps such as the many listed on the Related projects  
page.

The majority of those are very much concerned with existing  
legislation. If you look at these two, for example:
<A HREF="http://www.freegovernment.org/bills">http://www.freegovernment.org/bills</A>
<A HREF="http://www.govit.org/">http://www.govit.org/</A>
they attempt to open current (American, Federal) legislation to   
citizens.

But as you note, there are so many governments, even within just the  
U.S., that it seems like a daunting task to try to open all of them to  
citizens. And with their current structure and bureaucracy, will  
citizens really get involved?

For example, look at this list of state and local governments in the  
U.S.:
<A HREF="http://www.statelocalgov.net/">http://www.statelocalgov.net/</A>
And note that it is not even comprehensive. I noticed several township  
governments missing in Pennsylvania, for example. (Wikipedia lists  
five PA townships called Fairview; this site currently lists two.)

That's why I like Metagovernment's ground-up, start-from-scratch  
approach. It is a more daunting up-front task than targeting one  
national government, but it also makes for a much, much better model  
in the end. And it can grow much faster than an attempt to singly  
target every government everywhere.
