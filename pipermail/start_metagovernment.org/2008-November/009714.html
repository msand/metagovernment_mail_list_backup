This was the part that I had trouble with in the beginning, but after
watching the video I wondered if the roots of the Republican party that
focused on the Law would be of some value to consider in our project? From
my perspective, the American Republicans have become the War Party,
corrupted by Religious, Racial, and Sexual Intolerance -- so I certainly do
not see myself supporting their negative agenda. However, the strange chart
that lumped Socialism and Fascism together highlighted something quite
clear: Government Regulations (on the Left) vs. Personal Freedom (on the
Right).

I understand that such Open Government Control would be held by all of us,
but once it becomes all-pervasive, it is everywhere -- from the amount of
Coke Products I can purchase to the way I wear my clothes. If &quot;We the
People&quot; are to govern ourselves, where do we draw the line when are there no
limitations? It is possible that the propaganda simply made it through my
filters in a moment of weakness, but I'm concerned that our efforts to Open
everything may invite everyone into a corner of my life that I consider to
be strictly my own.
