Welcome, Casey. Just to be clear, this project gladly invites everyone  
to participate, but the project itself attempts to hold no particular  
political stance (other than what is espoused in the basic  
principles). In order to be welcoming to everyone, it is probably best  
if we stay as neutral as possible.

&gt;<i> The one aspect of your project I'm confused, and sceptical, about is  
</I>&gt;<i> the use of synthesis and what exactly that means.  It seems like

</I>
What you are describing sounds like compromise, which is very  
different from synthesis. Modern democracies usually rely on  
compromise: settling for something which appeals to no one, but which  
each side sees as better than letting the other side win.

Synthesis is a transcendence of conflict. Instead of a &quot;lowest common  
denominator&quot; compromise, it is a higher viewpoint on the situation.

As a random, real-world example: one side wants to exploit the  
resources of a forest for economic gain, another side wants to protect  
the forest because it contains endangered species. A compromise would  
be to let the first side exploit half the forest. A synthesis would be  
to turn to ecotourism, preserving the forest and making money at the  
same time.
