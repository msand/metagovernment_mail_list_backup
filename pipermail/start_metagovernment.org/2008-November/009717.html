<PRE>Hello everyone-
 
DemocracyLab will be discussing open source license options at our upcoming
board meeting on Thursday the 20th.  Bjorn Freeman-Benson, technical
director at the Eclipse Foundation, prepared the following recommendations
for our consideration (he will be in Germany for an Eclipse conference
during our board meeting next week).  I would welcome any comments or
suggestions the group has.  Thanks in advance,
 
Mark 
 
 
The open source licensing issue is an interesting one because it mixes legal
issues with politics: there are at least two major camps, but I'll get to
that in a bit. First, open source licenses are designed to provide three
freedoms:
*	The freedom to copy and use the software 
*	The freedom to make derivative versions of the software (derivative
works) 
*	The freedom to redistribute the software
There are a wide variety of open source licenses out there and each one
provides different versions of each of these freedoms. The first freedom is
pretty much universal, but of course there are exceptions, e.g., the JSON
license says that is must be &quot;used for Good, not Evil&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.crockford.com/JSON/license.html">http://www.crockford.com/JSON/license.html</A>
 
There are small variations in the first freedom amongst licenses, for
example some licenses allow the user to do pretty much anything, e.g., the
Apache 2.0 License <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php,">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php,</A> whereas
most licenses impose some redistribution restrictions on the user as
described below.
 
The second freedom is where licenses start to differ. One school of thought
is that anyone can make any derivative work, e.g., the BSD-style and MIT
licenses <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.</A> The other school of
thought is that anyone can make a derivative work, but any such derivative
work must be recontributed to the world under the same license terms, e.g.,
the Mozilla Public License
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mozilla1.1.php.">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mozilla1.1.php.</A>
 
The third freedom is where the politics really start to diverge. The key to
understanding the discussion around the freedom to redistribute is
understanding the viral nature of certain licenses (also known as
&quot;copyleft&quot;):
1.	The first type of license says &quot;you have to acknowledge where this
software came from, but other than that, you can redistribute it however you
want&quot;. For example, you could use it in a commercial product; you could
rewrite major portions and sell it in an iPhone app; you can copy from the
code and paste it into your own projects; etc. The license is not viral in
any way because it does not attach itself to the redistributed code (except,
as I mentioned, the usual requirement that you have to acknowledge its
provenance). 
2.	The second type of license says &quot;you have to keep this code under
this license, but you can use your own license for any additional code&quot;.
Thus if you took module X and distributed it with your own module Y, then X
must retain the original license while you use a different license for Y.
The Eclipse Public License
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/eclipse-1.0.php</A> is like this. What this
means is that if you modify module X (under the EPL) and redistribute your
new X-prime, then you have to keep X-prime under the EPL. This license is
semi-viral in that it attaches itself to the original code and all derived
versions, but does not infect other code. 
3.	The third type of license says &quot;you have to keep this code under
this license *and* any other code you link up to this code *also* must be
under this license&quot;. The GNU Public License
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php</A> is like this. Using my
previous example, if you use module X (under the GPL) and redistribute it
with your own code (module Y), then your module Y *must* also be GPL
licensed. This license is maximally viral because it forces all code that it
touches to be GPL'ed.
The open source community political issue is between the types 1 and 2s
versus the type 3s - without being at the Board meeting in person to explain
the politics, let me just say that I think the type 3s are wrong (and
naive). I think the GPL is a bad license because it restricts the freedom to
redistribute because it injects a certain political belief into the
software... 
 
The final, and key, question is &quot;what license should we use for Democracy
Lab?&quot; As our goal is to maximize participation and reuse, I recommend that
we choose the Mozilla Public License: it requires that derivative versions
of the DemocracyLab code base be made available in source code form, but it
is not a viral license that would restrict the code's use.
