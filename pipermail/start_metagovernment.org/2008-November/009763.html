<PRE>I believe that every organization is started with a particular goal or set
of goals in mind. This includes the Free Nelson Mandela group whose goal was
fairly obvious, the United States of America whose goals were set forth in
the Constitution. I agree that at some point, all of the laws on which we
build our organizations become mute when the foundations on which they were
built are no longer relevant, but I still believe that an organization
should be built on a particular set of goals.

That said, I really do not feel compelled to defend the Declaration of Human
Rights. If Open Government is going to take hold in the United States, we're
going to have to start with the Constitution. It's an old set of ideals that
hardly seem relevent -- in fact, Americans know the 10 Commandments better
than the Bill of Rights -- but those documents define the United States,
just like all the other documents that define all the other organizations
around the world.
