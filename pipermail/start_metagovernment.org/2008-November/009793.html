       How about a nuance for opening a proposition in the midst of the plus minus
  metascore.  (proper terminology) or the lack of, if given or not, a divisive quality 
  established thru reference to particular subject matters.  Then instead of a sayounce 
  type scenario, you would have your requirements pending input, to the particulars 
  of the feedback level, and instead of assumptions to what is actual, you would have 
  dependency levels, built stage by stage, upon a system of reliable creativity filtering, 
  by use of the editors.  That way, you have limited the ability of infractions, to be 
  in proposition form, and ominously, enable timely response by search editors to 
  recreate the particulars of any imposing In-Stance.
       There you have the meets and bounds forming what is the metagovernment.org 
  A synopsis rationale to the performance based on structuing input on relativity.
  Not a hypothetical, nor posthumous reasoning, but initialization, through output,
  of finely tuned editors.

        Regarding the rating scale, I audit contract programs regularly.  I used to
        use a 1-10 scale for each audit question but what I found was that the
        contractor and the auditor could never agree on the degree of compliance and
        they always ended up with a &quot;split the difference&quot; compromise.

        For my last round of audits, I gave three options, 1) in compliance, 2) out
        of compliance, and 3) not applicable.  The audit questions are divided
        finely enough that I don't run into areas where we need a range.  If this
        were the case, I would slice the questions more finely until I could get by
        with the yes/no response.

        Done this way, we now blaze thru our audits.  I would imagine that proposals
        cor consideration should also be managed this way so that individual
        elements could be pared away from the proposal or modified without slowing
        down the process for the entire proposal.

        &gt; Chris's 26 NOV comment about complexity is dead on.  I would like to add to
        &gt; that comment the need for moving discussions or proposals along quickly.
        &gt; The keys to selling this concept to the masses are technical elegance and
        &gt; simplicity, cost (lower the better), and actually producing results.  If
        &gt; there is a high learning curve and people don't understand how it works
        &gt; they
        &gt; won't trust it (think black box voting machines).  If they can't conclude a
        &gt; discussion quickly, they'll see no point in using it.
        &gt;
        &gt; What we're really talking about here is Government 2.0.  Gotta be faster,
        &gt; smarter, more elegant, transparent, and ubiquitous.  We should be thinking
        &gt; along the lines of Twitter.  Our product has to offer something that simply
        &gt; smokes the current system right out of the gate.

        &gt; I don't have time to look into this thread much right now, but I
        &gt; wanted to point out that sophistication can be achieved without
        &gt; sacrificing simplicity. For example (and what we had mentioned
        &gt; before), a slider is immediately intuitive and yet more nuanced than
        &gt; yes/no. The example given was the right side of this page:
        &gt; <A HREF="http://jaanix.com/">http://jaanix.com/</A>
        &gt;
        &gt; The problem with yes/no is it allows for zero nuance. People don't
        &gt; always whole-heartedly love or hate something, and I don't see a
        &gt; problem with accommodating more nuance if it can be done elegantly.
        &gt; The world is not black and white, and forcing people to think that way
        &gt; is a cause of problems, not a solution.
        &gt;
        &gt; And I certainly wouldn't want to get rid of something along the
        &gt; functionality of synthesis scoring. This is crucial to allowing
        &gt; proposals to mutate and thus build consensus.

        &gt; I would like to add to what has been said that it is possible to have
        &gt; things which are elegant, simple and yet capture the complexity of the
        &gt; problem.
        &gt;
        &gt; Think how slashdot presents why posts are selected: funny, interesting,
        &gt; etc.
        &gt;
        &gt; And I agree you can have a slide that you will relate very easily.
        &gt; We have had this discussion before, and someone pointed out that the
        &gt; more something is like a continuous slide the more people will vote
        &gt; with their belly, the more something is like a 0/1 the more people
        &gt; will vote with their head.
        &gt;
        &gt; I like the belly.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; If someone claim that something is a summ of two different proposals,
        &gt; we can have a vote to answer the question:
        &gt; Does this claim really sinthesize truthfully this proposal (shown on
        &gt; the right) and this proposal (shown on the left).
        &gt; And if it gets enough votes it inherits the votes of the above.
        &gt;
        &gt; But then the next question:
        &gt; Do you agree with this can be asked later.
        &gt;
        &gt; I personally would not feel scared to have more than one question
        &gt; coming up to understand where does a single person stands respect to a
        &gt; proposal.
        &gt; Yes I like it.
        &gt; No I don't think it is complete.
        &gt; Yes I think it correctly represents the problem.
        &gt;
        &gt; Each question can be posed simply. But for an important topic we
        &gt; should not have a problem with asking 3 or 5 questions.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; Although it is true that things that are easy are sold better, but in
        &gt; this topic people are tired of seeing things to be so simple, thatthey
        &gt; obviously have no real power anymore. They are only given the choise
        &gt; between two equivalent parties, equivalent people, and they only can
        &gt; say this or that.

        &gt; thinking

        &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; I don't have time to look into this thread much right now, but I wanted
        &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; point out that sophistication can be achieved without sacrificing
        &gt; &gt; simplicity. For example (and what we had mentioned before), a slider is
        &gt; &gt; immediately intuitive and yet more nuanced than yes/no. The example given
        &gt; &gt; was the right side of this page: <A HREF="http://jaanix.com/">http://jaanix.com/</A>
        &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; The problem with yes/no is it allows for zero nuance. People don't always
        &gt; &gt; whole-heartedly love or hate something, and I don't see a problem with
        &gt; &gt; accommodating more nuance if it can be done elegantly. The world is not
        &gt; &gt; black and white, and forcing people to think that way is a cause of
        &gt; &gt; problems, not a solution.
        &gt; &gt;
        &gt; &gt; And I certainly wouldn't want to get rid of something along the
        &gt; &gt; functionality of synthesis scoring. This is crucial to allowing proposals
        &gt; to
        &gt; &gt; mutate and thus build consensus.

        &gt; Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;
        &gt;
        &gt; I agree with the points that have been made thus far, however, I feel the
        &gt; slider and partial answers like &quot;I sort of agree&quot; can be achieved in a
        &gt; different way.
        &gt;
        &gt; Consider the following:
        &gt;
        &gt; Proposal No. 420 - MetaScore Navigation (+|-)
        &gt; Description - The MetaScore Navigation allows users to navigate through the
        &gt; MetaScore application.
        &gt;
        &gt; Line 1 - Discussions Button (+|-)
        &gt; Description - The Discussions Button displays all of the Discussions on
        &gt; MetaScore.
        &gt;
        &gt; Line 2 - Communities Button (+|-)
        &gt; Description - The Communities Button displays all of the Communities on
        &gt; MetaScore.
        &gt;
        &gt; User 1 completely agrees that we need Navigation but couldn't care less
        &gt; about the details. The User clicks on the Plus sign and lets the experts
        &gt; settle the details.
        &gt;
        &gt; User 2 agrees that we need Navigation but doesn't like the two options
        &gt; presented. The User clicks the minus sign on the first two lines and adds a
        &gt; their own options.
        &gt;
        &gt; User 3 agrees that we need a Navigation and likes some what what was
        &gt; originally presented, and some of what User 2 added to the debate. The User
        &gt; clicks the plus sign on the lines they agree with and leaves the other
        &gt; lines
        &gt; alone.
        &gt;
        &gt; User 4 is a bastard that doesn't want MetaScore to succeed for their own
        &gt; selfish interests. The User clicks the minus sign and cracks an evil grin.
        &gt;
        &gt; User 5 abstains because the User is too busy to care.
        &gt;
        &gt; The Proposal passes as the majority of members have weighed in their
        &gt; positive votes, selecting some of the original Navigational lines, and some
        &gt; of the newly proposed lines.
        &gt;
        &gt; I would consider this to not only be Consensus, but also a very open and
        &gt; accessible process that lets everyone get involved in their own particular
        &gt; way.

        &gt; Do I understand this correctly, that each individual line written in a
        &gt; proposal could
        &gt; be scored? I was thinking of comments on particular sections but this
        &gt; is an added
        &gt; twist.
        &gt;
        &gt; Certainly if we are at that level of granularity, then I don't see a
        &gt; need for anything
        &gt; beyond + and - and I wonder if it would even be possible to have a
        &gt; good interface
        &gt; with more options if we're at that level.
        &gt;
        &gt; For scoring the entire proposal (which I think you describe for User
        &gt; 1) I still think
        &gt; it would be good to have the two other options.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; The interaction you describe for User 2 seems to imply that a proposal can
        &gt; be
        &gt; edited in place like a Wikipedia page. Since there can be multiple
        &gt; competing edits
        &gt; that follow up on this proposal, it should probably spawn a new
        &gt; (related) proposal
        &gt; which can be scored separatly.
        &gt;
        &gt; In particular User 3 could add a synthasis score to the new proposal
        &gt; and carry over
        &gt; the momentum generated by the hundreds of mindless User 1s who just want
        &gt; something done, without bothering to read the proposal and seeing if they
        &gt; actually agree with what has been written there.
        &gt;
        &gt; I guess I shouldn't see that too harsh on User 1 though, since everybody's
        &gt; time
        &gt; is limited. It just means that those who make the effort maybe have more
        &gt; control. I'm not sure that's good or bad, I guess it depends on the people
        &gt; and
        &gt; wikipedia gives me hope that it's good.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; Even if I'm repeating myself (I'm not even sure anybody was against
        &gt; it), I'd really
        &gt; like to press for a veto option. It just allows those who do read the
        &gt; proposals, to
        &gt; raise a flag and slow down a proposal even though it may have enough
        &gt; support to
        &gt; become policy (possibly because of a mob effect).

        &gt; &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; Yes, I believe that we could utilize a simple interface like BackpackIt to
        &gt; build the separate sections of a Proposal. Here is an example that took two
        &gt; seconds to create:
        &gt;
        &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.backpackit.com/pages">http://metagovernment.backpackit.com/pages</A>
        &gt; Username: metagovernment
        &gt; Password: metascore
        &gt;
        &gt; I'm still not sure I see the need for extra controls at the &quot;superficial
        &gt; vote&quot; level. Again, if they wanted to cast a more specific vote, then they
        &gt; can interact with the Proposal by voting on or discussing specific
        &gt; sections,
        &gt; or by adding their own Amendments.
        &gt;
        &gt; The interaction you describe for User 2 seems to imply that a proposal can
        &gt; &gt; be
        &gt; &gt; edited in place like a Wikipedia page. Since there can be multiple
        &gt; &gt; competing edits
        &gt; &gt; that follow up on this proposal, it should probably spawn a new
        &gt; &gt; (related) proposal
        &gt; &gt; which can be scored separatly.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; While I do believe that cloning a Proposal would be a helpful way to find a
        &gt; Consensus, I imagine that automatically spawning a new Proposal could be
        &gt; confusing, and create an infinite number of clones that would be nearly
        &gt; impossible for a human to track.
        &gt;
        &gt; Instead, I think that popular Amendments would rise to the bottom, and
        &gt; conversely with unpopular Amendments, such that once a Proposal has earned
        &gt; a
        &gt; certain percentage of Approval from the Community, only the Popular
        &gt; Amendments will remain.
        &gt;
        &gt; I guess I shouldn't see that too harsh on User 1 though, since everybody's
        &gt; &gt; time
        &gt; &gt; is limited. It just means that those who make the effort maybe have more

        &gt; people
        &gt; &gt; and
        &gt; &gt; wikipedia gives me hope that it's good.
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; I don't believe that people who make more effort earn an extra vote. The
        &gt; value of their contribution is contained within their Amendments, along
        &gt; with
        &gt; the effort to be more specific with their vote. Ultimately, a User is
        &gt; voting
        &gt; to Approve or Veto the Proposal. If the Member Vetos more than they
        &gt; Approve,
        &gt; then the User has effectively cast a Veto vote.
        &gt;
        &gt; Even if I'm repeating myself (I'm not even sure anybody was against
        &gt; &gt; it), I'd really
        &gt; &gt; like to press for a veto option. It just allows those who do read the

        &gt; &gt; raise a flag and slow down a proposal even though it may have enough
        &gt; &gt; support to
        &gt; &gt; become policy (possibly because of a mob effect).
        &gt;
        &gt;
        &gt; I'm simply looking for positives and negatives. Assuming that a Veto is
        &gt; simply a negative vote, I say we go with Veto! (It has a much stronger
        &gt; value
        &gt; in my mind than Deny).
        &gt;
        &gt; Finally, I believe that the mob effect is resolved by the Percentages
        &gt; acting
        &gt; as the Clock. I've read recommendations that put a 72 hour clock on the
        &gt; vote, which seems to invite mobs to move as quickly as possible. When
        &gt; you're
        &gt; counting on a certain percentage, the process would necessarily spread to
        &gt; everyone, and not be driven by the mob mentality.
