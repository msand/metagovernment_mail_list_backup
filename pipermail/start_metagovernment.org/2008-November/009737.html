</I>
Mob?  I don't think so.  I sometimes characterize our standard
electoral systems as &quot;mass voting&quot;.  They follow that pattern, because
there's only a few candidates (or norm proposers) and a great many
voters.  There's almost no intercommunication between candidates and
voters except by mass media and advertising (in one direction), and
mass polling (in the other).

What I suggest is the exact opposite.  I'm coding a system of
peer-to-peer voting in which everybody is a bona-fide candidate, and
anyone can vote for anyone else.  To make this possible, we need to
use recursive delegation.  It's something new.  It may be difficult to
form a clear picture of how it works.  Here's an example to
illustrate:

A City Councillor proposes a new bylaw to restructure business and
property taxes.  I don't quite know how to respond to it.  I lack
information about the proposal, and I'm ignorant of tax law.  Not
wishing to depend on untrusted media sources, I instead vote for:

  A.  My friend, the economics graduate.  She then votes for:

  B.  Her former teacher, who now instructs on public policy and
      economics at the university.  He is already voting for:

  C.  A clerk working at a downtown tax consultancy, who is proposing
      a slightly different version of the bylaw.

  I -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C

As I discover, my vote ends up with C.  A couple of weeks later, I ask
A, &quot;Why are we voting for C?&quot;  She gives me several reasons.  In this
way, I learn a little more about the issues (still not an expert), and
I can better connect them with my own interests (I'm the expert on
those).

Months later, my friend D asks, &quot;Why are you voting for C?&quot;  I give
him A's explanation and explain how it fits my own situation.  I
figure I'm pretty smart.  But he's critical.  He sees flaws in my
reasoning.  He suggests that E's draft of the bylaw is far superior,
at least for someone in my situation (which is very similar to his
own).

I've never heard of E, so I look up her web site.  I compare it with
C's.  I speak again to A and D, asking them some pointed questions.
Based on their answers, I either shift my vote to D (and thence -&gt; E),
or I keep it with A (and thence -&gt; C).

(There may be flaws in this process - please point them out - but
there is nothing resembling a &quot;mob&quot;.)

&gt;<i>    ... Where also it tend to make people use their power just for
</I>&gt;<i> casting their vote (or chose who should cast their vote), while what
</I>&gt;<i> we are trying to do here (as far as I see it), is to go beyond the
</I>&gt;<i> logic of &quot;one person one vote&quot;, toward a logic of &quot;one person one
</I>&gt;<i> idea&quot; or even better &quot;one person one brain&quot; or &quot;one person one mind&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Which of course lends itself to all sorts of terrible jokes, if you
</I>&gt;<i> work in the theory of the mind department in a Uni, which I will not
</I>&gt;<i> describe.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I will try to defend my previous idea, provided we understand that
</I>&gt;<i> I have no attachment whatsoever for it.
</I>&gt;<i> You are free to trash it, but please do find a good reason to trash it.
</I>
Your idea is primarilly a critique (unequal influence), and only
secondarilly a proposed solution (to equalize it).  First I'll apply
the critique to my own proposal, and then I'll try to defend against
it with (as you say) reason.

&gt;<i> The idea that we need as a society that people stay on the net for so
</I>&gt;<i> long is it because it is needed for society, or is it because we like
</I>&gt;<i> to play. Would it be better from society point of view if we all
</I>&gt;<i> participate equally, or would it be better that people participate in
</I>&gt;<i> a natural way?
</I>
Not sure.  Usually the natural ways are better, unless we can find
fault with them.  But it's always interesting to consider the
alternatives.

&gt;<i> Because as a mathematician I can already predict that if people can
</I>&gt;<i> participate as much as they like, you would have a power law
</I>&gt;<i> distribution of time, with a flattening at some point (that is, no one
</I>&gt;<i> will stay online beyond a certain number of hours, as physiological
</I>&gt;<i> needs will kick in). A very natural distribution, and very unequal.
</I>
True.

&gt;<i> Is this what we want... sorry, let me rephrase this, is this what
</I>&gt;<i> would be best for society?
</I>
We have two societies to consider (unless someone proposes a third):

  * status quo, with standard political institutions

  * alternative, with the addition of a cascade voting medium (example
    above)

&gt;<i> Wouldn't this run the risk of having those people have a
</I>&gt;<i> disproportionate power, out of bound respect to their qualifications?
</I>
In the status quo, we have full time legislators.  Although all of us
are equally responsible for obeying the laws and bylaws, only the
official legislators are allowed to vote on them.  I agree, that
*does* seem disproportionate.  And it does seem to invite abuse (by
power or money) as you imply.

In the alternative society, by contrast, everyone has an equal vote.
Some may spend extra time in drafting legislation (like C and E), but
they do not gain disproportionate influence on that account.  They
each retain a single vote, just like everyone.  The extra time they
spend in improving the quality of their drafts does no apparent harm.
It even appears to be beneficial, at least according to the voters who
continue to approve, day after day.

&gt;<i> Do we want people to compete to write the best statements-laws, or to
</I>&gt;<i> stay as long as possible online.
</I>
We want the first, and we measure what's &quot;best&quot; by the amount of
formal assent (votes) that it acquires.

The second is irrelevant.  People can spend as much time as they like.
Some need more time.  Some need less.

&gt;<i> I don't know the answer; but I am puzzled and unsatisfied with all the
</I>&gt;<i> answers given so far.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could have a balancing actions on the weight. As you stay
</I>&gt;<i> longer and longer your voice become weaker and weaker.
</I>
There are different types of &quot;voice&quot;.  We are concerned with the voice
that decides the issue, the voice of *assent*.  In the status quo, we
are voiceless.  Only the elect are allowed to vote on the laws.

In the alternative, everyone has an equal and unvarying voice of
assent.  There is no need to change that.  It is ideal.  Just as
everyone has an equal obligation in obeying the law, so everyone ought
to have an equal vote in making the law.

In the alternative, everyone also has equal scope to contribute to the
discussion.  Even I (ignorant of tax law) was able to ask questions
and get answers from the candidates (at some level).  Try doing that
in City Council!

True that C and E are getting more air-time in some respects.  More
people by far are viewing the information on *their* web sites, than
on mine.  But that's a different kind of voice.  And there is no need
to equalize it.  We want to maximize the availablity of relevant
information, regardless of its sources.

&gt;<i> By the way, I just noticed on your signature that you are from
</I>&gt;<i> Toronto. I am in St John's (NFL), and I might pass through Toronto
</I>&gt;<i> when I go back to Europe at the end of the month. Would you like to
</I>&gt;<i> meet up? We could go out for a coffee, or something to eat.
</I>&gt;<i> And of course the invite is open to anyone else who is in or around Toronto!
</I>
Definitely, I'd enjoy it!  Let me know when your plans are firm, and
we'll meet up,
