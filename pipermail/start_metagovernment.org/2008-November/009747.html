<PRE>I'm not sure that I see the need (or ability) to positively identify each
interested party, as the open nature of the network will allow an endless
variety of parties to emerge, thus self-identifying one another.

It might be best to look at the process like a seed:

1. A Problem is submitted: &quot;Homosexuals should have the right to legally
marry.&quot; The more +/- 1 a Recommendation earns, the higher it appears in the
stack.

2. Comments may be left on the Problem, along with Links, Videos, and other
types of Information, to facilitate an Open Forum.

3. Resolutions may be proposed to the Problem, such as &quot;Amend the State
Constitution to expand the Right of Marriage to every man and woman of 16
years or older.&quot; The more +/1 a Recommendation earns, the higher it appears
on the stack.

3. Comments may be left on the Resolutions as well, in order to focus the
Open Forum on a specific Solution to the Problem.

4. When a Resolution garners enough support, the Resolution becomes ...

It would be helpful to identify the steps between a Problem and a Law, but
I'm too tired to run that whole process through my head. However, I do
believe that ultimately an Amendment to the Constitution should require the
coveted &quot;100% Vote.&quot;

(On an exhausted note, it would be funny to imagine National Broadcast
Messages that sent out warning when a Resolution reaches a certain level --
something like, &quot;Homosexual Marriage Rights have reached Condition Yellow.&quot;)
