<PRE>Thanks Michael,
yes, it does seem a better solution than mine.

I am still unconvinced, but then I was also unconvinced by mine. I am
just very aware of the critic that will eventually reach us.

 The problem I see is that voting by proxy (letting someone else vote
for you), tends to create exactly the mob group, that we want to
avoid. Where also it tend to make people use their power just for
casting their vote (or chose who should cast their vote), while what
we are trying to do here (as far as I see it), is to go beyond the
logic of &quot;one person one vote&quot;, toward a logic of &quot;one person one
idea&quot; or even better &quot;one person one brain&quot; or &quot;one person one mind&quot;.
Which of course lends itself to all sorts of terrible jokes, if you
work in the theory of the mind department in a Uni, which I will not
describe.

But I will try to defend my previous idea, provided we understand that
I have no attachment whatsoever for it.
You are free to trash it, but please do find a good reason to trash it.

The idea that we need as a society that people stay on the net for so
long is it because it is needed for society, or is it because we like
to play. Would it be better from society point of view if we all
participate equally, or would it be better that people participate in
a natural way?

Because as a mathematician I can already predict that if people can
participate as much as they like, you would have a power law
distribution of time, with a flattening at some point (that is, no one
will stay online beyond a certain number of hours, as physiological
needs will kick in). A very natural distribution, and very unequal.

Is this what we want... sorry, let me rephrase this, is this what
would be best for society?

Wouldn't this run the risk of having those people have a
disproportionate power, out of bound respect to their qualifications?
Do we want people to compete to write the best statements-laws, or to
stay as long as possible online.

I don't know the answer; but I am puzzled and unsatisfied with all the
answers given so far.

Maybe we could have a balancing actions on the weight. As you stay
longer and longer your voice become weaker and weaker.


Thanks for keeping this up, though.

By the way, I just noticed on your signature that you are from
Toronto. I am in St John's (NFL), and I might pass through Toronto
when I go back to Europe at the end of the month. Would you like to
meet up? We could go out for a coffee, or something to eat.
And of course the invite is open to anyone else who is in or around Toronto!

Pietro
