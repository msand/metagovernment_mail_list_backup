</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Centuries ago&quot; sounds a little overstating (on the other hand,
</I>&gt;<i> Switzerland has not just shadow, but real referendums for
</I>&gt;<i> centuries), but, of course, technology does exist. Only a) special
</I>&gt;<i> applications have to be written and b) the idea has to be promoted.
</I>
True, I was overstating.  The cut-off date is more like 1950 (as I
just admitted to Jacki).  Still my point stands.  If people wanted to
vote Yes/No on bills, we'd all be voting by now.

&gt;<i> I see two types of transition: a) from voting on existing
</I>&gt;<i> legislature to voting on alternative proposals and b) from voting on
</I>&gt;<i> local legislature to voting on state legislature (including specific
</I>&gt;<i> budget items).
</I>
I agree with transition (b), but I think (a) is doubtful.  I doubt
that people want to cast non-binding votes for official legislation.
It's boring, even tame.

Better to jump straight to unrestricted, independent proposals.  They
will often be at odds with the official agenda.  That makes it more
interesting, and more meaningful.

&gt;<i> Of course the possibility has to be realized by the
</I>&gt;<i> public. Realizing the possibility is a prerequisite for a transition
</I>&gt;<i> from a non-binding to a binding vote (actually approving legislative
</I>&gt;<i> proposals by a popular vote).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is more attractive - voting on state o? local legislature? This
</I>&gt;<i> tread was started on the suggestion that voting on local issues will
</I>&gt;<i> stimulate more interest. Might be so. We just need to try.
</I>
Agreed, it can only be an experiment by the public.  We'll see how it
goes, and maybe learn something.

&gt;<i> How are you planning to promote? ...
</I>
Maybe seed it with proposals from the local government, and null
counter-proposals (against them)?  Or kick-start it with some
independent intiatives that are controversial?

&gt;<i> ... As I understood from your site, Votorola works on your
</I>&gt;<i> server. This is not something that you plan to freely distribute to
</I>&gt;<i> local governments or any activist who would like to setup voting in
</I>&gt;<i> his/her community. Right?
</I>
It's the opposite - Votorola is locally installed.  For my part, I'll
run a server here in Toronto.  But that's only for local residents,
and for local issues.  Other towns and regions will install their own
servers.  Instructions are here:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/manual.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/manual.xht</A>

Later we'll support super-servers.  Each super-server will aggregate a
single, larger voter list from its local sub-servers, and thus enable
voting on higher jurisdictional issues - national laws, executives,
and so forth.

&gt;<i> I guess here can be 2 models: 
</I>&gt;<i> - one central site/system that would allow local communities to
</I>&gt;<i>   setup voting on their local laws etc. (including alternatives)
</I>&gt;<i> - a piece of software that every enthusiast or local government can
</I>&gt;<i>   install on a server of their choosing
</I>
&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
Yes, those are the two approaches.  My own design follows the second.
It's de-centralized.  Each community installs and administers its own,
independent electoral server.

&gt;<i> 2nd point I gathered from your site is that &quot;The technical backbone
</I>&gt;<i> of Votorola is a delegate-cascade voting mechanism that is open to
</I>&gt;<i> recasting.&quot; I did not get a clear understanding of how Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> allows to vote on legislative proposals. Is there a place to see
</I>&gt;<i> such a demo?
</I>
Not yet.  The alpha release only supports voting for public officials
(Mayor, MP, and so forth).  And I don't have a good technical
description of normative voting.  Maybe this is the most readable
overview:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/outline.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/outline.xht</A>

In other words, it's much the same as voting for a public official,
except the candidates aren't running for office; instead, each is
busily drafting a norm (a particular law, plan or policy).  Each
drafter has her own variation of the norm, and that variation is the
effective &quot;candidate&quot; for which the votes are cast.  Where a consensus
proves to be possible, the collective votes will cascade together, and
so will the collective text.

Here's the original proposal that sparked Votorola.  It's somewhat out
of date (and politically naive), but it's essentially correct in
outline:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Law-Making">http://zelea.com/project/textbender/d/overview.xht#Law-Making</A>

Except there's no need of a special drafting medium.  Each drafter can
choose her own medium.  We'll beta-test with wiki cascades, as I
describe here:

  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-October/000895.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-October/000895.html</A>

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... Here I think it would be valuable to enable voting using
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; mobile phones.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We currently have UI interfaces for command line, Web and email
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; clients.  We can add one for mobile devices.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great! When would it be possible to try it?
</I>
The mobile interface may be deferred.  I believe it's essential for
production, but not for the initial beta.  (Other developers are free
to code it, at any time.)

It may be March or April before we can vote on norms.  I'm currently
raising the funds for beta development.  I have enough to cover the
coding, but not the testing.  Testing may extend well over a year.
This assumes a single developer, and a single test site (Toronto).
