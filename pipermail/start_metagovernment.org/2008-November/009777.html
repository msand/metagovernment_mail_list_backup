<PRE>I completely agree that that &quot;dynamic queue&quot; effect is quite addictive (and
that the Google ads are creepy).

Looking over your comments I believe our top row should read:

1. Home - Displays a list of Proposals with the most activity.
2. Issues - A list of member submitted issues listed by their rating.
3. Groups - A list of all user groups sorted by the number of members.
4. Proposals - A list of policy changes recommended by a member group.
5. Policies - A list of policies sorted according to their approval rating.

My only addition to your comments was No. 2, as Issues seem to be an easier
way to engage the public rather than throwing them directly into a group to
rate proposals. I imagine this to function like a discussion board, with
members creating new Issues, ranking their importance, and discussing them
in further detail. Groups could connect to specific Issues, as well as
connect them to Proposals, which ultimately lead to the resulting Policy
changes.

I'll start working on some wire frames now that I'm starting to visualize
MetaScore.
