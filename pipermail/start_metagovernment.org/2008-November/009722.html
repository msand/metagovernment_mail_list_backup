</I>
So there's no restrictions on *what* people can vote for.  OK, I
agree.  No dispute.  (And no problem.  We just decouple the voting
system from the objects we vote for, referring to them by Web links.)

&gt;<i> I have looked over the links you gave. Well it will be interesting
</I>&gt;<i> to see the beta when it comes out. I would be interested to test
</I>&gt;<i> it...
</I>
I hope you do.  Testers will definitely be needed in various roles,
from electoral admins to voters.

I'll restart the alpha testing this winter.  The focus will be on
basic usability (elections for office only).  Larger scale testing
will begin toward spring, when the norm elections are brought online.

&gt;<i> ...Regarding the development, did you try to outsource into
</I>&gt;<i> countries with lower labor costs.
</I>
Actually, I do the work myself.  So there's no labour costs.  There's
just overhead (rent, beer, toothpaste).

&gt;<i> Jacki brought up a good point: how would one aggregate existing
</I>&gt;<i> norms or proposals from a local government for which alternatives
</I>&gt;<i> can be developed. It would be neat for an individual to be able to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - install the Votorola software on her website,
</I>
OK, she can already do that (alpha release).

&gt;<i> - point to a local government site (assumes the local government
</I>&gt;<i>   publishes norms and proposals) and parse the norms and proposals
</I>
Normally the voters will do this, one norm at a time.  Initially the
admin might have to do it, just to get things rolling.  For each norm
(each bylaw or ordinance proposed in Council), she will need:

  i) URI of the proposed text

 ii) personal email address of the drafter (e.g. Councillor) who
     proposed it

She then uses Votorola to create an election for that norm.  In the
alpha, this is hard work (only an admin can do it).  It will be
trivial in the beta.  She will simply provide a title (&quot;Bylaw
2009-301&quot;) and a brief description of the norm (&quot;Zoning amendment at
Harbord and Spadina Avenue&quot;).  That's all.  Votorola will then respond
with a unique URI for the election (Web and email addresses) where
people can vote.

Next, she pre-registers the Councillor (assuming he isn't registered
already).  This requires only the Councillor's name and email address
(or a symbolic address, if the real one is unavailable).

She then links the Councillor's identity to the URI of the proposed
text.  Now people can see exactly what he (for his part) is proposing.

Finally, she casts an open vote for the Councillor, thus voting for
his version of the norm.  (We assume she supports his version.  If
not, see next.)

&gt;<i> - promote site to the local community and organize voting and
</I>&gt;<i>   development of alternatives.
</I>
Anyone who wishes to vote for the official version of the norm can
simply vote for the Councillor.

Any rival who has different ideas can copy the Councillor's text, make
alterations to it, and post it to her own Web site.  Others who prefer
the alternative can shift their votes to the rival, instead of the
Councillor.

Suppose one of the rivals gets a good many votes.  She may call up the
Councillor and say, &quot;If you could change this and that in your text,
we'd be on the same page.  I could shift my vote to you!  Just think,
you'd be in the lead, with lots of happy voters.&quot;

Meanwhile, open Council elections are proceeding in parallel.  People
are voting not only for municipal norms, but also for the Councillors'
seats.

&gt;<i> I am also curious where you are raising the funds. I do not see a
</I>&gt;<i> donate button on <A HREF="http://zelea.com/">http://zelea.com/</A>
</I>
I was speaking loosely, it's not really funding.  I hire myself out
occaisionally.  I earn enough to pay the rent (usually).

Votorola is just software.  It's not an organization (DemocracyLab) or
a community (Metagovernment), so there's less need of funding.
