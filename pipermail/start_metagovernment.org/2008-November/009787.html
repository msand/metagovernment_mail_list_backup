<PRE>Do I understand this correctly, that each individual line written in a
proposal could
be scored? I was thinking of comments on particular sections but this
is an added
twist.

Certainly if we are at that level of granularity, then I don't see a
need for anything
beyond + and - and I wonder if it would even be possible to have a
good interface
with more options if we're at that level.

For scoring the entire proposal (which I think you describe for User
1) I still think
it would be good to have the two other options.


The interaction you describe for User 2 seems to imply that a proposal can be
edited in place like a Wikipedia page. Since there can be multiple
competing edits
that follow up on this proposal, it should probably spawn a new
(related) proposal
which can be scored separatly.

In particular User 3 could add a synthasis score to the new proposal
and carry over
the momentum generated by the hundreds of mindless User 1s who just want
something done, without bothering to read the proposal and seeing if they
actually agree with what has been written there.

I guess I shouldn't see that too harsh on User 1 though, since everybody's time
is limited. It just means that those who make the effort maybe have more
control. I'm not sure that's good or bad, I guess it depends on the people and
wikipedia gives me hope that it's good.


Even if I'm repeating myself (I'm not even sure anybody was against
it), I'd really
like to press for a veto option. It just allows those who do read the
proposals, to
raise a flag and slow down a proposal even though it may have enough support to
become policy (possibly because of a mob effect).
