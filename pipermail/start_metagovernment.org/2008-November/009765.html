It depends on how you view the scope and goal of the project. I think  
it is critical that we require consensus for lawmaking, in order for  
the other basic principles to work. Otherwise you just have mob-rule  
democracy, which is open to many, many criticisms. There are plenty of  
other open governance projects working on this model, and if it  
works... more power to them, but I am skeptical.

Requiring consensus for a law can't possibly work in the United States  
right now. But it certainly can work in a new chess club. As people  
get more used to working to a consensus before enacting a policy, the  
scope should be able to scale upward to larger and larger communities.
