<PRE>I stumbled across the Open Web Awards sponsored by Mashable, and noticed
they had a Politics category amongst all of the Social Networks and Start
Pages. Judging by the number of blogs in the line-up, it is obvious that the
Open Governance movement is still in transition. However, there were a
number of Direct Democracy projects, including GovIt, that could offer some
ideas for MetaScore. Of those remaining Direct Democracy projects, I wanted
to share some thought about two in particular:

Politics4All - <A HREF="http://www.politics4all.com">http://www.politics4all.com</A>

This is the one site that actually made sense to me. Simple navigational
choices and a clear 3 step process made the goal of the website quite
obvious. The &quot;Latest Updates&quot; and &quot;Blog Front-Runners&quot; initially turned me
off, but after I registered and signed into the site, the entire experience
revolved around me -- which was absolutely awesome until I got trapped in
&quot;MyP4A&quot; and couldn't find a way back to the community at large. Ultimately,
it seemed like their three step process got lost in the final execution.

Create Debate - <A HREF="http://www.createdebate.com">http://www.createdebate.com</A>

I really want to love this website as it has everything a Direct Democracy
could every want: Research, Debate, People and Topics, along with a create
method for Creating different Debates. When you cross your eyes it looks
their website is running a branch of our current Alpha. My problem is that
Create Debate simply exists to create debates -- obviously -- but why? There
did not seem to be any direct cause and effect, but instead, merely a flashy
reinvention of the old fashion bulletin board.

The two ideas I learned from these two examples were thus:

1. MetaScore should clearly identify itself and its methodologies to the end
user.

Before I managed to sink my teeth into the project, I wasn't sure if we were
creating another Wiki or a next-generation Bulletin Board. Once I managed to
imagine shooting Tweets -- simple messages from Twitter -- at the United
States Constitution, the idea began to snow ball when it passed through the
process of Proposals and Policies. This process is something very specific
that should be made very clear to the end user. Otherwise, Wikipedia and/or
Creative Commons won't see a reason to use MetaScore for their Licensing
Agreements.

2. MetaScore should clearly present the resulting Policies to the end user.

If I have come to the right conclusion, we're working on something larger
than Issues, or Groups, or Proposals -- or even Policies! We're working on
the Laws that Govern a Community -- Laws that everyone from the Creators to
the Enforcers follow (along with all the Peons in-between). These Laws are
something very specific. You can imagine reading page one of an electronic
document, or printing page two of the physical document, and go online to
change them whenever you see fit. That's a big change to the way we
typically think about those things.
