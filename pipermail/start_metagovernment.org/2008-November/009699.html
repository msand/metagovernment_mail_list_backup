<PRE>Now that the Metagovernment home page has been updated, I think it is  
fully descriptive of the project. If that is too much text, I would  
propose this abbreviated form:


The goal of the Metagovernment project is to make the governance of  
any community as accessible as a free software project. No one is  
required to participate, but everyone is allowed to participate, just  
as software developers can contribute to open source projects and  
editors can contribute to Wikipedia.

This form of democracy, called open source governance, does not entail  
voting or majority-rule. Instead, people may help govern any community  
as much or as little as they wish by creating, discussing, and  
supporting resolutions. User input is weighed by other users through a  
scoring system and brought to the attention of other participants  
interested in that input.

Metascore is intended to act as the replacement for the governance  
system of any community which currently relies on representative  
democracy for governance.

Within any community, any person may propose a new policy, comment on  
an existing or proposed policy, or comment on other people's comments.  
Everyone is then invited to apply tags and scores to each proposal and  
each comment, which are then raised in prominence if they accrue  
higher scores.

Users are also invited to apply synthesis scores to proposals, which  
are a numerical statement of how well they believe a particular  
proposal synthesizes two or more other competing proposals. Synthesis  
scores allow a proposal to &quot;steal&quot; points from the proposals it  
synthesizes.

If a proposal attains a very high score (many positive scores and very  
few negative scores), it will be considered to have attained a  
consensus and then will become a policy of the community. If a  
community is not able to achieve a consensus on a proposal, they are  
encouraged to come up with a synthesis which will bring about a  
consensus. If that fails, the proposal may fall down to a smaller sub- 
community where it can achieve consensus. That smaller community may  
then work further on the proposal until they find a way to make it  
acceptable to the larger community.

At first, we intend for Metascore to be used in very small communities  
such as clubs, interest groups, and other small or newly-formed  
organizations. From these small communities, we intend to get a better  
idea of how the process works in the real world. We will then adapt  
the software accordingly to enable it to scale to larger and larger  
communities.

At that point, we expect that Metascore will become an attractive  
governance mechanism for larger communities. Members of those  
communities may set up an instance of Metascore ad hoc, without formal  
approval from the larger community. As more members of that community  
begin to use that instance of Metascore, they will eventually invite  
the entire community to switch its formal governance mechanism over to  
the Metascore instance. In this way, any community, from a small club  
to a large government can transition to open source governance.

We do not expect governments, particularly national governments, to  
cede their authority in the near future. The intention of the  
Metagovernment and its associated communities is to gradually make a  
governance system so superior to the status quo &#8212; and so compellingly,  
unprecedentedly democratic &#8212; that the people will demand a change to  
this form of government. In states which claim to be built on  
democratic principles, the people should be able to peacefully  
transform their government through the mechanisms of that government.  
In less democratic states, the transition may take longer, but open  
source governments innately are protected from brutal force, as they  
do not have a single leader or a single physical presence.
