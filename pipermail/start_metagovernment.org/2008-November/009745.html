<PRE>Hi Ed,

Thanks for putting this list together.  I'm Roger Eaton from Los Angeles.
Mark Frischmuth clued me in and I have been dipping into the email stream
now and then.  I've been working with a couple non-profits in the area to
establish a system of &quot;group dialogs&quot; online.

Our idea here is to vote on &quot;candidate messages&quot; written by group members to
elect a message to represent the group.  Using an iterative process of
voting where a percentage of messages survive each voting round until only
one message survives, even large groups can elect a message to represent the
group.  The software is called InterMix Group Dialog Software and is being
developed by a single programmer in Uruguay, Marcelo Delgado, using specs
that I co-develop in gtalk consultation with the programmer.

Mark's system and mine both use a dual rating system - for interest and for
approval.  InterMix enables an alternation between &quot;unity&quot; rounds and
&quot;diversity&quot; rounds, where in unity rounds, all participants together elect a
message to represent their common humanity, and in diversity rounds, each
group elects its own message.  The system is meant for consensus and
community building, and is probably good for setting of community
priorities, but it is not meant for law-making and I doubt it would work for
that.  A somewhat outdated and imperfect description from a semi-technical
point of view is available at <A HREF="http://udcworld.org/gatech.htm.">http://udcworld.org/gatech.htm.</A>

The latest push is to add a forum to the system, so that candidate messages
can be discussed before being voted on.  This forum system should be
deployed by the end of the year.  Assuming all goes well we will be opening
or re-opening a couple dialogs at the beginning of 2009.  See
<A HREF="http://globalassembly.net">http://globalassembly.net</A> and
<A HREF="http://raoulwallenberginstitute.org/mep/index.html.">http://raoulwallenberginstitute.org/mep/index.html.</A>

If the [Start] list is interested to try the technology, I would be happy to
set up a simple dialog for the list with only one group.  The software
allows preset topics (which can be ignored by the participante), so if we
try a dialog, we might want to specify a couple of topics, such as
&quot;What are the sticking points in getting online democracy working?&quot; and &quot;Is
there a way to develop closer cooperation between [Start] list member
projects?&quot;.  Any other ideas for preset topics?
