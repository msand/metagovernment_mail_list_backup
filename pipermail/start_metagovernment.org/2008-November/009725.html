I do not see a problem with this sort of disproportionate power.

Look at how communities work now. You may have one person who  
dedicates a vast amount of time to, say, organizing a chess club.  
Currently, we might call that person the club president; and they get  
to make a lot of decisions for the whole club. This is somewhat  
sensible, as they have much more time invested in the project, and  
know more about what is going on. Why should some new member to the  
club (who perhaps doesn't care about the club or its other members or  
its traditions) have an equal say to that president?

Open governance, particularly the Metagovernment model, makes this  
arrangement more flexible in several ways, without breaking the  
sensible part of giving increased &quot;power&quot; to those with more community  
dedication.

First, it doesn't allow for any particular empowered president (or  
other ruler), so people's level of power is always a direct result of  
their community dedication, not some artificial empowerment mechanism.

Second, everything is transparent and archived. So if only one person  
is doing all the work, everyone else can still see what they have been  
doing, even at a later date.

Third, anyone else can empower themselves at any time by simply  
spending more time in the community. And likewise, someone who is  
currently empowered can quickly lose that empowerment if they start  
ignoring the community.

To me, that sounds like a very natural, very flexible, very fair way  
of distributing power. Much better than giving exactly equal status to  
one person who has dedicated their life to a community and another  
person who just showed up and is acting on a whim. And also better  
than giving power to one individual and hoping that they do the right  
thing for the community.
