I don't think is just a matter of being more used to this model.
Although this of course matters too.

I think there is also something about raw numbers.
As more people get involved the depth of the discussion might grow not
linearly but as n square, or n^n.

Of course while mathematically those discussion might go through a
combinatorial explosion, this will not happen if the topic is bounded.
We are speaking about this and only this. Are we going to put the
table here or there. The number of possibilities are limited, the
number of point of views are limited by the fact that reality itself
in this regard is limited, and then the system will work.

But if the discussion is allowed to go out of the boundaries, it can
easily explode, and never reach any synthesis.

SO by all mean, let us start with consensus, but do not expect that to
always work. Let us keep both the software and our heart prepared for
alternatives.

Think at something as simple as european union. At the beginning all
decisions were based on consensus. This was ok as long as EU was few
states. As soon as it started to expand with all the eastern european
states, the sheer number of states, of specific cases, of details,
made every discussion non conclusive. Until they have tried
(suceeded?) to change it into a majority rule.
