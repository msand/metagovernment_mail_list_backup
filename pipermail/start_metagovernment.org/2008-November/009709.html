I think this the essential point... for every previous form of  
government. What separates open source governance, at least in the  
Metagovernment model, is that there is no government except for the  
people.

We discussed this quite a while ago in defining the difference between  
libertarianism and open source governance. They look somewhat similar,  
except that libertarians are afraid of the government. In our model,  
we embrace government, because it is us.

In a consensus government where there is no law which does not  
maintain consensus, then there cannot be any &quot;us vs. them&quot; between  
government and the people. I truly believe that a mature open source  
government can transform citizenship such that all people are actually  
engaged in civil society. In fact, if there is a full mesh of open  
source communities, then every social act is a participation in  
governance.

&gt;<i> Oftentimes people question my commitment to Open Government, and

</I>&gt;<i> the Sheriff managed to haul the offender off to trial.
</I>
Consensus government is the opposite of mob rule. As long as there is  
any substantial minority with a modicum of reason, there can be no  
rash mob acts. As people get more used to the idea of developing  
consensus before action, the idea of mob action will diminish, not  
increase.

The status quo (e.g. America) is quite prone to mob rule. Look at the  
two American invasions of Iraq: both of which involved hyping the  
American public into a froth until a large majority wanted to invade.  
But there was never a consensus... just a fevered majority. In a  
consensus-building process, at least the second invasion probably  
could not have garnered a consensus.
