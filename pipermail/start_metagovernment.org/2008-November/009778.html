<PRE>I'm attaching a first draft of the design document.

I took the liberty of taking a step back from the seriousness of group
proposals and focused on the issues that matter most. While this does sound
poetic, I believe that issues are the most direct route to the widest
audience of users. Requiring members to sign up for groups and read detailed
proposals seems appropriate for more advanced users, although everyone is
free to participate on all levels of MetaScore.

Here's a quick breakdown of the pages:

1. Homepage - Displays the most active issues, along with small blocks for
active groups and proposals on the side. The sub-navigation enables the user
to learn more about the process and the associated organization, as well as
the ability to get involved.

2. Issues - Lists all of the active Issues on metascore, with sub-navigation
to sort according to rank and activity, and the ability to create a new
Issue.

3. Groups - Lists all of the active Groups on metascore, with sub-navigation
to sort according to rank and activity, and the ability to create a new
Group.

4. Proposals - Lists all of the active Proposals on metascore, with
sub-navigation to sort according to rank and activity, and the ability to
create a new Proposal.

5. Policies - Lists all of the active Policies on metascore, with
sub-navigation to sort according to rank and activity, with a link to get
involved in the process.

Feedback would be appreciated (as well as a link to store the document!)
