That's the whole point behind the third basic principle: &quot;Without  
consensus there is no law.&quot; That's a somewhat radical proposition in  
that it says that the basic state of government is non-regulation, and  
that laws can only actualize if they can attain consensus. (The point  
of the fourth principle -- and fifth, if it comes to pass -- is to  
greatly soften that radicalism by making consensus much more likely to  
happen.)

Proposition 8 passed with just over 52 percent of the vote:

No matter how we define consensus, it most certainly will be higher  
than that. I'm guessing even for something as huge as the U.S., it  
would still be at least 67 percent. (Or more likely that by the time  
Metagovernment can scale to that level, things as huge and  
geographically static as the U.S. might just be obsolete.)

Whenever people have questions about the project that seem like  
stumpers, I always find the answer in one or two of the basic  
principles. That's where the basic principles came from... until they  
were all put together, the project just didn't seem to work. Once they  
were in place, everything else seemed to come together very naturally.
