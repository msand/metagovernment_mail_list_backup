<PRE>I've recently responded to a long conversation on the Open Access mailing
list that I wanted to share with Metagovernment.

One of the subscribers had mentioned some concerns regarding the difference
between:

1. 'Open Access' which allows citizens to freely access their government
data.
2. 'Open Governance' which allows citizens to interact with their government
data.

While I remain a huge supporter of open governance -- as I believe that we
should not only have access to our data, but also have access to tools which
allow us to manage our government data (including our votes) -- California
Issue 8 brought about the same concerns I shared with the subscriber who had
originated the thread.

Specifically, non-gay (aka Straight) voters had the option to approve or
deny the rights of gay couples to legally marry and adopt children. I
believe this is an excellent example of the majority determining the rights
of a minority, and I wonder if this might be further amplified in an open
governance scenario?

One criticism I've heard is that the American Government should not be
involved with marriage rights -- they should simply be a freedom for
everyone -- but what is the difference between the Constitution on which the
American Government is written, and Freedoms shared by all Americans?

In Open Governance, I see these Freedoms accessible to all, however, Issue 8
clearly illustrates that the majority of California would deny their
homosexual minority a basic freedom to commit to another human being -- or,
specifically, they won't legally recognize their commitment.

I seriously doubt that giving people more access to Information would have
stopped the multi-billion dollar efforts of the Mormon Church. At best,
everyone would have a platform on which to vocalize their opinions. At
worst, Open Governance will enable multi-billion dollar efforts to directly
control the Government.

(My question has prompted interest from a few of the members who I have
invited to join our list.)
