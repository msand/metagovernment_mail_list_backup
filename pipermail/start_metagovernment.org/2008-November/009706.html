<PRE>I would agree completely with what Mike says below .. politics right now is
too opaque, and legalese too difficult to understand. Right now, only the
most popular issues ('hot topics') or those that are guaranteed to interest
the majority of viewers are noticed. Small interest groups exist to notify
the public but only where they are well funded. The control of dialogue
happens not only at the level of what proposals make it to the floor, but
also by the media (or, simple dissemination of information).

Lack of access to information make current polling methods (like those on
house-phones or even those over the internet) relatively useless. With some
limitations, uninformed opinions are basically open to the highest bidder.

I have said from the beginning that even a shadow-government like
implementation needs to be powerful (ie featured) enough to support a
live-government system. the sense of activities being meaningful is critical
for people to participate and to participate responsibly.

Even with a counter-proposal system, current proposals and currently active
legislation have to be included. These proposals cannot occur in a vacuum.

Barriers to information exist at all levels -- we might do well to focus on
one at a time. Getting current legislation online at all these different
levels and in different organizations will be a long, hard battle. But, it's
one that people may more easily support than that of open governance.

I'm thinking, in the long term, it makes sense to set up a system to track
which governments have parts/all of their legislation online, and if it is
online, how it can be aggregated. This will be useful for metagovernment,
once it's up and running, but may also be useful otherwise.

Thoughts?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Jacki,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Still, it was done centuries ago.  Legislative info was openly
</I>&gt;<i> published with the advent of newspapers in London, in 1700.  By 1770,
</I>&gt;<i> the popular dailies were reporting verbatim the debates of Parliament.
</I>&gt;<i> So publication is not the hurdle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... An API that Votorola or some other site could use to aggregate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these legislative texts would be extraordinarily useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The initiative I was thinking of would essentially put the legislation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; online for people to review/comment. Gaining access to it is a first
</I>&gt;<i> step, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was the first step for them, anyway.  And it may have been
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient.  They had a lively public sphere in the 18th and early
</I>&gt;<i> 19th centuries.  But times have changed.  Our legislatures no longer
</I>&gt;<i> debate in public.  Private deals are hammered out among political
</I>&gt;<i> parties, and between the parties and their backing organizations -
</I>&gt;<i> lobbies, business firms, financeers, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Maybe there is an exception at the local level.  Not all of the
</I>&gt;<i> regional and city councils are caught up in the political &quot;machine&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Some of them may be debating things the old fashioned, human way.  I
</I>&gt;<i> don't know, their debates are not much reported.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next step might be a non-binding vote, as you originally
</I>&gt;<i> suggested.  Maybe they couldn't do that in 1700.  They had mass
</I>&gt;<i> petitions beginning about 1680, but organizing a separate petition for
</I>&gt;<i> each bill might have been difficult.  It became easy only around 1950.
</I>&gt;<i> The exapnsion of the telephone network gave us the enabling technology
</I>&gt;<i> for a simple Yes/No vote on legislative bills.  Apparently, there was
</I>&gt;<i> no demand for that, or we'd be voting today.  So voting is not the
</I>&gt;<i> hurdle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need something more interesting to vote *for*.  The
</I>&gt;<i> official legislative agenda is not sufficient (at least not for a
</I>&gt;<i> non-binding vote).  I think it would be more interesting to vote for a
</I>&gt;<i> *public* legislative agenda.  Rather than just shadow-voting, we'd
</I>&gt;<i> have a shadow legislature complete with its own proposals and
</I>&gt;<i> counter-proposals.  That's the hurdle.  And it's just within our
</I>&gt;<i> technical reach, today.
