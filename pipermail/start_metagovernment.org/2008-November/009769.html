I think you are right that conversations might get out of hand (which  
is another reason I support recursive user scoring), but I also think  
it is necessary for synthesis. Take the real-world example I gave in a  
previous thread of people who want to cut a forest for profit and  
people who want to preserve the forest for endangered species. The  
synthesis of turning to ecotourism for profit is far outside the  
bounds of the original discussion. But clearly it is a vastly superior  
solution than anything &quot;inside the box.&quot;

It may be OK for things to remain unresolved. If there is no consensus  
that a law should be enacted, then why should it? If there is a real  
problem that has to be solved, then people will need to either work  
harder for a consensus or change their perspective about the need for  
a law.

I am, as you say, prepared for alternatives to consensus, but I think  
it should not be abandoned just because things don't get done. If only  
51% of people want something to get done, I suggest it should not be  
done. (Or they need to make a better case for it.)
