<PRE>First off, my humble apologies for failing to maintain the level of
involvement in this project which it deserves and needs. Unfortunately, I
am not in a position yet to improve on that participation.

This one, however, I could not pass by.

By pure chance I opened Chris's posting and was sufficiently intrigued to
go and watch the video he linked to. In short, Chris, if you are thinking
of adopting a new world view, PUHLEASE don't base it on this nonsense!

It is gold dust - The motherlode of republican drivel. I shall, in time,
use it as the focal point for my exposure of the vacuous aphilosophical
approach to politics demonstrated most clearly by the randroids and their
ilk. Anyone who can define Fascism as left wing, or fail to understand the
vital connection between Roman wealth and their policies of conquest and
slavery is clearly so politically naive they shouldn't be allowed out in
public without a nanny.

I haven't got time to demolish it completely here and now but all you need
to do to begin the demolition process yourselves is ask the question &quot;Who
Forms The Law?&quot; which their republican Utopia is supposed to be controlled
by. If the answer is anything less than &quot;We The People&quot; then all they are
describing is yet another Oligarchy.

For anyone wanting to explore my own drivel in more depth I have two
relevant passages already online. First is my attack on the cult of
Leadership.

and second, somewhat more immediately relevant to this project is my
attack on Meritocracy (which is usually a thinly veiled justification for
Oligarchy). This contains, amongst other things, my first draft of a
&quot;Democratic Debating Algorithm&quot; and the definition of the &quot;7 Sub
Propositions&quot; which are really required to decide any single Democratic
Proposition.

I hope others find them useful.

Regards

Harry



&gt;<i> I wasn't sure about this video until I reached the end, when they
</I>&gt;<i> explained:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In the midst of plenty, however, the Roman people forgot what Freedom
</I>&gt;<i> entailed. They forgot that the essence of Freedom is the proper limitation
</I>&gt;<i> of Government. When Government power grows, people's Freedoms recedes.
</I>&gt;<i> Once
</I>&gt;<i> the Romans dropped their guards, power-seeking politicians began to exceed
</I>&gt;<i> the powers granted to them in the Roman Constitution. Some learned that
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> could elect politicians who would use Government power to take property
</I>&gt;<i> from
</I>&gt;<i> some and give it to others. Agriculture subsidies were introduced,
</I>&gt;<i> followed
</I>&gt;<i> by housing and welfare programs. Inevitably, taxes rose, and controls over
</I>&gt;<i> the private sectors were imposed. Soon, a number of Rome's producers could
</I>&gt;<i> no longer make ends meet, and they went on the dole. Productivity
</I>&gt;<i> declined,
</I>&gt;<i> shortages developed, and mobs began roaming the streets demanding Bread
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> Circuses from the Government. Many were induced to trade Freedom for
</I>&gt;<i> Security. Eventually the whole system came crashing down.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=36590912">http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=36590912</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While this does sound similar to the current state of affairs in the
</I>&gt;<i> United
</I>&gt;<i> States, I must admit that the video had a greater impact on my views of
</I>&gt;<i> Socialism vs. the Republic. Oftentimes people question my commitment to
</I>&gt;<i> Open
</I>&gt;<i> Government, and warn of the mob mentality that used to hang cattle thieves
</I>&gt;<i> before the Sheriff managed to haul the offender off to trial.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've stated before in this list that the phrase &quot;Open&quot; could be applied to
</I>&gt;<i> any form of Government, but I wonder if it might be more prudent to focus
</I>&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;<i> the original definition of the Republic, which translates into The Law?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Should we focus our efforts on an Open Republic, in order to give the
</I>&gt;<i> people
</I>&gt;<i> a way to protect The Law? This sounds quite radical to my way of thinking,
</I>&gt;<i> and I wanted to hear some thoughts before I go changing the way I look at
</I>&gt;<i> the world!
