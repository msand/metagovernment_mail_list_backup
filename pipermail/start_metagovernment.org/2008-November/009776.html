<PRE>&gt;<i> Ultimately, the goal is to paint a picture that clearly identifies what the
</I>&gt;<i> user has come to do and how to go about doing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What does everyone else have in mind in respect to the MetaScore User Experience?
</I>
Maybe a good starting point would be the current and most important
proposals (as determined by their scores) and treat them like the
articles on the digg front page. From there you could drill down into
the discussions and proposals or go to the other sections you
suggested.

This always gives people a reason to come back, since most of the time
something possibly new and interesting might have happened.

&gt;<i> In MetaScore, we're working on a system of rules that govern a particular
</I>&gt;<i> organization. This requires the identification of both the primary
</I>&gt;<i> organization and the complete set of rule, correct?
</I>
Yes, the central element is probably the community and the groups the
user is particularly concerned with. Here I think of a group as
focusing on editing and preparing proposals, before they are presented
to be merged into the community as a policy.

&gt;<i> D. Proposals - Displays the Proposals to Issues.
</I>&gt;<i> E. Resolutions - List of Proposals that have been accepted by the Members.
</I>&gt;<i> F. Amendments - List of Resolutions that have been added to the Charter.
</I>&gt;<i> F. Charter - Outlines the official rules of the Organization.
</I>
Rather than having these categories, I would suggest just
distinguishing between proposals and policies. Everything in the
community repository is implicitly a policy, since all proposals come
either from groups or users and are then merged into the community
repository when accepted. A proposal would however go through some
stages before being accepted as a policy. Stages might be draft, call
for comments, proposed, accepted, rejected etc.

One aspect I see crossing all sections would be discussions. For any
part of the site, you may read the discussions regarding that section.
For example the discussion across the entire community to get a broad
overview of what's going on, if you are just regarding a specific
proposal you might see the discussion of the people editing it. All
messages should be relevant to the context of the content the user is
viewing; kinda like the user interface advertisements from Google to
my right that are kinda creeping me out atm. :)

A problem I see here is that things might seem buried too much.
Everything might be interlinked like in wikipedia, so that when
looking at a policy you might see proposed modifications, discussion,
users involved, history etc. but I'm not sure how overwhelming or
overloaded that might be.
