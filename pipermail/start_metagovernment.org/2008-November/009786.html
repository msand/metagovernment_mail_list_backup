<PRE>I agree with the points that have been made thus far, however, I feel the
slider and partial answers like &quot;I sort of agree&quot; can be achieved in a
different way.

Consider the following:

Proposal No. 420 - MetaScore Navigation (+|-)
Description - The MetaScore Navigation allows users to navigate through the
MetaScore application.

Line 1 - Discussions Button (+|-)
Description - The Discussions Button displays all of the Discussions on
MetaScore.

Line 2 - Communities Button (+|-)
Description - The Communities Button displays all of the Communities on
MetaScore.

User 1 completely agrees that we need Navigation but couldn't care less
about the details. The User clicks on the Plus sign and lets the experts
settle the details.

User 2 agrees that we need Navigation but doesn't like the two options
presented. The User clicks the minus sign on the first two lines and adds a
their own options.

User 3 agrees that we need a Navigation and likes some what what was
originally presented, and some of what User 2 added to the debate. The User
clicks the plus sign on the lines they agree with and leaves the other lines
alone.

User 4 is a bastard that doesn't want MetaScore to succeed for their own
selfish interests. The User clicks the minus sign and cracks an evil grin.

User 5 abstains because the User is too busy to care.

The Proposal passes as the majority of members have weighed in their
positive votes, selecting some of the original Navigational lines, and some
of the newly proposed lines.

I would consider this to not only be Consensus, but also a very open and
accessible process that lets everyone get involved in their own particular
way.
