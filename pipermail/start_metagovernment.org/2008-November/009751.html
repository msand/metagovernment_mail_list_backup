In the status quo, we generally have one of two possibilities. Either:
A) 50.01% can completely overrule 49.99%
or
B) A tiny minority or even one person can overrule everyone.

Given that, I would say that any greater percentage we can attain is  
going to be more democratic. We cannot hope to achieve perfection, but  
we can certainly do better than the above.

I just want to take issue with the way this is worded. If  
Metagovernment develops the way we are proposing (starting up from  
tabula rasa in small communities and working its way up to larger and  
larger ones), then laws like this won't be possible.

In a no-law-without-consensus scenario, it must be assumed that  
everyone has every right unless there is a law against it. So a law  
wouldn't be worded to give rights, only to take them away. And in that  
case, as shown in the Prop 8 results, I think it is usually difficult  
to get a large majority to decide to take away rights even from a  
small minority.

But I can imagine no problem getting a large consensus to agree that  
people do not have the right, for example, to murder or steal.
