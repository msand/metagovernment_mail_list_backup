Yes, it is interesting how the history of a nation really impose
something on the present. We (Italy) do have that kind of civil union.
And they don't have all the same rights. And people discussed a lot.
But no one that I know of, took the &quot;separate but equal&quot; example.

But also a man and a woman who don't want to be married but want to
have a &quot;civil union&quot; can. So I have two friends of mine who have a
family. But they are not married in church, not in front of the state,
but made this &quot;civil union&quot;. I know they are an open couple. Very
stable and with 2 beautiful kids. I am not sure what their rights are.
How is it different from the &quot;being married in front of the state&quot;
case. But I have the sensation that if more and more options were
available, to everybody, a lot of the pressure would be relieved for
everybody.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What possibly may be better would be a slight tweak to that idea, which is
</I>&gt;<i> to not let anyone get married: not in the eyes of the state, anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, the state can only recognize civil unions between any two people.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, completely separate from that, churches can decide if people can get
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;married,&quot; and they can decide what, in their religion, defines a marriage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually this is how it is done in italy. You both go to church AND to
the burocratic office.
I think things are a bit more complicated, and if you go to church
this does have some legal value, but I don't know what. And you can
divorce of one easily, but not of the other. The church one cannot be
divorced but can be declared null. So that even when it was done it
was not a real marriage. For example if it comes out that one person
was not fully committed to it (&quot;I marry you but only if you will do
this and that&quot;).

But still two person of the same sex cannot get married in front of the law.


&gt;<i> I think people would still have problems with that proposal too, but what we
</I>&gt;<i> are doing here is an informal example of what synthesis scoring is supposed
</I>&gt;<i> to bring about. If there really is enough sentiment that something needs to
</I>&gt;<i> be done about this issue, people should be able to build toward a consensus
</I>&gt;<i> through more and more clever syntheses.
