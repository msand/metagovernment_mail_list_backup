<PRE>I was struck during the election by how much effect the various ballot initiatives can have on the electorate. 

In massachusetts, the initiatives (bill proposals) generated more news and media attention locally than the presidential election did. 

It would be interesting to put together an initiative to greatly expand local governments, putting most if not all bills up for a (non-binding) popular consensus vote.. This might be. a first step in guaging the enthusiasm at large for such a form of governance.

Thoughts?

&quot;I can bank online, day trade online, file my taxes online, shop
online&#8211;all securely&#8211; but people have to wait hours in line to cast a
ballot in a federal election. Give me a break! If we can't even get
our act together and set up a secure and functional voting method 4
years after the last election fiasco, then I have no faith that we
will be able to turn the economy around.&quot;

And a rough count of the other comments suggests around 3.9% of the
respondents (31/795) were independently thinking along similar lines.
It's not Gallup, and it doesn't speak to what percentage of people
would like or be comfortable to see forms of governance online, but it
is somewhat encouraging nonetheless. Not that I detect any organised
pushback - but for what once seemed like a pretty far-out idea - we
are winning the meme war.

In the spirit of good things_not_ being lost in the noise - if anyone
is harbouring some far-out ideas which they've kept to themselves due
to fear of ridicule, or because they are not fully developed - let's
hear them :-)
