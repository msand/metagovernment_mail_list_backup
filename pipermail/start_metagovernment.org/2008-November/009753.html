<PRE>Hello Mike,
and welcome.

I think we all agree that the end experience for the user must be of
great simplicity, and ease of use.

On the other side the internal structure might be much more complicated,
provided it is well thought out, completely understood by the
technicians and totally transparent.

So adding tags to a resolution must be very easy.
But the formula with which the tags are evaluated to find out what
resolutions are similar to a particular one, and how does the weight
from one resolution influence the weight on another resolution does
not need to be easy to use. It would be better if it was, but even if
only technicians and math people understand it. That would not be a
problem.

You mentioned Google. Google is the perfect example. The interface is
easy to use (although you can use quite some tricks if you go and
study the tutorial). But the algorithms used by google to rank and
discover the pages are all but easy.

Also I think there is a number of people here who are resisting any
joint venture between this project and a company. So I think the idea
of collaborating with google at this stage is not really possible.

I am looking forward to your feedbacks, especially from your
experience as a federal government employee.
