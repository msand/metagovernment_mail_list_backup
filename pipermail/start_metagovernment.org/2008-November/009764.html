<PRE>&gt;<i> &quot;Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality
</I>&gt;<i> or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are
</I>&gt;<i> entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its
</I>&gt;<i> dissolution.&quot;
</I>
This seems to be fairly vague on gay marriage though if you ask me.
There is nothing in there about discrimination due to sexual
orientation and Men an women could be interpreted as exclusively
between a man and a woman.

I wonder, if you have to make laws illegible, if you want to be
precise. In spirit I guess the law would be for gay marriage, but it's
certainly not clear. For the laws we write with metagovernment I would
like to have summaries, explanations and examples for the laws we
write, apart from the actual text of the law. This makes explicit the
spirit of the law and may also be helpful in court.

This may bloat the texts somewhat, but hopefully only few people will
have to read the details.
