I don't have time to look into this thread much right now, but I  
wanted to point out that sophistication can be achieved without  
sacrificing simplicity. For example (and what we had mentioned  
before), a slider is immediately intuitive and yet more nuanced than  
yes/no. The example given was the right side of this page: <A HREF="http://jaanix.com/">http://jaanix.com/</A>

The problem with yes/no is it allows for zero nuance. People don't  
always whole-heartedly love or hate something, and I don't see a  
problem with accommodating more nuance if it can be done elegantly.  
The world is not black and white, and forcing people to think that way  
is a cause of problems, not a solution.

And I certainly wouldn't want to get rid of something along the  
functionality of synthesis scoring. This is crucial to allowing  
proposals to mutate and thus build consensus.
