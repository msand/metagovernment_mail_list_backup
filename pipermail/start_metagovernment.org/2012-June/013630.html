<PRE>Welcome Olaf,

(Olaf and I spoke about lowercased.org last year.)
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/political-and-electoral-reform/forum/topic/creating-a-modern-citizen-lawmaking-process-in-nyc">http://www.nycga.net/groups/political-and-electoral-reform/forum/topic/creating-a-modern-citizen-lawmaking-process-in-nyc</A>

&gt;<i> What we really could use right now before the amendment's text is
</I>&gt;<i> locked for petitioning, is recommendations for any aspects of the
</I>&gt;<i> software, hardware, or implementation of the citizens' forum that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone thinks we should require to maximise its usefulness or
</I>&gt;<i> minimise its corruptibility / vulnerability to co-option.
</I>
I still recommend allowing the citizen free choice in this regard.
Just as one may choose which newspaper to read in the morning (or even
publish a newspaper of one's own), so the citizen might freely choose
the form and content of his/her political participation.  People will
naturally choose what is most useful and trusted, and do all the work
themselves of maximizing utility and minimizing corruption.  The
primary requirement of the system should therefore be freedom of
choice in regard to the system itself.

You answered me previously and I failed to reply.  I reply below.

&gt;<i> As far as vote tabulation goes, to me the critical concern is one of
</I>&gt;<i> transparency of the system and verifiability of the tally. (This is
</I>&gt;<i> easy to achieve for us since with electronic signatures to place
</I>&gt;<i> proposals on the ballot, they aren&#8217;t secret.) It&#8217;s unclear to me
</I>&gt;<i> what the advantage is of having multiple such systems for a single
</I>&gt;<i> jurisdiction for our application, given it would be open to public
</I>&gt;<i> inspection, use open source software, and its results would be
</I>&gt;<i> verifiable. For actual votes that would have to be kept secret
</I>&gt;<i> (something our proposals do not incorporate) I can see how such a
</I>&gt;<i> system of vote mirroring might have merit, but am technically
</I>&gt;<i> ignorant. ...
</I>
I think we're *all* ignorant because the technology is still immature.
Who knows what shape it will take?  One advantage of allowing it to
take multiple shapes is that we get to see what the alternatives are,
try them out for ourselves, and choose the best from among them.
Another advantage is that people have different needs and hopes.  No
single system can satisfy all of them, but multiple systems probably
can.

&gt;<i> ... For actual votes that would have to be kept secret (something
</I>&gt;<i> our proposals do not incorporate) I can see how such a system of
</I>&gt;<i> vote mirroring might have merit, but am technically ignorant.
</I>
I didn't know your votes were public.  That makes all the difference.
Private voting is actually incompatible with vote mirroring, whereas
any system of public voting is compatible *as is*.  Its votes may be
imaged and combined with votes from other sources.  The source itself
need not do any technical work.

&gt;<i> There is no shortage of jurisdictions to provide for a diversity of
</I>&gt;<i> tabulation systems. As far as the many alternative ways of
</I>&gt;<i> structuring voting, whether in elections proper or in some
</I>&gt;<i> qualifying preceding process, while i agree that these should be
</I>&gt;<i> explored and experimented with, it seems unnecessarily confusing and
</I>&gt;<i> costly to have multiple such systems in use for each decision,
</I>&gt;<i> despite the choice and supposed security advantages. In any case, at
</I>&gt;<i> some point some sort of common standard would have to be developed,
</I>&gt;<i> and they would have to be certified by government or some trusted
</I>&gt;<i> entity, both in order for the votes to count, to avoid multiple
</I>&gt;<i> voting, and for the systems to mirror each other, no?
</I>
Why the stamp of authority?  Suppose all we have is freedom of choice.
Each mirror sets its own standards for choosing which sources to image
from and which of their votes to image.  Each individual chooses which
mirror (or combination of mirrors) to trust.  Elected officials make
their own choices concerning which results to trust.  Those who make
the wrong choices and make unpopular decisions as a result will see an
immediate decline in their prospects for re-election as expressed by
the voters.

In this way, all of us together have the means and incentive to keep
the results accurate and intelligible.  But if we instead delegate the
trustworthiness of the system to an authority *apart from us*, then
that authority would have the means and incentive to corrupt the
system.

&gt;<i> As far as communal deliberation goes, it seems imperative to me that
</I>&gt;<i> there be a single virtual place where citizens can go to access and
</I>&gt;<i> participate in the drafting and deliberation of proposals for a
</I>&gt;<i> particular jurisdiction. Again there are many ways in which these
</I>&gt;<i> discussion spaces could be structured, and I agree there should be
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility about that, but ultimately each proposal has to have a
</I>&gt;<i> single space (perhaps subdivided by function) in order to work
</I>&gt;<i> effectively, and all such proposals in a jurisdiction and their
</I>&gt;<i> drafting and deliberation spaces should be easily accessible and
</I>&gt;<i> comparable from a central site.
</I>
A centralized architecture poses theoretical and practical problems.
In theory, those who must participate are out in the periphery, so
this calls for a decentered architecture.  In practice, no authority
could enforce a centralized system anyway.  You may be thinking that
enabling laws of the sort that regulate the electoral system or
service bureaucracies are required here.  (see next)

&gt;<i> While I hear your concerns, I still don&#8217;t see your vision of robust
</I>&gt;<i> participation coming to fruition without some legal implementation
</I>&gt;<i> giving it legitimacy. ...
</I>
I think its legitmacy rests on electoral rights and rights of free
expression.  These are well grounded in law.  It might be supposed
that substansive participation in politics (something new) would
require new powers for the citizen vis-a-vis the government, and
therefore new laws.  But there is already sufficient power in the
electoral system to turn over the government (&quot;administration&quot; as
Americans say) and I think it follows that there is sufficient power
to drive the legislative agenda, too.  All that is missing is free
expression in regard to political issues (who should be in office?
what should be the laws?  what should be the policies?).  People do
not freely express themselves on these issues because they lack the
means.  It is therefore a technical failing, not a legal one.

&gt;<i> ... Finally, as far as your model goes, there are issues, including
</I>&gt;<i> the creation and recognition of any such system, that elected
</I>&gt;<i> assemblies cannot be relied upon to adopt in accordance with the
</I>&gt;<i> public&#8217;s will, no matter how it is registered. There is far too much
</I>&gt;<i> money in politics, nowhere near sufficiently informative coverage of
</I>&gt;<i> elections, and far too many legislative tricks for representatives
</I>&gt;<i> to actually be fully accountable to their constituents, let alone
</I>&gt;<i> the fact that they make hundreds if not thousands of such decisions
</I>&gt;<i> in the course of their term. Therefore the option of direct
</I>&gt;<i> legislation by the people must be available to be utilized whenever
</I>&gt;<i> a sufficient number of citizens think it necessary.
</I>
The elected official can be relied upon to seek re-election of course,
and to avoid public disgrace.  If the electors could be relied upon to
express themselves on these issues in conjunction with the day-to-day
issues confronting the official (legislative bills, executive
decisions, and so forth), then there would be little opportunity for
money to fill that connecting role.  Money comes into play only
because the voters are absent from the decision process.  Their
absence leaves the elected official alone and exposed to money
pressures.  We all know how expensive it is to win an election,
particularly one in which the voters are formed as a passive audience.
What we don't generally recognize is that money enters *purely* as a
surrogate for voter participation.  The voters cannot participate in
the decision process *as voters* because the process unfolds long
before the ballots are printed.  The resulting power vacuum in advance
of the election is what sucks in the money, and the money is what
makes the decision.

&gt;<i> We have to start somewhere! Preferably in our own jurisdictions. I
</I>&gt;<i> will do my best to incorporate your concerns into our proposal, but
</I>&gt;<i> there are also strict fiscal restraints on charter amendments by
</I>&gt;<i> petition here that limit how open ended we can be. Thanks again for
</I>&gt;<i> your thoughtful comments and good luck in your work!
</I>
Thank you!  But if your votes are public, then I guess my concerns are
already addressed.  (Please accept my apologies for the late reply.)

Very best,
--

&gt;<i> Thanks for your questions, Ed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The public advocate is an existing position in New York City, to whom we would give most of the responsibilities associated with implementing the citizens' forum. Currently the position is essentially an ombudsman for citizens who have a gripe with city government, elected to a four year term, though there is more to it, described in the city charter, available from the site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are leaving the selection of software open in the hopes of stimulating advance in the field and allowing for innovation down the line.  Initially it would have to meet all of the requirements and functionalities provided for by the Citizens' Forum Amendment, along with any specified by the public advocate or state law.  But even if everything goes our way, it wouldn't be selected until 2015, so it seems a bit premature to solicit software recommendations.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm writing to solicit your thoughts and questions on draft amendments to the city charter of New York that aim to take as big a step a first step as we think we can pull off towards creating a modern-day citizen lawmaking process.  This will admittedly fall short of more utopian but achievable ideas often the focus of this list, but we think it's significant nonetheless.  Please note we won't be able to change the drafts once we begin circulating the petitions this summer to place them on the ballot, so now is the time for useful suggestions.

To spare this list long-winded explanations of legal considerations unique to lowercase d's local effort which addressing some of your comments might require, and because most of the people involved in writing our drafts are not on this list, I encourage you to share your feedback off-list, however you prefer.
