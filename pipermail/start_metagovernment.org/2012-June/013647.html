Pietro, partly also because of our discussion in the other thread a 
while back, where you expressed your critique concerning the delegation 
of votes and also the tight connection between voters and their 
positions ... we (I) thought of the possibility to realize this with 
Votorola. It turned out to be really easy: You keep the whole delegation 
tree, but it becomes a tree only made out of proposals (proposals with 
no authors). The root proposal somehow represents the current temporary 
consensus and the ones delegating to it are suggested improvements for 
it. The ones delegating to those are improvements for the improvements 
and so on. The voters have no explicit proposal of their own and just 
swarm to whatever point in the tree they like and this way push 
consensus into its shape.

And yes, with some modification, I think, Liquid Feedback could also be 
able to do this.

Yes, this was the point I tried to make.
