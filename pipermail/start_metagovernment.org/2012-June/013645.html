<PRE>Thomas and Paul,

Thomas said:
&gt;<i> I'm not sure that I understand what you mean. A possible
</I>&gt;<i> misunderstanding might come from the words: &quot;initiative&quot; in Liquid
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback is just a &quot;position&quot;. Many positions/initiatives make a
</I>&gt;<i> poll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But even to start a new poll and publish your position is really
</I>&gt;<i> easy in almost all e-dem-tools. How much more energy you then want
</I>&gt;<i> to invest to communicate your position is then up to you. If the
</I>&gt;<i> poll is of importance it will lead to a decisive referendum without
</I>&gt;<i> any further effort of yours.
</I>
Paul Nollen said:
&gt;<i> I start from the notice of Direct Democracy meaning &#8220; the right of
</I>&gt;<i> the citizens to take part in the legislative part of legislation on
</I>&gt;<i> an equal level, if they want to do so&#8221;. An Initiative is then a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal of law. To presume that a good idea or proposal will lead
</I>&gt;<i> automatically to a decisive referendum is a thought I don&#8217;t
</I>&gt;<i> share. Look at the thousands of wonderful ideas that yearly are
</I>&gt;<i> shown on inventors expositions. Only a few will ever reach the
</I>&gt;<i> public.
</I>
I think what Thomas means by &quot;poll&quot; is a kind of primary referendum.
The text has not been finalized yet, but the public is already voting
among the finalists.  One measure of its &quot;importance&quot; therefore is the
level of public participation it attracts.

Provided the public does reach a rough consensus in the primary on a
final text, and provided the turnout is sufficiently high, then I
agree with Thomas.  A final decision is pretty much inevitable.  The
form of that decision may vary (referendum, legislature, executive
order, collective action) but the content is pretty much guaranteed to
be what the public has already agreed to.

I think the moral underlying what Thomas says is that the primary
ought not to suppress the expressed ideas of any individual, nor give
priority to those of any other.  Isn't that right, Thomas?

Paul Nollen earlier said:
&gt;<i> ... And yes, if you think your proposal is better and it is not
</I>&gt;<i> taken up by the authors you have to start your own initiative and
</I>&gt;<i> try to do better.
</I>
That would be a form of suppression.  It is almost ubiquitous among
e-democracy systems, and it exactly mirrors the status quo in society.
If the powerful do not listen, then seek power for yourself.

I'm reminded of what you wrote here, Paul:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004313.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004313.html</A>

  ... Members who are only &quot;users&quot; and don't participate in the
  internal working of the [kayak] club whatsoever are facing the
  results of internal decision making processes without any means of
  influencing the working of the club.  They only can make remarks
  about the the things that goes wrong afterwards.  But they always
  have the possibility to take their kayak and paddle on their own.

But politics is not a solitary sport.  To paddle away is to disfran-
chise onself, unless one finds another club.

Thomas said:
&gt;<i> But this is a high price to pay! With Communicative Delegation
</I>&gt;<i> everybody can have his/her own proposal right from the beginning and
</I>&gt;<i> this price is reduced to one single click.
</I>
I think we must ensure that the offended person always has a choice.
We must ensure that he/she is free to shift to a system (such as
communicative delegation) where the unfair rejection of ideas is
impossible.  Provided we keep the cost of shifting low enough, then
everyone will eventually move to the freer systems.  There is probably
no way to prevent that.  (We'll have made the moral into a fact.)
