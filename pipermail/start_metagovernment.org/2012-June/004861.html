<PRE>Hi everyone,

It's been a while since I've chimed in, but at Ed's encouragement I'm
providing a window into DemocracyLab's world, centered in Portland, Oregon
USA.

For those of you unfamiliar with DemocracyLab, our unique presumption is
that we can facilitate a dialogue that creates opportunities for creative
problem solving by framing issues through three lenses:
1) Why? - the values, principles and beliefs that guide our thinking
2) What? - the objectives we seek to accomplish
3) How? - the actions we take and the policies we implement

We're currently running a demo of our software relating to Oregon's Tax
System.  I'd encourage you to take five minutes to try it out - don't worry
about not being Oregon residents.  You can find it linked in the upper
right on this page: <A HREF="http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,">http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,</A>
along with a link to download the codebase if you choose to.  Forewarning -
we're using facebook as our login system right now.  I know, I know -
you'll find adding additional login options as items #18 and #19 on our
issue-tracking board: <A HREF="https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.">https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.</A>  Feel
free to dive in!

Our output screen starts to map out participants' thinking, using dynamic
histograms to show the connections between the values, objectives, and
policy preferences users have expressed.  Our belief is that there's
insight in the data, and that we're just starting to be able to express it
visually.  I'd welcome any and all feedback on what we're doing.

One challenge we're hoping to address in the future is shared by others
working on active projects - managing the initiation, evolution and
evaluation of proposals.  How do you balance the competing needs of
different stages in its lifecycle?  One idea I've had is having proposals
gather sponsors, with redrafting tools evolving as the scale of the sponsor
base does.  For example:
1 sponsor - the author controls everything
up to 10 sponsors - consensus drafting tools, 90% &quot;yes&quot; votes needed to
advance
10-100 sponsors - idea is introduced to voting system, amendment drafting
system balances conformity to original intent with need for continued
improvement
100-1000 sponsors - document direction becomes narrowly bound, but body of
evidence documenting rationale and likely impacts grows
1000+ sponsors - we should be so lucky!  A bridge to cross then...

The sun's dipping into the forested horizon here in Oregon, and I need to
sign off.  I hope each of you are well-

Mark
