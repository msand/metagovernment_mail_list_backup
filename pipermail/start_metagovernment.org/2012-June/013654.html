<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> thank you very much for your reply.
</I>&gt;<i> And for taking my critics seriously.
</I>
Thank you for your critique. ;-)

&gt;<i> So we are now thinking about writing a possible alternative to liquid
</I>&gt;<i> feedback. We want parties around the world to be able to try different
</I>&gt;<i> systems.
</I>
At the same time? With vote-mirroring from one system to the other?

&gt;<i> And on that note...
</I>&gt;<i> How is your system going? Has it been implemented? And tested?
</I>
It is improving. Slowly but steady. By the end of summer it is 
supposedly ready for beta-testing.

&gt;<i> I have to admit I have some doubts over the idea of the delegation
</I>&gt;<i> tree. Especially if you intend to map all the variations. One of the
</I>&gt;<i> doubts is that the delegation tree is not necessarily a tree at all.
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose you have a proposal A. Then two mutations: A1, A2. So now you
</I>&gt;<i> have 4 options: A, AA1, AA2, AA1A2.
</I>
What do you mean with &quot;options&quot;? In my view, as a voter you have only 
three: A, A1 and A2. And ofc everybody has the option to create 
countless new mutations, but until then: only three. A is at the root 
and A1 and A2 are proposed improvements to A (branches coming out of the 
root), which have gathered a number of voters behind them, so the voters 
of A are inclined to talk to them, i.e. look for consensus.


Best,
Thomas
