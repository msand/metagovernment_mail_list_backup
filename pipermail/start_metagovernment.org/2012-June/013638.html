<PRE>Hi all,

yes, I think that Liquid democracy is an amelioration of the proven system of  &#8220;initiative&#8221; like it exists in Switzerland and half of the states in the US. There is much more involvement possible in the &#8220;draft&#8221; stage of the initiative but the authors still have the decisive power to change their initiative or not. For those who know the initiative system I think the Liquid democracy system is appealing. It makes it possible to start with an initiative that already is tested in a free discussion and eventually improved with suggestions from everyone who wanted to participate. Then the proposal has still to prove his popular support  (old system of signatures replaced by electronic means) before it can be put to the vote of the citizens as a whole. And yes, if you think your proposal is better and it is not taken up by the authors you have to start your own initiative and try to do better.

Hi Paul and Olaf,

I know Liquid Feedback, it is used by the German Pirate Party. And I think it is one of the better e-dem-tools out there. You can vote, you can delegate your vote, you can propose improvements to a position and you can bring in your own position and collect votes for it. The only handicap IMO is: by its concept the whole system gives more power to the early drafters/voters and therefore tends to freeze at some point and is therefore not suitable for large numbers of participants. This is because a position can only be changed/improved by its author. If he rejects such a request, people would have to leave him and start all over again ... and then again and again ...

The only solution I can see is Communicative Delegation:

Best,
Thomas

  hi all

  Sorry if I am not on the point but do you know liquid feedback? 
  <A HREF="http://liquidfeedback.org/">http://liquidfeedback.org/</A>  as far that I know it includes liquid democracy as well (free representation) like <A HREF="http://aktivdemokrati.se/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/enghumans.jpg">http://aktivdemokrati.se/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/enghumans.jpg</A>
  Liquid feedback it is already used by a number of organisations.

  Olaf, in reviewing some of the lowercased proposal content, I think I have one primary suggestion. 

  As I understand it, you allow for citizens to propose ballot measures, and for them to go to election if they get enough support, right? And you allow for collaborative drafting and online deliberation.

  But I think that combination still leaves out one crucial aspect. What we see in early attempts to bring in citizen participation is that many people propose many similar initiatives, and there is very little sorting mechanism. Further, we see people being asked to vote yes-or-no, or often yes-or-abstain, on these proposals. 

  Not only is it unrealistic to ask people to vote on the thousands of proposals that get introduced, it is also very restricting. What several of our projects are doing is working to build systems that bring people together in the drafting process, not just at the end voting process. In fact, if we do it right, the voting process is more like an affirmation of all the work that went into the drafting process, and ends up being a relatively minor aspect of the whole thing.

  Enabling collaborative drafting is a good first start, but there needs to be a feedback loop right in that drafting process that helps not only winnow down the volume of proposals, but also which helps bring people together and build consensus.

  I have not yet worked out how this aspect would fit into your existing documents, but first let us know if you've already accommodated this position, if you'd like help doing so, or if you disagree.

    Thanks for your questions, Ed.

    The public advocate is an existing position in New York City, to whom we would give most of the responsibilities associated with implementing the citizens' forum. Currently the position is essentially an ombudsman for citizens who have a gripe with city government, elected to a four year term, though there is more to it, described in the city charter, available from the site.

    We are leaving the selection of software open in the hopes of stimulating advance in the field and allowing for innovation down the line.  Initially it would have to meet all of the requirements and functionalities provided for by the Citizens' Forum Amendment, along with any specified by the public advocate or state law.  But even if everything goes our way, it wouldn't be selected until 2015, so it seems a bit premature to solicit software recommendations.

    What we really could use right now before the amendment's text is locked for petitioning, is recommendations for any aspects of the software, hardware, or implementation of the citizens' forum that anyone thinks we should require to maximise its usefulness or minimise its corruptibility / vulnerability to co-option. 

    Best,
    Olaf

    Hi, Olaf. 

    I was going to suggest that you post a summary, but I see now that you have one linked at the bottom of:
    <A HREF="http://lowercased.org/d/draft-amendments/">http://lowercased.org/d/draft-amendments/</A>

    I don't see in that or in the legal text the specifics of the Public Advocate. Is that an existing office, or something you are proposing?

    Also, what software do you have in mind for the CItizen's Forum? If you don't have a specific package in mind, you could state your specs here, and perhaps other members of this list could suggest what would fit the requirements.

      Greetings all,

      I'm writing to solicit your thoughts and questions on draft amendments to the city charter of New York that aim to take as big a step a first step as we think we can pull off towards creating a modern-day citizen lawmaking process.  This will admittedly fall short of more utopian but achievable ideas often the focus of this list, but we think it's significant nonetheless.  Please note we won't be able to change the drafts once we begin circulating the petitions this summer to place them on the ballot, so now is the time for useful suggestions.  The text of the Citizens' Forum amendment, which is concerned with the implementation of the internet component of our proposals, is accessible on our site

      <A HREF="http://lowercased.org">http://lowercased.org</A>

      via Real democracy for NYC &gt; Draft Amendnments

      I apologize in advance for the density of the legal text.  If you don't have the time to wade through it but have a particular concern that some consideration be included, please feel free to let us know. To spare this list long-winded explanations of legal considerations unique to lowercase d's local effort which addressing some of your comments might require, and because most of the people involved in writing our drafts are not on this list, I encourage you to share your feedback off-list, however you prefer.

      Thanks!

      Olaf
