<PRE>Thanks Michael, excellent suggestions.  Your last question is the most
important, about users being able to &quot;discover its overall purpose&quot;. We're
adding some additional features soon that should make the output screen,
and hopefully the purpose, a little more intuitive, but a bit of
explanation by video or diagram would be useful as well.

We're also strongly considering framing a new issue each month, and
distributing a monthly description of results recorded and insights
gleaned, making DemocracyLab both an engagement tool and a monthly
publication.  This could build audience, present information in a format
people are used to, and create reasons for ongoing engagement as new issues
are framed.

I'll let everyone know how it goes-

Mark

&gt;<i> Hi Mark,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave it a try, beginning here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/entities.php?type=1&amp;community=1&amp;issue=1">https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/entities.php?type=1&amp;community=1&amp;issue=1</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I ordered my values in the list (left).  I ignored the &quot;positive&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;negative&quot; boxes to the right because they looked optional.  I then
</I>&gt;<i> went to step 2, which looks very similar.  For some reason want back
</I>&gt;<i> to check on step 1, and I saw that my values were no longer ordered
</I>&gt;<i> there.  That's my fault, of course.  I should have read more than 10
</I>&gt;<i> words of the instructions before jumping in.  Still, some suggestions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * If the list cannot honour manual ordering, then do not let it
</I>&gt;<i>    receive dropped items.  This is misleading, and gave me false
</I>&gt;<i>    confidence that I was on the right track.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * If the correct method is to drag the values from left to right,
</I>&gt;<i>    then put an arrow from left to right.  No need for words.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Label the drop box something like &quot;Values I feel positively about&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    rather than &quot;You feel positive about&quot;.  Repeating the word
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;values&quot; makes the purpose clearer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also maybe:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Remove the rounded border from the large heads up display.  Or
</I>&gt;<i>    something else to distinguish it from the controls below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Remove the instructions &quot;See a description by hovering over one of
</I>&gt;<i>    the values&quot;, because that is unecessary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    In general, there is instructional clutter in the valuable space
</I>&gt;<i>    immediately preceding the controls.  Better to give the controls
</I>&gt;<i>    priority of place.  Lengthy instructions are a warning sign that
</I>&gt;<i>    the UI is difficult to use (which really it is not) or difficult
</I>&gt;<i>    to understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I finished and arrived at the overview:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/index.php?community=1&amp;issue=1">https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/index.php?community=1&amp;issue=1</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It has a nice, simple layout (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3).  At first it's
</I>&gt;<i> unclear that &quot;Step&quot; refers to the previous data-entry pages that I
</I>&gt;<i> already completed.  So another suggestion:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  * Give the data entry pages prominent titles matching the overview
</I>&gt;<i>    page (Step 1, Step 2 ...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The overview page contains a series of bar charts.  When I hover the
</I>&gt;<i> mouse over the charts, they rearrange in various ways.  How will the
</I>&gt;<i> user learn the purpose of these?  (I understand you are not finished
</I>&gt;<i> coding it, yet.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A larger question: Imagine a user who is impatient to read
</I>&gt;<i> explanations, or to watch videos, but is happy to explore the
</I>&gt;<i> application hands on.  By what path will he/she discover its overall
</I>&gt;<i> purpose, meaning its personal utility, social value, or what not?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's been a while since I've chimed in, but at Ed's encouragement I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providing a window into DemocracyLab's world, centered in Portland,
</I>&gt;<i> Oregon
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; USA.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For those of you unfamiliar with DemocracyLab, our unique presumption is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that we can facilitate a dialogue that creates opportunities for creative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem solving by framing issues through three lenses:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) Why? - the values, principles and beliefs that guide our thinking
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) What? - the objectives we seek to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) How? - the actions we take and the policies we implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We're currently running a demo of our software relating to Oregon's Tax
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; System.  I'd encourage you to take five minutes to try it out - don't
</I>&gt;<i> worry
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about not being Oregon residents.  You can find it linked in the upper
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right on this page: <A HREF="http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,">http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; along with a link to download the codebase if you choose to.
</I>&gt;<i>  Forewarning -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we're using facebook as our login system right now.  I know, I know -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you'll find adding additional login options as items #18 and #19 on our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; issue-tracking board: <A HREF="https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.">https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.</A>  Feel
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; free to dive in!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our output screen starts to map out participants' thinking, using dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; histograms to show the connections between the values, objectives, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy preferences users have expressed.  Our belief is that there's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; insight in the data, and that we're just starting to be able to express
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; visually.  I'd welcome any and all feedback on what we're doing.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One challenge we're hoping to address in the future is shared by others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working on active projects - managing the initiation, evolution and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evaluation of proposals.  How do you balance the competing needs of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different stages in its lifecycle?  One idea I've had is having proposals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; gather sponsors, with redrafting tools evolving as the scale of the
</I>&gt;<i> sponsor
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; base does.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1 sponsor - the author controls everything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up to 10 sponsors - consensus drafting tools, 90% &quot;yes&quot; votes needed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10-100 sponsors - idea is introduced to voting system, amendment drafting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system balances conformity to original intent with need for continued
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; improvement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 100-1000 sponsors - document direction becomes narrowly bound, but body
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evidence documenting rationale and likely impacts grows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1000+ sponsors - we should be so lucky!  A bridge to cross then...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The sun's dipping into the forested horizon here in Oregon, and I need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sign off.  I hope each of you are well-
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mark
