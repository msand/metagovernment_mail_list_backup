<PRE>Hi Thomas,
thank you very much for your reply.
And for taking my critics seriously.


I couldn't answer you before, as I was at a conference (EdgeRyders,
hashtag #lote). There I also met several interesting people. Among
them Sm&#225;ri McCarthy, an icelandic mathematician who was both involved
in producing the idea at the base of Liquid Feedback. And the
Icelandic system. We had some very interesting conversations. As every
self-respecting mathematician he is then a bit critic to both system,
although agreeing that those systems are way better than the 5 years
election alternatives.

So we are now thinking about writing a possible alternative to liquid
feedback. We want parties around the world to be able to try different
systems.

And on that note...
How is your system going? Has it been implemented? And tested?

I have to admit I have some doubts over the idea of the delegation
tree. Especially if you intend to map all the variations. One of the
doubts is that the delegation tree is not necessarily a tree at all.
Suppose you have a proposal A. Then two mutations: A1, A2. So now you
have 4 options: A, AA1, AA2, AA1A2. But AA1A2 is both a child of AA1
and AA2. Thus you have a cycle. In other words it might be harder than
it looks like.

Personally I am a bit over the Vilfredo experience. Mostly because I
want now to concentrate on open source software. Vilfredo was great,
and I learned a lot. In fact everybody here should test it, as it has
changed a lot from the last time this community used it. But I am
thinking about other ways to implement a Fair Collaboration system...

Something along the line of a poll. Where users ask to evaluate a
proposal, and the system finds a proposal and asks the user to
evaluate it. So it is not possible for the users to chose which
proposals to evaluate, nor for a user to advertise a proposal. You can
read a proposal. But when you read it you are not allowed to vote for
it.


Cheers,
Pietro
