<PRE>Hi Paul,

Yes, thanks.

The current discussion is more on how to define and require the provision of such software for citizen lawmaking in a city charter in the context of a potentially hostile government. &#160;Given the amendment's likely longevity if enacted, simply naming existing software would probably be limiting, as well as inappropriate to a charter.

Liquid Feedback seems excellent though, and i'd be curious, perhaps in another thread, to hear people's thoughts on it if they have experience with its implementation, (if such discussion hasn't already occurred here on this list).

Olaf

</I>&gt;<i>&#160; Olaf, 
</I>in reviewing some of the lowercased proposal content, I think I have one primary 
suggestion. 
&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>As I understand it, you allow for citizens to propose ballot measures, and 
</I>for them to go to election if they get enough support, right? And you allow for 
collaborative drafting and online deliberation.
&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>But I think that combination still leaves out one crucial aspect. What we 
</I>see in early attempts to bring in citizen participation is that many people 
propose many similar initiatives, and there is very little sorting mechanism. 
Further, we see people being asked to vote yes-or-no, or often yes-or-abstain, 
on these proposals. 
&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>Not only is it unrealistic to ask people to vote on the thousands of 
</I>proposals that get introduced, it is also very restricting. What several of our 
projects are doing is working to build systems that bring people together in the 
drafting process, not just at the end voting process. In fact, if we do it 
right, the voting process is more like an affirmation of all the work that went 
into the drafting process, and ends up being a relatively minor aspect of the 
whole thing.
&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>Enabling collaborative drafting is a good first start, but there needs to 
</I>be a feedback loop right in that drafting process that helps not only winnow 
down the volume of proposals, but also which helps bring people together and 
build consensus.
&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>I have not yet worked out how this aspect would fit into your existing 
</I>documents, but first let us know if you've already accommodated this position, 
if you'd like help doing so, or if you disagree.
&gt;<i>&#160;

</I>&gt;<i>Thanksfor your questions, Ed.&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The public advocate is an existing position in New York City, to whom we  would give most of the responsibilities associated with implementing the  citizens' forum. Currently the position is essentially an ombudsman for  citizens who have a gripe with city government, elected to a four year term,  though there is more to it, described in the city charter, available from the  site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We are leaving the selection of software open in the hopes of stimulating  advance in the field and allowing for innovation down the line.&#160;  Initially it would have to meet all of the requirements and functionalities  provided for by the Citizens' Forum Amendment, along with any specified by the  public advocate or state law.&#160; But even if everything goes our way, it  wouldn't be selected until 2015, so it seems a bit premature to solicit  software recommendations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What we really could use right now before the amendment's text is locked  for petitioning, is recommendations for any aspects of the software, hardware,  or implementation of the citizens' forum that anyone thinks we should require  to maximise its usefulness or minimise its corruptibility / vulnerability to  co-option. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Best,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Olaf

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi, Olaf. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I was going to suggest that you post a summary, but I see now that you  have one linked at the bottom of:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't see in that or in the legal text the specifics of the Public  Advocate. Is that an existing office, or something you are proposing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, what software do you have in mind for the CItizen's Forum? If you  don't have a specific package in mind, you could state your specs here, and  perhaps other members of this list could suggest what would fit the  requirements.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I'm writing to solicit your thoughts and questions on draft amendments  to the city charter of New York that aim to take as big a step a first step  as we think we can pull off towards creating a modern-day citizen lawmaking  process.&#160; This will admittedly fall short of more utopian but  achievable ideas often the focus of this list, but we think it's significant  nonetheless.&#160; Please note we won't be able to change the drafts once we  begin circulating the petitions this summer to place them on the ballot, so  now is the time for useful suggestions.&#160; The text of the Citizens'  Forum amendment, which is concerned with the implementation of the internet  component of our proposals, is accessible on our site

To spare  this list long-winded explanations of legal considerations unique to  lowercase d's local effort which addressing some of your comments might  require, and because most of the people involved in writing our drafts are  not on this list, I encourage you to share your feedback off-list, however  you prefer.
