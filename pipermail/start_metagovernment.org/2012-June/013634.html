<PRE>Hi Ed, thanks.

Currently the number of ballot proposals to appear on the ballot is capped at the seven with the most signatures. &#160;Because we cannot treat electronic and paper petitions filed differently, this is in the Right of Initiative amendment.

Certainly participation during drafting is much of the point of the citizens' forum. &#160;On it we provide for every measure to be linked to alternative or similar measures and a capacity for descriptive comparison, for proposals to be merged, and for users to sort search results of proposals by, among other things, the amount of support and consensus they currently have. &#160;Drafting pages of proposals track the suggestions people make, archives accessibly and attempts to identify duplicative comments as they are being made. &#160;When people object to proposals they can opt to select from a menu of the reasons for opposition collected on the collaboratively authored deliberation page, so drafters can identify what people most object to, and they have the option to message all such people to measure the effectiveness of a change to their proposal in satisfying the criticism.

We'd be very happy to hear any suggestions for additional features to bring about the desired participation. &#160;Since however such participation is unlikely to be anywhere near comprehensive, placing the measures with the most support on the ballot for adoption by all voters is i think a necessary step in the current legal framework.

Thanks again for your thoughts. &#160;I realize the amendments are not the easiest reading and I appreciate your and other people's taking a crack at them so that we can make them better!

Best,

Olaf

</I>&gt;<i>Olaf, in reviewing some of the lowercased proposal content, I think I have one primary suggestion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I understand it, you allow for citizens to propose ballot measures, and for them to go to election if they get enough support, right?&#160;And you allow for collaborative drafting and online deliberation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>But I think that combination still leaves out one crucial aspect. What we see in early attempts to bring in citizen participation is that many people propose many similar initiatives, and there is very little sorting mechanism. Further, we see people being asked to vote yes-or-no, or often yes-or-abstain, on these proposals.&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Not only is it unrealistic to ask people to vote on the thousands of proposals that get introduced, it is also very restricting. What several of our projects are doing is working to build systems that bring people together in the drafting process, not just at the end voting process. In fact, if we do it right, the voting process is more like an affirmation of all the work that went into the drafting process, and ends up being a relatively minor aspect of the whole thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Enabling collaborative drafting is a good first start, but there needs to be a feedback loop right in that drafting process that helps not only winnow down the volume of proposals, but also which helps bring people together and build consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I have not yet worked out how this aspect would fit into your existing documents, but first let us know if you've already accommodated this position, if you'd like help doing so, or if you disagree.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The public advocate is an existing position in New York City, to whom we would give most of the responsibilities associated with implementing the citizens' forum. Currently the position is essentially an ombudsman for citizens who have a gripe with city government, elected to a four year term, though there is more to it, described in the city charter, available from the site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>We are leaving the selection of software open in the hopes of stimulating advance in the field and allowing for innovation down the line. &#160;Initially it would have to meet all of the requirements and functionalities provided for by the Citizens' Forum Amendment, along with any specified by the public advocate or state law. &#160;But even if everything goes our way, it wouldn't be selected until 2015, so it seems a bit premature to solicit software recommendations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What we really could use right now before the amendment's text is locked for petitioning, is recommendations for any aspects of the software, hardware, or implementation of the citizens' forum that anyone thinks we should require to maximise its usefulness or minimise its corruptibility / vulnerability to co-option.&#160;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Hi, Olaf.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I was going to suggest that you post a summary, but I see now that you have one linked at the bottom of:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i><A HREF="http://lowercased.org/d/draft-amendments/">http://lowercased.org/d/draft-amendments/</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I don't see in that or in the legal text the specifics of the Public Advocate. Is that an existing office, or something you are proposing?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Also, what software do you have in mind for the CItizen's Forum? If you don't have a specific package in mind, you could state your specs here, and perhaps other members of this list could suggest what would fit the requirements.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I'm writing to solicit your thoughts and questions on draft amendments to the city charter of New York that aim to take as big a step a first step as we think we can pull off towards creating a modern-day citizen lawmaking process. &#160;This will admittedly fall short of more utopian but achievable ideas often the focus of this list, but we think it's significant nonetheless. &#160;Please note we won't be able to change the drafts once we begin circulating the petitions this summer to place them on the ballot, so now is the time for useful suggestions. &#160;The text of the Citizens' Forum amendment, which is concerned with the implementation of the internet component of our proposals, is accessible on our site
