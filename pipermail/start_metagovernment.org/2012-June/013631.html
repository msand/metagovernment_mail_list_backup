I think this part of the exchange, above, gets at the core of Michael's argument, and expresses is very well. If we want something that the people will trust, why not let the people decide what it is that they trust?

But Michael, I have to ask if the argument ends there. If people are given the freedom to choose their form of participation, there still needs to be a meta-entity to aggregate that participation: the cross-forum (or does it have a new name now?). Does that system not suffer from some of the same weaknesses of centralization? Sorry if you have already explained how you intend to deal with that, but even if so, it seems important to re-state it here.
