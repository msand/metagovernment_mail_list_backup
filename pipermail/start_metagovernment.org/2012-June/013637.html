<PRE>Ed and Olaf,

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> &gt; ... What we see in early attempts to bring in citizen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; participation is that many people propose many similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; initiatives, and there is very little sorting mechanism. Further,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we see people being asked to vote yes-or-no, or often
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; yes-or-abstain, on these proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not only is it unrealistic to ask people to vote on the thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of proposals that get introduced, it is also very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; restricting. What several of our projects are doing is working to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; build systems that bring people together in the drafting process,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not just at the end voting process. In fact, if we do it right,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the voting process is more like an affirmation of all the work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that went into the drafting process, and ends up being a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; relatively minor aspect of the whole thing.
</I>
Olaf Bertram-Nothnagel said:
&gt;<i> We'd be very happy to hear any suggestions for additional features
</I>&gt;<i> to bring about the desired participation.  Since however such
</I>&gt;<i> participation is unlikely to be anywhere near comprehensive, placing
</I>&gt;<i> the measures with the most support on the ballot for adoption by all
</I>&gt;<i> voters is i think a necessary step in the current legal framework.
</I>
The additional features needn't be incorporated in the central
drafting system itself.  People could copy the texts to external
systems (such as Liquid Feedback as Paul Nollen recommends, or a
communicative delegation system, as Thomas recommends) and apply the
new feature sets in that way.  Some systems are even purposely
designed as extenders of other systems (Votorola and Outcast).

The voting phase could be extended in much the same way.  A petition
that was rejected could be kept afloat in a network of external voting
systems. There it would be reworked and revoted until it reached a
larger, more stable consensus.  It could then be reintroduced into the
petition system, or directly into the assembly.  Since the consensus
would be pre-formed and stable, the final vote would be just a
formality, a minor aspect of the overall process, exactly as Ed says.

Such formal extensions are possible only because your proposed system
(Olaf) is fully public (as rightly it should be).  In this sense, no
authority has any control over it, not even its form.  (The public may
be defined as that which escapes the control of authority and other
powers, and is therefore competent to direct them.)

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> But Michael, I have to ask if the argument ends there. If people are
</I>&gt;<i> given the freedom to choose their form of participation, there still
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be a meta-entity to aggregate that participation: the
</I>&gt;<i> cross-forum (or does it have a new name now?). Does that system not
</I>&gt;<i> suffer from some of the same weaknesses of centralization? Sorry if
</I>&gt;<i> you have already explained how you intend to deal with that, but
</I>&gt;<i> even if so, it seems important to re-state it here.
</I>
True.  We previously discussed how a system, even if it is decentered,
may nevertheless depend on a center for some aspects of its operation.
(I think we were speaking of Outcast.)  Imagine three separate systems
of different architectural design.  One is primarily *centered* in
structure (c1), while two are primarily *decentered* (d1, d2):

     (c1) (d1) (d2)

The internal designs of these systems are of no consequence for our
discussion of vote mirroring.  But imagine two external vote mirrors
(m1, m2):

          (m1)
          / \
         / ^ \      ^
        /  |  \     |  vote imaging
       /   |   \
     (c1) (d1) (d2)
       \   |   /
        \  |  /     |
         \ v /      v
          \ /
          (m2)

If (m1) and (m2) have no connection aside from the 3 shared vote
sources, then the whole of the 5 systems/nodes is a purely de-centered
network.  But if (m1) and (m2) are Outcast mirrors, and if (d2) is an
Outcast source, then we could draw it like this:

          (m1) &lt;---+
          / \       \
         / ^ \       \
        /  |  \       \
       /   |   \       \
     (c1) (d1) (d2) &lt;--(p1)
       \   |   /       /
        \  |  /       /
         \ v /       /
          \ /       /
          (m2) &lt;---+

              &lt;-- reading shared data from (p1)

Here it is clear that the Outcast nodes (m1, m2, d2) depend on a
common pollwiki (p1) for aspects of their operation.  A pollwiki is a
central facility that cannot be replaced or duplicated in the normal
course of operation.  Therefore Outcast is not purely decentered.  (We
want it to be, but it's not there yet.)
