<PRE>Hi Mark,

I gave it a try, beginning here:
<A HREF="https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/entities.php?type=1&amp;community=1&amp;issue=1">https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/entities.php?type=1&amp;community=1&amp;issue=1</A>

I ordered my values in the list (left).  I ignored the &quot;positive&quot; and
&quot;negative&quot; boxes to the right because they looked optional.  I then
went to step 2, which looks very similar.  For some reason want back
to check on step 1, and I saw that my values were no longer ordered
there.  That's my fault, of course.  I should have read more than 10
words of the instructions before jumping in.  Still, some suggestions:

  * If the list cannot honour manual ordering, then do not let it
    receive dropped items.  This is misleading, and gave me false
    confidence that I was on the right track.

  * If the correct method is to drag the values from left to right,
    then put an arrow from left to right.  No need for words.

  * Label the drop box something like &quot;Values I feel positively about&quot;
    rather than &quot;You feel positive about&quot;.  Repeating the word
    &quot;values&quot; makes the purpose clearer.

Also maybe:

  * Remove the rounded border from the large heads up display.  Or
    something else to distinguish it from the controls below.

  * Remove the instructions &quot;See a description by hovering over one of
    the values&quot;, because that is unecessary.

    In general, there is instructional clutter in the valuable space
    immediately preceding the controls.  Better to give the controls
    priority of place.  Lengthy instructions are a warning sign that
    the UI is difficult to use (which really it is not) or difficult
    to understand.

I finished and arrived at the overview:
<A HREF="https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/index.php?community=1&amp;issue=1">https://democracylab.herokuapp.com/index.php?community=1&amp;issue=1</A>
It has a nice, simple layout (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3).  At first it's
unclear that &quot;Step&quot; refers to the previous data-entry pages that I
already completed.  So another suggestion:

  * Give the data entry pages prominent titles matching the overview
    page (Step 1, Step 2 ...).

The overview page contains a series of bar charts.  When I hover the
mouse over the charts, they rearrange in various ways.  How will the
user learn the purpose of these?  (I understand you are not finished
coding it, yet.)

A larger question: Imagine a user who is impatient to read
explanations, or to watch videos, but is happy to explore the
application hands on.  By what path will he/she discover its overall
purpose, meaning its personal utility, social value, or what not?

&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's been a while since I've chimed in, but at Ed's encouragement I'm
</I>&gt;<i> providing a window into DemocracyLab's world, centered in Portland, Oregon
</I>&gt;<i> USA.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those of you unfamiliar with DemocracyLab, our unique presumption is
</I>&gt;<i> that we can facilitate a dialogue that creates opportunities for creative
</I>&gt;<i> problem solving by framing issues through three lenses:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Why? - the values, principles and beliefs that guide our thinking
</I>&gt;<i> 2) What? - the objectives we seek to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i> 3) How? - the actions we take and the policies we implement
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're currently running a demo of our software relating to Oregon's Tax
</I>&gt;<i> System.  I'd encourage you to take five minutes to try it out - don't worry
</I>&gt;<i> about not being Oregon residents.  You can find it linked in the upper
</I>&gt;<i> right on this page: <A HREF="http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,">http://democracylab.org/participate/web-developers/,</A>
</I>&gt;<i> along with a link to download the codebase if you choose to.  Forewarning -
</I>&gt;<i> we're using facebook as our login system right now.  I know, I know -
</I>&gt;<i> you'll find adding additional login options as items #18 and #19 on our
</I>&gt;<i> issue-tracking board: <A HREF="https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.">https://github.com/bnfb/DemocracyLab/issues.</A>  Feel
</I>&gt;<i> free to dive in!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our output screen starts to map out participants' thinking, using dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> histograms to show the connections between the values, objectives, and
</I>&gt;<i> policy preferences users have expressed.  Our belief is that there's
</I>&gt;<i> insight in the data, and that we're just starting to be able to express it
</I>&gt;<i> visually.  I'd welcome any and all feedback on what we're doing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One challenge we're hoping to address in the future is shared by others
</I>&gt;<i> working on active projects - managing the initiation, evolution and
</I>&gt;<i> evaluation of proposals.  How do you balance the competing needs of
</I>&gt;<i> different stages in its lifecycle?  One idea I've had is having proposals
</I>&gt;<i> gather sponsors, with redrafting tools evolving as the scale of the sponsor
</I>&gt;<i> base does.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 sponsor - the author controls everything
</I>&gt;<i> up to 10 sponsors - consensus drafting tools, 90% &quot;yes&quot; votes needed to
</I>&gt;<i> advance
</I>&gt;<i> 10-100 sponsors - idea is introduced to voting system, amendment drafting
</I>&gt;<i> system balances conformity to original intent with need for continued
</I>&gt;<i> improvement
</I>&gt;<i> 100-1000 sponsors - document direction becomes narrowly bound, but body of
</I>&gt;<i> evidence documenting rationale and likely impacts grows
</I>&gt;<i> 1000+ sponsors - we should be so lucky!  A bridge to cross then...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The sun's dipping into the forested horizon here in Oregon, and I need to
</I>&gt;<i> sign off.  I hope each of you are well-
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mark
</I>
