I had to mothball proxyfor.me when my free trial on AWS expired and
they started charging me almost 40 bucks a month for it (most of that
was for ELB, which I didn't really need but that they require to
provide HTTPS support). I'm looking at the various alternatives: It'd
be good to port it at least once anyway to prove that it's not tied to
any particular platform. I also got the Colorado voter database and
started hacking that to create a way to authenticate voters without
risking exposing their information, sending them a postcard, or
require them to provide a credit card (like most of the other systems
have). Next round I plan to shadow the Boulder and/or Denver city
council proposals with authenticated voters, which ought to be
illuminating...

&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.needpedia.com/">https://www.needpedia.com/</A> This guy is still actively pursuing his project, though I don't know how he intends to really bring power to the people, an attempt is kinda being made.
</I>
Looks to me like he underestimates the amount of &quot;government&quot; required
to keep a system like that working. Wikipedia is kind of a nightmare
because of that (lots of topics where the foxes are guarding the
henhouses).
