<PRE>I've updated and restarted proxyfor.me. It's still on AWS, but uses an
internal HTTPS certificate and server rather than using the (much more
expensive) AWS ELB system for that. It's also updated to the latest
versions of the tools and libraries, and there has been a *lot* of
progress on those over the past year: The new app is about 80% smaller
and only takes a third of the time to start up, mostly due to AOT
compilation (which works in Angular now but didn't in the version I
started with).

I had to toss all the old profiles when I updated the database schema
to handle authentication, but have set it up in a &quot;demo&quot; mode where
you can log in as one of the bots to check it out without having to
fill out your profile first (instructions are on the startup screen).

I'm not going to do any PR for this release: I'll wait until I have
the authentication stuff and new local (Boulder/Denver) proposals
finished and will call that Beta 4.
  Regards,
    Scott
