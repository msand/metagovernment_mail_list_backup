I'm not sure &quot;e-democracy&quot; is the right term here. Maybe it is, maybe  
not. It certainly *sounds* like the right word, but note that for the  
majority of people who use it, the word refers to any use of internet  
technology in political processes. So to many, a politician raising  
funds with an e-mail campaign is considered an act of e-democracy.

When you say &quot;e-democracy&quot; are thinking of the term Metagov has  
rebranded a few times and which is now being called collaborative  
governance?

This community, the group of people involved in this project, is at  
the stage where it could use some more involved governance than mere  
adhocracy. This community does not have a geographical location nor an  
existing structure to supplant... can it still be a guinea pig for  
this emergent system?
