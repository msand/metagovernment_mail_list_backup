Welcome, Andy. To expand on Mat&#237;as' explanation, the critical  
difference the internet adds is the ability to open participation  
among everyone at all times. The consent model still applies, since of  
course nobody can be involved in all decisions all the time. But there  
is no longer any need for official representatives. That said,  
however, several of our member projects are forms of &quot;liquid  
democracy,&quot; where people can give their proxy to someone else, but  
have the option to revoke that proxy at any time.
