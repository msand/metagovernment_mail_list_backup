<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; It sounds similar to a &quot;pollwiki&quot;.

Yes, but the pollwiki looks more basic.  I think your multi-variant
wiki is logically a *pollwiki plus*.  The &quot;plus&quot; is stuff that's
specific to Adhocracy, or experimental.  In any case, the two
wiki-things *should* be compatible (one as base, the other as
superstructural component).  The common pollwiki is not supposed to
interfere with the designs or experimental freedoms of the various
facilities (pollservers and such) that make use of it.  Otherwise it
would be broken, and we should probably fix it ASAP.

&gt;<i> There is a demo of my current state at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://test.liqd.net/page/Section_2__The_House">http://test.liqd.net/page/Section_2__The_House</A> (a multi-variant wiki
</I>&gt;<i> page) and <A HREF="http://test.liqd.net/page/diff?left=14&amp;right=15">http://test.liqd.net/page/diff?left=14&amp;right=15</A> (a
</I>&gt;<i> rudimentary diff, this should really only show the passages that
</I>&gt;<i> have changed at all)...
</I>
That all looks to be compatible with the common pollwiki.  It stays
meticulously silent on these concerns, so I think you could put your
own wiki-thing on top of it, with minimal interference between the
two.

&gt;<i> ... I still need to fully resolve the issue of which comments to
</I>&gt;<i> show where (i.e. will users realize that there is supposed to be a
</I>&gt;<i> discussion space between documents? how can I allow distinct
</I>&gt;<i> discussions on page variants without fatally confusing people?).
</I>
Good questions!  I'm curious what answers you come up with.  As I say,
I think this is the technical heart of e-dem.  (My own answers assume
that the users are already, in some capacity, discussing these
things.)

&gt;<i> The whole idea of this is to have a HEAD variant (&quot;status quo&quot;) of
</I>&gt;<i> each legal document and to allow users to create variants of that
</I>&gt;<i> version (or to create a new document with an empty HEAD).
</I>
The pollwiki has basic variance built into it.  It's flexible with
regard to the application of variance (what you do with it), because
it imposes no restrictions on it.  This makes it 100% compatible with
applications (such as yours) that do impose restrictions.  As long as
they are imposed in superstructural components, and those components
are mutually non-interfering, then any contradictory restrictions
between them are also non-interfering.  So again, the pollwiki
*should* be compatible with all voting facilities (not least
Adhocracy).

&gt;<i> This is a second step after formulating the goal of the change (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;better benefits for people on health care&quot;) as a proposal. Variants
</I>&gt;<i> regarding a number of documents can then be voted to become the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;body&quot; (i.e. the implementation section) of that proposal. Finally
</I>&gt;<i> (pending some consistency checks), the proposal (not the variants)
</I>&gt;<i> can be decided upon.
</I>
Right, because you are concerned with administrative rules of
promulgation, and that sort of thing.  That's one reason why you
impose restrictions - what the users can do, where and when they can
do it, and with whom.  But those restrictions can also be imposed
outside of the common infrastructure.  (Advantage is to avoid
head-banging with other projects on technical grounds that nobody
really disagrees about, yet still allowing competition on other
grounds for purposes of innovation, and so forth.)

&gt;<i> I don't use a traditional wiki engine for this because I want to
</I>&gt;<i> tightly integrate with the (delegated) voting aspect of the system.
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO this kind of deep-down policy text work is where DV will become
</I>&gt;<i> especially powerful.
</I>
MediaWiki is surprisingly flexible and extensible.  You might find
that it can do all you need.  (Advantages are the high quality of the
code and the extensive user base.)

Our reference installation is MediaWiki, but we're not restricted to
that particular engine (nor even to wikis) for the common purposes
(poll definition/ID and basic position drafting).  For example, users
are not forced to compose their variant drafts in the wiki itself.
They are free to choose any medium for this purpose, without
restriction.  (Actually, we don't have good supports for that freedom
yet, but it *is* built in.)

&gt;<i> There is a very rough design document at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://piratepad.net/adhcplanbeta.">http://piratepad.net/adhcplanbeta.</A> (This has partially been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented and parts of it are still on my roadmap. The whole
</I>&gt;<i> discussion on whether to use an existing DVCS was never really
</I>&gt;<i> finished and I decided to roll my own, mostly because I would not have
</I>&gt;<i> been using more than 5% of any DVCS while having to handle all of its
</I>&gt;<i> complexity. I have not yet gotten into the whole geo-debate which
</I>&gt;<i> seems very central to the pollwiki concept, I'm still waiting for a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;customer&quot; to give me proper requirements on this ;))
</I>
Some of your potential customers (why not?) might be attracted by the
relative stability of a product that's situated on common ground, as
opposed to a risky solo flight.

(The geo-debate about navigating among cities, states, etc?  That's
 for the pollwiki admins and users to sort out.  It's a common enough
 problem on the Web, and we're not hung up on it.)

&gt;<i> &gt; The difference engine is not like that.  It's not a new medium, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rather an interconnector of existing media.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yet you won't get over the requirement of being able to extract some
</I>&gt;<i> kind of draft text and imposing certain rules on it (e.g. disallowing
</I>&gt;<i> trolls from destroying it). My gut feeling with regards to MediaWiki,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, is that it was designed by a group of people who know
</I>&gt;<i> WP:NPOV by heart and that this might limit its applicability to
</I>&gt;<i> explicitly Non-NPOV use cases.
</I>
Rules we already spoke of.  Trolls:

By allowing a text to break up into variants, I think we relieve most
of the tension that would otherwise drive an edit war.  All that
remains, then, is a residue of vandalism, and that kind of stuff -
stuff that MediaWiki is already proven to handle.

&gt;<i> &gt;  Discussions are rational in a democracy only insofar as they are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  focused on differences of position.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Nice. Is that yours? Can I cite that in my thesis somehow?
</I>
Yes.  You are working on a thesis?
