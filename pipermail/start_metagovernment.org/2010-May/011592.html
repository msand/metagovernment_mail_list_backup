<PRE>Dear all,

Just received an email, that the Vilfredo paper for ePart was accepted.
We received good feedbacks. Very fair critics (like that there has not
been enough testing).
Also both reviewers rated the paper maximum in terms of originality.
Here are the two reviews (not the comments, which I consider personal,
and I am not sure if they can be published)

OVERALL RATING: 3 (strong accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (expert)
Originality: 7 (strong accept)
Relevance: paper is relevant to the call topics of EPART 2010: 7 (strong accept)
Rigor of paper (Quality) (COMPLETE RESEARCH PAPER) OR Motivation
(ONGOING WORK/ PROJECT): 6 (accept)
Contribution to the research field (COMPLETE RESEARCH PAPER) OR
Potential for contribution (ONGOING WORK/ PROJECT): 7 (strong accept)
References used are suitable: 5 (weak accept)
Writing, structure and presentation of content: 7 (Strong accept)

OVERALL RATING: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 2 (medium)
Originality: 7 (strong accept)
Relevance: paper is relevant to the call topics of EPART 2010: 6 (accept)
Rigor of paper (Quality) (COMPLETE RESEARCH PAPER) OR Motivation
(ONGOING WORK/ PROJECT): 5 (weak accept)
Contribution to the research field (COMPLETE RESEARCH PAPER) OR
Potential for contribution (ONGOING WORK/ PROJECT): 6 (accept)
References used are suitable: 6 (accept)
Writing, structure and presentation of content: 6 (accept)


Not that some rating go to 7 and some range from -3 to +3.
Unfortunately there is no standard of the review rating system to
which I can link you to, so you'll need to imagine by the explanation.

Now I am working on transforming the paper from the .pages version to LaTeX2e.

Oh, yes, I also started the page on voting theory on the metagov website
