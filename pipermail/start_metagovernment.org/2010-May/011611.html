<PRE>Hello Owen, what I am trying to say is that there is an entry level
that need to be there before a tool is useful. This is a number of
people must be there to use the tool. And the number of people depends
on the technology itself.

Maybe you can convince some communities to use your technology. But it
is a maybe. In Vilfredo we tried and failed. We have about 150 people
registered and no one who is using it right now. Not even me. Oh, we
have wonderful papers coming out, and two psychologists that find the
process interesting, and a grant proposal. So maybe something will
come out, but so far not one person is using it.

We never considered this problem. We always focused on the voting. But
this problem is important, is relevant, and is well known. Most
website idea fail because they cannot get enough people to even start.
I think I burned in this way 3 or 4 ideas. Some were good ideas. As
such I am really aware of this problem.

What is coming to me is that each website has a number of people who
are using it at any one time. Maybe it is just the author. It is
important that the website is useful for that number of people. Right
now Vilfredo is not useful if there are less than 6 people on a
question. In 5 it is still more efficient to just exchange emails.
Once you move to 6 or more it becomes cool. But not 6 registered, 6
that are actually using the website. Going there every day or every
other day.

This is why WH2 succeeded, it had an idea that had already enough
traction for enough people, and a technology that had traction for
that number of people. Maybe you can convince the administrator of any
of those government organisations to use a website. But that is not
enough, each user need to actually use it. Either because they WANT to
use it, or because they NEED to use it. The website of many government
organisations are not that cool, but you NEED to use it, so you do it.

And if you think about it this describes also the failure that is
experiencing metagovernment.
When we were a single organisation we were focused, we wanted to make
a tool, and we would have been the first to use that tool. And then
give it to other groups. Now we are an &quot;umbrella organisation&quot;, and as
a result we do not identify with any of our tool. So we use none
(except on special occasions to test them), and none of them have
enough people to be turned on.

Which, I believe, is what drove some of us away.


Sorry, I have no solution. I am just stating the problem.
Pietro
