<PRE>Mike, it may be overly ambitious but, in a brainstorming mode, here's an
opportunity that might be worth considering:

&quot;Biometrics.gov is the central source of information on biometrics-related
activities of the Federal government. Two sister sites provide a repository
of biometrics-related public information (www.biometricscatalog.org) and
opportunities for discussion (www.biometrics.org). These websites, working
together, were developed to encourage greater collaboration and sharing of
information on biometric activities among government departments and
agencies; commercial entities; state, regional, and international
organizations; and the general public.&quot;  <A HREF="http://www.biometrics.gov/">http://www.biometrics.gov/</A> 

Can we show them how to do collaboration better?

Owen

Subject: [MG] Tooling up existing engagements (a proposal)

I have a proposal.  We could be at the point of development where
non-technical people can take the helm.  I assume that we are.*
Here is my proposal:

 1. Find a text that at least two of us care about. (We don't need
    many people, and the developer will make a third.)  The text
    should be at least 10 paragraphs long.

 2. Open it up to drafting, voting and discussion using our tools.

 3. Refine the tools to the point of rough usability.  This could be
    as little as 2 weeks work.

 4. Find places where people are *already* engaged with political
    issues, and already involved in discussions about them.

 5. Get engaged/involved with them.

 6. Bring our tools into the mix.

 7. Refine the tools until they are helpful to these people.
    If we get this far, then e-democracy (or whatever we call it)
    is a reality.

Does this sound feasible?  (I think it's technically feasible.)
Can anyone forsee problems?

 * I agree with Thomas, who says that usability is now the only
   obstacle.
