<PRE>A technically important update has just been pushed on Vilfredo.

I would like to speak you about it for what it entails.
Essentially when people vote for some proposals, after the voting, I
noticed that some people seemed to be in some special situation.
Those people, which we would call &quot;Key Players&quot;, had the possibility
to just shrink the pareto front just by changing a vote. Voting on
something that they didn't.

So the question is, can they rewrite that proposal so that they could
support it?

Some of you might remember that at the end of the 3rd generation I
made some calculations and asked some people (FOrd, Ed, and Jackie) to
rewrite a particular proposal. This was it. It took me at the time one
evening to do those calculations. But now we coded the changes
directly on Vilfredo. So now if you go to the history of any question,
you can see for each generation, who are the key players. I understand
this seem just some sort of abstruse mathematical knowledge, but it
can turn out very practical. Imagine you are in the middle of a
discussion, and you receive an email inviting you to work on a
&quot;particular&quot; proposal. One that you did not support. If you this
right, so that now you would support the new proposal, and no one of
the previous supporters are lost, you will have shrank the pareto
front (by adding one proposal, and taking away 2).

So for example if you look at
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewhistoryofquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>

You can see for each generation the key players.

A couple of bugs were also sorted out.

Cheers,
Pietro
