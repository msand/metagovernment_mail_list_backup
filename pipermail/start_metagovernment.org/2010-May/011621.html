<PRE>Perhaps this might of interest to Metagov subscribers, particularly with
respect to the need/potential for an XML-based standard for the expression
of policies/issues upon which stakeholder input and feedback (e.g., &quot;votes&quot;)
can be provided.

Subject: RE: ITIF &amp; StratML

Daniel, to those only have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  So I
certainly don't want to convey the impression that I believe StratML is the
answer to everything.  

On the other hand, based upon the first definition of the term &quot;policy&quot; at
<A HREF="http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/search?q=define+policy&amp;FORM=DTPDIA&amp;qpvt=defin">http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/search?q=define+policy&amp;FORM=DTPDIA&amp;qpvt=defin</A>
ition+policy, StratML does seem to me to be a fairly good structure for
expressing it:  &quot;course of action: a program of actions adopted by a person,
group, or government, or the set of principles on which they are based&quot;

Indeed, according to that source, &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;plan&quot; are synonyms for
&quot;policy&quot;.

However, rather than theorize about it or simply accept someone else's
perspective, how about: 

a) using Joe Carmel's XForms form --
<A HREF="http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/stratmlxform3.xml">http://xmldatasets.net/XF2/stratmlxform3.xml</A> -- to see how ITIF's policy
statements &quot;fit&quot; the schema for StratML Part 1, and to the degree that new
or different elements may be required,

b) working with an ANSI-accredited standards development organization like
AIIM to specify a standard for &quot;policy&quot; statements that is tightly
integrated with the kinds of (strategic and performance) &quot;plans&quot; required to
translate policy into effective action?  (In my view, we have far too much
&quot;policy&quot; and far too little effective action.  In other words, many policy
statements are under-specified and thus ineffective, as if we naturally
prefer to talk about problems rather than solve them.)

Note: AIIM's StratML Committee is now working on StratML Part 2, Performance
Plans and Reports: <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part2">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part2</A>  It is already
complicated enough that I fear trying to address still more complexity right
now might unduly raise the risk of failure.  However, if and, hopefully,
when we get to Part 3, the concept of &quot;authorities&quot; (e.g., &quot;policies&quot;) is on
our radar: <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A> 

The degree to which the value of the StratML standard is recognized and
acted upon by others, like ITIF, will have significant bearing on whether
further effort on the StratML standard will be worthwhile (and might be
accelerated with additional participation and expertise).

Owen,

Thank you for the information and converting ITIF's mission statement to
StratML.  I will be sure to keep this in mind as a great example of using
structured data to promote open government and look forward to seeing new
uses of this data.

I thought you might be able to help with a more technical question.  As you
know, ITIF puts out a number of policy recommendations.  Would it be
advisable to use StratML if we wanted to create a structured data set of all
our recommendations or would another XML vocabulary and schema be more
appropriate?  The structure does not seem to directly relate to
recommendations for others since it is more about an organization's own
actions, although since you stated that you think candidates could use this
for their campaign platform (which might entail not just actions they would
take but actions they want to see others take), I thought maybe this would
work.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Subject: ITIF &amp; StratML

Kevin, seeing on LinkedIn that you joined the ITIF group prompted me to
convert ITIF's mission statement to StratML format for inclusion in our
collection at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#ITIF">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#ITIF</A>

Robert, I encourage ITIF to consider the potential benefits of widespread
usage of the StratML standard (ANSI/AIIM 21:2009), whose purposes are
outlined at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A>

I have converted to StratML format all of the agency open gov plans of which
I am aware, at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OpenGovDirective">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OpenGovDirective</A>

I am also promoting the notion that political parties and candidates for
elective office should publish their platforms on the Web in StratML format.

In support of your policy proposals
goal&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/ITIFwStyle.xml#_b2385d12-64ec-11df-8661-e">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/ITIFwStyle.xml#_b2385d12-64ec-11df-8661-e</A>
e507a64ea2a&gt;, it would be good if ITIF could:


a)      participate in promoting that notion,

b)      publish some &quot;model&quot; objectives for potential incorporation into
such &quot;plans&quot; and

c)       report to your stakeholders which candidates have and have not
included them in their campaign platforms.

In the event there might be opportunities for partnership between AIIM and
ITIF along those lines, I am copying Betsy Fanning, AIIM's director of
standards; Bryant Duhon, who edits AIIM's online publications; and Steve
Levenson, who chairs AIIM's Standards Board.
