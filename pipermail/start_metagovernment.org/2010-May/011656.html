<PRE>It turns out that PdI's goals are practically the same as ours.  But
your method (particularly private voting) looks to be based on
groundless assumptions, and I'm afraid it will fail.  Anyway (in good
faith), this is what I argue below.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; ... Public voting would be, at the moment, a huge cultural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; change that the voting population is not willing to accept...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Are you sure?  Did they ever get a choice?

Did you intend to reply?  You have knowledge of what the voting
population is/is not willing to accept.  How did you come by that
knowledge?  Or did you merely assume it (as others might) without
grounds?

&gt;<i> &gt; We had a discussion about this in the election methods list.  I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sure we covered all the bases, but ...

</I>
To know the perception of the general public, per se, would require a
public voting system.  The public cannot speak (as such) in private.

Aside from the general public, you are also wary of what the experts
think.  But who are these experts?  Where have they analyzed the
relative merits of public vs. private voting?

&gt;<i> [a] ... Furthermore, I have consulted some experts on the matter,
</I>&gt;<i> and they let me know that they would not hesitate to condemn a
</I>&gt;<i> non-secure voting system outright as
</I>&gt;<i> unreliable/fringe/non-serious/suspect, and derail our entire project
</I>&gt;<i> from their position of authority as opinion makers.
</I>
&gt;<i> [b] ... Ofcourse, from an engineering standpoint, a public voting
</I>&gt;<i> system is much much easier. In fact, as I have said before, creating
</I>&gt;<i> a practical secure system would be something of an achievement, as
</I>&gt;<i> right now these systems are largely just prototypes for academic
</I>&gt;<i> research.
</I>
Unless I misunderstand, [a] and [b] are practical contradictions.
What the experts will condemn/derail in [a], you will build in [b].
 
&gt;<i> Our system would be open to anyone (eligible in &quot;normal&quot; elections),
</I>&gt;<i> not just party members or people who voted for PdI in &quot;normal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> elections. People are surprised when they hear this, but our
</I>&gt;<i> objective is to create a channel for _everyone_, and that is what a
</I>&gt;<i> vote for PdI stands for...
</I>
Your goals are therefore practically the same as ours.  So (with a
change of person) the same conclusion follows:

  This makes you a bigger target for attack.  Your attackers will be
  politically saavy (parties for instance) and they'll sieze upon any
  confusion over the verification system, and play hardball with it.
  You'd ordinarily lose, ofc.  But if people can see the votes for
  themselves, and count them for themselves, then they'll also
  *defend* them for themselves.  (Because you aim your voting system
  at the general public, it behooves you to ensure that it *is* a
  public voting system.  Otherwise you bring a knife to a gun fight.)
