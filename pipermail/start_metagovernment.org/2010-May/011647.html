It depends on the scale of implementation. In clubs, for example,  
votes are held by a show of hands. At board meetings, directors vote  
&quot;on the record,&quot; and in legislative bodies, votes are usually recorded  
for each member.

I think the reason elections have traditionally been held with  
anonymous votes has been to protect the people who lose the election  
from being persecuted by the winners. However, if the voting is on  
policy instead of for candidates, this possibility doesn't really  
exist. Even in liquid democracy systems, it is not very plausible to  
imagine that proxy representatives could lash out at people who voted  
the opposite of their position: they won't be empowered with means to  
do anything... will they?

In the Web 2.0 age, the desire for privacy is most likely centered  
around reputation and peer pressure. People may not be inclined to  
vote for their beliefs if they don't want others to know they think  
that way. It is then a matter of personal philosophy as to whether  
this is a good or bad thing. Some would say that people should have  
the anonymous cloak to enable them to vote free of outside pressure.  
Others would say that people should be required to stand by their  
vote: if they are embarrassed to vote a particular way, then they have  
to resolve that internal conflict themselves, not ask that the voting  
system enable it.
