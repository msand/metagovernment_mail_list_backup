<PRE>Pietro, your point is well-taken:  Most initiatives fail, often for lack of
participation.

 

However, Alex's point is also on the mark:  It must be as easy as possible
for folks to participate, using whatever means *they* choose.

 

If the spirit of the President's Open Government Directive is to be
achieved, government agencies will not impose any artificial restrictions
upon citizens as to what means they may use to communicate with their
government.  However, if agencies are to achieve their statutory mandates
with any degree of efficiency, they will take steps to ensure that
everything they do and receive (including input from citizens) is &quot;aligned&quot;
with their strategic objectives.  And the same is true of any organization.

 

Citizens should be free to document their own objectives and the tools and
services should automatically draw the appropriate connections.

 

Hopefully, the StratML standard will be helpful toward those ends.

 

Alex, the folks at MindTouch expressed interest in implementing StratML in
Deki Wiki, but I don't think they've had the time, resources, or business
proposition to follow through. <A HREF="http://www.mindtouch.com/">http://www.mindtouch.com/</A>  If there's any
chance you might be willing and able to implement the StratML standard in
Drupal or Wordpress, I'd be glad to help in any way of which I am capable.

Hello Owen, what I am trying to say is that there is an entry level
that need to be there before a tool is useful. This is a number of
people must be there to use the tool. And the number of people depends
on the technology itself.

I think this is a good point, and it's one I struggle with regularly.  The
direction of the Votorola project is exactly the direction I see the
organizations I work with heading, but that doesn't mean they will see the
some congruence.

 

I have wrestled with how to phrase my own interpretation of the divide I am
looking at, and I see now it has at least 2 sides.

 

On one side I wish to be able to implement Votorola by using something
besides Mediawiki, and to do that easily.  Specifically I would choose
Drupal and Wordpress.

 

That is the tech side, and the ease of use and speed in getting started are
the critical factors.

 

On the other side I have been wrestling with how to help groups discover,
for themselves, in their own terms, their implicit need for such a voting
system.

 

I have been playing with the idea of a story based tutorial of sorts helping
the group to discover the needs and the 'official' names for solutions, and
even, then, creating icons or representations of terms and system objects,
thereby facilitating the process of taking ownership of the system.  In this
way, the group can evangelize to members in familiar language and with
native expertise.

 

Perhaps others have seen similar needs and could help me to find other ways
of describing this, or even examples of such a tutorial.
