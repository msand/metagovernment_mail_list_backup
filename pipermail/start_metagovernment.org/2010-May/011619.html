<PRE>Hi all,

I prefer to call it e-Citizen or e-World or e-Life instead of e-Democracy.

Can I create a geographic constituency any where in the world using a Google
map and start raising issues (functional subject matter) for voting? Can
these two be in tree format, for easy drill down?

Any person should be able to vote, stating his / her interest in the
constituency for voting (example - resident, place of birth, service
provider, service seeker, etc.

Am I making my point clear? Is it in sync with what you are doing?

Best,

Kris Dev
