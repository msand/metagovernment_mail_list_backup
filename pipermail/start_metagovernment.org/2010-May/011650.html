<PRE>Hi all,

First of all: congratulations on creating pdl! We had a very similar effort in Germany a while back, called Metapartei. I very much liked their approach, but they never formally got set up... 

As for software, I'd be glad to support you with components from Adhocracy, maybe the discussion and delegation systems can be of value to you?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the reason elections have traditionally been held with anonymous votes has been to protect the people who lose the election from being persecuted by the winners.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And matters such as coercion and vote buying.
</I>
My understanding of the legal situation at least here in Germany is that in order to have a fully secret ballot (i.e. to avoid coercion and buying) the voters themselves must be unable to prove their choice. While I have seen algorithmic approaches that do have this quality, I don't think one can (or should be able to) achieve this using a distributed system and home PCs. 

For me, it is essential to be able to use a liquid approach using generic hardware and a web browser. I also think that the positive value of forcing people to stand with their opinions should not be neglected, especially in combination with a delegation system. All of this doesn't change the fact that a public ballot might exclude those who cannot safely express their opinions. This, along with questions related to the digital divide and media literacy, limits the scope in which LD can be used today. 

The even more relevant question is: what's the killer feature of LD? I don't think that direct democracy is used so little today because of the amount of work involved: ballots could be cast every week with the same budget that is needed to run parliaments, and voters could easily vote on issues that they care about if polling stations were located near supermarkets. 

The reason we don't use direct democracy is that it is hard to distribute information about policy widely enough. The question &quot;what should we vote on?&quot; is much harder to answer than &quot;how should I decide?&quot;. both questions must be answered in order to produce good decisions. That's why I think policy creation and debate should be the core of LD, not vote casting. And for that process to occur, you want to have as much information from the voters as possible, especially their decisions. Still, we will never be able to turn everyone into a policy expert -- that's why delegated voting might be a good tool to use in an information-based direct democracy. 

Regards,
 Friedrich
