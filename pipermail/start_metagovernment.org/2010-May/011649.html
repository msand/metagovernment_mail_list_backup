The scale of implementation that we have in mind is that for which people
expect privacy (ie elections), hence my comment re cultural change.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the reason elections have traditionally been held with anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> votes has been to protect the people who lose the election from being
</I>&gt;<i> persecuted by the winners.

And matters such as coercion and vote buying.


&gt;<i> However, if the voting is on policy instead of for candidates, this

</I>&gt;<i> not very plausible to imagine that proxy representatives could lash out at
</I>&gt;<i> people who voted the opposite of their position: they won't be empowered
</I>&gt;<i> with means to do anything... will they?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the Web 2.0 age, the desire for privacy is most likely centered around
</I>&gt;<i> reputation and peer pressure. People may not be inclined to vote for their
</I>&gt;<i> beliefs if they don't want others to know they think that way. It is then a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of personal philosophy as to whether this is a good or bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i> Some would say that people should have the anonymous cloak to enable them to
</I>&gt;<i> vote free of outside pressure. Others would say that people should be
</I>&gt;<i> required to stand by their vote: if they are embarrassed to vote a
</I>&gt;<i> particular way, then they have to resolve that internal conflict themselves,
</I>&gt;<i> not ask that the voting system enable it.
