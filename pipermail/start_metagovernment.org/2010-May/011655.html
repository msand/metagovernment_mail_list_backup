For what it is worth, in the United States, there was significant  
controversy over Diebold voting systems, used in election booths in  
many states and localities. Not only did the president of Diebold  
promise to deliver an entire state to GW Bush in 2004, but also there  
were numerous articles about enormous problems and security flaws in  
their systems.

Diebold systems ran on Windows (itself making the whole thing  
relatively unreliable and open to numerous exploits), were completely  
closed-source and undocumented, were networked together (exposing them  
to wide-scale exploits), and most importantly were actually  
demonstrated on video to be easily compromised by relatively  
unsophisticated hackers.

...and yet, people continued to use them. That division of Diebold got  
sold to another company, which then got bought by yet another company.  
That company, Election Systems &amp; Software, is the largest manufacturer  
of voting machines in the United States today.

I am just pointing this out as an aside: clearly the endorsement of  
experts should be helpful... it is just that criticism by experts is,  
apparently, not always harmful.

As has been discussed in earlier threads, there are relatively easy  
ways to make even anonymous voting both credible and reliable. The  
difference here, however, is that one probably has to abandon the  
strict one-person-one-vote philosophy (which is not a bad thing, since  
nobody can vote on every issue anyway).

The idea most discussed in the past in this group has been to have a  
reputation system (preferably where users have no ability to promote  
their own reputation, but can only get reputation from the actions of  
others), and then to have the software analyze recursive spheres of  
influence such that multiple users all giving positive ratings to each  
other are cancelled out.

A reputation system removes any need for complex identification or  
vote-authentication systems. It requires other kinds of back-end  
complexity, but in the end it is much more organic and adaptable to an  
open system like the internet.
