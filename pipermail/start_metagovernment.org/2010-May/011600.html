<PRE>We now have a voter registry that's technically functional.  It's
ready for sharing among multiple projects, voting sites, and so forth.
(See details at bottom.)  What other facilities are needed in order to
start e-democracy?  If we coded them, how would you use them?

I'm assuming everyone would agree that e-democracy hasn't happened
yet, and that the missing ingredients are the technical facilities.
(People can already do the &quot;democracy&quot; part, they only need the &quot;e-&quot;
part.)  So what exactly is missing?  If you had it, how would you go
about starting e-democracy?

I'm only a tool developer, so I ask for your help.
Best to all,

RESIDENTIAL REGISTRY (2a-c)
===========================
Reposted from <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/votorola/t/fa41aa4918dddaa6">http://groups.google.com/group/votorola/t/fa41aa4918dddaa6</A>

This task is largely complete, except for the last item (2d).
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp#Residential_registry">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp#Residential_registry</A>

This is mostly technical infrastructure.  It gives us a functional
prototype of a voter register that's ready for sharing with other
clients.  Votorola's pollserver is the reference client, but others
have equal access to the same registration data.  Details:

2a) Compiling voter lists
-------------------------
  The latest register for each local area is posted here.  If your
  area in the wiki has registrants, they'll show up here:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/">http://u.zelea.com/system/host/u/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/</A>

  For each registrant, it tells:
  * Where he/she lives, postal code, electoral districts, etc.
  * The level of trust at which this data is authenticated

  Pollservers may use these registers to compile their voter lists,
  exactly as Votorola does.

2b) Enforcing voter eligibility based on divisions
--------------------------------------------------
  Here's a riding (electoral district) in which only local registrants
  are entitled to vote:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Tor/riding/Trinity-Spadina">http://u.zelea.com/w/Tor/riding/Trinity-Spadina</A>

  Here's a voter who has registered to vote in that riding:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom</A>

  Divisional restrictions like this may be configured to cover any
  geo-political area of residence (city-wide, state-wide, etc). More
  information: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Division">http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Division</A>

  Try it out.  You can't vote here unless you're locally registered:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=Tor!p!tsmp">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=Tor!p!tsmp</A>

2c) Enforcing voter eligibility based on trust
----------------------------------------------

  Here's a poll that's restricted to voters who are authenticated to a
  trust level of 1: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/vohall">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/vohall</A>

  Here are some trusted voters:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe</A>
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom</A>

  More information: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Trust_level">http://u.zelea.com/w/Property:Trust_level</A>

  Try it out.  You need level 1 to vote here:
  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!vohall">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=G!p!vohall</A>

2d) Policing the voter registry
-------------------------------

  This part isn't ready yet.  We still need layouts of streets etc. so
  neighbours can detect local sock puppets:
  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Policing_for_local_sock_puppets">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Policing_for_local_sock_puppets</A>

  Meantime, all we have for policing is rudimentary browsing of the
  trust network.  For example, to see who's trusting Thomas:

    <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:Browse/User:ThomasvonderElbe-20GmxDe">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:Browse/User:ThomasvonderElbe-20GmxDe</A>

  The trust sources are listed at top left.  Browse to any of them by
  clicking on the round icon.  For example:

    <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:Browse/User:Mike-2DZeleaCom">http://u.zelea.com/w/Special:Browse/User:Mike-2DZeleaCom</A>

  Trust *destinations* are listed at bottom right.

Other changes
-------------

* The front page of the server now links to the compiled data exports
  (poll counts, voter registers, etc): <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/</A>

* Configuration changes made in the wiki (poll titles, eligibility
  criteria, trust signatures, and so forth) now automatically find
  their way to the pollserver within a few hours.  If you don't want
  to wait, you can force an immediate refresh (only for a poll).  For
  example: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Poll?p=Sys!p!sandbox">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Poll?p=Sys!p!sandbox</A>

That's all.  Please report any bugs you see.
