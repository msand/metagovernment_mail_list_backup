<PRE>Hello,

My name is Andy Pope and I live in Ashland, WI USA, a small town on the
shores of Lake Superior's Chequamegon Bay.  For a living I write code for a
small manufacturing company mainly working on Engineering Data Management
(2d/3d CAD data), as well as integrating 3rd party applications (CAD
programs mostly) using the company's 'Business Rules'.

I'm glad I stumbled on a link to your site today (it was in a response to a
post I found looking for new societal ideas:
<A HREF="http://www.whynot.net/ideas/5874">http://www.whynot.net/ideas/5874</A>) and I must say Metagovernment matches up
well with some thoughts I've been mulling on for a couple of months now.
 I've gone through the map laid out to help orient a newbie, as well as some
of the other information, and have a couple of questions.

1.  Your chosen system of 'Direct Democracy' seems very similar to a form
of governance I've become interested in called Sociocracy (
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociocracy</A>).  Sociocracy utilizes a similar
idea of Consensus Building described on your website, but uses 'Circles' and
'Double Linking' to solve the issues you appear to be struggling with
regarding 'weighting' the vote of an expert higher than that of a layperson.
 You may have already settled that issue in the ml (I didn't find any
reference to a consensus on the wiki) but there are other benefits to this
style of governance.  Have you considered Sociocracy?

2.  I can find no reference to a proposed economic model.
I recently had an epiphany regarding society.  It was around the time the US
Congress was debating whether or not people in the US should be allowed to
go to a doctor without going broke.  And I realized that something I'd taken
as a given was actually the cause of many our problems...Not money per se,
but Capitalism.  After spending a couple of hours reading entries on your
website I think most of you, like me, believe most people today do not come
close to reaching their full potential.  I believe this is because
multitudes of People all across the planet have committed all of their
energies toward the goal of acquiring wealth.  And that's not the worst of
it, they're not even acquiring the wealth for themselves (ourselves?), but
instead for a relatively small group of powerful wealthy people, who would
like to become more powerful and more wealthy.  Think of the multitudes that
are spending 8-10 hours a day in a factory (that's in the US, longer in
third world countries) doing the jobs of tools (I once worked in a factory
and I found it to be a dehumanizing experience).  Instead of being
subservient to Kings/Lords/Governors we are subservient to corporations,
evidenced by our dependence on them for the essentials of life
and livelihood.
My epiphany was that 'Capitalism simply does not work'.
I have some thoughts on a better way, but I'd like to know where you're
coming from.  Can you point me to a previous thread on the topic, or any
ideas proposed or consensus' reached?


I like many of your ideas, and I think this or something like it is the next
step for us, as a people, to take.

Thanks,

Andy Pope
