&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all: congratulations on creating pdl! We had a very similar effort
</I>&gt;<i> in Germany a while back, called Metapartei. I very much liked their
</I>&gt;<i> approach, but they never formally got set up...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hi Friedrich and thank you. Hopefully this effort will fare better..

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for software, I'd be glad to support you with components from Adhocracy,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe the discussion and delegation systems can be of value to you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Discussion systems are something we have in mind, but not immediately.
Delegation on the other hand is a core feature.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the reason elections have traditionally been held with anonymous
</I>&gt;<i> votes has been to protect the people who lose the election from being
</I>&gt;<i> persecuted by the winners.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And matters such as coercion and vote buying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding of the legal situation at least here in Germany is that in
</I>&gt;<i> order to have a fully secret ballot (i.e. to avoid coercion and buying) the
</I>&gt;<i> voters themselves must be unable to prove their choice. While I have seen
</I>&gt;<i> algorithmic approaches that do have this quality, I don't think one can (or
</I>&gt;<i> should be able to) achieve this using a distributed system and home PCs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
In the literature this property is called receipt-freeness, and is related
to vote buying. As you correctly point out, it is hard to achieve receipt
freeness using home PC's. In the case of the scheme I am looking at right
now, the problem would occur if the voters decided to reverse engineer the
voting client in order to extract the random component of the random cipher.

But the problem is deeper, home PC's make the prospect of a secure voting
system very hard, as the PC itself is a vulnerable platform. However, we
believe there is room for a compromise between absolute security, and
something practical. That is the spot we are trying to hit, and we define
this in terms of the properties related to secure voting systems.
Specifically, we are working with the client trust assumption.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me, it is essential to be able to use a liquid approach using generic
</I>&gt;<i> hardware and a web browser.
</I>

Yes, that is our aim.



&gt;<i> I also think that the positive value of forcing people to stand with their
</I>&gt;<i> opinions should not be neglected, especially in combination with a
</I>&gt;<i> delegation system. All of this doesn't change the fact that a public ballot
</I>&gt;<i> might exclude those who cannot safely express their opinions. This, along
</I>&gt;<i> with questions related to the digital divide and media literacy, limits the
</I>&gt;<i> scope in which LD can be used today.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The even more relevant question is: what's the killer feature of LD? I
</I>&gt;<i> don't think that direct democracy is used so little today because of the
</I>&gt;<i> amount of work involved: ballots could be cast every week with the same
</I>&gt;<i> budget that is needed to run parliaments, and voters could easily vote on
</I>&gt;<i> issues that they care about if polling stations were located near
</I>&gt;<i> supermarkets.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The reason we don't use direct democracy is that it is hard to distribute
</I>&gt;<i> information about policy widely enough. The question &quot;what should we vote
</I>&gt;<i> on?&quot; is much harder to answer than &quot;how should I decide?&quot;. both questions
</I>&gt;<i> must be answered in order to produce good decisions. That's why I think
</I>&gt;<i> policy creation and debate should be the core of LD, not vote casting. And
</I>&gt;<i> for that process to occur, you want to have as much information from the
</I>&gt;<i> voters as possible, especially their decisions. Still, we will never be able
</I>&gt;<i> to turn everyone into a policy expert -- that's why delegated voting might
</I>&gt;<i> be a good tool to use in an information-based direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, creating a system that promotes debate is important, but we are trying
to lay down the first stone, that is, the channel itself.

Regarding delegated voting, that is the reason why we are aiming for a
hybrid system. In such a system, voters can delegate to representatives
whenever they do not want to excercise a direct vote. In other words, it is
a representative system, but one in which the voters have retained the power
to 1) vote directly on specific policy decisions, and 2) change their
representative at any moment (not eg every four years). Under this model,
their is no decision as what is voted on, since everything is voted on,
directly or through a choice of delegate.

Regards,

David
