(I agree, it's crucial.)  We had a similar learning experience,
drafting and voting up plans with Votorola.  We weren't on the same
page (who ever is?) and we found it difficult to talk about our
differences in any concrete way.

&gt;<i> Just allowing a discussion to happen somewhere else doesn't create a

</I>&gt;<i> comments can be introduced into each line of a proposal. This (or at  
</I>&gt;<i> least some kind) of tight integration between discussion and drafting  
</I>&gt;<i> (and hopefully voting too) seems like a much, much more powerful end  
</I>&gt;<i> result.
</I>
We also looked at text annotation (Thomas and I).  In the end, we
didn't go that route.  Rather than embed the content of one medium in
another (commentary/discussion in drafting), we agreed it's better to
bridge the two by linkage.  (Now I'm thinking, we could rename the
tool a &quot;difference bridge&quot;.)

&gt;<i> Can you explain more clearly how this difference engine would be  
</I>&gt;<i> experienced by the user?
</I>
Below is a mock-up of a difference view (proposed alpha).  You kind of
have to squint at it, because it's twice removed from what an ordinary
user would eventually see.  The main part (a) is the basic difference
fragment between two position drafts.  In this fragment, the voter is
proposing a higher tax rate than the candidate:

 (b)  &lt;&lt;&lt; Voter-VxCa, rev 946     +7 CO-VOTERS with same diff: *******
      &gt;&gt;&gt; Candidate-CxCa, rev 934
      - - - @@ ... @@ frag 11
        blah blah context blah
 (a)  &lt; The tax rate is 0.60% of assessed value, per annum.
      &gt; The tax rate is 0.55% of assessed value, per annum.
        blah blah context blah
 (c)  - - -                            merge to:  &lt;&lt; LEFT  |  RIGHT &gt;&gt;
 (d)  This diff is DISCUSSED AT:
      * <A HREF="http://list.somewhere.com/t3645/post356">http://list.somewhere.com/t3645/post356</A>
      * <A HREF="http://list.elsewhere.com/t87/post98">http://list.elsewhere.com/t87/post98</A>
      * and so forth

 (this is all from <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/de/abstract.xht">http://zelea.com/project/de/abstract.xht</A>)

Also shown are several extended features, including (b) a tally of
other voters of the same candidate who are proposing the same
difference; (c) cherry-picking merge controls that allow for the
transfer of the difference in either direction; and (d) reverse links
to all known places where the difference is being discussed.

Following the links in (d) you may join in the discussions.  The
discussions, in turn, are tied to the difference view by embedded
links; as in this list post, for example:

  Dear candidate,

  Please note that 7 of us are recommending a higher tax rate.
  Amongst us, we provide over half of your total votes:
  <A HREF="http://diff.erehwon.com/taxpol/Voter-VxCa/946/Candidate-CxCa/934#11">http://diff.erehwon.com/taxpol/Voter-VxCa/946/Candidate-CxCa/934#11</A>

  Why do you continue to use a lower rate in your own draft?

  Your faithful voter,
  etc etc

We've talked about using this kind of tool for missionary work.  We'd
go into forums where political differences are already the topic of
discussion (albeit less concrete and focused) and tool them up with
these embedded links, and so forth.  (Just as votes without discussion
can seem anemic, as you say, so sometimes can discussion without
votes.)
