</I>
Yes, my reply was further below, regarding the difference between an issue,
and the public's perception of an issue.

I have assumed what the public is willing to accept, as of today, on the
grounds that private voting is what has been practiced over the years in
election processes around the world. So my belief that public voting would
be, at the moment, a huge cultural change, seems quite reasonable.

No, I have not conducted a scientific experiment, poll or otherwise, to
arrive at this assumption, nor do I think this is practical or necessary for
our purposes. Ofcourse, the party may change its mind, although this is
unlikely. If the idea of public voting gains ground and becomes the
prevalent political culture, then that would be a different scenario, but I
do not see this happening in the near future.

Furthermore, more than 20 years of research into the area of secure (in the
literature, this term usually implies and includes _privacy_) voting systems
strongly suggests that there are powerful sociological reasons to prefer
private systems, reasons that justify this historical and ongoing research.
&gt;<i>From my limited experience, nobody in academia considers public voting
</I>systems seriously for elections, which is our target functionality.

But let me restate, I am not an expert in political theory, or sociology, so
I am not qualified to argue this. I am focusing on researching and
engineering a solution that meets the criteria of a secure voting system as
defined in the literature, which I think is necessary to present a credible
alternative to the general public. I do not see our party gaining
credibility if we present a public voting system, so we'll just have to
agree to disagree, as of today.

Although I am ofcourse interested in why you think we &quot;will fail&quot;


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We had a discussion about this in the election methods list.  I'm not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; sure we covered all the bases, but ...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Im sure you have valid points, but my concern, at this point, is not

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To know the perception of the general public, per se, would require a
</I>&gt;<i> public voting system.  The public cannot speak (as such) in private.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
See above.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aside from the general public, you are also wary of what the experts
</I>&gt;<i> think.  But who are these experts?  Where have they analyzed the
</I>&gt;<i> relative merits of public vs. private voting?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Academics who research secure voting systems.

In particular I have met with some locally from this group
<A HREF="http://vototelematico.diatel.upm.es/">http://vototelematico.diatel.upm.es/</A>


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [a] ... Furthermore, I have consulted some experts on the matter,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and they let me know that they would not hesitate to condemn a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-secure voting system outright as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unreliable/fringe/non-serious/suspect, and derail our entire project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from their position of authority as opinion makers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [b] ... Ofcourse, from an engineering standpoint, a public voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system is much much easier. In fact, as I have said before, creating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a practical secure system would be something of an achievement, as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right now these systems are largely just prototypes for academic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; research.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unless I misunderstand, [a] and [b] are practical contradictions.
</I>&gt;<i> What the experts will condemn/derail in [a], you will build in [b].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, what experts would derail is a public voting system. Hence we are trying
to build a secure (as I said above, as defined in the literature, including
privacy) voting system.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Our system would be open to anyone (eligible in &quot;normal&quot; elections),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not just party members or people who voted for PdI in &quot;normal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; elections. People are surprised when they hear this, but our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objective is to create a channel for _everyone_, and that is what a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote for PdI stands for...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your goals are therefore practically the same as ours.  So (with a
</I>&gt;<i> change of person) the same conclusion follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  This makes you a bigger target for attack.  Your attackers will be
</I>&gt;<i>   politically saavy (parties for instance) and they'll sieze upon any
</I>&gt;<i>  confusion over the verification system, and play hardball with it.
</I>&gt;<i>   You'd ordinarily lose, ofc.  But if people can see the votes for
</I>&gt;<i>   themselves, and count them for themselves, then they'll also
</I>&gt;<i>   *defend* them for themselves.  (Because you aim your voting system
</I>&gt;<i>  at the general public, it behooves you to ensure that it *is* a
</I>&gt;<i>  public voting system.  Otherwise you bring a knife to a gun fight.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Exactly right. Which is why we have to build a secure system, leveraging
years of research into such matters. I am hoping that my current choice of
secure voting scheme is up to the task. But this, like many ambitious
projects, is uncertain. It may be infeasible, but we are willing to try.

Regards,

David
