<PRE>Dear All,

PdI (Partido de Internet) is a recently launched initiative, and as of
February, political party, whose aim is to establish a liquid democracy
channel within the existing representative democratic system established in
Spain. PdI will run for elections like any other political party. Unlike
normal political parties, PdI has no ideology (as is normally understood by
the term); its representatives (at the municipal, regional or national
level) will act like robots, casting votes according to the results of
elections carried out on the internet, in which any eligible citizen can
vote. This procedure would take place for potentially any and all decisions,
in effect implementing a hybrid direct/representative democracy (liquid
democracy) where citizens can vote on every matter.

Our plan is to launch an opensource project to develop a voting system that
satisfies the requirements of accuracy, privacy, verifiability,
incoercibility (and others), to the maximum extent possible with an internet
solution. The Spanish DNIe (electronic id document containing certificates)
will be used as the means for identification. We are well aware that secure
remote voting systems are largely an area of academic research and not
settled technology, and that many authorities on the matter are skeptical of
the possibility of any practical implementation. I have been researching
this matter for some time now, and hopefully we will begin an experimental
prototype in the near future.

I had come accross metagovernement a while back, but had not signed up until
now. I think there is a large degree of overlap, and we are looking forward
to any possible collaboration between metagovernement and PdI!

Kind Regards,

David
