<PRE>Hi Mark,
so Stallking Time is you :-).
Nice to meet you, and thanks for all the work you have been doing on the wiki.

Why do you say that your credibility is in the downswing?

If you feel that you have a solution that can help us why not suggesting it?

We have a question open on Vilfredo just on this:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>

Oh, yes, make sure that you log in before writing the question. In
theory the system should let you log in after, but this morning was
not working and I would feel responsible if you loose all the work of
writing a well thought answer.

There are already 3 proposals in the pareto front, but the situation
has frozen for lack of new ideas. Maybe your idea might solve the
impasse. It would also be good if you could look at the existing idea
and try to change them to integrate your idea. In this way you might
get the support of the original author.


Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> encourage the wikignomes to breathe some life into it. &#160;I speak of this with
</I>&gt;<i> some experience.
</I>&gt;<i> A realtime chat feature in the wiki would avoid some of the more recent

</I>&gt;<i> of my wiki box into the chats setup by the community off-site.
