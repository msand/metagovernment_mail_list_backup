We might.  I'm not be the best person to ask (tech head and all), but
if they met the qualification of step 4, then I think the tools
*should* work for them.

&gt;<i>  4. Find places where people are *already* engaged with political
</I>&gt;<i>     issues, and already involved in discussions about them.
</I>
For &quot;political issues&quot;, I guess we're looking for a) pending decisions
that have b) widespread social effects.  For &quot;engagement&quot;, I guess we
need what Steven Clift et al. are discussing here:
<A HREF="http://groups.dowire.org/r/topic/1xqojjch9PUpvXLXvUvvlz">http://groups.dowire.org/r/topic/1xqojjch9PUpvXLXvUvvlz</A>

Measures of engagement (as discussed there) might be helpful for us,
too.  We need evidence of *prior* engagement, because the e-dem tools
are unlikely to conjure engagement out of thin air (especially at this
early stage).  I wonder if there's a broad survey of engagement data,
one that could highlight the best candidate communities for step 4?
We could ask.

Also, we'd be in a position to do our own measurements in the context
of an experimental design with empirical data (before/after).  That
might give us a better sense of how well our tools are working.  It
might also open the door to research funding.  Does this all sound
feasible?

Ofc, we'd have to reach step 4, first.

&gt;<i>  1. Find a text that at least two of us care about. (We don't need
</I>&gt;<i>     many people, and the developer will make a third.)  The text
</I>&gt;<i>     should be at least 10 paragraphs long.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Open it up to drafting, voting and discussion using our tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  3. Refine the tools to the point of rough usability.  This could be
</I>&gt;<i>     as little as 2 weeks work.
