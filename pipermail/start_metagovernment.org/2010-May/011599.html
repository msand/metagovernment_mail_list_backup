<PRE>Thanks Ed,
and thank you Matias.

I have to say that in this period where no one is using Vilfredo (nor
are we pushing it at all), those academic results is what is keeping
us going. For example one of the reviewer asked for more testing, and
here I have two friends, who independently have shown interest in
Vilfredo. They both study psychology (one is a graduate student the
other a master student) and they both might be doing some tests.

I have added the title of the paper to the metagovernment page.

I don't think for now I can put the pdf available for download. But if
anyone of the list wants to read it just drop me a direct email and I
will send it to you.

This pdf has already gone quite a lot around, and received many
helpful comments. I passed the last week in transforming it into latex
format. Now I will round it up with the comments received and send it
again.

Cheers,
Pietro
