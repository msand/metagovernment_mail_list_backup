<PRE>Michael,

thanks for your insightful reply!

</I>
It is quite similar.

There is a demo of my current state at
<A HREF="http://test.liqd.net/page/Section_2__The_House">http://test.liqd.net/page/Section_2__The_House</A> (a multi-variant wiki
page) and <A HREF="http://test.liqd.net/page/diff?left=14&amp;right=15">http://test.liqd.net/page/diff?left=14&amp;right=15</A> (a
rudimentary diff, this should really only show the passages that have
changed at all). I still need to fully resolve the issue of which
comments to show where (i.e. will users realize that there is supposed
to be a discussion space between documents? how can I allow distinct
discussions on page variants without fatally confusing people?).

The whole idea of this is to have a HEAD variant (&quot;status quo&quot;) of
each legal document and to allow users to create variants of that
version (or to create a new document with an empty HEAD).

This is a second step after formulating the goal of the change (e.g.
&quot;better benefits for people on health care&quot;) as a proposal. Variants
regarding a number of documents can then be voted to become the &quot;body&quot;
(i.e. the implementation section) of that proposal. Finally (pending
some consistency checks), the proposal (not the variants) can be
decided upon.

I don't use a traditional wiki engine for this because I want to
tightly integrate with the (delegated) voting aspect of the system.
IMHO this kind of deep-down policy text work is where DV will become
especially powerful.

There is a very rough design document at
<A HREF="http://piratepad.net/adhcplanbeta.">http://piratepad.net/adhcplanbeta.</A> (This has partially been
implemented and parts of it are still on my roadmap. The whole
discussion on whether to use an existing DVCS was never really
finished and I decided to roll my own, mostly because I would not have
been using more than 5% of any DVCS while having to handle all of its
complexity. I have not yet gotten into the whole geo-debate which
seems very central to the pollwiki concept, I'm still waiting for a
&quot;customer&quot; to give me proper requirements on this ;))

&gt;<i> We usually assume that building a better mousetrap will bring the
</I>&gt;<i> users stampeding to our door. &#160;And who knows? &#160;Maybe it will. &#160;But the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite expectation is probably more realistic when it comes to
</I>&gt;<i> interfacing with discussion media.
</I>
There is also the &quot;Berlin approach&quot; which appears to include massive
latte macciato-fests with NGO head people. That one doesn't work,
either.

&gt;<i> The difference engine is not like that. &#160;It's not a new medium, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather an interconnector of existing media.
</I>
Yet you won't get over the requirement of being able to extract some
kind of draft text and imposing certain rules on it (e.g. disallowing
trolls from destroying it). My gut feeling with regards to MediaWiki,
for example, is that it was designed by a group of people who know
WP:NPOV by heart and that this might limit its applicability to
explicitly Non-NPOV use cases.

&gt;<i> &#160;Discussions are rational in a democracy only insofar as they are
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;focused on differences of position.
</I>
Nice. Is that yours? Can I cite that in my thesis somehow?

&gt;<i> I don't understand, because we don't expect that of users. &#160;We do
</I>&gt;<i> expect it of projects (tech and non-tech) that they will come together
</I>&gt;<i> to develop the common parts of e-dem (the parts that *must* be
</I>&gt;<i> common). &#160;But the ultimate purpose of that effort is to reach out to
</I>&gt;<i> the users. &#160;The form of reaching out will vary, but it should always
</I>&gt;<i> involve a maximizing of choice in regards to facilities. &#160;This
</I>&gt;<i> includes (where possible) the choice of using an already familiar
</I>&gt;<i> tool, or an already familiar context. &#160;(All in the spirit of free
</I>&gt;<i> voting, because it's choice that makes the voter and choice that makes
</I>&gt;<i> him free.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's supposed to be a bazaar (I agree) and not a cathedral.
