It's a strange feeling for me right now. Is the point I was waiting for 
so long already here? Or not yet?
We can register, we can open polls, we can vote and we can collect votes 
for our position. What else is needed? Well, the streetwikis for 
excluding sock-puppets. And OFC usability should be improved, but this 
will still be true for years I guess. Even the difference-bridge is just 
a usability issue for me. So I guess, we soon can spread the good news 
while in parallel still working on usability all the time. Also, the 
whole thing should run under a nice name. For that &quot;freevoters.net&quot; is 
the leading and only candidate right now. ;-)

Best,
Thomas
