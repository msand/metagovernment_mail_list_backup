I agree.

&gt;<i> At some point the number of cities or local areas will be too

</I>&gt;<i> the selected country the list of cities/oranizations. Maybe this
</I>&gt;<i> could also be done with a wiki property?  [quoted from other thread]
</I>
Yes.  We can use the area property for that.  So Dresden is in Saxony
[[Area::Saxony]], and Saxony is in Germany [[Area::Germany]].

It's easy enough to model a hierarchy.  It's a little trickier to view
it, because there are so many possibilities (see details at bottom).

But coming back to my point, this is a lot of work.  I think we need
help from the users, especially as we don't have an immediate problem.
The current area nav seems OK: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas">http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas</A>

Regarding users, the difference bridge is a little more usable now.
Here for example, one of your voters is complaining of a simple
spelling mistake: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3116&amp;a=3103#h3">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3116&amp;a=3103#h3</A>
(login under alias &quot;b&quot;, to play with patch controls)

You're off for holidays, so that leaves me as the only tester.  We're
headed for elections here in Toronto, so maybe I can find a gung-ho
tester or two locally: <A HREF="http://www.toronto.ca/elections/">http://www.toronto.ca/elections/</A>

PS (details of geo-nav)

You can use the built in property browser (like we do now for the
trust network) to browse the area hierarchy.  Or you can have drill
down lists (as you describe) implemented with semantic queries
(possibly in &quot;concepts&quot;)
<A HREF="http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Concepts">http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Concepts</A>

Or you can have tree views.  And/or your federal area can have a
federal map showing all the states; while each state has a state-wide
map showing all the local cities and regions.  Each city/region, in
turn, can have maps showing all the electoral districts.  (Maybe like
 I have in Toronto: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Tor">http://u.zelea.com/w/Tor</A>
 But I haven't filled in all the districts there, just some.)

Drilling down even further, each city/region can have neighbourhood
and street maps for purposes of policing the voter registry.  We
haven't prototyped any of those layouts yet, but we can do them very
quickly, as needed.  So you can see your own street (maybe click for
Google Street View, if it's available); your own building; your own
corridor; your own flat; and ultimately you yourself (the first free
voter on your block ;-).

In general, area admins/users have complete freedom in regards to
exploring all the various (bewildering really) navigation
possibilities.  And if some of their choices/inventions are especially
cool (and also politically neutral) then we could incorporate them in
the temporary central wiki, instead of (or in addition to) our boring
list of areas: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas">http://u.zelea.com/w/Site:List_of_areas</A>
