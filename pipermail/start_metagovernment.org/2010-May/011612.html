&gt;<i> Hello Owen, what I am trying to say is that there is an entry level

organizations I work with heading, but that doesn't mean they will see the
some congruence.

I have wrestled with how to phrase my own interpretation of the divide I am
looking at, and I see now it has at least 2 sides.

On one side I wish to be able to implement Votorola by using something
besides Mediawiki, and to do that easily.  Specifically I would choose
Drupal and Wordpress.

That is the tech side, and the ease of use and speed in getting started are
the critical factors.

On the other side I have been wrestling with how to help groups discover,
for themselves, in their own terms, their implicit need for such a voting
system.

I have been playing with the idea of a story based tutorial of sorts helping
the group to discover the needs and the 'official' names for solutions, and
even, then, creating icons or representations of terms and system objects,
thereby facilitating the process of taking ownership of the system.  In this
way, the group can evangelize to members in familiar language and with
native expertise.

Perhaps others have seen similar needs and could help me to find other ways
of describing this, or even examples of such a tutorial.
