I agree with the overall aim of Thomas's plan, but I think it lacks
clear, practical steps of execution.  Here's the steps I would specify
(only #1 is complete, so far):

     <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/frvp</A>

1. POLLSERVERS (done)

   Deploy the essential voting facilities in one or more pollservers.

      (PW)
       |      PW  pollwiki (common) <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/Pollwiki">http://u.zelea.com/w/Pollwiki</A>
       |      PS  pollserver (only Votorola, at present)
       |          <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollserver">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Pollserver</A>
      (PS)

2. RESIDENTIAL REGISTER

      Registers are for authenticating votes. Authentication is
      required because unauthenticated votes are worse than no votes
      at all; they cast doubt on the practice of democracy as a
      whole. A residential register implements just one type of
      authentication that may co-exist alongside others. For a first
      implementation, however, a residential register has
      advantages.[2]

   Prototype the residential register, including streetwiki (SW) and
   trustserver (TS). Integrate these with the central polling
   facilities. <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki</A>

      (PW SW)
         |      PW SW  integral pollwiki/streetwiki <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w">http://u.zelea.com/w</A>
         |      PS TS  pollserver/trustserver <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/</A>
         |
      (PS TS)

   a) Compile a voter list

      Have the TS compile a separate registration list per SW area
      (city, local region), and post it openly.

      Have each PS aggregate the registration lists (residential from
      TS, member rolls from various organizations) into a single
      voter list that combines all properties (residential,
      organizational) that are required for its particular
      polls. <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/edor</A>

   b) Enforce voter eligibility based on divisions

      Add local divisions as explicit registration properties in SW
      user pages. For example, the user specifies all local electoral
      districts in which she is resident.

      Add other divisions as implicit registration properties. The
      pollserver deduces these when compiling its voter list, based
      on the location of the registrant's SW.

   c) Enforce voter eligibility based on neighbourhood trust

      Have TS trace the trust network across all areas, and set trust
      levels as registration properties. Ranges of trust extension
      (person to person) are unlimited at first (across continents
      and oceans). Later, as the network condenses and strengthens,
      the ranges will be tightened (ultimately down to neighbourhood
      scales).

      Set minimal trust levels in PW divisions, and apply these
      during PS counts.

   d) Enable users to police the register

      Enable navigation of the trust network. Emplace nav aids that
      interlink user pages on lines of trust, so trust is always
      traceable to its sources.

      Enable navigation of streets. Prototype the streetwiki pages
      for ways, neighbourhoods, and so forth.

3. FREE-RANGE VOTING

      Voters must not be fenced in by competing facilities. They are
      neither cattle nor consumers.  If their inherent potential for
      consensus (and dissensus) is arbitrarily constrained or split
      by non-political competition, then it will never be
      realized. Without the potential of consensus, democracy itself
      fails.

   Wait for the first non-Votorola pollserver (voting site or tool)
   to hook into the common architecture. Share votes with it. Let the
   users try it out and wander freely between the
   servers. <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring</A>

           \ | /
            \|/
            (TS)

4. DIFFERENCE ENGINE

      Communities of practice are not portable. The tools of
      e-democracy must reach out to people wherever they are already
      engaged with each other, which means via their existing lines
      of communication.

   Code a bare-bones difference engine. Explore and develop the
   interface with discussion
   media. <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/de">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/de</A>

5. DATA ARCHIVING AND VERIFICATION FACILITIES

      Verification is required, because unverified results are worse
      than no results at all. They cast doubt on the practice of
      democracy as a whole.

   Record all vote shifts in the database, not just the lastest vote
   dispositions. Re-implement the snapshot export interface, moving
   it from the filebase to the database.[3]

   Allow for independent verification of poll results, based on
   static snapshots of vote, configuration and other input data.

6. DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE

      Democracy is a decentered thing. It exists in the peripheries,
      because that's where the people are. If the facilities are not
      likewise distributed, then they are not facilities of
      democracy.

   Wait for the first area to request separation from the central
   site. Help it go independent with its own wiki and servers.

      (PW SW)    (PW)    (PW)
         |        |       |
         |        |       |
         |        |       |
      (PS TS)    (PS)    (PS)

                 area    area

   If it's a local area with a streetwiki, then subscribe to its
   registration lists from the central pollserver. The local
   registrants may then vote everywhere.

NOTES AND REFERENCES

  [2] The advantages of authentication based on residence include
      universal tightness, so there are no cracks for sock puppets to
      slip through. Also, voters and politicians are familiar with
      this form of authentication, so there is no need to explain why
      the votes should be taken seriously. For more on the rationale
      of residential authtentication, see:
      <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-April/002740.html.">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-April/002740.html.</A>

  [3] Historical records of vote shifts must be implemented early
      on. Aside from allowing more efficiency in the generation of
      public snapshots for verification purposes, the history will
      serve another crucial purpose. It will provide a strong
      safeguard against vote buying. See the last item (v) at
      <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#vote-buy.">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#vote-buy.</A>

Are any of these steps non-essential?  Or are any of the essentials
missing?
