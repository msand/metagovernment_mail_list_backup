Interesting comment, especially in this context. Would you care to
elaborate this a bit? I am currently working on something that you
would probably call a difference engine (I go with &quot;multi-variant
wiki&quot;). I feel that while I am in large parts reproducing existing
tools (i.e. wikis, branch version mgmt.) the requirements for
political negotiation are sufficiently different to justify this
overhead.

What I mean is: in formalizing these kinds of negotiations into a
software platform, we're introducing a new process that will
necessarily sustain/accomodate its own, dedicated communities of
practice or else it will not take place. Of course, this is much
harder than accessing existing communities to give them new tools - so
I'm very curious regarding your model for doing so.

</I>
I agree completely. But doesn't this speak against the whole
mega-architectural approach we're discussing? Essentially, FRV would
mean we're building a cathedral hoping that people will come in to
deliberate in the dark corners. Having a completely separate little
island would probably work better for them. (This is short-term
thinking, of course, but groups tend to do that.)

Regards, Friedrich
