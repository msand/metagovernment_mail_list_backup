Are you sure?  Did they ever get a choice?

We had a discussion about this in the election methods list.  I'm not
sure we covered all the bases, but here are 5 reasons why vote buying
is unlikely to affect a public voting system:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#fn-2">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#fn-2</A>

In regards to coercion, first consider that:

  a) Both coercion and vote buying are forms of voter corruption.
  b) A voting system that is public (i.e. freely communicative) is
     necessarily a primary voting system.
     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election</A>

Now, from the above reference:

  TABLE 1.  SYSTEMATIC CORRUPTION OF VOTERS
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  Voting System   Individual                Collective
  --------------  ------------------------  ------------------------

  State           --                        manipulation by mass
  Electoral                                 propaganda, financed by
                                            campaign contributions,
                                            or by influence peddling

  State           Party discipline,         --
  Legislative     the whipping system

                  Vote buying, influence
                  peddling

  Public Primary  Social pressure from      --
  (Electoral and  employer, school,
   Legislative)   church, union, etc. *

                  Vote buying, influence
                  peddling

  -----------------------------------------------------------------
   * family pressure is more nature-like than systematic, so
     consider it separately

  We can take any of the corruptions (Table 1), and investigate it in
  detail.  That's one approach.  Another ... is to consider how the
  two categories of system (state and public) will interact.  There
  could be a positive synergy between them, with the corruptions of
  the state being weakened by the public system, while those of the
  public system are filtered out by the state's secret ballot.  I
  would argue this is generally true, for all of the corruptions
  listed in the table.

Do you still believe that public voting is a cause of voter
corruption?  I would argue that it is instead a remedy and a cure.  (I
also see that your Demoex-like approach would have the potential to
mitigate corruption in the state legislature.)

&gt;<i> &gt; (And we foresee other problems that would make [private voting]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infeasible in practice.)
</I>
&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on this?
</I>
We probably forsee the same practical problems.  The difference is
that your users are party members, wheras ours (we hope) are the
general public.  This makes us a much bigger target for attack.  Our
attackers will be politically saavy (parties for instance) and they'll
sieze upon any confusion over the verification system, and play
hardball with it.  We'd ordinarily lose, ofc.  But if people can see
the votes for themselves, and count them for themselves, then they'll
also defend them for themselves.  Because we aim our voting system at
the general public, it behooves us to ensure that it *is* a public
voting system.  (Otherwise we bring a knife to a gun fight.)
