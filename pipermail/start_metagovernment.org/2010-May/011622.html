I'm thinking of an e-assist that would enable democracy.  When I come
at it from that direction, I don't want to qualify the end (democracy)
any further.  It's for people to decide, and the technology ought not
to interfere with their decision, nor colour it any way.

&gt;<i> This community, the group of people involved in this project, is at
</I>&gt;<i> the stage where it could use some more involved governance than mere
</I>&gt;<i> adhocracy.  This community does not have a geographical location nor
</I>&gt;<i> an existing structure to supplant... can it still be a guinea pig
</I>&gt;<i> for this emergent system?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  The issues needn't be geographically located.  If
people want to rule/govern Metagov, then it's almost to the point
where they could begin testing the tools with that purpose in mind.

Pietro is saying that communities are a difficult seed to plant.  But
Alex is saying that communities are already out there, and it's only a
matter of how we approach them.

</I>
Most likely, yes.  We can already do geo-political constituencies.  We
can probably add mapping visualizations, if needed.

Structuring is up to the users (it's a wiki) so they can do tree
structures if they like.  We can probably add graphics too, if that's
needed: <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Graph_extensions">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Graph_extensions</A>

&gt;<i> Any person should be able to vote, stating his / her interest in the
</I>&gt;<i> constituency for voting (example - resident, place of birth, service
</I>&gt;<i> provider, service seeker, etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I making my point clear? Is it in sync with what you are doing?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  The registration framework can *express* any number
of registration properties, there is no limit.  But currently we can
only *authenticate* on residence and related geo-locals.  If you
needed authentication for other properties, then it would take some
work.  I don't promise that the pollserver admins would support your
properties.  It might depend on demand.  (But you could always mirror
the votes and do your own counts.)

Anyone can vote.  All votes are recorded and posted for mirroring etc.
But depending on how the admins/users configure the poll, not all
votes are necessarily counted by the local pollserver.  Some votes may
be barred from the count for reasons of non-residency, insufficient
authentication, and so forth.
