</I>Though my credibility is on the down-swing, I have a solution, even a
comprehensive one, but I require face-to-face development:  it is too
difficult doing this mediated by electrons. The solution is that the wiki
needs more code development.  The wiki can't be just a static store of
proposals--the state of wiki (Mediawiki especially) is currently in a state
like a medical textbook when it needs to be a living breathing body of
knowledge.  It needs the concept of community-in-time built into it: journal
logs (like advogato) for people to publish ideas in transition that can be
put into a digg like queue on an alternative front page that exists in
time--line items dates for users to thumb up or down: something to bootstrap
the involvement process until it runs itself.  My User:StalkingTime page has
some of the ideas in a very rough form.  Subtle little enhancements
encourage the wikignomes to breathe some life into it.  I speak of this with
some experience.

A realtime chat feature in the wiki would avoid some of the more recent
conflicts too.  I would love to dialog, but can't ever seem to make it out
of my wiki box into the chats setup by the community off-site.
