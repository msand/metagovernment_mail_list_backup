Can you explain more clearly how this difference engine would be  
experienced by the user?

I am glad you recognize it as crucial (right?), because as we have  
found with Vilfredo (for example), votes without discussion are  
anemic. People want to be able to explain why they voted a certain way  
and/or to know why others did not vote for them. Same goes for  
discussion and drafting.

Just allowing a discussion to happen somewhere else doesn't create a  
good user experience. By comparison, look at the Candiwi model where  
comments can be introduced into each line of a proposal. This (or at  
least some kind) of tight integration between discussion and drafting  
(and hopefully voting too) seems like a much, much more powerful end  
result.
