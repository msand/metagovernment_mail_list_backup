<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. DIFFERENCE ENGINE [now INTERFACE WITH DISCUSSION MEDIA]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Communities of practice are not portable. The tools of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; e-democracy must reach out to people wherever they are already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engaged with each other, which means via their existing lines
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of communication.

It sounds similar to a &quot;pollwiki&quot;.  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/pollwiki/">http://zelea.com/project/pollwiki/</A>

We're developing a common pollwiki (or multi-variant wiki) so that all
projects can share the same design, instead of competing needlessly
over it.  Can you share your own design?  (We want the best, and we'll
use yours if it's better.)

&gt;<i> What I mean is: in formalizing these kinds of negotiations into a
</I>&gt;<i> software platform, we're introducing a new process that will
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily sustain/accomodate its own, dedicated communities of
</I>&gt;<i> practice or else it will not take place. Of course, this is much
</I>&gt;<i> harder than accessing existing communities to give them new tools - so
</I>&gt;<i> I'm very curious regarding your model for doing so.
</I>
  If you build it, they won't come.

We usually assume that building a better mousetrap will bring the
users stampeding to our door.  And who knows?  Maybe it will.  But the
opposite expectation is probably more realistic when it comes to
interfacing with discussion media.  (I've been there, and I've talked
with others who have.)  People tend to be engaged already in
conversations, and invested in the media that support them.  A new
medium that requires uprooting and starting all over - killing the
conversation - is a non-starter.  That's what (4) is saying.

The difference engine is not like that.  It's not a new medium, but
rather an interconnector of existing media.

  Discussions are rational in a democracy only insofar as they are
  focused on differences of position.

That says it all: we require three interconnected media.  Discussions
are situated in one medium (discussion) and positions are situated at
the juncture of two others (voting and drafting).  We can use a
difference engine (as I call it) to bridge all three, and get them
working together in situ.  If you are developing something like this,
then you are lucky!  IMHO it's the technical center of e-dem and we'll
have no real users till we get there.

&gt;<i> &gt; 6. DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Democracy is a decentered thing. It exists in the peripheries,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because that's where the people are. If the facilities are not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; likewise distributed, then they are not facilities of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree completely. But doesn't this speak against the whole
</I>&gt;<i> mega-architectural approach we're discussing? Essentially, FRV would
</I>&gt;<i> mean we're building a cathedral hoping that people will come in to
</I>&gt;<i> deliberate in the dark corners. Having a completely separate little
</I>&gt;<i> island would probably work better for them. (This is short-term
</I>&gt;<i> thinking, of course, but groups tend to do that.)
</I> 
I don't understand, because we don't expect that of users.  We do
expect it of projects (tech and non-tech) that they will come together
to develop the common parts of e-dem (the parts that *must* be
common).  But the ultimate purpose of that effort is to reach out to
the users.  The form of reaching out will vary, but it should always
involve a maximizing of choice in regards to facilities.  This
includes (where possible) the choice of using an already familiar
tool, or an already familiar context.  (All in the spirit of free
voting, because it's choice that makes the voter and choice that makes
him free.)

It's supposed to be a bazaar (I agree) and not a cathedral.
