</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In regards to coercion, first consider that:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a) Both coercion and vote buying are forms of voter corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>  b) A voting system that is public (i.e. freely communicative) is
</I>&gt;<i>     necessarily a primary voting system.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  -----------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>   * family pressure is more nature-like than systematic, so
</I>&gt;<i>     consider it separately
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  We can take any of the corruptions (Table 1), and investigate it in
</I>&gt;<i>  detail.  That's one approach.  Another ... is to consider how the
</I>&gt;<i>  two categories of system (state and public) will interact.  There
</I>&gt;<i>  could be a positive synergy between them, with the corruptions of
</I>&gt;<i>  the state being weakened by the public system, while those of the
</I>&gt;<i>  public system are filtered out by the state's secret ballot.  I
</I>&gt;<i>  would argue this is generally true, for all of the corruptions
</I>&gt;<i>  listed in the table.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you still believe that public voting is a cause of voter
</I>&gt;<i> corruption?  I would argue that it is instead a remedy and a cure.  (I
</I>&gt;<i> also see that your Demoex-like approach would have the potential to
</I>&gt;<i> mitigate corruption in the state legislature.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Im sure you have valid points, but my concern, at this point, is not the
merits of public voting vs private voting per se, but rather the perception
that the general public and subject matter experts have of them.

In other words, if the general public expects private voting, and if the
general public is skeptical or regards a public voting system as
insecure/suspect/unreliable, then we have no option in our quest for
credibility as an organization to create a secure system. Furthermore, I
have consulted some experts on the matter, and they let me know that they
would not hesitate to condemn a non-secure voting system outright as
unreliable/fringe/non-serious/suspect, and derail our entire project from
their position of authority as opinion makers.

Hence, as I said before, I am convinced that for us to be a credible party,
we must cover this requirement that the public associates (correctly or not)
with a &quot;serious&quot; and reliable initiative.

Ofcourse, from an engineering standpoint, a public voting system is much
much easier. In fact, as I have said before, creating a practical secure
system would be something of an achievement, as right now these systems are
largely just prototypes for academic research.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; (And we foresee other problems that would make [private voting]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; infeasible in practice.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you elaborate on this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We probably forsee the same practical problems.  The difference is
</I>&gt;<i> that your users are party members, wheras ours (we hope) are the
</I>&gt;<i> general public.
</I>

Our system would be open to anyone (eligible in &quot;normal&quot; elections), not
just party members or people who voted for PdI in &quot;normal&quot; elections. People
are surprised when they hear this, but our objective is to create a channel
for _everyone_, and that is what a vote for PdI stands for, even if it does
transfer some of your voting power to others.



&gt;<i> This makes us a much bigger target for attack.  Our
</I>&gt;<i> attackers will be politically saavy (parties for instance) and they'll
</I>&gt;<i> sieze upon any confusion over the verification system, and play
</I>&gt;<i> hardball with it.  We'd ordinarily lose, ofc.  But if people can see
</I>&gt;<i> the votes for themselves, and count them for themselves, then they'll
</I>&gt;<i> also defend them for themselves.  Because we aim our voting system at
</I>&gt;<i> the general public, it behooves us to ensure that it *is* a public
</I>&gt;<i> voting system.  (Otherwise we bring a knife to a gun fight.)
</I>&gt;<i>

David
