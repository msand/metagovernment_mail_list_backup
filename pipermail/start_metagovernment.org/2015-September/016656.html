The problem isn't that your proposal is radical (in fact IMHO it's
downright archaic), the problem is that you can't even answer the
simplest questions about how it would work to solve any problem that
requires any sort of collective decisionmaking. Which is what this
mailing list (and the metagovernment.org site) is for.

Again, in case you actually want to *debate* the issue rather than
just repeatedly exposing yourself as another useless ideologue, please
show how a money-based system could be used to establish any of these
policies:
1) Should abortion be legal?
2) Should same-sex marriages be sanctioned by The State?
3) Which recreational drugs should be legal?
4) Can my neighbor build a skyscraper on his lot and blot out the sun
that falls on mine?
5) What building codes apply to that skyscraper such that it doesn't
fall on me, or injure its occupants?
6) Can my neighbor breed pit-bulls?
7) What is speed limit on my street, and what is the penalty for breaking it?
  Regards,
    Scott
