<PRE>Alexander,

thank you. I wonder why your fist sentence is about wrong approach, if I
agree with vast majority of what you are writing.
There is just one small distinction in our opinions. You promote
programing - I try to promote organizing with minimum of hierarchy.I
just believe that it is easier way to go, that is all imho.
What do you think ?

Cheers
m.

</I>&gt;<i> methods available to everyone - which is basically &quot;viral
</I>&gt;<i> marketing&quot;/&quot;word of mouth&quot;/...
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of big open source projects exist and some of them are awesome

</I>&gt;<i> Many, probably the vast majority of open source developers are
</I>&gt;<i> chronically poor. This is just how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have never heard of &quot;Chomsk's mandatory syndicates&quot; and the name
</I>&gt;<i> itself doesn't convince me.
</I>&gt;<i> If it cannot be described in one sentence or a small parapgrah that
</I>&gt;<i> boild down the main features to the main points, i don't feel like
</I>&gt;<i> spending time digging into it.
</I>&gt;<i> There are and were to many promising approaches that made me read a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of text in the past and nobody has time for that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So rather than compaining, I recommend trying to advertise it and
</I>&gt;<i> even if it's just word of mouth.
</I>&gt;<i> Basically you have to find USERS!!! You have to solve a problem for
</I>&gt;<i> people and try to make it more popular and scale it up.
</I>&gt;<i> And YES, that means, you cannot start with replacing the president of
</I>&gt;<i> a country, but rather solve little problems on a large scale with
</I>&gt;<i> some nice app, where people really need it.
</I>&gt;<i> Once they figure out the tool is neat, they might start to brainstorm
</I>&gt;<i> about solving some more sophisticated problems with the same tools
</I>&gt;<i> and invent more features.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> GITHUB is the biggest platform in the open that is actually used, not
</I>&gt;<i> only for code, but for all kinds of proposals and forms of governing
</I>&gt;<i> communities and prototyping those methods.
</I>&gt;<i> So I would recommend to give it a try, learn a lot about those and
</I>&gt;<i> then try to find the shortcomings and try to improve on those.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you manage to do that, then some people who are already familiar
</I>&gt;<i> with github and see the same shortcomings might follow.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this is a little bit older, but important...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO spread of information (marketing, propaganda, memetics, choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your favorite ) is one of the problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would like to claim that we got partial solutions available. And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partial is enough here, because there is no capacity to develop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something final and final solution will probably never exist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example Chomsky's mandatory syndicates. It is partially solving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concentration of capital as well as it diminishes corruption offers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to authoritarians and it opens way for further development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So why is this not happening ? People *do not* recognize it. It has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; little of traditional marketing and when it comes to viral, Seth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Godin would say: it is not remarkable in ordinary conversation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; life. You cannot make the remark safely in relation to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reputation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it so ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; m.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I aslo spent some time thinking, how to make your projects more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; remarkable, but I do not know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Do you have any idea ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It'd be &quot;remarkable&quot; if it actually solved the collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decisionmaking problem ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; IMHO the big problem here is not marketing, it's producing a product
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that actually works. Once you have that, people *will* recognize it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and will use it without you having to spend a large amount of effort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or large sums of money marketing it. So I'd recommend studying the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem, not the memes necessary to convince people to buy/use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something that doesn't really solve it.
