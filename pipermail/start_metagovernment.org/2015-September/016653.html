<PRE>I believe this is the wrong approach to think about it.

There are a lot of solutions out there - growing, already existing,
starting out and improving.
Some of them we might know about, some are unknown to us.

marketing/propaganda/memetics/... will not go away. one could even argue
they are a feature of evolution, so complaining about it doesnt lead
nowhere.

Tons of people out there in the open learn how to program and they JFDI
(just fucking do it) and start to program something.
Either you are &quot;the government&quot; or you have to realize that you are not and
nothing can change that, so you have to learn how to use the methods
available to everyone - which is basically &quot;viral marketing&quot;/&quot;word of
mouth&quot;/...
A lot of big open source projects exist and some of them are awesome an
gather a lot of traction.
Many, probably the vast majority of open source developers are chronically
poor. This is just how it goes.

I have never heard of &quot;Chomsk's mandatory syndicates&quot; and the name itself
doesn't convince me.
If it cannot be described in one sentence or a small parapgrah that boild
down the main features to the main points, i don't feel like spending time
digging into it.
There are and were to many promising approaches that made me read a lot of
text in the past and nobody has time for that.

So rather than compaining, I recommend trying to advertise it and even if
it's just word of mouth.
Basically you have to find USERS!!! You have to solve a problem for people
and try to make it more popular and scale it up.
And YES, that means, you cannot start with replacing the president of a
country, but rather solve little problems on a large scale with some nice
app, where people really need it.
Once they figure out the tool is neat, they might start to brainstorm about
solving some more sophisticated problems with the same tools and invent
more features.

GITHUB is the biggest platform in the open that is actually used, not only
for code, but for all kinds of proposals and forms of governing communities
and prototyping those methods.
So I would recommend to give it a try, learn a lot about those and then try
to find the shortcomings and try to improve on those.

If you manage to do that, then some people who are already familiar with
github and see the same shortcomings might follow.
