</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;Company&quot; or an &quot;NGO&quot; or a &quot;FOUNDATION&quot; or some of the crowdfunding

</I>
OK, so the Catholic Church can *buy* laws that bans same-sex marriage
or abortion unless the rest of us are willing to pony up the money to
prevent this (and they have billions, at least if you're willing to
consider the value of their land holdings). Makes sense to me: It's
how the energy companies currently prevent a carbon tax from being
passed and how the NRA prevents any reasonable gun control policies
from being enacted. Seems to me your proposal is actually
significantly *worse* than what we have now because it requires we
*accept* that money buys policy, removing the fantasy we all maintain
that &quot;doing right&quot; still counts for something.

&gt;<i> Is there anything that our current &quot;government systems&quot; with all their
</I>&gt;<i> election, proposal, execution, etc... processes do, that works better than
</I>&gt;<i> what I try to describe here?
</I>
No. It seems to me it works exactly the same way...

&gt;<i> One thing upfront:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Some things are easy to enforce to social pressure or economic pressure
</I>&gt;<i> and in the vast majority of cases that solves the problem.
</I>
Right, like it ended slavery, allowed women the right to vote, ended
child labor, etc. (i.e., in your dreams ;-)

&gt;<i> My general approach now is:
</I>&gt;<i> Start with the obvious improvements and make it work for some people, then
</I>&gt;<i> scale it and face the problems that emerge then.
</I>&gt;<i> I have enough confidence that those problems can be managed - if not, then
</I>&gt;<i> let's have a public system for enforcing contracts (like competing
</I>&gt;<i> constitutions) and spend all the power of thought to brainstorm how this
</I>&gt;<i> could look like - because people dont usually discuss this, but instead how
</I>&gt;<i> we vote - which does not seem to be the major problem, because it all
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the &quot;contract enforcement mechanisms&quot; or &quot;proposal execution
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism&quot;
</I>
No, the problem is that *we* never get a chance to vote. It's all done
*for* us by our SDAP &quot;leaders&quot;. They can't represent us because they
are not like us.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Should abortion be legal?
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else
</I>
The standard libertarian answer. To which I respond:
OK, so if a woman decides she wants to abort a perfectly healthy 9
month old fetus because she's decided she would rather party than take
care of a child, we're supposed to be OK with that? So what if she
considers that fetus to be something less than a person, it doesn't
affect you, right? Unfortunately surveys show that very few of us are
OK with this, and the few that say it's still OK are actually just
fighting against some mythical slippery slope that any restriction on
abortion will just lead to more restrictions.

What if that women considers black people, or Germans, or some other
class of people to be something less than a person? Does she get to
own slaves? Commit genocide?

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Should same-sex marriages be sanctioned by The State?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else
</I>
So if they want to raise pit-bulls and fight them, that's no one's
business too, right?  Dogs are not people, so we shouldn't be able to
infringe on anyone's rights to do whatever they want with them (hey,
fight them, marry them, whatever they want!)

This kind of superficial understanding of what morals are and why we
humans have a moral systems in the first place is unfortunately
characteristic of libertarianism, a philosophy I really want to like,
but simply can't because it's so underdeveloped. You might benefit
from actually reading matchism.org. Even if you don't accept all of it
(and I've actually yet to receive any substantive criticism about any
flaws in it), at least it will prepare you to debate people who
actually have thought about the issue rather than just having adopted
an ideology without ever having examined the ramifications.

&gt;&gt;<i> 4) Can my neighbor build a skyscraper on his lot and blot out the sun
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that falls on mine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Interesting question - I have some thoughts about it, but I think it
</I>&gt;<i> doesnt make sense to tell them now.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead:
</I>&gt;<i> How is this currently being solved?
</I>
Not very well. The decision is usually made based on the economics
(i.e., who has more money). But it doesn't need to be this way: People
could actually set up system such that The People get what *they*
want. How this might be done is also explained on matchism.org.

&gt;<i> What is the right strategy depends a lot on &quot;contract law&quot;, which for
</I>&gt;<i> example would be TRANSPARENT to everyone, because it would be &quot;BLOCKCHAIN
</I>&gt;<i> BASED&quot; (see projects like <A HREF="https://www.ethereum.org/">https://www.ethereum.org/</A> )
</I>
No, it depends on people having a way of expressing their opinion
*without* having to spend money they may not have, trust a politician
that is not like them and doesn't even really care about them, or riot
in the streets to protest what is probably already a done deal. I.e.,
provide them with the tools to run an actual democracy rather than the
pseudo-democracies we all live under now.
