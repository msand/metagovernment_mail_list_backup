<PRE>Hello,

this is a little bit older, but important...

IMHO spread of information (marketing, propaganda, memetics, choose your
favorite ) is one of the problems.
I would like to claim that we got partial solutions available. And
partial is enough here, because there is no capacity to develop
something final and final solution will probably never exist.

For example Chomsky's mandatory syndicates. It is partially solving
concentration of capital as well as it diminishes corruption offers to
authoritarians and it opens way for further development.

So why is this not happening ? People *do not* recognize it. It has
little of traditional marketing and when it comes to viral, Seth Godin
would say: it is not remarkable in ordinary conversation and life. You
cannot make the remark safely in relation to your reputation.

Is it so ?

Kind regards
m.


&gt;<i> I aslo spent some time thinking, how to make your projects more
</I>&gt;<i> remarkable, but I do not know.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any idea ?
</I>
It'd be &quot;remarkable&quot; if it actually solved the collective
decisionmaking problem ;-)

IMHO the big problem here is not marketing, it's producing a product
that actually works. Once you have that, people *will* recognize it
and will use it without you having to spend a large amount of effort
or large sums of money marketing it. So I'd recommend studying the
problem, not the memes necessary to convince people to buy/use
something that doesn't really solve it.
  Regards,
    Scott
