<PRE>i agree with &quot;minimum hierarchy&quot;.

For now, all &quot;discussing &amp; voting, etc...&quot; tools and ideas have failed to
convince me.
There needs to be actions every single day and they shape reality while
others are busy discussing and voting around.
The FORCE that shapes reality every day is what people do every day, which
is WORK
WORK is directed by who pays and even though the government is spending
some &quot;tax money&quot;, the vast majority of money comes from
economic programs &quot;sponsored&quot; by loans given by private banks.

Spending money is VOTING on what people do every day and thus how they
shape REALITY.
This &quot;thing&quot; we call ECONOMY and it's already &quot;GRASS ROOTS&quot;, because
everyone is involved on a daily basis.

And YES, you can argue the economy and the way money works is not fair and
not everyone has the same voting power and a lot more can be said about
issues with that system, BUT,
despite that, it works already on a daily basis and it's grass roots in the
sense that everyone can participate all the time.

So if everyone was literate and would know programming, we could all
happiely discuss how we shape our money systems (using custom block chain
technology for replacing what we currently have - by building superior
systems and advertising their usage to people - which will vote with THEIR
MONEY and buy into a better alternative)

...but we don't.
I lost all hope discussing some fairytale stories of how i can delegate
votes or give some points on some proposals that might go to arbitrary
processes to reach some consensus and then nothing happens. Who will
implement? will we advertise those new methods to existing government,
which will then let go of their power and implement the new things... and
maybe in some decades or generations we vote maybe twice a year and on some
issues directly... which is still far from the &quot;GRASS ROOTS EVERY DAY
THING&quot; that we ALREADY have when looking at the real democracy, which is
the economy and &quot;voting with money&quot;. (For example - I'm from germany and we
don't even have the right to vote on issues on a country wide level - so
when greece had a &quot;referendum&quot; to vote for or against a certain policy -
this doesnt exist in germany. But check your calendar, it's 2015 already -
and still nothing)

*I'm sick of this waiting process. Power belongs to the people and it has
to be taken. You don't beg for something that is already yours.*
The way to go is to build superior alternatives that make the current
system obsolete by proofing that there is more efficiency and more wealth
for everyone.
If this is shown, people will join you happily and the ones under pressure
now will be the first ones to go with a superior alternative.


I guess my point of view is to radical for most people, but that's fine -
what can i do...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I believe this is the wrong approach to think about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are a lot of solutions out there - growing, already existing,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting out and improving.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some of them we might know about, some are unknown to us.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marketing/propaganda/memetics/... will not go away. one could even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; argue they are a feature of evolution, so complaining about it doesnt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lead nowhere.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tons of people out there in the open learn how to program and they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; JFDI (just fucking do it) and start to program something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Either you are &quot;the government&quot; or you have to realize that you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not and nothing can change that, so you have to learn how to use the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; methods available to everyone - which is basically &quot;viral
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; marketing&quot;/&quot;word of mouth&quot;/...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A lot of big open source projects exist and some of them are awesome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an gather a lot of traction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Many, probably the vast majority of open source developers are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; chronically poor. This is just how it goes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have never heard of &quot;Chomsk's mandatory syndicates&quot; and the name
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itself doesn't convince me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it cannot be described in one sentence or a small parapgrah that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boild down the main features to the main points, i don't feel like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; spending time digging into it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are and were to many promising approaches that made me read a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; lot of text in the past and nobody has time for that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So rather than compaining, I recommend trying to advertise it and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; even if it's just word of mouth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Basically you have to find USERS!!! You have to solve a problem for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people and try to make it more popular and scale it up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And YES, that means, you cannot start with replacing the president of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a country, but rather solve little problems on a large scale with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some nice app, where people really need it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once they figure out the tool is neat, they might start to brainstorm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about solving some more sophisticated problems with the same tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and invent more features.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GITHUB is the biggest platform in the open that is actually used, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only for code, but for all kinds of proposals and forms of governing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communities and prototyping those methods.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So I would recommend to give it a try, learn a lot about those and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then try to find the shortcomings and try to improve on those.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you manage to do that, then some people who are already familiar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with github and see the same shortcomings might follow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; this is a little bit older, but important...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; IMHO spread of information (marketing, propaganda, memetics, choose
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; your favorite ) is one of the problems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I would like to claim that we got partial solutions available. And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; partial is enough here, because there is no capacity to develop
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something final and final solution will probably never exist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; For example Chomsky's mandatory syndicates. It is partially solving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; concentration of capital as well as it diminishes corruption offers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; to authoritarians and it opens way for further development.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; So why is this not happening ? People *do not* recognize it. It has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; little of traditional marketing and when it comes to viral, Seth
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Godin would say: it is not remarkable in ordinary conversation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; life. You cannot make the remark safely in relation to your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; reputation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is it so ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Kind regards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; m.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; I aslo spent some time thinking, how to make your projects more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; remarkable, but I do not know.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have any idea ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; It'd be &quot;remarkable&quot; if it actually solved the collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; decisionmaking problem ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; IMHO the big problem here is not marketing, it's producing a product
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that actually works. Once you have that, people *will* recognize it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; and will use it without you having to spend a large amount of effort
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; or large sums of money marketing it. So I'd recommend studying the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; problem, not the memes necessary to convince people to buy/use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; something that doesn't really solve it.
