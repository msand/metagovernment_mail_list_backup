A &quot;Company&quot; or an &quot;NGO&quot; or a &quot;FOUNDATION&quot; or some of the crowdfunding
platforms like &quot;KICKSTARTER&quot; and the likes or *ANY KIND OF PROPOSAL*,
because that's what it is, can *(1. PROPOSE)* and in case enough votes
(=money) is gathered, *(2. EXECUTE)* the proposal by delivering on their
promise.


*What of those above would be the best &quot;proposal vehicle&quot;?*=&gt; That depends
on what should be accomplished.

*What is the best way to structure the &quot;proposal vehicle&quot;?*
=&gt; That depends on the voters and what they support (=demand).
Which starts with just marketing/media communication *(=what POLITICIANS DO
THESE DAYS)*
then goes on with realtime customer feedback with voting on proposals (e.g.
<A HREF="https://www.uservoice.com/">https://www.uservoice.com/</A>) (=what politicians do very rarely, when they do
a &quot;non-binding referendum)
continues with buying actual SHARES for those who want to make sure their
vote is counted in a certain proposal rather than switching and voting for
an alternative that sticks to their promise
and finishes with the option to start one's own proposal by becoming
&quot;entrepreneurial/activistic&quot; and create a PROPOSAL themselves (using any
kind of above listed &quot;proposal vehicles&quot;)

One thing that I would like to see in any response to this would be how
&quot;CURRENT&quot; (not some imaginable fairytale future, but our current reality)
solves these problems.
Is there anything that our current &quot;government systems&quot; with all their
election, proposal, execution, etc... processes do, that works better than
what I try to describe here?




&gt;<i> Which is what this
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list (and the metagovernment.org site) is for.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
sure :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Again, in case you actually want to *debate* the issue rather than just
</I>&gt;<i> repeatedly exposing yourself as another useless ideologue, please show how
</I>&gt;<i> a money-based system could be used to establish any of these policies:*
</I>


*One thing upfront:*
1. Some things are easy to enforce to social pressure or economic pressure
and in the vast majority of cases that solves the problem.
2. Some things are hard (e.g. in the media you hear about IS or ISIS in the
middle east), but they also exist now.
  - Maybe the reason that we have dysfunctional government and not what i'm
proposing is the root cause so they would not exist anymore
  - Maybe they exist, but &quot;media campaigns&quot;, &quot;economic-&quot; and/or &quot;social
pressure&quot; are enough to handle the situation

*Who is enforcing a rule put into the contract they call &quot;Constitution&quot;
today?*
=&gt; the government (which might be a good thing, because the constitution is
good), (which might be a bad thing, because the constitution in another
country is crap)

*TODAY: *We are born and &quot;auto-sign&quot; all the contracts that come with
&quot;citizenship&quot; of a certain country and you cannot easily switch, thus
removing the option to &quot;vote&quot; by switching from one to a different
contract/constitution/country BY FORCE (police/military/lawyers/judges).

*IN THE FUTURE:* Maybe a lot of problems cease to exist if that is
re-thought.

*A question remains:*
if all the above fails - who is enforcing a certain law (e.g. a rule in a
contract) - by force - if really necessary

I don't know the answer to that. In the future, the answer might be
obvious, but today it's hard to give an answer to that.
I believe, as experiences are made by people with different approaches
transitioning from the STATUS QUO to something that works better for most
people, answers might surface.
Until then, I do not believe that those general questions of government can
be changed any time soon and I do not believe there is a lot of sense
speculating about what would be better and how it would work - because it's
too hard to imagine with promising certainty.

*My general approach now is:*
Start with the obvious improvements and make it work for some people, then
scale it and face the problems that emerge then.
I have enough confidence that those problems can be managed - if not, then
let's have a *public system for enforcing contracts (like competing
constitutions) and spend all the power of thought to brainstorm how this
could look like - because people dont usually discuss this, but instead how
we vote - which does not seem to be the major problem, because it all
depends on the &quot;contract enforcement mechanisms&quot; or &quot;proposal execution
mechanism&quot;*




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Should abortion be legal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else


&gt;<i> 2) Should same-sex marriages be sanctioned by The State?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else


&gt;<i> 3) Which recreational drugs should be legal?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; same answer as above, but it might affect others in case it leads to
massive health problems
==&gt; 1. increase prices of health insurance for those abusing drugs
==&gt; 2. start &quot;initiative&quot; in collaboration with health care providers to
raise awareness and create programs for prevention
  (you might argue people will not do that, but then tell me how this is
different from &quot;governments might not do that&quot;)
  =&gt; in fact it makes economically sense to invest into prevention and
awareness programs and a lot of private initiatives/companies/... do so
  =&gt; in fact many governments ignore the problem of drug abuse, which might
sometimes border on supporting it

Summary: everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else +
people will organize against large scale drug abuse


&gt;<i> 4) Can my neighbor build a skyscraper on his lot and blot out the sun
</I>&gt;<i> that falls on mine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; Interesting question - I have some thoughts about it, but I think it
doesnt make sense to tell them now.
Instead:
How is this currently being solved?
I live in germany and I experienced a lot of times in my life, how some
&quot;public projects&quot; created new buildings, that made
the situation for a lot of people really really shitty. The ones i
personally experienced was:
=&gt; expanding the airport in &quot;Frankfurt am Main&quot; which made the southern
regions so loud, many people got into serious health problems and the value
of their living decreased a lot.

This is the reality everywhere - in germany strong laws exist that make
those things hard to happen, but they still do.
In the vast majority of countries, governments don't give a shit about it
and follow the money anyway.



*Imagine the following:*1. Government or Major (corrupted or not) decides
to allow a certain skyskraper/nuclear powerplant/airport/... to be build in
the immediate neighbourhood of several thousand people.
Once that becomes &quot;law&quot;, the police will use force to make it happen.
*OR*
2. Someone buys the land and wants to build something that would affect
thousands of people living there which can then pool all their resources to
make life hell for the person who wants to build.
- Maybe people in general are allowed to buy shares of anything surrounding
them all the time and can block certain decisions if they want to have
certain guarantees
- Maybe people just re-arrange all the &quot;supply routes&quot; to make it
economically un-feasible to do something
- Maybe they don't care and just move
- Maybe some people even like a certain project

What is the right strategy depends a lot on &quot;contract law&quot;, which for
example would be TRANSPARENT to everyone, because it would be &quot;BLOCKCHAIN
BASED&quot; (see projects like <A HREF="https://www.ethereum.org/">https://www.ethereum.org/</A> )

Sure, sometimes things can go wrong, but they already do - in what I
propose, people can learn and immediately learn and check all &quot;contracts&quot;
that exist on the &quot;Blockchain&quot; which would affect some decision you take
(e.g. buying a house in a certain location and move in with your family).
You can check and follow the feed of &quot;contracts&quot; and &quot;contract updates&quot;
surrounding &quot;your life&quot; :-) And discuss with the community surrounding your
life and create contracts with them to prevent certain scenarios to happen
that you would not like to see.



&gt;<i> 5) What building codes apply to that skyscraper such that it doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> fall on me, or injure its occupants?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It's all hard to imagine, but given the scenario I have in mind has
progressed a lot and is a mainstream thing, maybe i could imagine something
like:

1. Established &quot;Best Practices&quot; that are well known (like people know what
a 10 dollar bill is or how to shop in a supermarket) say:
=&gt; Whenever you move into a certain district, the first thing you should do
is read the contract of your house/flat/... you move in and connected to
that is buying a share of the property of the region, which states what can
be done and what cannot be done in that region.
(You probably have the guarantee to that most people in your region would
be on your side if something is not covered by the contract and extend it
once an unexpected scenario happens, because they are affected by the same
things)
*ADANTAGE* =&gt; No single person or small group can enact a law (because the
person or small group benefits or helps a particular interest groups like
politicians do it all the time), that would change something that puts a
minority into an uncomfortable position, because every minority (because
its in the mainstream of people) lives and forms certain contracts that
protect their way of living.


6) Can my neighbor breed pit-bulls?
&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; everyone decides for himself, because it's affecting nobody else
(if they forge a weapon that will harm others that's a different problem)


&gt;<i> 7) What is speed limit on my street, and what is the penalty for breaking
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
=&gt; See contract laws around roads
