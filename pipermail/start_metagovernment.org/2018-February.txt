Thank you a lot Steve,
as I see it now my explanation was too complicated, there are two terms
that may explain it all:

1. Sociology of happiness
2. Leverage points

I have a question for all. Please, are these two terms enough to understand
the concept? Please, does it say something to you? No, is an acceptable
answer :)

The old stuff about the leverage points ...

Actually,

there is more to tell, happiness is not everything. There are more indexes
to watch e.g. years of potential life lost, natural resources depletion,
global climate risk index and also animal protection index.

Very interesting.

https://www.democracy.earth

2.2 Voting.

The vote token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens, setting a common language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies, a range of voting transactions is permitted with votes:

? Direct Vote: Selfish voter Alice is allowed to use her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy. 

? Basic Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote on Alice's behalf.

? Tag Limited Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated votes can only be used on decisions with the #environment tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.

? Transitive Delegation: If Bob received votes from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract. Circular delegations (e.g. Alice receiving the tokens she sent Bob from Frank) are prohibited since the original allocation of votes from an organization to its members carries a signature indicating who is the sovereign owner of the votes.

? Overriding Vote: If Bob already used the delegated votes he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. Voters always have the final word on any given decision with their original votes.

? Public Vote: Often referred as the golden rule of liquid democracies, all delegators have the right to know how their delegate has voted on any given issue with their votes. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order to attract more delegations.

? Secret Vote: A method able to guarantee vote transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of public elections held within large populations that have a high risk of coercion. Even if perfect secrecy on vote transaction is achieved, users can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data. For this reason, research on integration with blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record is encouraged. This might include a mining fee to settle the vote transaction that can be either subsidized by the implementing organization or directly paid by voters. We recommend research and integration of secret votes with these blockchains: 

? Ethereum: uses precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128, for pairing checks, which permit zk- SNARKs, also see here, as implemented in the Byzantium hard fork.

? ZCash: implements shielded transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.

? Monero: uses ring signatures with stealth addresses. 


2.3 User Experience.

User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of a decentralized architecture and becomes even more important as the redundant layers of centralized architectures condense to the user. In a centralized internet architecture, the user does not own the interface or experience. In a decentralized internet architecture, the user interface (UI) should be based on the user's perspective. In this sense, transactions get done under three distinct views:

? Self: Using a public identity related to an individual.

? Organization: In representation of an organization that extended representation rights to individuals (e.g. workplace, club, political party, etc).

? Anonymous: Without any connection to a public identity.

This understanding of SELF / ORG / ANON shape-shifting requirement highly influenced our interface and token design. At any given time a Sovereign user can adopt any of these modes to interact with decentralized organizations.

Meh, it's just a rehash of the failed LiquidFB system. I've been
trying to explain to them exactly how LiquidFB failed and why their
system doesn't address any of the real problems in it (see the
"Issues" tab on https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper), but to no
avail. They're quite skilled at marketing (getting funding, getting
conference invites etc.) but unfortunately seem to be almost
completely clueless when it comes to any of the scientific or
engineering issues that they'd need to deal with to create something
capable of replacing our existing systems. That and they're just
incorrigible fanboys of blockchain. It's like arguing with religious
fanatics. They really have no good explanation of why blockchain
technology is even relevant to the problem of public policy
decisionmaking, but, again, it's all about the marketing with those
guys.

Right: They don't know how to provide this but just have some vague
feeling that it's necessary. Which of course, as I've provided lots of
*scientific* evidence for in the Matchism manifesto and the help
system for proxyfor.me, is simply not true.

Hi,

Some here on this list may be familiar with ParticipateDB, the online catalogue for digital engagement technology my consulting firm launched back in 2009. Last year, we spun it out under a new entity, the Center for Applied Community Engagement, LLC.

We are currently running the ParticipateDB 2018 Digital Engagement Census, a global practitioner survey to find out which tools and services people have been using in their community engagement and public participation work lately.

Here?s the launch announcement from February 9:
http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/09/welcome-to-the-participatedb-2018-digital-engagement-census/

Here?s yesterday?s update (we?ve extended the survey through February 26, plus a first glimpse at the results):
http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/18/participatedb-2018-digital-engagement-census-extended-through-february-26/

And here?s the census main page with the link to the online survey form:
http://www.participatedb.com/census

A lot of you are involved in developing or promoting new/interesting e-participation tools (for policy making, group decision making etc.).

Would be great if you could take part or share with others in your network who might have interesting stories/examples to report.

We are particularly interested in hearing from non-English speaking countries around the globe.

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks,
Tim

PS: If you want to find out if your tool is already listed, check the list of 350+ tools (we still would like to hear about recent project examples, though). Thanks!

Definitions first: Happiness as "affect balance" (Kahneman).
Impact factor positive or negative.

So if you would like where is the main trouble of this world you may like
to measure traffic and analyze electronic communication and try to predict
world happiness from it.

You may perhaps find that governments became slaves of some media and that
we are barking at the wrong wall.

Hi Tim and all,

thank you very much for your interesting e-mail and the links, in
particular the overview on the tools.

I would like to take this as an opportunity to write to this group right
away an e-mail I wanted to post anyway as it directly refers to your
initiative.

Over the past ca. 10 years, I have been a more or less silent observer here
and was involved in a few bilateral and multilateral initiatives with group
members.

We are starting a big initiative at the moment (described below and almost
identical in the attachement in case you want to forward it to others) to
create a new internet tool for global debate, voting and elections.

The participation of metagovernment list members would be very much
appreciated and I am looking forward to hearing from old a new potential
partners.

Best regards,

Rasmus Tenbergen

Project Brief 01/2018



*An Internet Tool for Global Debate, Voting and Elections (GDVE-it) *



The World Parliament Experiment (WPE) and Democracy Without Borders (DWB)
are pleased to announce that they will be collaborating on the development
and promotion of an Internet Tool for Global Debate, Voting and Elections
(GDVE-it) and that they are seeking additional partners to imple-ment this
project.

GDVE-it is a practical bottom-up approach to promoting global democracy.
The internet platform will allow for a biometric registration as a world
citizen and the allocation of a unique world citizen?s ID. GDVE-it will be
a scalable and flexible platform ready to be used for different purposes.



*Initial subjects *

In a first step, registered world citizens will be able to vote on
resolutions considered at the UN Security Council. Making these resolutions
the subject of public voting is viewed as a symbolic counterbalance to the
unrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the UN?s most important body.
The goal is to achieve large public participation and to help build popular
momentum for a reform of the UN and to promote global democracy in general.
Other purposes of the platform may include to allow registered users to
endorse symbolic World Citizen Initiatives.



*Technical development and operation *

In close consultation with the project?s partners, WPE will be responsible
for the technical development and operation of GDVE-it as the successor of
an internet tool having been implemented in the year 2000. This ?old? World
Parliament Experiment internet tool included functionalities and features
relevant to GDVE-it but needs a thorough technical upgrade. Also, some
important features will need to be added, e.g. for secure personal
identification. All functions and logical conjunctions will be rethought
and, where necessary, improved.



*Political advocacy and promotion *

DWB?s role will be to help coordinate all non-technical aspects of the
project. In particular, this concerns the creation and coordination of an
international network of experts and project partners as well as political
advocacy and public outreach. Generally, DWB supports GDVE-it as a sandbox
that allows to explore the feasibility and dynamics of global participation
and elections.



*About WPE and DWB *

WPE is a non-profit organization dedicated to making the idea of a
democratically elected parliament and other forms of global democracy
palpable: by events, campaigns and tools. DWB supports an even more
holistic approach to democracy promotion with a focus on global democracy.
One of its goals is the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly as a
step towards a world parliament.



*The GDVE-it Network *

At present, WPE and DWB are building an informal network of experts and
institutions to support the development of GDVE-it. Membership is not tied
to formal responsibilities. Network members will

? receive frequent updates on the progress of the project and invitations
to project meetings and conferences,

? be invited to contribute ideas, concepts or code,

? be asked for their opinion and advice,

? support the project as they see fit ? e.g. by research, articles,
statements, and networking.



*To build an excellent GDVE-it we need to bundle the global competencies in
this field. *

*You are kindly invited to become a member of the GDVE-it network (Google
Group: https://goo.gl/rnHh6n <https://goo.gl/rnHh6n>)!*

Message-ID: <CAEyrqBoHufGtSp0TESHmMwAxAJVqo0nwBe4Wsd7tEVGjbJqN7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

you may not believe it, but you may improve your happiness even in long
term (see e.g. Martin Seligman
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman>, Ed Diener
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Diener> and Ruut Veenhoven
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruut_Veenhoven>)

And you may also design a search engine (like google) that will provide you
with result that are likely to make people in society happy.
It may be not obvious, that if you try to make people happy you make it
also on the level of society.

But that is not all, you may even design an app for smartphones that will
occasionally ask you how happy you are to see how it the engine working.
You may also need some more analytical questions and research to improve
the search engine, but the important is - it is possible.

When it comes to implementation, I will try to persuade some people behind
some existing search engine to start one more engine and give it a try.

What do you say?

Thank you a lot Steve,
as I see it now my explanation was too complicated, there are two terms
that may explain it all:

1. Sociology of happiness
2. Leverage points

I have a question for all. Please, are these two terms enough to understand
the concept? Please, does it say something to you? No, is an acceptable
answer :)

The old stuff about the leverage points ...

Actually,

there is more to tell, happiness is not everything. There are more indexes
to watch e.g. years of potential life lost, natural resources depletion,
global climate risk index and also animal protection index.

Very interesting.

2.2 Voting.

The vote token aims to be a standard for digital democracy able to interoperate with other tokens, setting a common language for the governance of blockchain based organizations. Within the context of liquid democracies, a range of voting transactions is permitted with votes:

? Direct Vote: Selfish voter Alice is allowed to use her tokens to vote directly on issues as in a direct democracy. 

? Basic Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Bob. As long as Bob has access to those tokens he can use them to vote on Alice's behalf.

? Tag Limited Delegation: Alice may delegate votes to Charlie under the specified condition that he can only use these tokens on issues carrying a specific tag. If the delegation specifies that delegated votes can only be used on decisions with the #environment tag, then Charlie won't be able to use these anywhere else but on those specific issues. This leads to a representation model not based on territory but on knowledge.

? Transitive Delegation: If Bob received votes from Alice, he can then delegate these to Frank. This generates a chain of delegations that helps empower specific players within a community. If Alice does not desire to have third parties receiving the votes she delegated to Bob, she can turn off the transitive setting on the delegation contract. Circular delegations (e.g. Alice receiving the tokens she sent Bob from Frank) are prohibited since the original allocation of votes from an organization to its members carries a signature indicating who is the sovereign owner of the votes.

? Overriding Vote: If Bob already used the delegated votes he received from Alice but she has a different opinion on a given issue, as the sovereign owner of her votes Alice can always override Bob's decision. Voters always have the final word on any given decision with their original votes.

? Public Vote: Often referred as the golden rule of liquid democracies, all delegators have the right to know how their delegate has voted on any given issue with their votes. In the same way congressmen votes are public, on liquid democracies competing delegates on any given tag have an incentive to build a public reputation based on their voting record in order to attract more delegations.

? Secret Vote: A method able to guarantee vote transactions untraceable to the voter. This is indispensable in contexts of public elections held within large populations that have a high risk of coercion. Even if perfect secrecy on vote transaction is achieved, users can still be fingerprinted with exposed meta-data. For this reason, research on integration with blockchains designed for anonymous transactions with a proven track record is encouraged. This might include a mining fee to settle the vote transaction that can be either subsidized by the implementing organization or directly paid by voters. We recommend research and integration of secret votes with these blockchains: 

? Ethereum: uses precompiled contracts for addition and scalar multiplication on the elliptic curve alt_bn128, for pairing checks, which permit zk- SNARKs, also see here, as implemented in the Byzantium hard fork.

? ZCash: implements shielded transactions using zero-knowledge proofs.

? Monero: uses ring signatures with stealth addresses. 


2.3 User Experience.

User Experience (UX) is a critical aspect of a decentralized architecture and becomes even more important as the redundant layers of centralized architectures condense to the user. In a centralized internet architecture, the user does not own the interface or experience. In a decentralized internet architecture, the user interface (UI) should be based on the user's perspective. In this sense, transactions get done under three distinct views:

? Self: Using a public identity related to an individual.

? Organization: In representation of an organization that extended representation rights to individuals (e.g. workplace, club, political party, etc).

? Anonymous: Without any connection to a public identity.

This understanding of SELF / ORG / ANON shape-shifting requirement highly influenced our interface and token design. At any given time a Sovereign user can adopt any of these modes to interact with decentralized organizations.

Meh, it's just a rehash of the failed LiquidFB system. I've been
trying to explain to them exactly how LiquidFB failed and why their
system doesn't address any of the real problems in it (see the
"Issues" tab on https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper), but to no
avail. They're quite skilled at marketing (getting funding, getting
conference invites etc.) but unfortunately seem to be almost
completely clueless when it comes to any of the scientific or
engineering issues that they'd need to deal with to create something
capable of replacing our existing systems. That and they're just
incorrigible fanboys of blockchain. It's like arguing with religious
fanatics. They really have no good explanation of why blockchain
technology is even relevant to the problem of public policy
decisionmaking, but, again, it's all about the marketing with those
guys.

Hi,

Some here on this list may be familiar with ParticipateDB, the online catalogue for digital engagement technology my consulting firm launched back in 2009. Last year, we spun it out under a new entity, the Center for Applied Community Engagement, LLC.

We are currently running the ParticipateDB 2018 Digital Engagement Census, a global practitioner survey to find out which tools and services people have been using in their community engagement and public participation work lately.

Here?s the launch announcement from February 9:
http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/09/welcome-to-the-participatedb-2018-digital-engagement-census/

Here?s yesterday?s update (we?ve extended the survey through February 26, plus a first glimpse at the results):
http://blog.participatedb.com/2018/02/18/participatedb-2018-digital-engagement-census-extended-through-february-26/

And here?s the census main page with the link to the online survey form:
http://www.participatedb.com/census

A lot of you are involved in developing or promoting new/interesting e-participation tools (for policy making, group decision making etc.).

Would be great if you could take part or share with others in your network who might have interesting stories/examples to report.

We are particularly interested in hearing from non-English speaking countries around the globe.

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks,
Tim

PS: If you want to find out if your tool is already listed, check the list of 350+ tools (we still would like to hear about recent project examples, though). Thanks!

Definitions first: Happiness as "affect balance" (Kahneman).
Impact factor positive or negative.

So if you would like where is the main trouble of this world you may like
to measure traffic and analyze electronic communication and try to predict
world happiness from it.

You may perhaps find that governments became slaves of some media and that
we are barking at the wrong wall.

Hi Tim and all,

thank you very much for your interesting e-mail and the links, in
particular the overview on the tools.

I would like to take this as an opportunity to write to this group right
away an e-mail I wanted to post anyway as it directly refers to your
initiative.

Over the past ca. 10 years, I have been a more or less silent observer here
and was involved in a few bilateral and multilateral initiatives with group
members.

We are starting a big initiative at the moment (described below and almost
identical in the attachement in case you want to forward it to others) to
create a new internet tool for global debate, voting and elections.

The participation of metagovernment list members would be very much
appreciated and I am looking forward to hearing from old a new potential
partners.

Best regards,

Rasmus Tenbergen

and promotion of an Internet Tool for Global Debate, Voting and Elections
(GDVE-it) and that they are seeking additional partners to imple-ment this
project.

GDVE-it is a practical bottom-up approach to promoting global democracy.
The internet platform will allow for a biometric registration as a world
citizen and the allocation of a unique world citizen?s ID. GDVE-it will be
a scalable and flexible platform ready to be used for different purposes.



*Initial subjects *

In a first step, registered world citizens will be able to vote on
resolutions considered at the UN Security Council. Making these resolutions
the subject of public voting is viewed as a symbolic counterbalance to the
unrepresentative and undemocratic nature of the UN?s most important body.
The goal is to achieve large public participation and to help build popular
momentum for a reform of the UN and to promote global democracy in general.
Other purposes of the platform may include to allow registered users to
endorse symbolic World Citizen Initiatives.



*Technical development and operation *

In close consultation with the project?s partners, WPE will be responsible
for the technical development and operation of GDVE-it as the successor of
an internet tool having been implemented in the year 2000. This ?old? World
Parliament Experiment internet tool included functionalities and features
relevant to GDVE-it but needs a thorough technical upgrade. Also, some
important features will need to be added, e.g. for secure personal
identification. All functions and logical conjunctions will be rethought
and, where necessary, improved.



*Political advocacy and promotion *

DWB?s role will be to help coordinate all non-technical aspects of the
project. In particular, this concerns the creation and coordination of an
international network of experts and project partners as well as political
advocacy and public outreach. Generally, DWB supports GDVE-it as a sandbox
that allows to explore the feasibility and dynamics of global participation
and elections.



*About WPE and DWB *

WPE is a non-profit organization dedicated to making the idea of a
democratically elected parliament and other forms of global democracy
palpable: by events, campaigns and tools. DWB supports an even more
holistic approach to democracy promotion with a focus on global democracy.
One of its goals is the establishment of a UN Parliamentary Assembly as a
step towards a world parliament.



*The GDVE-it Network *

At present, WPE and DWB are building an informal network of experts and
institutions to support the development of GDVE-it. Membership is not tied
to formal responsibilities. Network members will

? receive frequent updates on the progress of the project and invitations
to project meetings and conferences,

? be invited to contribute ideas, concepts or code,

? be asked for their opinion and advice,

? support the project as they see fit ? e.g. by research, articles,
statements, and networking.



*To build an excellent GDVE-it we need to bundle the global competencies in
this field. *

*You are kindly invited to become a member of the GDVE-it network (Google

Hi,

you may not believe it, but you may improve your happiness even in long
term (see e.g. Martin Seligman
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Seligman>, Ed Diener
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Diener> and Ruut Veenhoven
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruut_Veenhoven>)

And you may also design a search engine (like google) that will provide you
with result that are likely to make people in society happy.
It may be not obvious, that if you try to make people happy you make it
also on the level of society.

But that is not all, you may even design an app for smartphones that will
occasionally ask you how happy you are to see how it the engine working.
You may also need some more analytical questions and research to improve
the search engine, but the important is - it is possible.

When it comes to implementation, I will try to persuade some people behind
some existing search engine to start one more engine and give it a try.

What do you say?
