<PRE>Hi,

I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:

&#160;On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning 
relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed 
scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to 
their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page
 rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as
 is evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, 
many scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep 
details of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve 
this issue?

Thank you,
s
