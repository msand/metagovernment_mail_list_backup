<PRE>Hi,

We do a huge amount of work with large scale, multi-stakeholder strategies,
especially in the public sector (see
<A HREF="http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781472427816">http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781472427816</A> for details on my book
'Validating Strategies' which will be published in the UK in March.

Strategies invariable produce many, often competing options - so some sort
of 'prioritisation' or 'Validation' of the strategies is required.

We recommend a 3 step process:

1 - voting - in which people get to vote which option is most attractive to
them.  In reality, the consequence of voting is that the least controversial
ideas (not necessarily the best or most important ideas) win the vote.
2 - clustering - stakeholders cluster around those ideas that are most
important to them, so that if enough stakeholders support a given idea then
maybe they can get on with it even if the rest of the community doesn't want
to support it
3 - clumping - in which those ideas which don't have enough support may be
able to attract support by clumping together with other ideas, editing all
ideas in the process, until such time as a new concept emerges which either
rises to the top of the voting or which attracts a big enough cluster of
people so that it will happen.

Another key principle is to ask people what they are prepared to actually
DO, and DON'T ask them what they WANT.  This may sound like a trivial
distinction but it is utterly profound. In a city redevelopment, if you ask
people what they 'want' in order to minimise congestion on the roads, many
will say they want more cycleways.  If you ask them what they intend to
'do', many will sheepishly admit that they want to drive their cars to work
because there will be less congestion because other people are using the
cycleways.  So in all our strategies, our overwhelming focus is on
understanding what people (end-users) want to DO, not what they WANT.

Cheers

Phil

Hi Ed,

Sorry to intervene, but isn't it a fact of life that most people are not
interested even in reading other people's proposals on how to fix problems
1)-5), let alone making their own proposals?

Hi, Jacopo.

I admit I still don?t fully understand Airesis, but my impression so far is
that it may emphasize voting a bit too much. Please correct me in whatever
way I am misapprehending.

Government and governing bodies outside of government make a vast array of
decisions that affect out life. It can decide questions like:
	* Should we build a swimming pool in this city park?
	* Should we send troops to country X to intervene in a massacre?
	* Should we ban texting while driving?
	* Should we have schools teach a particular new curriculum?
	* Should we raise the tax on tobacco?
Those are just random examples. The array of decisions is seemingly
infinite. And you can easily be a stakeholder in ever single one of those.
But you cannot reasonably vote on all of those decisions with a fully
informed opinion. It is impossible.

And I agree that delegation is not the answer. I think the real problem and
the real answer here is that we are asking the wrong questions. All of the
above are yes/no questions. They assume that there can only be two choices,
and they invite ignorant participation (anyone can say yes or no to those
for any number of reasons).

Instead, those above questions could be stated as:
	* How can we affordably make this park serve the community better?
	* How can we effectively intervene in the massacre in country X?
	* How can we address safety issues with texting while driving?
	* How can we best teach our children?
	* How can we help discourage people from smoking?
For each of those questions, it is not a matter of voting yes or no, but of
building solutions that can get everyone to vote for them. The process may
be much longer, but the result would be orders-of-magnitude better.?

Isn?t that a much stronger, more workable, more persistent form of
democracy? One that builds solutions for everyone?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not exclude delegation is proven from the experience of the pirate

&gt;<i>Participation mean effort and effort mean time and energy. In today world
</I>we do have little time to spare (at least in Italy) because we are busy
surviving. Now it does not imply that every one should participate in
proposal making but it should be on the final decision making. If you are
not willing to even know what is decided it mean that you deserve to live
the consequences of your absence. My and ?the Airesis development team idea
is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the
stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
&gt;<i>Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and this
</I>is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
&gt;<i>In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include
</I>participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be
modified and developed as we learn from experience and different
methodology) ?I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought
up.
&gt;<i>When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the
</I>participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you
don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not
be in the agenda!
&gt;<i>If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a
</I>choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent
that (easy to do)?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Efficiency:
</I>&gt;<i>There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy
</I>(Airesis Team) is to?analyze?each problem and then brake it down in to
smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
&gt;<i>So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;<i>Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in?synthesis
</I>by the participants in the debate.
&gt;<i>The second strategy is to use different voting system for different
</I>solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway
or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For
that we will choose the?mathematical formula that show to give the best
result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm? and so forth. The
participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is?fundamentally?a
</I>right but we live in a delegated democracy, the fundamental question is: is
functioning? My answer is NO!?
&gt;<i>So, the rules of the game are set, we work to see if there is a way of
</I>making them better.
&gt;<i>I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot be
</I>present during the vote.
&gt;<i>If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a
</I>rarity.
&gt;<i>If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for each

</I>&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote
</I>discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if
and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote
delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see
what you think:
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of
</I>effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is
not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are
smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to
have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted
subversive effort.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>consultation,
</I> more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only better for a
problem under consideration, in isolation from all other problems. Extra
effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to other problems. And
the output of solving this problem is not a linear function of the input
effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns. People are rational agents
constrained by bounded resorcses. They always prioritize and ration their
efforts. And this is the reason why most people will not participate
directly in political decision making, and reasonably so. (I have in mind
problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>delegate their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>It can also be technically difficult or impossible
</I> if people are to participate via internet. People can always automate their
voting using bots, for example, thus circumventing your restrictions.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation.
</I>But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering
posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see
what other people may say.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system
</I>mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score
is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked
your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is
vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating
each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they
are willing to invest effort.
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should
</I>have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think
that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will
necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people
should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to
different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of
issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the
</I>best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their
governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion
about it. Why is this so?

system users can score other users with weights proportional to their own

susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as  is evident
from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many
scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details of
their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
