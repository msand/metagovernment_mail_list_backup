<PRE>Hi, Jacopo.

I admit I still don&#8217;t fully understand Airesis, but my impression so far is that it may emphasize voting a bit too much. Please correct me in whatever way I am misapprehending.

Government and governing bodies outside of government make a vast array of decisions that affect out life. It can decide questions like:
Should we build a swimming pool in this city park?
Should we send troops to country X to intervene in a massacre?
Should we ban texting while driving?
Should we have schools teach a particular new curriculum?
Should we raise the tax on tobacco?
Those are just random examples. The array of decisions is seemingly infinite. And you can easily be a stakeholder in ever single one of those. But you cannot reasonably vote on all of those decisions with a fully informed opinion. It is impossible.

And I agree that delegation is not the answer. I think the real problem and the real answer here is that we are asking the wrong questions. All of the above are yes/no questions. They assume that there can only be two choices, and they invite ignorant participation (anyone can say yes or no to those for any number of reasons).

Instead, those above questions could be stated as:
How can we affordably make this park serve the community better?
How can we effectively intervene in the massacre in country X?
How can we address safety issues with texting while driving?
How can we best teach our children?
How can we help discourage people from smoking?
For each of those questions, it is not a matter of voting yes or no, but of building solutions that can get everyone to vote for them. The process may be much longer, but the result would be orders-of-magnitude better. 

Isn&#8217;t that a much stronger, more workable, more persistent form of democracy? One that builds solutions for everyone?

&gt;<i> Hi S
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not exclude delegation is proven from the experience of the pirate party in Germany that use LQFB that the function created less participation.
</I>&gt;<i> Participation mean effort and effort mean time and energy. In today world we do have little time to spare (at least in Italy) because we are busy surviving. Now it does not imply that every one should participate in proposal making but it should be on the final decision making. If you are not willing to even know what is decided it mean that you deserve to live the consequences of your absence. My and  the Airesis development team idea is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;<i> In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be modified and developed as we learn from experience and different methodology)  I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought up.
</I>&gt;<i> When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not be in the agenda!
</I>&gt;<i> If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent that (easy to do) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency:
</I>&gt;<i> There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy (Airesis Team) is to analyze each problem and then brake it down in to smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;<i> So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in synthesis by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;<i> The second strategy is to use different voting system for different solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For that we will choose the mathematical formula that show to give the best result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm  and so forth. The participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is fundamentally a right but we live in a delegated democracy, the fundamental question is: is functioning? My answer is NO! 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the rules of the game are set, we work to see if there is a way of making them better.
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot be present during the vote.
</I>&gt;<i> If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a rarity.
</I>&gt;<i> If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for each sub-prolem rather than vote a single bill with hundred decision in it. Civic education should become obligatory. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Need to go to work
</I>&gt;<i> Bye
</I>&gt;<i> j
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please test Airesis.us and give us your critics. I believe is better to work pragmatically on the development of a platform and see it in action, analyze  statistical data and from poor experiences learn and modify the platform, rather than making hypothesis.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see what you think:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted subversive effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns. People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example, thus circumventing your restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation. But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see what other people may say.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your attention,

</I>&gt;<i> I agree on the first part of your email about the vulnerability of the scoring system.
</I>&gt;<i> The effort necessary should be greater than the value of the range achieved!
</I>&gt;<i> And if spotted the whole group be so devaluated that they loose their grade for ever!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I disagree on vote delegation, sooner or later it will create disaffection like the current system.
</I>&gt;<i> If implemented anyway it should be with a value &gt;1 for each delegated vote and eventually the value should be reduced as bigger is the amount of vote one single representative get.
</I>&gt;<i> Something like

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;<i> Dear user S
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if I understand correctly your question but I think the answer relies in the fact that each user vote ONE time.
</I>&gt;<i> therefore a good E-Democracy platform should have a strong certification of users.

</I>&gt;<i> If your question is about some sort of Karma to apply to the users, i believe the best way is statistical information of the activity, in Airesis.eu, for example, we start to collect data about users participation based on the vote they receive in the contributions that are posted in the different proposals.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
