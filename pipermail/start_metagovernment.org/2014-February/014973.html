<PRE>I will be happy to test Airesis&#160; service via some metagovernment group, but it will be appropriate if a more established member of the list creates the group (I am completely new to the list and my ideas are not 100% aligned with its core). But I think, since the service emphasizes collaborative deliberation and consensus finding, it is really suitable for the list members. And the effort seems generally good for the cause of DD. Just let me know when the group is created.

Hi to all
Basically the system is up steadily from Feb 2013 I join the dev group in Jan 2013 and I took the responsibility for the internationalization, We publish the English version 4 month ago and I did not much dissemination because I was coordinating the translators for the other 9 languages.
We did not divided the proposals by languages and by localization, because the platform is not yet used widely &#160;but as soon as there will be groups from other nation being created we will add in the search page the different custom search features. And we will divide the proposal by different mean, language, localization &#160;and other filter.&#160;

You guys are seeing something new and you are the pioneer in using the platform.

My suggestion is to create a metagovernment group invite the member of the ML to try it there, please be aware that the creator of the group will have administrative rights and he will be able to create roles and give each role different permits.
Most group that are created in Airesis they usually need to create group rules, i believe that as I am&#160;speaking to educated people here, that want to test the platform, will be OK to give administrative right to every one&#160; entering the metagovernment group with the basic rule to don't change the administrative credential.
I suggest to try different login for example create yourname then yourname1 and yourname2.
yourname will have administrative right but yourname1 will have a different role and will have different rights (must create different roles first in the administative panel)
If you have a group of ten people it will be a good try to start a simple proposal and seeit in action.
Every single user have a blog and we recently added forums where discussion will be stored, we even place a calendar feature to organize events and set the vote day for each group.
There is a strong notification feature that can be personalized in your personal setting.

Salut
jacopo

</I>&gt;<i>Hi Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I tried &quot;Try it&quot; session at www.airesis.eu. It looks interesting, I am glad to see that people are actively participating, creating hundreds of groups, debating and voting. Unfortunately all (or most) of it is in Italian, so I could not get a good feel of the deliberation process. May be a short guide in English (if it is not already there, but I did not notice it) would help to bring more international users?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thanks for mentioning the liquid feedback system. I am new to many of these concepts. Provided such system is flexible enough (to allow well customizable vote delegation), this is something I had in mind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>By participation I meant number of votes in support of a
</I> particular issue. For a DD party to succeed, it is important to involve as many people as
 possible. (I do not equate participation to the combined amount of energy spent on solving a problem).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I actually think that a real (direct) participation in form of voting alone will have huge impact on political life. Current &quot;representative&quot; democracies are doing very poor job representing people. Internet and computers present opportunity to fix it.

</I>&gt;<i>Hi S

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I do not exclude delegation is proven from the experience of the pirate party in Germany that use LQFB that the function created less participation.
</I>&gt;<i>Participation mean effort and effort mean time and energy. In today world we do have little time to spare (at least in Italy) because we are busy surviving. Now it does not imply that every one should participate in proposal making but it should be on the final decision making. If you are not willing to even know what is decided it mean that you deserve to live the consequences of your absence. My and &#160;the Airesis development team idea is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;<i>Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;<i>In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be modified and developed as we learn from experience and different methodology) &#160;I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought up.
</I>&gt;<i>When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not be in the agenda!
</I>&gt;<i>If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent that (easy to do)&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Efficiency:
</I>&gt;<i>There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy (Airesis Team) is to&#160;analyze&#160;each problem and then brake it down in to smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;<i>So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;<i>Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in&#160;synthesis by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;<i>The second strategy is to use different voting system for different solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For that we will choose the&#160;mathematical formula that show to give the best result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm&#160; and so forth. The participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is&#160;fundamentally&#160;a right but we live in a delegated democracy, the fundamental question is: is functioning? My answer is NO!&#160;
</I>&gt;<i>So, the rules of the game are set, we work to see if there is a way of making them better.
</I>&gt;<i>I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot be present during the vote.
</I>&gt;<i>If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a rarity.
</I>&gt;<i>If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for each sub-prolem rather than vote a single bill with hundred decision in it. Civic education should become obligatory.&#160;

</I>&gt;<i>Please test Airesis.us and give us your critics. I believe is better to work pragmatically on the development of a platform and see it in action, analyze &#160;statistical data and from poor experiences learn and modify the platform, rather than making&#160;hypothesis.&#160;&#160;

</I>&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see what you think:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted subversive effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more consultation,
</I> more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns. People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also be technically difficult or impossible
</I> if people are to participate via internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example, thus circumventing your restrictions.
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation. But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see what other people may say.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Thank you for your attention,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I agree on the first part of your email about the vulnerability of the scoring system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>The effort necessary should be greater than the value of the range achieved!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>And if spotted the whole group be so devaluated that they loose their grade for ever!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I disagree on vote delegation, sooner or later it will create disaffection like the current system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>If implemented anyway it should be with a value &gt;1 for each delegated vote and eventually the value should be reduced as bigger is the amount of vote one single representative get.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I don't know if I understand correctly your question but I think the answer relies in the fact that each user vote ONE time.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning 
</I>relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed 
scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to 
their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page
 rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as
 is evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, 
many scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep 
details of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve 
this issue?
