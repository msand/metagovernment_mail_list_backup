I'm not sure I get the point of your question; but I think the most critical aspect of this group is some degree of open-mindedness. That is a sort of necessary condition for achieving consensus-through-synthesis. (Though that then makes me consider if we're a good test group for our own dogfood... we as a group are fairly open-minded, so compared to the norm, we may be to willing to see others' point of view. The real acid test of our systems will be when we enter arenas where people are entrenched in seemingly uncompromising positions, such as the abortion debate.)

</I>
My goal would be to foster communication. Discussing in the context of an email list server presents difficulties in:

1. following a thread, especially as it branches.
2. knowing where to jump into an ongoing conversation.
3. understanding the history of a conversation
4. reading massive amounts of text; often poorly/diversely formatted

Numbers 1-3 are all closely related. Number 4 is a deep issue that gets overlooked a lot, perhaps because it is so difficult to address.
