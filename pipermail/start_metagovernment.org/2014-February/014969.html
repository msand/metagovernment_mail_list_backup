<PRE>Hi Paul,

Good post. I think to make those people involved something like the following should be offered:

we will make your vote counted the same way your favorite party A votes, OR
if one some issues you agree better with a party B, on those issues we will count your vote that way, OR
if yet there are issues no party represents you well we will count your vote directly, OR
we will only count your direct votes if you wish, OR
we will give you an opportunity to draft your own law in collaboration with other people, if you wish,

etc,etc, from least effort to most, not the other way around. Basically people should be given opportunity to delegate their votes in a very flexible way, sometime taking direct initiative on issues that they dim important.

Hi all, 
&#160;
I am following those Direct Democratic experiments. The first one that
succeeded to win a seat (they still have) was Demoex in a small town in Sweden.
I think that it is only directed to what we call &#8220;early adapters&#8221; and that is
always a small number of people. Most citizens are very conservative with
politics.
When you say that you are starting up a new political party and that you
take part in the elections the reaction is : Citizen:&#160; oh fine , I vote for
you, what is your program. Respons: we don&#8217;t have onen you have to decide for
yourself. Citizen: oh, sorry, I am not interested in politics and I don&#8217;t have
time to get involved. 
But most of them are still active. (Sol Australia has a chanche in the next
elections I think)

Hi
Ed,

Thank you for your response. I do like the idea of injected DD, or
what you call mixdemocracy. And I think that, if implemented right, it is indeed
the easiest path. Many other people find similar ideas appealing, to the extent
that there are serious attempts to implement them. Take, for example, the online
party of Canada. It has been officially registered since 2010. But as far as I
can judge its popularity is not growing that fast, if at all. The important
question to me is why? I would be very interested in hearing your
opinion.

Thanks.

Hi. It looks as if that FAQ is long-neglected. The scoring system
referenced there was my now-obsolete idea of weighted-voting, where the more
trusted/active/respected someone is, the more weight their vote gets. It&#8217;s
detailed here: 
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#User_scoring">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#User_scoring</A>
but the idea was pretty much abandoned in favor of a consensus model of
voting and a more organic community structure than I had originally
envisioned.
&#160;
As for the best/easiest/fastest path to DD,&#160; I&#8217;d say it can&#8217;t be all
three of those things. There&#8217;s an old saying in I.T.: &#8220;Cheap, fast, good: you
can have up to two.&#8221;
&#160;
The fastest way to DD is the referendum movement, such as Americans have in
California. I think it&#8217;s horrible. It represents a few huge, hot-button issues,
which require massive funding to get on the ballot. They are usually bad
decisions, and often result in unfunded mandates. But technically, it&#8217;s direct
democracy, and it&#8217;s happening now. 
&#160;
Perhaps the easiest path is &#8220;mixdemocracy&#8221; where political parties form to
get politicians into power who are sworn to act at the behest of a website or
other open input system. This is the goal of the E2D movement. I find a lot of
problems with it myself (I&#8217;ve considered doing it here in the U.S., but just
couldn&#8217;t get on board with some of the deep issues it has). It&#8217;s very difficult
to paste direct democracy onto a democratic republic. In current systems,
politicians vote frequently. They may vote hundreds of times on one bill, voting
up and down amendments and staying resolutions and so forth. There is no easy
way to adapt that to a web-input system. Plus representatives serve on
committees, which are tremendously un-democratic and are less about voting than
about deliberation. And there&#8217;s still no system for people to work on the
wording of bills; only to say that they want to vote up/down on one particular
one. And thus there is no real consensus-building. Is it really preferable for a
representative to vote &#8220;yes&#8221; on a bill because 51 percent of her constituents
said so?
&#160;
The best way is what we&#8217;re doing, of course. :) The goal here, as I see it,
is to make systems where any community of any size can come to a consensus 
decision. That&#8217;s it. We then release that system(s) to presumably-small
communities and let them recognize the power of a consensus system. They will be
making strong, sophisticated, well-thought-out decisions; unlike communities run
by more primitive forms of governance. As people start to see the strength and
power of these systems, they will scale them up to larger and more diverse 
communities, until they start taking over the functions currently managed by
government.
&#160;
That in my mind is the only truly workable path to direct democracy.
Everything else is highly fallible, highly unstable, and just not tenable within
the framework of society today.

Dear Jacopo,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they are willing to invest  effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;<i>Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>I am interested in direct democracy and I have
</I>    some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised
    several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question
    on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:
&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>On the FAQ page it is
</I>    suggested that the Metagovernment functioning relies upon, among other 
    things, the scoring system. In the proposed scoring system users can score
    other users with weights proportional to their own score. This is
    reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page rank it is susceptible to
    abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is evident from Google's 
    ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many scoring/recommending 
    web-services explicitly state that they keep details of their systems
    secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
