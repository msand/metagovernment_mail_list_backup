<PRE>Hi. It looks as if that FAQ is long-neglected. The scoring system referenced there was my now-obsolete idea of weighted-voting, where the more trusted/active/respected someone is, the more weight their vote gets. It&#8217;s detailed here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#User_scoring">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#User_scoring</A>
but the idea was pretty much abandoned in favor of a consensus model of voting and a more organic community structure than I had originally envisioned.

As for the best/easiest/fastest path to DD,  I&#8217;d say it can&#8217;t be all three of those things. There&#8217;s an old saying in I.T.: &#8220;Cheap, fast, good: you can have up to two.&#8221;

The fastest way to DD is the referendum movement, such as Americans have in California. I think it&#8217;s horrible. It represents a few huge, hot-button issues, which require massive funding to get on the ballot. They are usually bad decisions, and often result in unfunded mandates. But technically, it&#8217;s direct democracy, and it&#8217;s happening now. 

Perhaps the easiest path is &#8220;mixdemocracy&#8221; where political parties form to get politicians into power who are sworn to act at the behest of a website or other open input system. This is the goal of the E2D movement. I find a lot of problems with it myself (I&#8217;ve considered doing it here in the U.S., but just couldn&#8217;t get on board with some of the deep issues it has). It&#8217;s very difficult to paste direct democracy onto a democratic republic. In current systems, politicians vote frequently. They may vote hundreds of times on one bill, voting up and down amendments and staying resolutions and so forth. There is no easy way to adapt that to a web-input system. Plus representatives serve on committees, which are tremendously un-democratic and are less about voting than about deliberation. And there&#8217;s still no system for people to work on the wording of bills; only to say that they want to vote up/down on one particular one. And thus there is no real consensus-building. Is it really preferable for a representative to vote &#8220;yes&#8221; on a bill because 51 percent of her constituents said so?

The best way is what we&#8217;re doing, of course. :) The goal here, as I see it, is to make systems where any community of any size can come to a consensus decision. That&#8217;s it. We then release that system(s) to presumably-small communities and let them recognize the power of a consensus system. They will be making strong, sophisticated, well-thought-out decisions; unlike communities run by more primitive forms of governance. As people start to see the strength and power of these systems, they will scale them up to larger and more diverse communities, until they start taking over the functions currently managed by government.

That in my mind is the only truly workable path to direct democracy. Everything else is highly fallible, highly unstable, and just not tenable within the framework of society today.

&gt;<i> Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is vulnerable to abuse. Same is true for systems based on people evaluating each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know if I understand correctly your question but I think the answer relies in the fact that each user vote ONE time.
</I>&gt;<i> therefore a good E-Democracy platform should have a strong certification of users.

</I>&gt;<i> If your question is about some sort of Karma to apply to the users, i believe the best way is statistical information of the activity, in Airesis.eu, for example, we start to collect data about users participation based on the vote they receive in the contributions that are posted in the different proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> The analysis of the activity based on big numbers will permit us to develop a good score algorithm

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to post that question here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you,
</I>&gt;<i> s
