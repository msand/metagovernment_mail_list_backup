&gt;<i> This may be jumping the gun a bit, but even having a donation pot where funds go towards the promotion and expansion of the metagovernment idea, beefing up the beta site, internet video creation, ad space, whatever. Things to attract members and get them excited about its potential.

This is some of my hope in starting a non-profit: to gather and consolidate funds for projects. However, a lot of these can be done without cash. It&#8217;s time that&#8217;s the critically limited resource. Creating videos and building up the site are all about investing time. And perhaps coordinating projects a bit.

&gt;<i> Again I'll re-iterate my problem with this mailing list style of communication, it's messy and awkward and if membership participation increases and their's more replies coming in addressing various topics, it's going to be very hard to manage. I believe that a communal discussion forum would serve us much better for organizing ideas and categorizing results. Again I'll offer mywww.theinternetswebsite.com forum as I viable alternative to this mailing list. Ed you were talking about linking a list server to a forum, is there really much point in doing that if there&#8217;s only a few of us who participate anyway?
</I>
Well, that&#8217;s a chicken-and-egg thing. We don&#8217;t want to limit ourselves to only a few participants. That&#8217;s not the goal, so we shouldn&#8217;t aim to accommodate that. I&#8217;d rather be able to accommodate massive participation and also work to get it.
