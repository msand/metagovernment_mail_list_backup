<PRE>Hi to all
Basically the system is up steadily from Feb 2013 I join the dev group in
Jan 2013 and I took the responsibility for the internationalization, We
publish the English version 4 month ago and I did not much dissemination
because I was coordinating the translators for the other 9 languages.
We did not divided the proposals by languages and by localization, because
the platform is not yet used widely  but as soon as there will be groups
from other nation being created we will add in the search page the
different custom search features. And we will divide the proposal by
different mean, language, localization  and other filter.

You guys are seeing something new and you are the pioneer in using the
platform.

My suggestion is to create a metagovernment group invite the member of the
ML to try it there, please be aware that the creator of the group will have
administrative rights and he will be able to create roles and give each
role different permits.
Most group that are created in Airesis they usually need to create group
rules, i believe that as I am speaking to educated people here, that want
to test the platform, will be OK to give administrative right to every one
entering the metagovernment group with the basic rule to don't change the
administrative credential.
I suggest to try different login for example create yourname then yourname1
and yourname2.
yourname will have administrative right but yourname1 will have a different
role and will have different rights (must create different roles first in
the administative panel)
If you have a group of ten people it will be a good try to start a simple
proposal and seeit in action.
Every single user have a blog and we recently added forums where discussion
will be stored, we even place a calendar feature to organize events and set
the vote day for each group.
There is a strong notification feature that can be personalized in your
personal setting.

Salut
jacopo

</I>&gt;<i> By participation I meant number of votes in support of a particular issue.

</I>&gt;<i> spent on solving a problem).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I actually think that a real (direct) participation in form of voting

</I>&gt;<i> I do not exclude delegation is proven from the experience of the pirate
</I>&gt;<i> party in Germany that use LQFB that the function created less participation.
</I>&gt;<i> Participation mean effort and effort mean time and energy. In today world
</I>&gt;<i> we do have little time to spare (at least in Italy) because we are busy
</I>&gt;<i> surviving. Now it does not imply that every one should participate in
</I>&gt;<i> proposal making but it should be on the final decision making. If you are
</I>&gt;<i> not willing to even know what is decided it mean that you deserve to live
</I>&gt;<i> the consequences of your absence. My and  the Airesis development team idea
</I>&gt;<i> is that when, at the end, the personal interest will be at stakes, the
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholder will be involved in the decision taking.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually there is fronts and each fronts bring up his point of view and
</I>&gt;<i> this is the &quot;education&quot; time needed to make a good vote.
</I>&gt;<i> In large numbers and with a proposal making process that include
</I>&gt;<i> participation (in Airesis, the proposal making system still have to be
</I>&gt;<i> modified and developed as we learn from experience and different
</I>&gt;<i> methodology)  I do believe that the collective intelligence will be brought
</I>&gt;<i> up.
</I>&gt;<i> When you will be able to vote (securely!) from your smartphone the
</I>&gt;<i> participation is up to you and if you decide not to vote is because you
</I>&gt;<i> don't have time or because you don't care. Revolution at that time will not
</I>&gt;<i> be in the agenda!
</I>&gt;<i> If then you decide to install a bot that let other vote for you, is a
</I>&gt;<i> choice (dangerous I believe) I will consider developing system that prevent
</I>&gt;<i> that (easy to do)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Efficiency:
</I>&gt;<i> There is many type of problem and many way to address them. Our strategy
</I>&gt;<i> (Airesis Team) is to analyze each problem and then brake it down in to
</I>&gt;<i> smaller sub-problems to have the relative stakeholders address it.
</I>&gt;<i> So here the concept is more participation to solve your own problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Usually during this process many sub-problem find a solution in synthesis
</I>&gt;<i> by the participants in the debate.
</I>&gt;<i> The second strategy is to use different voting system for different
</I>&gt;<i> solution. Let's say that it need to be decided the max speed on the highway
</I>&gt;<i> or the amount of that particular drugs that you can carry legally etc.For
</I>&gt;<i> that we will choose the mathematical formula that show to give the best
</I>&gt;<i> result, In candidate selection we use Schulze algorithm  and so forth. The
</I>&gt;<i> participatory budgeting system will be for local expenditure ect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I open this email I say i do not exclude delegation, is fundamentally a
</I>&gt;<i> right but we live in a delegated democracy, the fundamental question is: is
</I>&gt;<i> functioning? My answer is NO!
</I>&gt;<i> So, the rules of the game are set, we work to see if there is a way of
</I>&gt;<i> making them better.
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe that delegating some one should be done only when I cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> present during the vote.
</I>&gt;<i> If you give large windows of time during the vote the above become a
</I>&gt;<i> rarity.
</I>&gt;<i> If the problem is divided in sub-problem your vote should be made for each
</I>&gt;<i> sub-prolem rather than vote a single bill with hundred decision in it.
</I>&gt;<i> Civic education should become obligatory.

</I>&gt;<i> Please test Airesis.us and give us your critics. I believe is better to
</I>&gt;<i> work pragmatically on the development of a platform and see it in action,
</I>&gt;<i> analyze  statistical data and from poor experiences learn and modify the

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I looked at both your blog posts, where you outline math of delegated vote
</I>&gt;<i> discounting, and where you discuss vote delegating in general. I think, if
</I>&gt;<i> and how to discount votes can be debated. But I feel very strongly for vote
</I>&gt;<i> delegation, therefore I would like to present some arguments for it and see
</I>&gt;<i> what you think:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Participation. Direct participation requires effort. Good amount of
</I>&gt;<i> effort. Fraction of people willing to commit such effort is small. This is
</I>&gt;<i> not because people lazy or dumb. I would say this is because people are
</I>&gt;<i> smart (sea more below). In short, a system without delegation is doomed to
</I>&gt;<i> have low participation, what also makes it more vulnerable to targeted
</I>&gt;<i> subversive effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Efficiency. I read in your post that more deliberation, more
</I>&gt;<i> consultation, more participation is always better. I disagree. It is only
</I>&gt;<i> better for a problem under consideration, in isolation from all other
</I>&gt;<i> problems. Extra effort devoted to a given problem means less effort to
</I>&gt;<i> other problems. And the output of solving this problem is not a linear
</I>&gt;<i> function of the input effort. Usually we deal with diminishing returns.
</I>&gt;<i> People are rational agents constrained by bounded resorcses. They always
</I>&gt;<i> prioritize and ration their efforts. And this is the reason why most people
</I>&gt;<i> will not participate directly in political decision making, and reasonably
</I>&gt;<i> so. (I have in mind problems and decision making of large, societal scale).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Fundamental principals of democracy. I think it is simply more
</I>&gt;<i> democratic to let people themselves to decide on extent of their
</I>&gt;<i> involvement in democratic decision making. Not allowing them to delegate
</I>&gt;<i> their votes (or discounting their votes) is more restrictive. It can also
</I>&gt;<i> be technically difficult or impossible if people are to participate via
</I>&gt;<i> internet. People can always automate their voting using bots, for example,
</I>&gt;<i> thus circumventing your restrictions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can elaborate on my points and give more reasons for vote delegation.
</I>&gt;<i> But it would be interesting to hear your objections. I am also considering
</I>&gt;<i> posting this or an altered version to the metagovernment list later, to see
</I>&gt;<i> what other people may say.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>  Dear Jacopo,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Thank you for your answer. My question was about a scoring system
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned on the metagovernment project FAQ page. I think it is their score
</I>&gt;<i> is more like reputation, or like what you call karma. I have not yet
</I>&gt;<i> checked your site in detail, but it seems to me that any scoring system is

</I>&gt;<i> each other performance. A group of people can always cheat a system, if
</I>&gt;<i> they are willing to invest effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for user vote counting, I completely agree with you, each user should
</I>&gt;<i> have just one vote. Interesting issue for me is vote delegation. I think
</I>&gt;<i> that a viable and efficient implementation of DD (Direct Democracy) will
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily have this feature. To ensure wide participation in DD, people
</I>&gt;<i> should be given option to delegate their votes. Votes could be delegated to
</I>&gt;<i> different people (or maybe parties, organizations) for different types of
</I>&gt;<i> issues (like education, defense, foreign policy etc).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also interested in hearing from other people what they think is the
</I>&gt;<i> best/easiest/fastest path toward DD. People are frustrated with their
</I>&gt;<i> governments, but I do not see wide DD movement. Not even much discussion
</I>&gt;<i> about it. Why is this so?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am interested in direct democracy and I have some programming
</I>&gt;<i> experience. Reading about the Metagovernment project raised several
</I>&gt;<i> questions for which I could not find answers. I asked one question on the
</I>&gt;<i> FAQ discussion page (<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>) a few
</I>&gt;<i> days ago, but I am not sure if anyone saw it there. Therefore I decided to
</I>&gt;<i> post that question here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  On the FAQ page it is suggested that the Metagovernment functioning
</I>&gt;<i> relies upon, among other things, the scoring system. In the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> scoring system users can score other users with weights proportional to
</I>&gt;<i> their own score. This is reminiscent to the Page rank, and like the Page
</I>&gt;<i> rank it is susceptible to abuse. There is no easy fix to such abuse, as is
</I>&gt;<i> evident from Google's ongoing battle against the abusers. In fact, many
</I>&gt;<i> scoring/recommending web-services explicitly state that they keep details
</I>&gt;<i> of their systems secret, to prevent abuse. How do you resolve this issue?
