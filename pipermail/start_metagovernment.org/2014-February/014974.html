<PRE>I would like to add one other option to Phil's great list below.

4 - Group Pro Con tree. Instead of voting for or against you add a pro
statement or a con statement that has not already been added. Then if you
have a weighted scoring system you can evaluate the decision based on the
reasons instead of the opinions. You can recursively weight each pro and
con with it's own pro and con list. You can the prioritize the options by
which has the highest pro weight. This is what SettleIt.org does.

Regards,
Bentley

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We do a huge amount of work with large scale, multi-stakeholder strategies,
</I>&gt;<i> especially in the public sector (see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781472427816">http://www.gowerpublishing.com/isbn/9781472427816</A> for details on my book
</I>&gt;<i> 'Validating Strategies' which will be published in the UK in March.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Strategies invariable produce many, often competing options - so some sort
</I>&gt;<i> of 'prioritisation' or 'Validation' of the strategies is required.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We recommend a 3 step process:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - voting - in which people get to vote which option is most attractive to
</I>&gt;<i> them.  In reality, the consequence of voting is that the least
</I>&gt;<i> controversial
</I>&gt;<i> ideas (not necessarily the best or most important ideas) win the vote.
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - clustering - stakeholders cluster around those ideas that are most
</I>&gt;<i> important to them, so that if enough stakeholders support a given idea then
</I>&gt;<i> maybe they can get on with it even if the rest of the community doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> want
</I>&gt;<i> to support it
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - clumping - in which those ideas which don't have enough support may be
</I>&gt;<i> able to attract support by clumping together with other ideas, editing all
</I>&gt;<i> ideas in the process, until such time as a new concept emerges which either
</I>&gt;<i> rises to the top of the voting or which attracts a big enough cluster of
</I>&gt;<i> people so that it will happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another key principle is to ask people what they are prepared to actually
</I>&gt;<i> DO, and DON'T ask them what they WANT.  This may sound like a trivial
</I>&gt;<i> distinction but it is utterly profound. In a city redevelopment, if you ask
</I>&gt;<i> people what they 'want' in order to minimise congestion on the roads, many
</I>&gt;<i> will say they want more cycleways.  If you ask them what they intend to
</I>&gt;<i> 'do', many will sheepishly admit that they want to drive their cars to work
</I>&gt;<i> because there will be less congestion because other people are using the
</I>&gt;<i> cycleways.  So in all our strategies, our overwhelming focus is on
</I>&gt;<i> understanding what people (end-users) want to DO, not what they WANT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
</I>&gt;<i>
