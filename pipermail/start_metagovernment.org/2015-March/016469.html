</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic proposition is that people can *recognize* expertise even
</I>&gt;<i> when they don't possess it themselves (how to reconcile this with
</I>&gt;<i> Dunning Krueger is tricky, but I think the hook relates to the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between judging your own competence vs. judging competence
</I>&gt;<i> of others).
</I>I probably didn't explain the actual algorithm properly. I haven't 
explained it too often recently, so I'll try to elaborate and also give 
some background on the local culture for the reasoning behind it.

Some of the thinking behind this relates quite a bit to the actual 
Finnish mentality.
Of course we also have some loud people who consider themselves experts, 
when in fact they're mostly incompetent.
But Finns generally seem to have somewhat good bullshit detectors in 
use, and don't give them too much attention.
Then we have in another end of a spectrum, the shy and quite but very 
insightful and experienced person in some specifc categories of topics 
and propositions.
These people usually don't make too much noise, nor attempt to get much 
recognition for their expertise. Another common trait in Finnish 
psychology is to downplay ones skills.
Some of the most skillful people who are very well recognized by their 
peers, friends and family, answer the question &quot;I heard you're an expert 
in X and Y, are you?&quot; with &quot;I'm not completely bad at least&quot; or 
something similarly colorful.

So to remedy this, we want to enable anyone who feels up for it, to 
claim to be an expert in a category(s). This makes their votes in 
propositions public, for the categories where they claim expertise. This 
way people can try to find peers who have skills in various categories 
and who approximate their personal opinion closely by looking at their 
historical record of votes. Thus if for example I know good physicists 
specializing in energy related questions, and I know from personal 
experience that they are able to analyze systems, processes and other 
related aspects to energy policies, then I can choose to trust these 
persons, e.g. 50-100% and use them as my personal approximation of 
opinion. This frees up people to look at topics which are close to their 
heart, and defers topics of less personal interest to other people, 
possible even in their local social circle, with whom they can discuss 
and question the possibilities in attempts to reach more consensus. It 
also enables e.g. retired people to contribute with the expertise 
relating to their fields of work, based on a lifetime of experience. And 
it also allows to find experts who are hidden away somewhere in the 
forest (mostly forest here in Finland :) ), as long as they choose to 
make their expertise public, such that people can choose to be 
approximated by a weighted (trust) sum of expert opinions, if a user 
personally doesn't want to take a stand for every topic/proposition in 
some category but still wants to contribute to the opinion 
approximation/diversification and consensus divergence/convergence 
processes.

And of course, as soon as a person votes directly in a proposition, then 
this persons opinion in this proposition is no longer approximated using 
the weighted average of experts whom the person trusts, but using their 
latest personal votes.

Hope this clears something up and provides at least a glimpse of insight 
into the local culture here.
So this kind of combines 1, 2 and 3. When claiming to be an expert (1), 
one can provide information about oneself (2) and give reasoning about 
what kind of perspective one has, and therefore who might want to trust 
them as experts to approximate their opinion. Of course, what they 
actually vote in specific options in specific propositions and how the 
votes/opinion approximations change over time, should be the main 
criteria for deciding if they are a good representative of yourself and 
if they presently deserve your trust/nomination (3).
&gt;<i> As an exercise for you, please try this, which appeared last week in
</I>&gt;<i> my local paper:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.dailycamera.com/opinion/ci_27754580/martin-hertzberg:-no-such-thing">http://www.dailycamera.com/opinion/ci_27754580/martin-hertzberg:-no-such-thing</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a life-long science nut, it's obvious to me that this guy is
</I>&gt;<i> incompetent. Can you tell? Do you think the average citizen making a
</I>&gt;<i> decision on e.g., a carbon tax would be able to?
</I>Yea, the language doesn't really fit proper scientific reasoning and 
questioning. But the comments afterwards contain several links to 
relevant physics and gives a lot more insight into the problematic use 
of language of the original poster. I wouldn't say the average citizen 
has enough time, energy, interest, curiosity nor mental faculties to 
properly debunk arguments from either side of the discussion. But there 
are completely reasonable physicists around who have good enough 
understanding of QED and photon absorption/emission, and these should be 
able to accumulate trust over time, as their predictions come from one 
of the most accurate scientific models around, with some of the smallest 
deviations between theory, prediction and empirical data. Hopefully folk 
science could recognize this, using e.g. a trust range based system or 
similar concepts.

&gt;<i> I'd also recommend decoupling the proxy issue from the expertise, as I
</I>&gt;<i> do. There are plenty of domains where things other than expertise
</I>&gt;<i> should be used to make decisions. The view of economists (who are
</I>&gt;<i> generally very conservative) on wealth redistribution being a good
</I>&gt;<i> example of this. Even granting that being an &quot;economist&quot; is a form of
</I>&gt;<i> expertise, which is something I personally question ;-)
</I>
Hmm, I'm not sure I completely follow, could you elaborate?

&gt;&gt;<i>   Thus if a user feels
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> improperly represented by any collection of experts and combination of trust
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to them, then they can just vote directly in all the topics of relevance to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them. This allows adapting to good experts gone bad, by removing trust or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> even recommending others not to trust, represented as negative trust.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, conflating two independent needs into the same system. The
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;good experts&quot; might help you understand an issue (via their
</I>&gt;<i> insightful comments), but they shouldn't be automatically used as
</I>&gt;<i> proxies. People should have to pick those based on their
</I>&gt;<i> moral/ideological preferences. For example see the matchism Goals
</I>&gt;<i> section:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://matchism.org/goals/">http://matchism.org/goals/</A>
</I>Did my extended explanation help? Or am I still slightly stuck in some 
semantics here?
One would recognize who is considered an expert by others by the amount 
of trust afforded to them, this doesn't automatically make them your 
proxy in any way. Only the users who personally trust a specific expert 
in a specific category, have their opinion approximated by them in this 
category until they personally vote in a specific proposition in this 
category, overriding the weighted average of the personally trusted experts.

&gt;&gt;<i> This system might allow studying changes in opinion over time, as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allows continued updating of timestamped opinion approximations, and can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow monitoring the progress and perceived successes/failures of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implemented propositions.
</I>&gt;<i> This might be a bit of overkill. Remember, the main goal has to be to
</I>&gt;<i> minimize the time required to participate. If you're tracking changes
</I>&gt;<i> over time, what that says to me is that either the proposers don't
</I>&gt;<i> know what they're doing, or that it is premature to propose a
</I>&gt;<i> law/policy in this area. Facilitating debate over (in the US) gun
</I>&gt;<i> control or abortion is just not the business we're in. Let that stuff
</I>&gt;<i> happen on Facebook or some other forum. When the population is ready
</I>&gt;<i> to decide on an issue, we'll know because a properly written proposal
</I>&gt;<i> will just pass with minimal debate.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott

This is mostly for the purpose of being able to see how experts change 
their minds in their field of expertise. Such that one can find good 
current experts to represent oneself, e.g. by comparing ones personal 
votes to the votes from experts. And such that one can find people who 
suddenly change behavior and start voting in a way which no longer 
resonates with oneself. If, the only way to verify that all the experts 
one trust still deserves it, is through reading the use of language by 
experts, then this might become time-consuming as well. If we can 
compare personal votes to groups of experts and changes in time, we have 
another indicator telling us something about how closely opinions match.

It also might allow to visualize convergence more easily, where fewer 
and fewer options have more and more of the total support, hopefully 
converging on a single new reformulated compromise. I've been working 
with data visualization for some years now, and feel personally 
interested in insightful graphs to ease data comprehension.

A whole collection of tools will probably be helpful. We would like to 
make our system a one-liner of html to add to any site, allowing simple 
integrations and more custom made behavior using the REST-ful api. 
Hopefully it would also allow private groups to vote about any 
trivialities as well, or e.g. where should we go? what should we eat? 
what should we do tonight? within minutes of opening our site on a 
smartphone. Everything is intended to be MIT-licensed or some similar 
permissive open source license. To allow any kind of organization to try 
out the patterns and explore the possibilities.
