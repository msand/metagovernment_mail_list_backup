<PRE>Thanks for the replies Scott.

&gt;<i> It's certainly less competitive and less potentially offensive than
</I>&gt;<i> rating. Probably also less subject to trolls mucking things up by
</I>&gt;<i> giving 5 star ratings to crap just to gum up the works (trolls will
</I>&gt;<i> get flagged, not rated, in my system). Those are all good things if
</I>&gt;<i> your FB or Slashdot and are more interested in collecting eyeballs
</I>&gt;<i> than in collecting good comments. Our priorities are the opposite. Our
</I>&gt;<i> goal must be to allow people to do what they need to do spending as
</I>&gt;<i> *little* time on the system as possible, not try to suck them in and
</I>&gt;<i> keep them as long as possible.
</I>
I feel 5 star rating is too subjective. A comment that people don't agree
with will be overwhelmingly rated a 1 and thus much less likely to be read.
Sometimes the unpopular opinion needs to be said though and I don't think
should be labeled as bad just because people don't agree with it. In my
system the controversial posts will get equal exposure as the highly rated
posts (the ones with most props). Each time a comment gets a reply it's
bumped to the top of the feed, however the comment falls down the feed if
it's not supported by props, This gives us a mixture of both types, and
helps highlight the best debates which will fuel conversation. The final
version of a proposal should be brief but the discussion beforehand should
be engaging. Keeping comment limited to just props won't rank the comments
in any order of goodness, it instead helps them all fluctuate which adds
variety. Only at the end will the highest rated comments be ranked, at this
time it will be proven that this comment speaks to a lot of people and
should be taken into consideration.

&gt;<i> Again, I think the cure is worse than the disease here: Any time you
</I>&gt;<i> introduce some &quot;elite group&quot; directly into the path of the legislative
</I>&gt;<i> process, to me that says &quot;SDAP control&quot;. We certainly don't want to
</I>&gt;<i> require everyone to read and rate every proposal or comment (my
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is to use sampling for the latter), but if I've written a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal that will likely be approved and will be effective (because I
</I>&gt;<i> know something about social engineering or because someone who does
</I>&gt;<i> has reviewed and endorsed it), the *last* thing I want is some SDAP
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;professional&quot; dicking around with it just prior to the voting phase.
</I>
But if this &quot;professional&quot; was approved time and time again by the people
then it wouldn't be an SDAP. Each proposal gets redrafted by a bunch of
&quot;professionals&quot; and the most accurate one gets chosen by the participants
of the discussion. As long as the re-drafter included the key points the
participants would give that individual a good rating and a trust system
would be established.

&gt;&gt;<i> It will hopefully all be computer generated random selection as far as
</I>any
&gt;&gt;<i> assigning of responsibility goes towards proposals, it'll be a civic
</I>duty of
&gt;&gt;<i> sorts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sampling like this does have it's uses, and was a big part of at least
</I>&gt;<i> the previous version of Blinap, but my claim is that if there is any
</I>&gt;<i> way for neurotypicals to get out of doing it, even if it requires
</I>&gt;<i> jumping through hoops like getting out of jury duty does, there's a
</I>&gt;<i> fatal flaw in the system: The people who are left to do the work with
</I>&gt;<i> be SDAP, and that's what's primarily wrong with our current systems.
</I>
Pay them enough to do it and you'll get your neurotypical participation no
problem.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Simple, like FB and Loomio, but IMHO inadequate for the heavy lifting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; required in political discussions. Imagine if on Amazon the only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; information you had was how often people liked the comments? A true
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (1-5) rating scale is necessary, not only for the original proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but for each individual comment (which are the &quot;products&quot; that people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; will be using, albeit in this case the utility of these &quot;products&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; in judging the quality of the OP).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What is meaning to the 1-5 scale?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Provides more information than a simple thumbs up. Nearly all academic
</I>&gt;<i> work using surveys use a multi-point scale. Why do you think that is?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What's the point in giving someone's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comment a 2 for instance?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Means it's not totally useless, but probably not worth strongly
</I>&gt;<i> suggesting other people read it. The real utility comes from those 3
</I>&gt;<i> and 4 star comments: Those would most likely get a thumbs up, but do
</I>&gt;<i> you want to read a bunch of 3 and 4 star comments when you could just
</I>&gt;<i> read the 5s? When writing a comment are you going to shoot for
</I>&gt;<i> something just good enough to get a thumbs up, or are you going to try
</I>&gt;<i> a little harder to get that extra star? Particularly if *your*
</I>&gt;<i> reputation goes up with the number of stars you average on your
</I>&gt;<i> comments?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the results are more effective simpler. 1)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Read comment or proposal. Do you believe the comment or proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> accurate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and complete? 2) If so, like/prop to give it more recognition. If not,
</I>&gt;<i> why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Inefficiency! Good enough is not good enough...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Read top replies to the comment to see if your reasoning has been said,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; prop that. 3) If no replies state your reason for disagreement make your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own, wait for feedback to defend your point. If everyone followed these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; steps it would work
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's certainly less competitive and less potentially offensive than

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Judging the quality of others post makes no real difference if the
</I>&gt;<i> reasons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the low ratings aren't explicitly stated. We're not comparing
</I>&gt;<i> products,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we're addressing each comment as it's own unique product. So the option
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simpler, do we think we need this product or not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's not that simple, again because of all the 3 and 4 star comments
</I>&gt;<i> an upvote-based system requires that people wade through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a 1-5 scale is useful when a proposal is moving to voting and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; getting summarized. It then becomes useful in judging all the entries,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because then we're comparing products.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it is *more* useful there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Follow up question. Are you able to edit your posts in matchism? If so
</I>&gt;<i> does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that not defeat all the scaling work if you can change the text to say
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Undecided. Proposals themselves can be edited and trigger a whole new
</I>&gt;<i> round of ratings. I'm not really comfortable with unlimited editing of
</I>&gt;<i> comments, though, particularly after something has been rated.
</I>&gt;<i> Deleting, maybe: Sometimes you realize that your post is complete
</I>&gt;<i> crap...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; I argue you then need a trusted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; source to summarize all the points at the end of the discussion because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; original proposer would just summarize whatever would get them votes,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't include the damning facts of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would argue that that's their right, and the proposals will actually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be better for it. As long as these negative comments are available to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the voters, why require that the be dealt with in the proposal itself?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The less reading required for an individual the better. If we leave it to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the proposer and top rated comments, the amount of time to self research
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might not be worth expending so we get less educated participation.
</I>&gt;<i> Entrust
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it to professional summarizers, who have track records of well written
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposal summaries. Could even compensate them for their time to keep
</I>&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested. Summarizing enables more people to get easily informed on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals and feel confident in casting a vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I think the cure is worse than the disease here: Any time you
</I>&gt;<i> introduce some &quot;elite group&quot; directly into the path of the legislative

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I was just referring to the proposal rewriting/integration phase. Who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; takes over that responsibility after you?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It will hopefully all be computer generated random selection as far as
