&gt;<i> Hello everyone involved in Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will be my first communication to the mailing list, so some 
</I>&gt;<i> introduction probably maybe useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Introduction
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> tl;dr; I'm a computer scientist involved in e.g. the OpenDemocracy.fi 
</I>&gt;<i> project
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I subscribed to this mailing list a few years back when we added 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenDemocracy.fi to the Metagovernment list of projects. I was reading 
</I>&gt;<i> every e-mail for some months (years?) and attempting to resolve the 
</I>&gt;<i> major discussion topics in my mind and figure out some suitable 
</I>&gt;<i> structure to attempt building and testing. At some point, the volume 
</I>&gt;<i> and mess of the format became more than my life, studies, work and 
</I>&gt;<i> research allowed for and I almost completely stopped reading the e-mails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meanwhile, we built an open source range-voting (-100% to +100%) and 
</I>&gt;<i> self proclaimed expert-trust range based representation for opinion 
</I>&gt;<i> approximation. We did it as a project course in the university, and 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to experiment with technologies which we had no previous 
</I>&gt;<i> experience with. So we built a prototype using Vaadin, Spring, Roo, 
</I>&gt;<i> OpenId, OpenAuth, etc. At first we were four developers and we planned 
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of work accordingly. After some time, two of the developers 
</I>&gt;<i> had to leave because of some personal circumstances, and there we 
</I>&gt;<i> were, two developers eagerly having planned far too much work, using 
</I>&gt;<i> technology combinations which had too much learning curve given the 
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances. The end result was a working system, but nothing we 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to show or tell about to people. It didn't feel fully usable 
</I>&gt;<i> nor scalable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The models and concepts we had in use received support from e.g. Hannu 
</I>&gt;<i> Nurmi, a local professor / expert in voting theory, systems, decision 
</I>&gt;<i> and game theory etc. <A HREF="http://users.utu.fi/hnurmi/homepage/webpub.pdf">http://users.utu.fi/hnurmi/homepage/webpub.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We also started a non-profit organization which exists to this day, 
</I>&gt;<i> but hasn't had major activities recently. We also received some media 
</I>&gt;<i> interest and the Finnish people seem very positive and open to the 
</I>&gt;<i> ideas and concepts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a master of science degree with major in computer science and 
</I>&gt;<i> minors in physics and mathematics. I wrote my master thesis on the 
</I>&gt;<i> topic of &quot;Quantum Computation and Algorithms using Hilbert-spaces and 
</I>&gt;<i> the Quantum Circuit Model&quot;. I have worked almost a year in the 
</I>&gt;<i> financial industry with analyzing and visualizing data relating to the 
</I>&gt;<i> banks, central banks, insurers, nations, currencies, securities and 
</I>&gt;<i> other macro-prudential risks and oversight. This job has finally ended 
</I>&gt;<i> (thank you existence and everything holy!) and currently I'm starting 
</I>&gt;<i> to work as a researcher at &#197;bo Akademi University where I'll be 
</I>&gt;<i> employed as project manager and coder for a project in the industrial 
</I>&gt;<i> economy department. I'll be working on removing some of the major 
</I>&gt;<i> inefficiencies of one of the most wasteful industries in the world, 
</I>&gt;<i> shipping. I also have a side project: <A HREF="http://www.infnitewhiteboard.com">http://www.infnitewhiteboard.com</A> 
</I>&gt;<i> and currently I'm prototyping a new system called the infinite white 
</I>&gt;<i> space. We also have some other open-source real-time peer-to-peer 
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives which hopefully will result in university spin-offs and 
</I>&gt;<i> other organizations with benefits to the general public.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Today I started reading the latest emails in the list again, and felt 
</I>&gt;<i> positively surprised by the kind of language/linguistics in use. 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore I decided to write this e-mail as an open invitation for 
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration and further discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our current direction involves keeping the data models and interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> from our first OpenDemocracy.fi prototype. We currently have a Swagger 
</I>&gt;<i> specification defined. Using this, anyone can generate the boilerplate 
</I>&gt;<i> code needed to create servers and clients using any of the programming 
</I>&gt;<i> languages which have swagger implementations available. This creates 
</I>&gt;<i> REST-ful clients and servers which allow creating categorized 
</I>&gt;<i> propositions with options, casting range-votes and comments for each 
</I>&gt;<i> option, claiming to be an expert in some category, trusting some 
</I>&gt;<i> self-proclaimed expert in some category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a user decides to give positive trust to some self proclaimed 
</I>&gt;<i> experts in some category, then we use the votes of those experts as an 
</I>&gt;<i> approximation of the opinion of the user, for this category. This 
</I>&gt;<i> applies until the user decides to cast a vote in a proposition, at 
</I>&gt;<i> which point we use their latest vote as an approximation of their 
</I>&gt;<i> current opinion. Thus if a user feels improperly represented by any 
</I>&gt;<i> collection of experts and combination of trust to them, then they can 
</I>&gt;<i> just vote directly in all the topics of relevance to them. This allows 
</I>&gt;<i> adapting to good experts gone bad, by removing trust or even 
</I>&gt;<i> recommending others not to trust, represented as negative trust.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This system might allow studying changes in opinion over time, as it 
</I>&gt;<i> allows continued updating of timestamped opinion approximations, and 
</I>&gt;<i> can allow monitoring the progress and perceived successes/failures of 
</I>&gt;<i> implemented propositions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're now considering to implement a minimal responsive mobile first 
</I>&gt;<i> version using Meteor and Polymer, releasing this on github and writing 
</I>&gt;<i> some tutorials to help others try to build similar web standards based 
</I>&gt;<i> things. Optimally we could try to interface with some other projects 
</I>&gt;<i> and try to properly integrate open data-sharing protocols. Hopefully 
</I>&gt;<i> this could lead to fast enough iteration and gamification, such that 
</I>&gt;<i> people would enjoy using the systems and improve in the process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So count us in on the presentations and discussions relating to common 
</I>&gt;<i> roadmaps.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With love and respect
</I>&gt;<i> Mikael Sand and the rest of the OpenDemocracy.fi team
