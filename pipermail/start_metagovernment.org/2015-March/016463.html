</I>
First priority is to separate the streams into pro and con: Mixing
them together is a recipe for exactly this kind of disaster. You still
run the risk of people putting a 1-star rating on a really
informative/insightful comment in an attempt to game the system and
push it down. But that's really a separate problem from the issue of
agree/disagree. I'm inclined to think this won't be a significant
problem, but if it turns out to be one we could impose some
restrictions to prevent it (like Slashdot does: You have limited
moderation points, you can't rate and comment in the same category,
etc.) For example, we might restrict people to only rating in either
the pro *or* con stream, not both. Attacking the opposition by
down-rating posts in their stream would be a lot less effective than
upvoting the best ideas in the stream you're supporting. We might also
honey-pot people by allowing them to attempt to game the system by
1-starring the opposition, but if their ratings are significantly
different from others, the system *automatically* flags them as a
troll.

&gt;<i> Sometimes the unpopular opinion needs to be said though and I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> should be labeled as bad just because people don't agree with it. In my
</I>&gt;<i> system the controversial posts will get equal exposure as the highly rated
</I>&gt;<i> posts (the ones with most props).
</I>
This is important, and why flagging needs to be designed correctly.
This is a big problem on slashdot with posts being flagged &quot;Troll&quot;
when it seems to me that they're merely controversial.

&gt;<i> Each time a comment gets a reply it's
</I>&gt;<i> bumped to the top of the feed, however the comment falls down the feed if
</I>&gt;<i> it's not supported by props, This gives us a mixture of both types, and
</I>&gt;<i> helps highlight the best debates which will fuel conversation. The final
</I>&gt;<i> version of a proposal should be brief but the discussion beforehand should
</I>&gt;<i> be engaging. Keeping comment limited to just props won't rank the comments
</I>&gt;<i> in any order of goodness, it instead helps them all fluctuate which adds
</I>&gt;<i> variety. Only at the end will the highest rated comments be ranked, at this
</I>&gt;<i> time it will be proven that this comment speaks to a lot of people and
</I>&gt;<i> should be taken into consideration.
</I>
Do you propose to support threading (comments on comments)? I'm trying
to figure out if there's a way to do this and allow sorting by
rating...

&gt;<i> But if this &quot;professional&quot; was approved time and time again by the people
</I>&gt;<i> then it wouldn't be an SDAP.
</I>
That's an assumption I'm not sure I'd make. SDAP doesn't mean stupid,
it (mostly) means prejudiced and prejudiced people can be popular and
skillful (Hitler, for example ;-)

&gt;<i> Each proposal gets redrafted by a bunch of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;professionals&quot; and the most accurate one gets chosen by the participants of
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion. As long as the re-drafter included the key points the
</I>&gt;<i> participants would give that individual a good rating and a trust system
</I>&gt;<i> would be established.
</I>
I don't know, still seems complicated, timeconsuming, and vulnerable
to exploit to me. My prediction is still that the vast majority of
proposals will come from the Managers (the executive branch), which
means all this stuff just isn't necessary except in the rare case when
you want to provide support for a marginally competent proposer.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sampling like this does have it's uses, and was a big part of at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the previous version of Blinap, but my claim is that if there is any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way for neurotypicals to get out of doing it, even if it requires
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> jumping through hoops like getting out of jury duty does, there's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fatal flaw in the system: The people who are left to do the work with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be SDAP, and that's what's primarily wrong with our current systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pay them enough to do it and you'll get your neurotypical participation no
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
</I>
I don't know, you'd have to pay me *a lot* before I'd be willing to do
this as a job. But I'd be willing to do it for free if it can be made
easy and interesting (maybe fun, even). A system that requires
payments to function also has a pretty major bootstrapping problem:
Somehow we need to get enough people to use the system to show that it
works and so is worthy of spending tax dollars on. We surely won't
have enough money to pay the numbers needed to get to that point...

    Scott
