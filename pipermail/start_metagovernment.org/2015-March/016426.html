Good idea.  I propose a similar thing with &quot;Managers&quot; which are
essentially the executive branch of government but without any
&quot;executive order&quot; type lawmaking ability.  Contracting the whole
process out would achieve the same goal.  You need to be able to fire
Hitler just as you would any other employee.

&gt;<i> &gt; I still say syndicalism (anarcho or otherwise), like communism, is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; poor match for human Clinations and is also going to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; non-competitive with a capitalistic system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, but

</I>
I didn't say they couldn't exist in non-competitive environments
(e.g., see my previous comments about the Amish and Kibbutzim which
rely on various forms of charity to exist).  Just that they will get
mowed down when any real competition arrives.

&gt;<i> The main trouble might be in the current unpopularity of syndicates.
</I>&gt;<i> Here in Czech Republic I have heard often that syndicates are return of
</I>&gt;<i> communism (meaning Bolshevism).
</I>
Not surprising, since a number of anarcho-syndicalists have explicitly
stated that it is but an intermediate phase in the evolutionary
process, the ultimate end being worldwide communism. I personally
don't buy these slippery-slope type of arguments, but would
acknowledge that many others do.

&gt;<i>  The optimal fix,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore, is just to ensure that regulation is done by the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals rather than the SDAPs we have now in our current
</I>&gt;<i> mis-representative governments. The two cliches that apply here are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;don't throw out the baby with the bathwater&quot; and &quot;dance with the one
</I>&gt;<i> what brung ya&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I understand this goal as optimal. Still I see that you largely depend
</I>&gt;<i> on volunteers (in Implementation Schedule).
</I>
Partially, although a large part of the design is to minimize the need
for them. Most of the &quot;work&quot; will be done by the crowd as a form of
entertainment. Is all the stuff posted on Facebook and Slashdot
created by &quot;volunteers&quot;? What if we could harness the energy of those
people for political rather than commercial gain?

&gt;<i> In case of stability I guess there will be not much interest in any
</I>&gt;<i> alternative (including Matchism) and
</I>&gt;<i> in case of instability you scenario is not suitable.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it so ? What do you say ?
</I>
Agreed, and in that case I'd say that a well designed syndicalism
would have a much better chance of succeeding, just as it started to
during the Spanish revolution. I still don't see it as a long-term
solution, but it could be a great a short-term patch for the kind of
chaos that comes when an authoritarian regime is overthrown. For
example the Iraqis, the Libyans, and the Egyptians would have been way
better off if a quick-and-dirty syndicalism could have been
implemented when their national governments bit the dust. Much easier
than training people up on a Matchist system, or any other nation-wide
direct democracy. And of course it's much easier to bootstrap because
it doesn't rely on a functioning infrastructure the way an electronic
direct democracy does. The disadvantage of course is that it'll be
hard to encourage people to train up (even minimally) on a system
they'll only need if their national government fails...
  Regards,
    Scott
