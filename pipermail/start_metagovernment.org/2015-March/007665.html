    The problem with mailinglists are, that it does not track progress.
    You need a system, that &quot;over time&quot; captures all the little
    &quot;aggreements&quot; and shows where there is still &quot;disagreement&quot;, so that
    participants can focus on that.
    Thus: The system needs to make &quot;proposals&quot; to participants about
    &quot;potential micro agreements&quot; and if they accepts, they are shown in
    the discussion all the time to everyone, so they do not lose focus.
    =&gt; This way, things can slowly build up without repeating everything
    all the time.
    =&gt; It also gives motivation to focus on micro agreements instead of
    creating big blobs of text to drown others.


Alex, YES! Great statement of one of the problems-to-be-solved!

The Blinap design will address this problem, but there are many other 
possible designs that would as well.

Do you know of any such designs (that would at least be better than 
email) that are up and running at this point that we could use?

(We -- or at least I -- have still not taken Airesis out for a spin, so 
I don't know the extent to which it addresses this problem.)

I have seen that you like Git these days -- could you jury-rig a 
progress-tracking/applying system in Git?
