So you're going to collect $10,000 (USD) from each citizen, and then
pay it back to them over a year as they make their votes?

&gt;<i> I have the disadvantage that I live in a small country, but it still works.
</I>&gt;<i> We have 11M citizens. If I ask every citizen that was born on March 1st with
</I>&gt;<i> his year of birth ending ***5 I will get 3014 citizens that should make
</I>&gt;<i> todays decisions. The may get paid 3650times the tax imposed on every
</I>&gt;<i> citizen. So the tax worth $1 per capita is more than enough.
</I>
This is an orthogonal issue to the payment issue: Random sampling.
This has been proposed many times, but I argue (on
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/representative-democracy/">http://www.matchism.org/representative-democracy/</A>) that it is a
non-starter as a design element because it will result in an even more
entrenched SDAP control over the government.  The problem is that
SDAPs *want* to be chosen to make decisions and Neurotypicals don't.
So the latter group will try to get out of it, either by failing to
register in the first place, or by making up excuses (like we do when
called for jury duty) to get out of it when called.

&gt;<i> Moreover you can still combine this method with other methods that you have
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned. Still proxies are not so economic a statistical sampling.
</I>
No: Proxies are chosen by each individual voter, not randomly.  And
additionally they are only guides, not delegates or representatives,
because the individual has the ability to override the proxy vote if
there is some reason for doing so.  My prediction, and hope, is that
in the vast majority of case the individual will simply accept their
proxy's recommendations and let the actual vote be cast by them, but
that in a small number of cases their proxies will disagree with each
other and/or the general vote will be close and the individual will
make the investment necessary to make their own informed decision.

    Scott
