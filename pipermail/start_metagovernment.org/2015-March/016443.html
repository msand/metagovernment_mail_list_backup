<PRE>Hi Scott,

Over a year ago now, I mostly swore off trying to conduct deep 
interconnected multi-threaded discussions on email lists, as not 
productive enough to warrant the expenditure of time and focus.

I heartily agree with you that it would be best that we focus on actual 
proposals, and on deciding whether to adopt/implement them. The question 
is: &quot;Where and how shall we do that work together?&quot; My first answer is, 
&quot;Not here (on the email list) just endlessly talking at one another.&quot;

With that, the prospect of putting time into reading closely the 
material on the new Matchism site, without there being any immediate 
useful thing to *DO* as I am reading and pondering the material, is 
again not productive enough to warrant the expenditure of time and 
focus. I am too busy doing useful things to be interested in spending 
time doing something useless. There needs to be a use, and it needs to 
be an immediate use, with enduring and cumulative effect.

(The software decision system that I am working on will provide what I 
want. At the point that it is operational (maybe 2018 with just me 
working on it), proposals drawn from the Matchism material will probably 
be among the first proposals that I pump into it, to test it out.)

&gt;<i> The matchism.org site (<A HREF="http://matchism.org">http://matchism.org</A>) is (finally) finished and
</I>&gt;<i> polished enough that I'm now encouraging people to read it. The
</I>&gt;<i> sections you all would be most interested in are &quot;The MatchSys&quot; (the
</I>&gt;<i> voting system), and the Goals section (the lead-in to the
</I>&gt;<i> proxy-matching and manager-advisory systems). But I recommend starting
</I>&gt;<i> at the beginning and read at least the pages leading up to the voting
</I>&gt;<i> system to get the necessary background. There's a navigation bar at
</I>&gt;<i> the bottom if you want to jump around from that point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why read it, especially when you've probably all got other projects
</I>&gt;<i> that will have to be put aside for a bit to do so? For one thing, it's
</I>&gt;<i> a lot different from most other political philosophy or economics
</I>&gt;<i> books in that there are a lot of very specific proposals: If you're up
</I>&gt;<i> for shooting fish in a barrel, here's a whole long string of them to
</I>&gt;<i> fire away at. It also addresses a much neglected issue in all the
</I>&gt;<i> other &quot;alternative government&quot; projects: The claim of Matchism is that
</I>&gt;<i> it is not sufficient, and may even be misguided, to focus on the
</I>&gt;<i> disenfranchised minorities in our society. The real need, and danger,
</I>&gt;<i> comes from that minority who currently hold the power. If this is
</I>&gt;<i> correct, then the new system merely needs to be designed to give the
</I>&gt;<i> *middle* majority the power to set the goals and control over how to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve them. It doesn't have to specifically be designed to support
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consent&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot; or even &quot;collaborative&quot; decisionmaking, all
</I>&gt;<i> of which have proven to be extremely difficult to actually implement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more cynical reason to read it is derived from my recent review of
</I>&gt;<i> all of the projects linked out from the Metagovernment.org site (and
</I>&gt;<i> most of those on the ParticipateDB.com site), none of which have not
</I>&gt;<i> amounted to much and most of which have been abandoned for all
</I>&gt;<i> practical purposes. Unfortunately, it seems to me that every one of
</I>&gt;<i> these dead-end projects is another nail in the coffin of the idea that
</I>&gt;<i> a new government system is even possible, let alone that it might be
</I>&gt;<i> developed by any independent person or group. It's one thing to take
</I>&gt;<i> on projects like these as an experiment or hobby, but I see that
</I>&gt;<i> hundreds of thousands of person-hours and millions of dollars have
</I>&gt;<i> been spent on these things. This sort of review is bound to make
</I>&gt;<i> anyone very discouraged,and instill a great reluctance to add to the
</I>&gt;<i> pile.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only reason for optimism I could find is that all of them I looked
</I>&gt;<i> at are missing what I believe to be one key ingredient: a
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive and well-specified philosophy. No revolution has been
</I>&gt;<i> successful without a &quot;story&quot; that can be used to sell the new
</I>&gt;<i> political &quot;technology&quot; it will be based on. Which is why I believe
</I>&gt;<i> that it's worth your time to invest in a philosophy/narrative *before*
</I>&gt;<i> expending any more resources building tools and technology. Even if it
</I>&gt;<i> turns out that Matchism isn't a good fit for you, the way it is
</I>&gt;<i> organized and specifically refers to competing alternatives (e.g., see
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;isms&quot; section) should help you find or develop one that will be.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
