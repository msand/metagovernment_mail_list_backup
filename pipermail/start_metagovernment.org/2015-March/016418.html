Fortunately it is malleable. One of the best experimental results I've
seen in this area is in Stenner's book where she activates
authoritarians with a story about space aliens and they immediately
start treating the entire human race as their in-group. The design of
Matchism also plays on this, where the in-group is global but defined
by philosophy rather than religion or national borders. The trick will
be to manage expression of these tribalistic tendencies so that it can
be harnessed to solidify and expand the movement without yielding to
the &quot;dark side&quot; (the prejudice and aggression that SDAPs bring to
their in-group/out-group classifications).

&gt;<i> There is one thing you need to make sure here:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other question is. Will neurotypicals gravitate to this syndicate ?
</I>
Certainly the design, with a strong in-group/out-group distinction
would appeal to SDAPs more.  I wouldn't think it is *incompatible*
with neurotypicals, but doubt it would be any more attractive to them
than any other system.
