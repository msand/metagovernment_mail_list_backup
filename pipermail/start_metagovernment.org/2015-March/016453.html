<PRE>&gt;<i> Simple, like FB and Loomio, but IMHO inadequate for the heavy lifting
</I>&gt;<i> required in political discussions. Imagine if on Amazon the only
</I>&gt;<i> information you had was how often people liked the comments? A true
</I>&gt;<i> (1-5) rating scale is necessary, not only for the original proposal,
</I>&gt;<i> but for each individual comment (which are the &quot;products&quot; that people
</I>&gt;<i> will be using, albeit in this case the utility of these &quot;products&quot; is
</I>&gt;<i> in judging the quality of the OP).
</I>
 What is meaning to the 1-5 scale? What's the point in giving someone's
comment a 2 for instance? I think the results are more effective simpler.
1) Read comment or proposal. Do you believe the comment or proposal is
accurate and complete? 2) If so, like/prop to give it more recognition. If
not, why not? Read top replies to the comment to see if your reasoning has
been said, prop that. 3) If no replies state your reason for disagreement
make your own, wait for feedback to defend your point. If everyone followed
these steps it would work


Judging the quality of others post makes no real difference if the reasons
for the low ratings aren't explicitly stated. We're not comparing products,
we're addressing each comment as it's own unique product. So the option is
simpler, do we think we need this product or not?


I think a 1-5 scale is useful when a proposal is moving to voting and
getting summarized. It then becomes useful in judging all the entries,
because then we're comparing products.


Follow up question. Are you able to edit your posts in matchism? If so does
that not defeat all the scaling work if you can change the text to say
anything?

&gt;<i> Moderators make the flagging calls? I'm also thinking this is a
</I>&gt;<i> non-starter for any scalable system. It needs to be primarily
</I>&gt;<i> self-policing or the resources required to maintain it will be
</I>&gt;<i> prohibitive. Hence my filtering proposal (the user can filter posts
</I>&gt;<i> based on how they've been flagged).
</I>

Ultimately it won't be moderators but a randomly selected jury, chosen to
look over each case and self-police. Each case is treated like any other
proposal, the jury has a discussion and then a vote is cast. Seems like the
fairest way to do it. Each jury member could even be compensated a bit for
the effort.

&gt;&gt;<i> I argue you then need a trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source to summarize all the points at the end of the discussion because
</I>an
&gt;&gt;<i> original proposer would just summarize whatever would get them votes,
</I>they
&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't include the damning facts of the proposal.
</I>
&gt;<i> I would argue that that's their right, and the proposals will actually
</I>&gt;<i> be better for it. As long as these negative comments are available to
</I>&gt;<i> the voters, why require that the be dealt with in the proposal itself?
</I>

The less reading required for an individual the better. If we leave it to
the proposer and top rated comments, the amount of time to self research
might not be worth expending so we get less educated participation. Entrust
it to professional summarizers, who have track records of well written
proposal summaries. Could even compensate them for their time to keep them
interested. Summarizing enables more people to get easily informed on
proposals and feel confident in casting a vote.


All the original posts are still accessible should anyone want to view
them. In fact, this is a necessary step to initial judging the summarized
entries with the 1-5 scale.

[snip]

&gt;<i> I was just referring to the proposal rewriting/integration phase. Who
</I>&gt;<i> takes over that responsibility after you?
</I>

It will hopefully all be computer generated random selection as far as any
assigning of responsibility goes towards proposals, it'll be a civic duty
of sorts.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no down vote but there is a

</I>&gt;<i> many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reports/flags. There's also a search engine to look for any past posts.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Seems like you've just introduced a SDAP at a key point in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; process.  What's to stop them from tweaking things to preserve their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; power or the status quo?  Why isn't the original proposer responsible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;for the revisions?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Every ideas man isn't an writer. The original proposer has swayed to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public opinion as best as they can, adding comments and tweaking their
</I>&gt;<i> idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anywhere that there was public support for, this is all done in an
</I>&gt;<i> attempt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to compromise to best suit public opinion. I argue you then need a
</I>&gt;<i> trusted

</I>&gt;<i> the voters, why require that the be dealt with in the proposal itself?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is why you need an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; outsider to break it down truthfully, initially I would do it, but in
</I>&gt;<i> time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we would establish trusted individuals who always reported the stories
</I>&gt;<i> with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accuracy, they would become like our trusted reporters and be compensated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for their work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, like Fox News and Brian Williams, right? Again, this is a recipe
</I>&gt;<i> for SDAP control of your government, which is exactly what's wrong
</I>&gt;<i> with our current systems. People need to learn to trust *each other*,
</I>&gt;<i> not some self-proclaimed experts whose real skills lie in the domain
</I>&gt;<i> of salesmenship (or perhaps even con-artistry) than in
</I>&gt;<i> government/journalism/social engineering/etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Right, the benevolent dictator model of government ;-)  What happens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; when Stalin succeeds you?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The site is not at it's most capable yet, when all is done there will be
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need for a successor. It will all be run through an open source program
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; regulates itself. Wired in to every interaction and transaction, it would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all be transparent. Improvements to the code would have to be checked and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; approved by a super majority, otherwise they should never change. No one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; need be in charge of the whole thing. We're all watching it equally.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> takes over that responsibility after you?
