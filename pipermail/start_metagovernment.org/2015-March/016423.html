Don't see a problem with them in a corporation or syndicate either:
They are the kinds of competitive people who may even be harder
working than non-authoritarian SDs, just the thing for higher
management. Where they  become a problem is if you let them into
positions of power in *government* (e.g., Bush/Cheney, Putin, Hitler,
etc.) where their prejudice against outsiders and aggression cause
problems (for Iraqis, Ukrainians, Jews/Europeans in general,
respectively).

The only problematic interaction I see in your proposal would be that
double highs would probably be harder to remove from power at whatever
time you propose to switch over to a direct democracy (they'll just
hang you for treason rather than going along with the program ;-)

&gt;<i> I will keep other social dominators and authoritarians.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it better now ?
</I>
I still say syndicalism (anarcho or otherwise), like communism, is a
poor match for human Clinations and is also going to be
non-competitive with a capitalistic system. The optimal fix,
therefore, is just to ensure that regulation is done by the
neurotypicals rather than the SDAPs we have now in our current
mis-representative governments. The two cliches that apply here are
&quot;don't throw out the baby with the bathwater&quot; and &quot;dance with the one
what brung ya&quot;.
