<PRE><A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Active_projects</A>

I've updated the MG Active Projects page. Following Pietro's
suggestion, I didn't delete the dead links but instead divided the
list in to 3 parts: Most active, formerly active, and discontinued.
This preserves all of the available information, but prioritizes it so
that it is most useful to readers and the projects themselves (waste
of resources to provide people with a list of dead links or even links
to projects that haven't been updated in years when what they (and we)
need is awareness of what's happening *now*).

Please check/update your project listing and move it between sections
if you think it's appropriate.

I also went ahead and removed the redundant links from the Related
Projects page. I didn't check all of those for discontinued/inactive
projects, however, so someone should still do that at some point. I'd
also recommend removing the location specifications for the listings
on that page: What with browsers offering to do automatic translation
even the language shouldn't be a barrier to people exploring the MG
site following those links. We certainly don't want to imply that any
of these projects or ideas is specific to some particular locality.
  Regards,
    Scott
