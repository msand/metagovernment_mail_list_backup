True, but doing so may put you at a competitive disadvantage: My hunch
is that Social Dominators in particular are actually necessary in a
fully-functional hierarchical organization, and if you try to exclude
them you'll end up crippling the organization directly or kicking off
a chain of bad decisions that will hobble it in some other way (e.g.,
those neurotypicals may choose a less efficient organizational
structure like matrix management). Which is why Matchism doesn't seek
to eliminate all these potentially useful but also potentially
dangerous personality and organizational types, but instead proposes
just to regulate them better.

Unless your organization can out-compete organizations that don't have
self-imposed limits like this, you're (again) wasting your and
everyone else's time.
  Regards,
    Scott
