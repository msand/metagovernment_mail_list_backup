<PRE>&gt;<i> I'd looked at this before, and it's not really clear to me how it
</I>&gt;<i> works.  Is there documentation?  A complete example?  I appreciate the
</I>&gt;<i> bootstrapping issue: It's hard to get anyone to participate unless
</I>&gt;<i> they can see how it works, and it's hard to show how it works unless
</I>&gt;<i> you've got a bunch of people contributing to it...
</I>
It's a pretty straight forward process, but it's hard to put into a
complete example because it moves in stages.
Anyone can post a proposal for a change in the way the world works. Then
anyone else can contribute to the idea with their own posts or by up voting
any post they agree with. The original proposer can then adopt any post
into their proposal by check marking it, indicating that the post be
included in the final version of the proposal. Once significant input has
been contributed the proposal can move to a voting stage where someone like
a president will take all the adopted posts and highly up voted criticism
posts and make a simplified version of what the whole idea will look like
in an easily read paragraph or two for the general voter. Then all users
will be able to get a recap of the lengthy conversation broken down to be
able to effectively make an educated decision on which direction they
intend to vote. Proposals are then categorized as rejected or passed after
a period of voting.

&gt;<i> Not sure if you appreciate the irony of running for representative on
</I>&gt;<i> the platform that representative government doesn't work ;-)
</I>
&gt;<i> I'm sometimes tempted to do this, or engage the existing powers
</I>&gt;<i> (representatives and/or bureaucrats) to gain their cooperation, but
</I>&gt;<i> have decided that this isn't the way the revolution happens. We need
</I>&gt;<i> to press those people to release the information we need to run a
</I>&gt;<i> government in parallel with theirs, but I'd have to recommend against
</I>&gt;<i> jumping into the fray ourselves because the issues of corruption,
</I>&gt;<i> legitimizing the opposition, and wasting precious resources (our time
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be spent building systems to enable the people to run their
</I>&gt;<i> government, not wasted actually trying to run the government ourselves
</I>&gt;<i> ;-)
</I>
I appreciate the irony don't worry. I think this is the most direct route
though. If I'm elected I'll be able to release all the information myself
to the site allowing people to run themselves. My task afterwards would
just be as an active participant on the site, helping individuals
legitimize their proposals. I'd also be redrafting proposals for the final
vote initially but we'll be able to establish a more public option later.
The opposition can say what they want but if I'm president ultimately what
I say goes and I would be subject to the people. Initiating our direct
democracy without opposition.

&gt;<i> I've signed up, but think I need more info on the system before I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> able to contribute anything.  I've also been satisfied with the
</I>&gt;<i> group's participation rate with viable systems: I learned a lot from
</I>&gt;<i> the Vilfredo and Loomio runs.  I've only been disappointed by the
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis run because I had so much trouble getting that system to work
</I>&gt;<i> and because of the language barrier.
</I>&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
</I>
Thanks for signing up and I hope others will too. My system should function
simply and effectively, but again it needs that participation before we're
really able to gauge things.
Cheers,
Reid
