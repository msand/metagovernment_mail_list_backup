<PRE>On Sun, Mar 22, 2015 at 3:25 PM, Reid Millerd &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mrpdublin at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> Simple, like FB and Loomio, but IMHO inadequate for the heavy lifting

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be using, albeit in this case the utility of these &quot;products&quot; is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in judging the quality of the OP).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is meaning to the 1-5 scale?
</I>
Provides more information than a simple thumbs up. Nearly all academic
work using surveys use a multi-point scale. Why do you think that is?

&gt;<i> What's the point in giving someone's
</I>&gt;<i> comment a 2 for instance?
</I>
Means it's not totally useless, but probably not worth strongly
suggesting other people read it. The real utility comes from those 3
and 4 star comments: Those would most likely get a thumbs up, but do
you want to read a bunch of 3 and 4 star comments when you could just
read the 5s? When writing a comment are you going to shoot for
something just good enough to get a thumbs up, or are you going to try
a little harder to get that extra star? Particularly if *your*
reputation goes up with the number of stars you average on your
comments?

&gt;<i> I think the results are more effective simpler. 1)
</I>&gt;<i> Read comment or proposal. Do you believe the comment or proposal is accurate
</I>&gt;<i> and complete? 2) If so, like/prop to give it more recognition. If not, why
</I>&gt;<i> not?
</I>
Inefficiency! Good enough is not good enough...

&gt;<i> Read top replies to the comment to see if your reasoning has been said,
</I>&gt;<i> prop that. 3) If no replies state your reason for disagreement make your
</I>&gt;<i> own, wait for feedback to defend your point. If everyone followed these
</I>&gt;<i> steps it would work
</I>
It's certainly less competitive and less potentially offensive than
rating. Probably also less subject to trolls mucking things up by
giving 5 star ratings to crap just to gum up the works (trolls will
get flagged, not rated, in my system). Those are all good things if
your FB or Slashdot and are more interested in collecting eyeballs
than in collecting good comments. Our priorities are the opposite. Our
goal must be to allow people to do what they need to do spending as
*little* time on the system as possible, not try to suck them in and
keep them as long as possible.

&gt;<i> Judging the quality of others post makes no real difference if the reasons
</I>&gt;<i> for the low ratings aren't explicitly stated. We're not comparing products,
</I>&gt;<i> we're addressing each comment as it's own unique product. So the option is
</I>&gt;<i> simpler, do we think we need this product or not?
</I>
It's not that simple, again because of all the 3 and 4 star comments
an upvote-based system requires that people wade through.

&gt;<i> I think a 1-5 scale is useful when a proposal is moving to voting and
</I>&gt;<i> getting summarized. It then becomes useful in judging all the entries,
</I>&gt;<i> because then we're comparing products.
</I>
I agree it is *more* useful there.

&gt;<i> Follow up question. Are you able to edit your posts in matchism? If so does
</I>&gt;<i> that not defeat all the scaling work if you can change the text to say
</I>&gt;<i> anything?
</I>
Undecided. Proposals themselves can be edited and trigger a whole new
round of ratings. I'm not really comfortable with unlimited editing of
comments, though, particularly after something has been rated.
Deleting, maybe: Sometimes you realize that your post is complete
crap...

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I argue you then need a trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> source to summarize all the points at the end of the discussion because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> original proposer would just summarize whatever would get them votes,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wouldn't include the damning facts of the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would argue that that's their right, and the proposals will actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be better for it. As long as these negative comments are available to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the voters, why require that the be dealt with in the proposal itself?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The less reading required for an individual the better. If we leave it to
</I>&gt;<i> the proposer and top rated comments, the amount of time to self research
</I>&gt;<i> might not be worth expending so we get less educated participation. Entrust
</I>&gt;<i> it to professional summarizers, who have track records of well written
</I>&gt;<i> proposal summaries. Could even compensate them for their time to keep them
</I>&gt;<i> interested. Summarizing enables more people to get easily informed on
</I>&gt;<i> proposals and feel confident in casting a vote.
</I>
Again, I think the cure is worse than the disease here: Any time you
introduce some &quot;elite group&quot; directly into the path of the legislative
process, to me that says &quot;SDAP control&quot;. We certainly don't want to
require everyone to read and rate every proposal or comment (my
proposal is to use sampling for the latter), but if I've written a
proposal that will likely be approved and will be effective (because I
know something about social engineering or because someone who does
has reviewed and endorsed it), the *last* thing I want is some SDAP
&quot;professional&quot; dicking around with it just prior to the voting phase.

&gt;&gt;<i> I was just referring to the proposal rewriting/integration phase. Who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> takes over that responsibility after you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will hopefully all be computer generated random selection as far as any
</I>&gt;<i> assigning of responsibility goes towards proposals, it'll be a civic duty of
</I>&gt;<i> sorts.
</I>
Sampling like this does have it's uses, and was a big part of at least
the previous version of Blinap, but my claim is that if there is any
way for neurotypicals to get out of doing it, even if it requires
jumping through hoops like getting out of jury duty does, there's a
fatal flaw in the system: The people who are left to do the work with
be SDAP, and that's what's primarily wrong with our current systems.

    Scott
