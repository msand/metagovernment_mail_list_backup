<PRE>I know that I am using here what is tribal in us. I know it is dangerous.

There is one thing you need to make sure here:
That the syndicate is governed by real direct democracy, that the 
neurotypicals are in charge. Than the conclusion you do, should not be 
valid. Or ?

Other question is. Will neurotypicals gravitate to this syndicate ?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Basically it will be a syndicate. There will be some basic ideological
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> values. You will make distinction between your syndicate employees (=owners)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and the rest of economy. Now you try to educate your employees to do a good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> choices and produce the choices in your syndicate or find a good source and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promote it. You are *not* selling this to the outer market.
</I>&gt;<i> Sort of the opposite of &quot;radical transparency&quot;: Information about
</I>&gt;<i> everything that goes on within the syndicate is held within the
</I>&gt;<i> syndicate. This is a very powerful organizational structure because it
</I>&gt;<i> fully leverages our instinctive tribalism. It's how cults work, the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;old boys network&quot;, and the Military Industrial Complex, which relies
</I>&gt;<i> on secrecy in the guise of &quot;national security&quot; to take care of its own
</I>&gt;<i> while screwing over everyone outside.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I think public corporations, ownership of which are held
</I>&gt;<i> jointly by their shareholders, are the better organizational
</I>&gt;<i> structure. The problem with this corporate structure now is primarily
</I>&gt;<i> that the shareholders do *not* have the power they are due because a
</I>&gt;<i> SDAP board of directors has all the real power. Enforce radical
</I>&gt;<i> transparency and this corrupting influence goes away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To the outer economy your syndicate behaves like evil. Is producing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fashionable stuff for good money and hurting society (like New Age courses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> :D , cigarettes, alcohol of lowest quality...) and spending good money on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> marketing, lobbying and corruption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I think syndicate can corrupt, you just need to pay somebody well for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some result, you do not need to know how he did it. Of course this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exception from equal distribution of income.
</I>&gt;<i> Except within the syndicate, of course.  You're free to implement
</I>&gt;<i> whatever distribution policy you want there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now your are not total evils. You are so kind that you take care about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unemployed people and you let them to enter your education courses and buy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same products as your employees enjoy. They prove themselves with their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> request for unemployment benefits.
</I>&gt;<i> The common recruitment mode for street gangs, another instantiation of
</I>&gt;<i> tribalism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is your advantage ? You do not need to spend much money on recruitment,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fluctuation should be low even with low wages, because you produce a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> other stuff for your employees than just money. You are trying to make their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lives easy and happy. Your morale and health should be also better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> average, if you understand your tactics and you are OK with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If correct, your syndicate should grow. People in other businesses should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suffer a little bit more, that should provide opportunity for growth. When
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are big enough in some state you should be able to &quot;corrupt&quot; your state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into direct democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> But why would you bother? You and your people already have everything
</I>&gt;<i> they need! Instead you'd naturally use this corruptive power to weaken
</I>&gt;<i> the government to reduce the effectness of laws and so solidify your
</I>&gt;<i> (and your tribe's) position and grow it if possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is also related to the government structure in the utopian novel
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Looking Backward&quot; where corporate mergers eventually reach their
</I>&gt;<i> asymptotic conclusion and the world is run by one huge corporation.
</I>&gt;<i> Which naturally looks after everyone because they're all &quot;valued
</I>&gt;<i> employees&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
