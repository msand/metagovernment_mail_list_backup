Upon further reflection, this strikes me as suboptimal. The problem is
that most of those proposals were *derived* using Matchism. If you try
to get them passed without this backup philosophy and research,
they're doomed to fail, a failure that won't really tell you much
because the proposals were just marketed incorrectly. Take the &quot;20%
above agreed (market) value for eminent domain&quot; proposal in
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/land-natural-resources/.">http://www.matchism.org/land-natural-resources/.</A> Unless you explain
that what this means is that the &quot;attachment to place&quot; Clination has
been deprecated (just like we already have done with the
&quot;racism/tribalism&quot; Clination), it's going to be really hard to
convince a lot of people to vote for it. Now people won't have to know
all the intricacies of Matchism to make this kind of determination on
their own, but they will have to know enough about it to at least
evaluate the proposal in the proper context (that is, this is not just
some expediency, what they would be agreeing to is that our collective
moral code is going to shift to t + 1 and that we're going to start
thinking about &quot;attachment to place&quot; in a different way).

Don't get me wrong: I have no proprietary interest in any of this and
even if only one or two of the actually MatchSpec proposals ever get
implemented I'd have to consider the project a success even if the
whole philosophy part doesn't ever amount to much. I saw *way* too
much of this in my review of the active and related projects on
Metagovernment.org. One of them even proposed a *patent* on the voting
system, which struck me as completely misunderstanding the environment
we're working in. Even those proprietary electronic voting boxes are
just another nail in the coffin of the tradition of using &quot;polling
places&quot; for this reason IMHO. All our existing systems are going to
mail-in ballots first, then electronic (internet) based voting.
Anything proprietary that stands in the way of that is doomed to
failure. So feel free to use any of these ideas anyway you want, but I
would appreciate any efforts to at least market/sell them properly.
  Regards,
    Scott
