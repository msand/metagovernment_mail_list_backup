Right: True &quot;crony capitalism&quot; should be easy to beat because it is
*not* truly competitive. But I don't believe there is such a thing as
&quot;crony capitalism&quot;. &quot;Cronyism&quot; is a *government* characteristic, SDAPs
in the government bypassing competition to chose their
friends/relatives/supporters as suppliers.

&gt;<i> The usual syndicate is quite charitable organisation, its main argument are

</I>
Right, same with communism. Unfortunately it's a poor match for human
Clinations, which is why IMHO they are non-competitive at best and
doomed to failure in most cases.

&gt;<i> On the other hand my syndicate is political, its main argument is making
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;neurotypical politics&quot; with the help of corruption (a way that has proved
</I>&gt;<i> to be effective).
</I>
I would think the two are fundamentally incompatible: The
neurotypicals not only won't seek out corruption, they won't even take
advantage of it when the system provides this tool to them (e.g.,
Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiment, where it's the
authoritarians who put government money in their own pockets).

&gt;<i> Cronyism is very limited here and should have no significant impact on
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> Motivation should be also better.
</I>&gt;<i> Contrary to other syndicates, this syndicate should not be charitable. Wages
</I>&gt;<i> will be still little, but the syndicate will advice how to spend those money
</I>&gt;<i> effectively. The goal of this syndicate is to establish direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> (not syndicalism), it should be marketed as important motivation.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it operational ?
</I>
I'm thinking it's a poor match for Clinations. Again I think where it
breaks down is the transition: It's easy enough to build up a large
and powerful organization using Social Dominators and Authoritarians
(it's how Corporations, the Mafia, and Governments all work now). But
then you've got two problems:
1) Those people will be unwilling to give up the power and
organization they've created when it's time to transition
2) You've marginalized the neurotypicals all along and so they're
conditioned to accept the status quo and so won't fight for the direct
democracy when the time comes for them to do so.

Matchism comes at it from the other direction: Build systems and train
the neurotypicals on how to use them to wield power and *then* use
that training/confidence/technology to marginalize the SDAPs and limit
their power.
