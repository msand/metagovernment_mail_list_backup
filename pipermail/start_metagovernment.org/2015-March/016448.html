</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At the point that it is operational (maybe 2018 with just me working on it),

</I>&gt;<i> Upon further reflection, this strikes me as suboptimal. The problem is
</I>&gt;<i> that most of those proposals were *derived* using Matchism.
</I>However the proposals were derived, they generally need to be tested in 
the laboratory before being implemented in the world. In Blinap (the 
decision system that I am working on), you could expect that each 
proposal would encounter the objection: &quot;This proposal has not been 
tested&quot;, at which point you would need to either test/demonstrate, or 
you would need to show that sufficient testing/demonstration had already 
been done, or you would need to argue convincingly that testing is not 
necessary.
&gt;<i>   If you try
</I>&gt;<i> to get them passed without this backup philosophy and research,
</I>&gt;<i> they're doomed to fail, a failure that won't really tell you much
</I>&gt;<i> because the proposals were just marketed incorrectly.
</I>Politicians worry about whether a proposal will pass. Scientists and 
Engineers worry about whether implementing the proposal would produce 
the desired implementation outcomes.
&gt;<i>   Take the &quot;20%
</I>&gt;<i> above agreed (market) value for eminent domain&quot; proposal in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/land-natural-resources/.">http://www.matchism.org/land-natural-resources/.</A> Unless you explain
</I>&gt;<i> that what this means is that the &quot;attachment to place&quot; Clination has
</I>&gt;<i> been deprecated (just like we already have done with the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;racism/tribalism&quot; Clination), it's going to be really hard to
</I>&gt;<i> convince a lot of people to vote for it. Now people won't have to know
</I>&gt;<i> all the intricacies of Matchism to make this kind of determination on
</I>&gt;<i> their own, but they will have to know enough about it to at least
</I>&gt;<i> evaluate the proposal in the proper context (that is, this is not just
</I>&gt;<i> some expediency, what they would be agreeing to is that our collective
</I>&gt;<i> moral code is going to shift to t + 1 and that we're going to start
</I>&gt;<i> thinking about &quot;attachment to place&quot; in a different way).
</I>The &quot;best&quot; way to persuade people that a new social system arrangement 
will make the world a better place is to test it (in the laboratory) and 
thereby demonstrate that there is good (scientific, engineering) reason 
to expect that it will have that effect if implemented in the real world.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't get me wrong: I have no proprietary interest in any of this and
</I>&gt;<i> even if only one or two of the actually MatchSpec proposals ever get
</I>&gt;<i> implemented I'd have to consider the project a success even if the
</I>&gt;<i> whole philosophy part doesn't ever amount to much.
</I>Any MatchSpec proposals that do get implemented and then prove to be bad 
ideas should not cause you to consider the project a success. What 
matters most is whether the implementations produce good outcomes, not 
whether the proposals pass.
&gt;<i>   I saw *way* too
</I>&gt;<i> much of this in my review of the active and related projects on
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment.org. One of them even proposed a *patent* on the voting
</I>&gt;<i> system, which struck me as completely misunderstanding the environment
</I>&gt;<i> we're working in. Even those proprietary electronic voting boxes are
</I>&gt;<i> just another nail in the coffin of the tradition of using &quot;polling
</I>&gt;<i> places&quot; for this reason IMHO. All our existing systems are going to
</I>&gt;<i> mail-in ballots first, then electronic (internet) based voting.
</I>&gt;<i> Anything proprietary that stands in the way of that is doomed to
</I>&gt;<i> failure. So feel free to use any of these ideas anyway you want, but I
</I>&gt;<i> would appreciate any efforts to at least market/sell them properly.
</I>My view is that &quot;proper&quot; marketing needs to be based PRIMARILY on 
DEMONSTRATING the goodness of the proposals through LABORATORY TESTING. 
(I see marketing without testing as irresponsible. The Founding Fathers, 
the Bolshevists, and the Nazis all did great at marketing.)
