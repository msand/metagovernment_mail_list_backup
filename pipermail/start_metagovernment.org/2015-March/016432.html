Simple, like FB and Loomio, but IMHO inadequate for the heavy lifting
required in political discussions. Imagine if on Amazon the only
information you had was how often people liked the comments? A true
(1-5) rating scale is necessary, not only for the original proposal,
but for each individual comment (which are the &quot;products&quot; that people
will be using, albeit in this case the utility of these &quot;products&quot; is
in judging the quality of the OP).

&gt;<i> There is no down vote but there is a
</I>&gt;<i> report/flag button that can result in a suspension if a post receives many
</I>&gt;<i> reports/flags. There's also a search engine to look for any past posts.
</I>
Moderators make the flagging calls? I'm also thinking this is a
non-starter for any scalable system. It needs to be primarily
self-policing or the resources required to maintain it will be
prohibitive. Hence my filtering proposal (the user can filter posts
based on how they've been flagged).

&gt;&gt;<i> Seems like you've just introduced a SDAP at a key point in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process.  What's to stop them from tweaking things to preserve their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power or the status quo?  Why isn't the original proposer responsible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>for the revisions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every ideas man isn't an writer. The original proposer has swayed to the
</I>&gt;<i> public opinion as best as they can, adding comments and tweaking their idea
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere that there was public support for, this is all done in an attempt
</I>&gt;<i> to compromise to best suit public opinion. I argue you then need a trusted
</I>&gt;<i> source to summarize all the points at the end of the discussion because an
</I>&gt;<i> original proposer would just summarize whatever would get them votes, they
</I>&gt;<i> wouldn't include the damning facts of the proposal.
</I>
I would argue that that's their right, and the proposals will actually
be better for it. As long as these negative comments are available to
the voters, why require that the be dealt with in the proposal itself?

&gt;<i> This is why you need an
</I>&gt;<i> outsider to break it down truthfully, initially I would do it, but in time
</I>&gt;<i> we would establish trusted individuals who always reported the stories with
</I>&gt;<i> accuracy, they would become like our trusted reporters and be compensated
</I>&gt;<i> for their work.
</I>
Yeah, like Fox News and Brian Williams, right? Again, this is a recipe
for SDAP control of your government, which is exactly what's wrong
with our current systems. People need to learn to trust *each other*,
not some self-proclaimed experts whose real skills lie in the domain
of salesmenship (or perhaps even con-artistry) than in
government/journalism/social engineering/etc.

&gt;&gt;<i> Right, the benevolent dictator model of government ;-)  What happens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when Stalin succeeds you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The site is not at it's most capable yet, when all is done there will be no
</I>&gt;<i> need for a successor. It will all be run through an open source program that
</I>&gt;<i> regulates itself. Wired in to every interaction and transaction, it would
</I>&gt;<i> all be transparent. Improvements to the code would have to be checked and
</I>&gt;<i> approved by a super majority, otherwise they should never change. No one
</I>&gt;<i> need be in charge of the whole thing. We're all watching it equally.
</I>
I was just referring to the proposal rewriting/integration phase. Who
takes over that responsibility after you?
  Regards,
    Scott
