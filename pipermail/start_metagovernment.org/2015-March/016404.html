I'd looked at this before, and it's not really clear to me how it
works.  Is there documentation?  A complete example?  I appreciate the
bootstrapping issue: It's hard to get anyone to participate unless
they can see how it works, and it's hard to show how it works unless
you've got a bunch of people contributing to it...

Not sure if you appreciate the irony of running for representative on
the platform that representative government doesn't work ;-)

I'm sometimes tempted to do this, or engage the existing powers
(representatives and/or bureaucrats) to gain their cooperation, but
have decided that this isn't the way the revolution happens. We need
to press those people to release the information we need to run a
government in parallel with theirs, but I'd have to recommend against
jumping into the fray ourselves because the issues of corruption,
legitimizing the opposition, and wasting precious resources (our time
needs to be spent building systems to enable the people to run their
government, not wasted actually trying to run the government ourselves
;-)

</I>&gt;<i> this is a real attempt to help our cause and it could go a long way for all

</I>&gt;<i> any interest.
</I>
I've signed up, but think I need more info on the system before I'd be
able to contribute anything.  I've also been satisfied with the
group's participation rate with viable systems: I learned a lot from
the Vilfredo and Loomio runs.  I've only been disappointed by the
Airesis run because I had so much trouble getting that system to work
and because of the language barrier.
  Regards,
    Scott
