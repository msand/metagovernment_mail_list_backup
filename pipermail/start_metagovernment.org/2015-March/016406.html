<PRE>So, we got plutocrats and authoritarians.
We have basically these options in this model.
Liberate from both of them in one step (1).
Liberate from one group first and the second after that (2)

1... both in one step. This might be too difficult. An attempt to do 
this may unite them temporary in one interest group.

2... one first, second after that. Two options again
     Authoritarians first (2-1)
     Plutocrats first (2-2)
2-1...Authoritarians first. Here I assume that it will be about direct 
democracy. Authoritarians will be against. And plutocrats ? They might 
loose their puppets in government. We would be facing the both again. 
Moreover plutocrats will not be target here, so they will be able to 
&quot;hit us incognito&quot;.

2-2...Plutocrats first. Here I assume democratization of business. 
Plutocrats are against, but authoritarian might be quite happy. They 
will have an opportunity to get rid of their global masters.
Please do not try this at your home or US will bomb you as &quot;terrorists&quot;. 
US must go first. As a result of democratization of business a lot of 
capital and plutocrats will move outside of US.

Now, how will authoritarians in US behave without plutocratic 
supervision ? We may expect them trying to mobilize Americans for their 
prejudices. Will they be successful ? In other words, might we expect 
scarcity in the US without plutocrats ? Please, excuse me now, I need to 
have a look at US economy and resources.
Before that. Does this email make sense to you ?

Kind regards
m.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     Authoritarians         Plutocrats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> location       national                  global
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds more like &quot;orientation&quot; to me: Authoritarians are
</I>&gt;<i> nationalist (or more accurately tribalist), but plutocrats are more
</I>&gt;<i> oriented toward economic boundaries than geopolitical boundaries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personality  prejudiced              selfish
</I>&gt;<i> I'd probably use &quot;aggressive&quot; over &quot;prejudiced&quot;.  Both groups are prejudiced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> job security voted                      inherited
</I>&gt;<i> Good, although maybe &quot;source of power&quot; would be a better name for this category.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> education    poor                        best
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly: There are a lot of very well educated authoritarians
</I>&gt;<i> (Bush/Cheney, Hitler, and Mao were all quite well educated).  If there
</I>&gt;<i> is an educational distinction, it's that plutocrats use educational
</I>&gt;<i> institution as a filter (their associates all also were educated at
</I>&gt;<i> famous private schools) whereas authoritarians will pick their
</I>&gt;<i> associates from the public at large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> safety          public person         hidden
</I>&gt;<i> Again, not exactly: Authoritarian *leaders* have to be very public,
</I>&gt;<i> but the followers do not have to be.  Maybe call this &quot;exercise of
</I>&gt;<i> power&quot;, and for authoritarians it would be &quot;through an authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> leader&quot; whereas plutocrats exercise power through *any* leadership.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deadliness   World war II           World war I, Vietnam,...
</I>&gt;<i> I'd break this into &quot;scale of conflicts&quot;, with authoritarians being
</I>&gt;<i> oriented toward large-scale and bet-the-farm conflicts whereas
</I>&gt;<i> plutocrats are more into small scale &quot;strategic advantage&quot; types of
</I>&gt;<i> conflicts.  Plutocrats are also more &quot;regime change&quot; oriented (the
</I>&gt;<i> installation and support of corrupt regimes in central and south
</I>&gt;<i> america and the Iraq war being better examples than any of the more
</I>&gt;<i> typical wars).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few more:
</I>&gt;<i> power goals              political/social       economic
</I>&gt;<i> individual freedom     suppressed           permitted
</I>&gt;<i> favorite prejudice      racial/cultural         economic class
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a hard exercise, because there are so many individuals (again
</I>&gt;<i> Bush/Cheney, Koch brothers, etc.) who are both.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope you will add some more lines.
