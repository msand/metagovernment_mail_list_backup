&gt;<i> Hello, thanks for the reply!
</I>
My pleasure, and I get a lot out of these discussions, not just
learning about other ways of doing things, but because it forces me to
understand my own proposals better. My 2 cents on the forum vs email
issue is that it doesn't matter: We're not making decisions here, or
even working on common projects. There's just no substitute for
spending a little time reading about and understanding other people's
proposals, and these come across just fine in email.

&gt;<i> Some of the thinking behind this relates quite a bit to the actual Finnish
</I>&gt;<i> mentality.
</I>&gt;<i> Of course we also have some loud people who consider themselves experts,
</I>&gt;<i> when in fact they're mostly incompetent.
</I>&gt;<i> But Finns generally seem to have somewhat good bullshit detectors in use,
</I>&gt;<i> and don't give them too much attention.
</I>
I belief this is universal: The other culture I know well is Chinese
(my wife is from Taiwan). Same problem (and solution) there.

&gt;<i> So to remedy this, we want to enable anyone who feels up for it, to claim to
</I>&gt;<i> be an expert in a category(s). This makes their votes in propositions
</I>&gt;<i> public, for the categories where they claim expertise.
</I>
But does that mean the rest of the votes are *not* public? My system
requires that, as I don't believe it is possible to build a robust
proxy system without that requirement. In fact, I don't believe it's
possible to built *any* electronic voting system without it because
it's just too easy, and too undetectable, to falsify a vote otherwise.

&gt;<i> This way people can
</I>&gt;<i> try to find peers who have skills in various categories and who approximate
</I>&gt;<i> their personal opinion closely by looking at their historical record of
</I>&gt;<i> votes. Thus if for example I know good physicists specializing in energy
</I>&gt;<i> related questions, and I know from personal experience that they are able to
</I>&gt;<i> analyze systems, processes and other related aspects to energy policies,
</I>&gt;<i> then I can choose to trust these persons, e.g. 50-100% and use them as my
</I>&gt;<i> personal approximation of opinion.
</I>
I don't follow this: Why is being an expert any guarantee, or even a
strong predictor, that they'd share your *opinion* on public policy?
Using economists as an example, one of them might be able to say
&quot;increasing minimum wage by 10% will reduce the size of the economy by
5%&quot; (they say things like this all the time. I don't believe them,
even though they are the &quot;experts&quot;, but then this is just an example
;-) *BUT* different people have different priorities. Most economists
are conservatives, which means they'll vote against the wage increase
because they're not bothered by the inequality and the greater overall
productivity is the higher priority. Progressives will think (and
vote) the opposite. It's not that they necessarily doubt the statement
(or the expertise), it just reflects different values.

Two other problems I see with using experts as proxies:
1) It takes a lot of votes (probably dozens, and both parties will
have had to make public votes on the same issues) to match proxies
(this is the bootstrapping problem).
2) People are experts in particular fields, which makes it a nightmare
to match proxies and severely limits the range of things they could
vote on (e.g., do you have a separate set of proxies for educational
issues than when voting on an environmental policy?)

Which is why I recommend the proxy system be separate from any
expert-assessment system. People can actually choose an expert (or
anyone) as a proxy in my system, it's just that they'll be know that
if they do that the expert might have different values and they'll
want to check their proxys' votes at the point where the decision has
to be made about whether to let the proxy vote go through or do a
manual override.

(big snip)

&gt;<i> A whole collection of tools will probably be helpful. We would like to make
</I>&gt;<i> our system a one-liner of html to add to any site, allowing simple
</I>&gt;<i> integrations and more custom made behavior using the REST-ful api. Hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> it would also allow private groups to vote about any trivialities as well,
</I>&gt;<i> or e.g. where should we go? what should we eat? what should we do tonight?
</I>&gt;<i> within minutes of opening our site on a smartphone. Everything is intended
</I>&gt;<i> to be MIT-licensed or some similar permissive open source license. To allow
</I>&gt;<i> any kind of organization to try out the patterns and explore the
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities.
</I>
I see these kinds of things (and Loomio markets this way a lot) as
being counterproductive. It's selling yourself and your products
short, and worse, will probably lead to bad design decisions because
you're not trying to solve the real problems. If you're not working on
a system that's designed to deal with thousands (and eventually
millions) of people who have very strong and polar opposite positions
(e.g., gun control and abortion in the US), you're wasting your and
everyone else's time. Groups of friends don't need a whiz-bang tool to
help choose a restaurant, corporate executives don't need a bunch of
&quot;input&quot; in the form of &quot;votes&quot; from their subordinates, and we don't
need a software package that helps people decide what color flowers to
plant on their street (community participation, intentional
communities, and all that other namby-pamby stuff). &quot;No guts, no
glory!&quot;, I believe is the right philosophy here. Or maybe &quot;go big or
go home!&quot; ;-)

    Scott
