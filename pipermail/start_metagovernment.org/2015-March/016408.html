That seems to me to make it even more essential that you have a
demo/tutorial/walkthrough.

&gt;<i> Anyone can post a proposal for a change in the way the world works. Then
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else can contribute to the idea with their own posts or by up voting
</I>&gt;<i> any post they agree with.
</I>
No rating or flagging?  How is this any different from what Loomio provides?

&gt;<i> The original proposer can then adopt any post into
</I>&gt;<i> their proposal by check marking it, indicating that the post be included in
</I>&gt;<i> the final version of the proposal. Once significant input has been
</I>&gt;<i> contributed the proposal can move to a voting stage where someone like a
</I>&gt;<i> president will take all the adopted posts and highly up voted criticism
</I>&gt;<i> posts and make a simplified version of what the whole idea will look like in
</I>&gt;<i> an easily read paragraph or two for the general voter.
</I>
Seems like you've just introduced a SDAP at a key point in the
process.  What's to stop them from tweaking things to preserve their
power or the status quo?  Why isn't the original proposer responsible
for the revisions?

&gt;<i> I appreciate the irony don't worry. I think this is the most direct route
</I>&gt;<i> though. If I'm elected I'll be able to release all the information myself to
</I>&gt;<i> the site allowing people to run themselves. My task afterwards would just be
</I>&gt;<i> as an active participant on the site, helping individuals legitimize their
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. I'd also be redrafting proposals for the final vote initially but
</I>&gt;<i> we'll be able to establish a more public option later. The opposition can
</I>&gt;<i> say what they want but if I'm president ultimately what I say goes and I
</I>&gt;<i> would be subject to the people. Initiating our direct democracy without
</I>&gt;<i> opposition.
</I>
Right, the benevolent dictator model of government ;-)  What happens
when Stalin succeeds you?
  Regards,
    Scott
