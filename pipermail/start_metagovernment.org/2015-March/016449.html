Oh, I don't worry too much about that: It'll be years, maybe decades,
before there will be any great call to have one of these new systems
fully replace our existing systems, during which they'll get plenty of
&quot;real world&quot; experience (better even than lab experiments, which don't
always reproduce conditions in the real world). Besides, we have a
pretty low hurdle to clear: The proposals that come out of our systems
don't have to be optimal, they just have to be better than what those
amateur social engineers in our existing governments produce.

Speaking of which, a bit of guerrilla marketing related to this: They
published my Guest Opinion in the local paper this morning:

Yeah, but as I point out on the web site, Moses was an amateur social
engineer. I'm claiming to be qualified to be a professional ;-)

&gt;<i> With that work having been done, now (for those of us interested in

</I>
Have at it! But keep in mind that none of our existing systems passed
such rigorous testing. My guess is that as long as we prevent the
SDAPs from hijacking the system (like what happened with the way Lenin
and Mao hijacked Marx's proposal), which is something Matchism is
pretty robustly designed to prevent, the danger here is pretty
minimal.

     Scott
