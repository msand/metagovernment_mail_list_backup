<PRE>I think there is difference between this syndicate and other syndicates 
and syndicalism.

I will compare it to crony capitalism.
Crony capitalism is the most competitive form we know. It has some 
weaknesses I am trying to exploit. The weakness are
cronyism (meritocracy should be more effective) and
class war, which is limiting motivation.

The usual syndicate is quite charitable organisation, its main argument 
are better wages for ordinary workers.

On the other hand my syndicate is political, its main argument is making 
&quot;neurotypical politics&quot; with the help of corruption (a way that has 
proved to be effective).
Cronyism is very limited here and should have no significant impact on 
decisions.
Motivation should be also better.
Contrary to other syndicates, this syndicate should not be charitable. 
Wages will be still little, but the syndicate will advice how to spend 
those money effectively. The goal of this syndicate is to establish 
direct democracy (not syndicalism), it should be marketed as important 
motivation.
Is it operational ?

m.

</I>&gt;<i> I didn't say they couldn't exist in non-competitive environments

</I>&gt;<i> mowed down when any real competition arrives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The main trouble might be in the current unpopularity of syndicates.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here in Czech Republic I have heard often that syndicates are return of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communism (meaning Bolshevism).
</I>&gt;<i> Not surprising, since a number of anarcho-syndicalists have explicitly
</I>&gt;<i> stated that it is but an intermediate phase in the evolutionary
</I>&gt;<i> process, the ultimate end being worldwide communism. I personally
</I>&gt;<i> don't buy these slippery-slope type of arguments, but would
</I>&gt;<i> acknowledge that many others do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   The optimal fix,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> therefore, is just to ensure that regulation is done by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neurotypicals rather than the SDAPs we have now in our current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mis-representative governments. The two cliches that apply here are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;don't throw out the baby with the bathwater&quot; and &quot;dance with the one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what brung ya&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, I understand this goal as optimal. Still I see that you largely depend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on volunteers (in Implementation Schedule).
</I>&gt;<i> Partially, although a large part of the design is to minimize the need
</I>&gt;<i> for them. Most of the &quot;work&quot; will be done by the crowd as a form of
</I>&gt;<i> entertainment. Is all the stuff posted on Facebook and Slashdot
</I>&gt;<i> created by &quot;volunteers&quot;? What if we could harness the energy of those
</I>&gt;<i> people for political rather than commercial gain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In case of stability I guess there will be not much interest in any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative (including Matchism) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in case of instability you scenario is not suitable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is it so ? What do you say ?
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, and in that case I'd say that a well designed syndicalism
</I>&gt;<i> would have a much better chance of succeeding, just as it started to
</I>&gt;<i> during the Spanish revolution. I still don't see it as a long-term
</I>&gt;<i> solution, but it could be a great a short-term patch for the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> chaos that comes when an authoritarian regime is overthrown. For
</I>&gt;<i> example the Iraqis, the Libyans, and the Egyptians would have been way
</I>&gt;<i> better off if a quick-and-dirty syndicalism could have been
</I>&gt;<i> implemented when their national governments bit the dust. Much easier
</I>&gt;<i> than training people up on a Matchist system, or any other nation-wide
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy. And of course it's much easier to bootstrap because
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't rely on a functioning infrastructure the way an electronic
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy does. The disadvantage of course is that it'll be
</I>&gt;<i> hard to encourage people to train up (even minimally) on a system
</I>&gt;<i> they'll only need if their national government fails...
