<PRE>hmm, I cannot think of any useful split between plutocrats and 
authoritarians that would give an opportunity for growth for direct 
democracy. I will leave it till later.

I will try to give different names for we are trying to achieve. I hope 
it will produce some new points of view.

At this moment we are trying to produce a system that is able to guess 
future decisions according to the decisions done. Is statistical 
analysis acceptable here ?
The guess is proposed to the voter for revision.
Is it so ?

Regards
m.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So, we got plutocrats and authoritarians.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Liberate from both of them in one step (1).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Liberate from one group first and the second after that (2)
</I>&gt;<i> I actually think it's easier than that: There is no need to &quot;liberate&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> from authoritarians because they will join and even promote the
</I>&gt;<i> movement once it gets large enough. Authoritarians aren't going to be
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to direct democracy in principle, they'll only oppose it
</I>&gt;<i> because it's different and so poses a threat to stability. But once
</I>&gt;<i> it's been shown to be effective and stable and has a sufficiently
</I>&gt;<i> large mindshare (it's got to be a lot, but probably significantly less
</I>&gt;<i> than even half) &quot;The People&quot; will become &quot;Their People&quot; and they'll
</I>&gt;<i> actually start to turn against those who *aren't* followers of the new
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1... both in one step. This might be too difficult. An attempt to do this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> may unite them temporary in one interest group.
</I>&gt;<i> This seems to me inevitable, at least at first. But again, SDAPs (at
</I>&gt;<i> least if you only include the chronically activated Authoritarians)
</I>&gt;<i> make up less than a third of the population. Once you've got even
</I>&gt;<i> close to half of the remainder, the tide will turn. Of course this
</I>&gt;<i> only works if we can keep the activation level low: Stenner says a
</I>&gt;<i> slight majority of the population has authoritarian tendencies, and
</I>&gt;<i> this is also what the Milgram experiment showed, but most of them
</I>&gt;<i> aren't activated (which is usually caused by fear of resource
</I>&gt;<i> shortages) and so act like Neurotypicals in non-threatening contexts.
</I>&gt;<i> But this is why taking advantage of a crisis is not a likely option
</I>&gt;<i> for a DD revolution: Once the authoritarians are activated, you get
</I>&gt;<i> Hitler (or Putin) and promoting a better solution to them is not an
</I>&gt;<i> easy sell.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2... one first, second after that. Two options again
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Authoritarians first (2-1)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Plutocrats first (2-2)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2-1...Authoritarians first. Here I assume that it will be about direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy. Authoritarians will be against. And plutocrats ? They might loose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> their puppets in government. We would be facing the both again. Moreover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> plutocrats will not be target here, so they will be able to &quot;hit us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incognito&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I think it's inevitable that Plutocrats, and most Social Dominators,
</I>&gt;<i> will steadfastly oppose any direct democracy system because it's them
</I>&gt;<i> that will be taking the haircut.  I don't see any way to avoid this
</I>&gt;<i> other than appealing to the old saw about a rising tide lifting all
</I>&gt;<i> boats, but fortunately they are a small minority so even if they don't
</I>&gt;<i> buy that they'll have to go along with the majority whether they like
</I>&gt;<i> it or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2-2...Plutocrats first. Here I assume democratization of business.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Plutocrats are against, but authoritarian might be quite happy. They will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have an opportunity to get rid of their global masters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please do not try this at your home or US will bomb you as &quot;terrorists&quot;. US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> must go first. As a result of democratization of business a lot of capital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and plutocrats will move outside of US.
</I>&gt;<i> I specifically call out the US as a *bad* early candidate for a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of reasons (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/implementation-schedule/">http://www.matchism.org/implementation-schedule/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> And, again, I see no reason to democratize business.  Business is fine
</I>&gt;<i> the way it is.  What we lack is adequate regulation, which is
</I>&gt;<i> something that will be easily imposed on it by The People with no real
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for those businesses to do anything about it (except maybe
</I>&gt;<i> move, as you suggest).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, how will authoritarians in US behave without plutocratic supervision ?
</I>&gt;<i> Again, they don't owe any allegiance to plutocrats.  Stenner claims
</I>&gt;<i> that a third of them lean left instead of right (something Altemeyer
</I>&gt;<i> never did really get a handle on). They're primarily concerned with
</I>&gt;<i> keeping the group together and they'll follow whatever leadership
</I>&gt;<i> claims (or shows) that it can do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We may expect them trying to mobilize Americans for their prejudices. Will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they be successful ? In other words, might we expect scarcity in the US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without plutocrats ? Please, excuse me now, I need to have a look at US
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> economy and resources.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Before that. Does this email make sense to you ?
</I>&gt;<i> The big improvement in Matchism over The Plan is that Matchism is much
</I>&gt;<i> less adversarial.  We don't need to single out any group for specific
</I>&gt;<i> treatment: If we design the system right, the dynamics will just
</I>&gt;<i> naturally steer things toward their natural Matchist conclusion. The
</I>&gt;<i> problem we have now is *purely* caused by this imbalance because the
</I>&gt;<i> Neurotypicals are just not getting their say (a significant minority
</I>&gt;<i> of them remain outside the political process entirely). Make it easier
</I>&gt;<i> (indeed automatic) for them to do so and the authoritarian and
</I>&gt;<i> plutocrat problems just go away.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
