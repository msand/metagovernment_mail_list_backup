<PRE>A few of you may be aware of my presents on the forums but probably even
less will be aware of my personal project I've been developing over the
years. My project can be found at theinternetswebsite.com it is a forum and
decision making center of close resemblance to what Scott appears to be
promoting.

What's more is I have taken a step of action to put this forum to wide
scale public use by running for the presidential position of my college. If
I'm able to be elected I will use the student budget to fund projects and
ideas based on the input of students, establishing a viable direct
democracy. Here is my platform: <A HREF="http://humberlife.com/governance/elections/">http://humberlife.com/governance/elections/</A>
For those wondering Reid is my middle name, Patrick is my first.

I think this plan is solid, the only issue I'm having at the time is
getting the first few participants online and active. This is why I'm
calling on this community to sign up to the site and participate in anyway
you can, to get some activity to build off of. I've included a couple
proposals I'd like to see that are two school specific proposals and one
worldwide specific proposal, again strangely enough very similar to Scott's
inheritance ideas in his matchism.org site. Feel free to submit whatever
proposal you like though.

Please sign up to the site and participate in anyway you can. I'm desperate
to try to get some traction with this site as voting for these elections
are only a little over a week away. Any questions or comments about the
site or my plan I'm happy to field here, I'd like the site to be process
oriented.

I know we're not the most active community at helping each other out. But
this is a real attempt to help our cause and it could go a long way for all
of us if you could support me here. Much love till then. Looking forward to
any interest.
