&gt;<i> There might be a way for successful syndicates. But it might be in some

</I>&gt;<i> Basically it will be a syndicate. There will be some basic ideological
</I>&gt;<i> values. You will make distinction between your syndicate employees (=owners)
</I>&gt;<i> and the rest of economy. Now you try to educate your employees to do a good
</I>&gt;<i> choices and produce the choices in your syndicate or find a good source and
</I>&gt;<i> promote it. You are *not* selling this to the outer market.
</I>
Sort of the opposite of &quot;radical transparency&quot;: Information about
everything that goes on within the syndicate is held within the
syndicate. This is a very powerful organizational structure because it
fully leverages our instinctive tribalism. It's how cults work, the
&quot;old boys network&quot;, and the Military Industrial Complex, which relies
on secrecy in the guise of &quot;national security&quot; to take care of its own
while screwing over everyone outside.

This is why I think public corporations, ownership of which are held
jointly by their shareholders, are the better organizational
structure. The problem with this corporate structure now is primarily
that the shareholders do *not* have the power they are due because a
SDAP board of directors has all the real power. Enforce radical
transparency and this corrupting influence goes away.

&gt;<i> To the outer economy your syndicate behaves like evil. Is producing
</I>&gt;<i> fashionable stuff for good money and hurting society (like New Age courses
</I>&gt;<i> :D , cigarettes, alcohol of lowest quality...) and spending good money on
</I>&gt;<i> marketing, lobbying and corruption.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I think syndicate can corrupt, you just need to pay somebody well for
</I>&gt;<i> some result, you do not need to know how he did it. Of course this is
</I>&gt;<i> exception from equal distribution of income.
</I>
Except within the syndicate, of course.  You're free to implement
whatever distribution policy you want there.

&gt;<i> Now your are not total evils. You are so kind that you take care about
</I>&gt;<i> unemployed people and you let them to enter your education courses and buy
</I>&gt;<i> the same products as your employees enjoy. They prove themselves with their
</I>&gt;<i> request for unemployment benefits.
</I>
The common recruitment mode for street gangs, another instantiation of
tribalism.

&gt;<i> What is your advantage ? You do not need to spend much money on recruitment,
</I>&gt;<i> fluctuation should be low even with low wages, because you produce a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> other stuff for your employees than just money. You are trying to make their
</I>&gt;<i> lives easy and happy. Your morale and health should be also better than
</I>&gt;<i> average, if you understand your tactics and you are OK with it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If correct, your syndicate should grow. People in other businesses should
</I>&gt;<i> suffer a little bit more, that should provide opportunity for growth. When
</I>&gt;<i> you are big enough in some state you should be able to &quot;corrupt&quot; your state
</I>&gt;<i> into direct democracy.
</I>
But why would you bother? You and your people already have everything
they need! Instead you'd naturally use this corruptive power to weaken
the government to reduce the effectness of laws and so solidify your
(and your tribe's) position and grow it if possible.

This is also related to the government structure in the utopian novel
&quot;Looking Backward&quot; where corporate mergers eventually reach their
asymptotic conclusion and the world is run by one huge corporation.
Which naturally looks after everyone because they're all &quot;valued
employees&quot;.
