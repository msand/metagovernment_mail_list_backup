<PRE>Hello everyone involved in Metagovernment!

This will be my first communication to the mailing list, so some 
introduction probably maybe useful.
Introduction

tl;dr; I'm a computer scientist involved in e.g. the OpenDemocracy.fi 
project

I subscribed to this mailing list a few years back when we added 
OpenDemocracy.fi to the Metagovernment list of projects. I was reading 
every e-mail for some months (years?) and attempting to resolve the 
major discussion topics in my mind and figure out some suitable 
structure to attempt building and testing. At some point, the volume and 
mess of the format became more than my life, studies, work and research 
allowed for and I almost completely stopped reading the e-mails.

Meanwhile, we built an open source range-voting (-100% to +100%) and 
self proclaimed expert-trust range based representation for opinion 
approximation. We did it as a project course in the university, and 
wanted to experiment with technologies which we had no previous 
experience with. So we built a prototype using Vaadin, Spring, Roo, 
OpenId, OpenAuth, etc. At first we were four developers and we planned 
the amount of work accordingly. After some time, two of the developers 
had to leave because of some personal circumstances, and there we were, 
two developers eagerly having planned far too much work, using 
technology combinations which had too much learning curve given the 
circumstances. The end result was a working system, but nothing we 
wanted to show or tell about to people. It didn't feel fully usable nor 
scalable.

The models and concepts we had in use received support from e.g. Hannu 
Nurmi, a local professor / expert in voting theory, systems, decision 
and game theory etc. <A HREF="http://users.utu.fi/hnurmi/homepage/webpub.pdf">http://users.utu.fi/hnurmi/homepage/webpub.pdf</A>

We also started a non-profit organization which exists to this day, but 
hasn't had major activities recently. We also received some media 
interest and the Finnish people seem very positive and open to the ideas 
and concepts.

I have a master of science degree with major in computer science and 
minors in physics and mathematics. I wrote my master thesis on the topic 
of &quot;Quantum Computation and Algorithms using Hilbert-spaces and the 
Quantum Circuit Model&quot;. I have worked almost a year in the financial 
industry with analyzing and visualizing data relating to the banks, 
central banks, insurers, nations, currencies, securities and other 
macro-prudential risks and oversight. This job has finally ended (thank 
you existence and everything holy!) and currently I'm starting to work 
as a researcher at &#197;bo Akademi University where I'll be employed as 
project manager and coder for a project in the industrial economy 
department. I'll be working on removing some of the major inefficiencies 
of one of the most wasteful industries in the world, shipping. I also 
have a side project: <A HREF="http://www.infnitewhiteboard.com">http://www.infnitewhiteboard.com</A> and currently I'm 
prototyping a new system called the infinite white space. We also have 
some other open-source real-time peer-to-peer initiatives which 
hopefully will result in university spin-offs and other organizations 
with benefits to the general public.



Today

Today I started reading the latest emails in the list again, and felt 
positively surprised by the kind of language/linguistics in use. 
Therefore I decided to write this e-mail as an open invitation for 
collaboration and further discussion.

Our current direction involves keeping the data models and interfaces 
from our first OpenDemocracy.fi prototype. We currently have a Swagger 
specification defined. Using this, anyone can generate the boilerplate 
code needed to create servers and clients using any of the programming 
languages which have swagger implementations available. This creates 
REST-ful clients and servers which allow creating categorized 
propositions with options, casting range-votes and comments for each 
option, claiming to be an expert in some category, trusting some 
self-proclaimed expert in some category.

If a user decides to give positive trust to some self proclaimed experts 
in some category, then we use the votes of those experts as an 
approximation of the opinion of the user, for this category. This 
applies until the user decides to cast a vote in a proposition, at which 
point we use their latest vote as an approximation of their current 
opinion. Thus if a user feels improperly represented by any collection 
of experts and combination of trust to them, then they can just vote 
directly in all the topics of relevance to them. This allows adapting to 
good experts gone bad, by removing trust or even recommending others not 
to trust, represented as negative trust.

This system might allow studying changes in opinion over time, as it 
allows continued updating of timestamped opinion approximations, and can 
allow monitoring the progress and perceived successes/failures of 
implemented propositions.

We're now considering to implement a minimal responsive mobile first 
version using Meteor and Polymer, releasing this on github and writing 
some tutorials to help others try to build similar web standards based 
things. Optimally we could try to interface with some other projects and 
try to properly integrate open data-sharing protocols. Hopefully this 
could lead to fast enough iteration and gamification, such that people 
would enjoy using the systems and improve in the process.

So count us in on the presentations and discussions relating to common 
roadmaps.

With love and respect
Mikael Sand and the rest of the OpenDemocracy.fi team
