<PRE>Hi,

I have elaborated it a little bit. I is not any joke.

At the moment when the human chain becomes impractically long the group 
may switch to other symbol, shared colour. Weirdly the easiest way of 
colour signalling are party hats, because you can easily monitor them 
from above. There should be minimal length of chain that wants to switch 
to colour. It may be the length of agora.
Proposal is now recognized under some colour. The relation of proposal 
to colour is public (on the board, uploaded etc.) As we see now the 
proposal should exist in print from the very beginning in order to be 
trustworthy.

The connection to other agoras may happen through any media. The more 
reliable forms are the forms that keep the text of the proposal unchanged.

Whether is decision valid depends on local custom. The decisive 
information for other citizens is a photo of agora, where they can see 
heads ( with party hats).

Please tell me something. Do you like it ?

Regards
m.
