I'm a little concerned about this. I'm actually working on the design
for this for my Matchsys and am also struggling with the issue of how
to integrate expertise into the system. Should experts be 1) self
appointed, 2) verified with Credentials (e.g., having your degree and
even course work made part of your public profile), or 3)
nominated/recognized by others? My current thinking is to support both
2 and 3. The problem with self-appointed experts being the Dunning
Krueger effect (i.e., a lot of those guys are so generally incompetent
that they're unable to recognize the fact that they're incompetent).
What makes #3 viable is the realm of folk psychology and folk science,
e.g., Keil 2010:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/refs/Keil_2010_FolkScience.pdf">http://www.matchism.org/refs/Keil_2010_FolkScience.pdf</A>

The basic proposition is that people can *recognize* expertise even
when they don't possess it themselves (how to reconcile this with
Dunning Krueger is tricky, but I think the hook relates to the
difference between judging your own competence vs. judging competence
of others).

As an exercise for you, please try this, which appeared last week in
my local paper:
<A HREF="http://www.dailycamera.com/opinion/ci_27754580/martin-hertzberg:-no-such-thing">http://www.dailycamera.com/opinion/ci_27754580/martin-hertzberg:-no-such-thing</A>

As a life-long science nut, it's obvious to me that this guy is
incompetent. Can you tell? Do you think the average citizen making a
decision on e.g., a carbon tax would be able to?

I'd also recommend decoupling the proxy issue from the expertise, as I
do. There are plenty of domains where things other than expertise
should be used to make decisions. The view of economists (who are
generally very conservative) on wealth redistribution being a good
example of this. Even granting that being an &quot;economist&quot; is a form of
expertise, which is something I personally question ;-)

&gt;<i>  Thus if a user feels
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improperly represented by any collection of experts and combination of trust
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to them, then they can just vote directly in all the topics of relevance to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them. This allows adapting to good experts gone bad, by removing trust or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even recommending others not to trust, represented as negative trust.
</I>
Again, conflating two independent needs into the same system. The
&quot;good experts&quot; might help you understand an issue (via their
insightful comments), but they shouldn't be automatically used as
proxies. People should have to pick those based on their
moral/ideological preferences. For example see the matchism Goals
section:
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/goals/">http://matchism.org/goals/</A>

&gt;<i> This system might allow studying changes in opinion over time, as it
</I>&gt;<i> allows continued updating of timestamped opinion approximations, and can
</I>&gt;<i> allow monitoring the progress and perceived successes/failures of
</I>&gt;<i> implemented propositions.
</I>
This might be a bit of overkill. Remember, the main goal has to be to
minimize the time required to participate. If you're tracking changes
over time, what that says to me is that either the proposers don't
know what they're doing, or that it is premature to propose a
law/policy in this area. Facilitating debate over (in the US) gun
control or abortion is just not the business we're in. Let that stuff
happen on Facebook or some other forum. When the population is ready
to decide on an issue, we'll know because a properly written proposal
will just pass with minimal debate.
  Regards,
    Scott
