</I>I expect the management positions to be voted in some way. If we want to 
keep them out of charge, we should not take them inside. On the other 
hand they may work as lobbyists that are outsourced (without right to 
vote and be voted) or in other outsourced services.

</I>Maybe, but

The main trouble might be in the current unpopularity of syndicates.
Here in Czech Republic I have heard often that syndicates are return of 
communism (meaning Bolshevism).

&gt;<i>   The optimal fix,
</I>&gt;<i> therefore, is just to ensure that regulation is done by the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals rather than the SDAPs we have now in our current
</I>&gt;<i> mis-representative governments. The two cliches that apply here are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;don't throw out the baby with the bathwater&quot; and &quot;dance with the one
</I>&gt;<i> what brung ya&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, I understand this goal as optimal. Still I see that you largely 
depend on volunteers (in Implementation Schedule).
In case of stability I guess there will be not much interest in any 
alternative (including Matchism) and
in case of instability you scenario is not suitable.
Is it so ? What do you say ?
