<PRE>Dear members,

I have found some inspiration in Bookchin's Ecology of Freedom. I'm not 
yet finished reading, but I would like to write something :)
Beware, this proposal is rather odd.

Imagine meetings in agora where people are allowed to enter and leave in 
pairs, pairs according to their sexuality. They are allowed to enter 
with children, but children just play there separately.

According to your sexuality you select your discussion partner (no need 
to have crush on her or him), she or he is expected to talk to you no 
matter her or his sexuality, preference or marital status.

At the moment when you reach a consensus about what should be decided 
today you start creating a human chain ( white gloves are acceptable). 
You are free to leave the chain, if you change your mind. At the moment 
when some chain is dominating agora and there are no reasonable 
objections to it, the decision is accepted and after next meeting is 
enforceable by its supporters. Every decision may be changed on any 
meeting in agora.

Now, our job might be to find a way how to establish some communication 
between these meetings in agoras. I guess some uploaded videos with 
basic statements and arguments should be suitable at the beginning.

I hope you have found some inspiration in my proposal.

I would be grateful for any attempts for improvement and any references 
to similar &quot;decision making games&quot;.

Kind regards
Michael
