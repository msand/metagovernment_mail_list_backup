OK, so that's two social engineers on this list ;-)  Any others?

When researching to make the call about whether it was worth trying to
rehabilitate &quot;social engineering&quot; as a meme I looked to see if anyone
was actually using it in an academic setting. I only found a few, in
Japan. Perhaps because it's originally written in Japanese where that
concept hasn't been corrupted to mean &quot;behavioral engineering&quot; as it
has in English-speaking countries e.g.,:
<A HREF="http://www.soc.titech.ac.jp/information_En/whatissoc.html">http://www.soc.titech.ac.jp/information_En/whatissoc.html</A>

&gt;<i> The &quot;best&quot; way to persuade people that a new social system arrangement will
</I>&gt;<i> make the world a better place is to test it (in the laboratory) and thereby
</I>&gt;<i> demonstrate that there is good (scientific, engineering) reason to expect
</I>&gt;<i> that it will have that effect if implemented in the real world.
</I>
Meh, people don't trust egg-heads. On this I agree with the others:
Build it and they will come. My difference with them is only in how to
go about building it, not in how to market it.

&gt;<i> Any MatchSpec proposals that do get implemented and then prove to be bad
</I>&gt;<i> ideas should not cause you to consider the project a success. What matters
</I>&gt;<i> most is whether the implementations produce good outcomes, not whether the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals pass.
</I>
Agreed. I'm just saying the odds of them even *passing* are low unless
they are marketed properly. In which case whether they'd work or not
is a moot question.

&gt;<i> My view is that &quot;proper&quot; marketing needs to be based PRIMARILY on
</I>&gt;<i> DEMONSTRATING the goodness of the proposals through LABORATORY TESTING. (I
</I>&gt;<i> see marketing without testing as irresponsible. The Founding Fathers, the
</I>&gt;<i> Bolshevists, and the Nazis all did great at marketing.)
</I>
Again, good points. I would just encourage you not to set too high a
standard, for Matchism or for your own project. We don't have to know
everything to know that what we're building is better than our
existing systems. As long as you take obvious design precautions (like
ensuring that SDAPs can't take control over the legislative branch),
the risks are IMHO very small.
  Regards,
    Scott
