<PRE>Alex, thanks! That was a nice little brainstorm. It is now going into my 
&quot;chew on&quot; file as I play around with User Interface options for the kind 
of decision system that we are talking about.

</I>&gt;<i> repositories of libraries it depends on) has its own &quot;github issues&quot;, 
</I>&gt;<i> where you can discuss certain things and closing it down using a &quot;pull

</I>&gt;<i> in this side discussion, people could propose solutions (how to 
</I>&gt;<i> rephrase things) ...and if it gets enough votes or the &quot;owner&quot; of the 
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is happy, he merges it back into the original text, closing 
</I>&gt;<i> the discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If people are not happy with how a document owner evolves the 
</I>&gt;<i> document, they can fork it and own it themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> Features like &quot;subscription to updates of the original document&quot; are 
</I>&gt;<i> thinkable, so that, if people are fine with it, could immediately 
</I>&gt;<i> receive all new versions of a certain solved conflict (in the sense of 
</I>&gt;<i> words or sentences that were discussed and for which a solution was 
</I>&gt;<i> found for the &quot;the original&quot; or a &quot;certain fork&quot; =&gt; all &quot;forks&quot; can be 
</I>&gt;<i> informed and maybe accepting that change in their fork too - keeping

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. So this is one thing - each individual could now have his own 
</I>&gt;<i> repositories and ongoing discussions and track his own progress in general
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Each discussion (example: go to a blog entry in a medium.com 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://medium.com">http://medium.com</A>&gt; blog and select text) ... could in addition have 
</I>&gt;<i> some &quot;stats&quot; that show aggreements and disaggrements in an attached 
</I>&gt;<i> info box. (Exactly how that would work and what needs to be shown, has 
</I>&gt;<i> to be experimented with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe, given enough time, github or tools around github that use 
</I>&gt;<i> the github API, will evolve into this.
</I>&gt;<i> It could be done by people from metagovernment or anyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> Its perfect to prototype solutions (because github and its API exists 
</I>&gt;<i> and lots of people are on there and have accounts)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; Once, a nice working solution has been prototyped, it can be 
</I>&gt;<i> thought of how to make it &quot;independent&quot; from github and use it in 
</I>&gt;<i> other contexts, but thinking about that and similar problems in the 
</I>&gt;<i> prototyping phase doesnt make sense.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basically, someone should just create a github repository and start 
</I>&gt;<i> hacking on a solution - that could start with &quot;github issues&quot;

</I>&gt;<i>         The problem with mailinglists are, that it does not track
</I>&gt;<i>         progress.
</I>&gt;<i>         You need a system, that &quot;over time&quot; captures all the little
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;aggreements&quot; and shows where there is still &quot;disagreement&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>         so that participants can focus on that.
</I>&gt;<i>         Thus: The system needs to make &quot;proposals&quot; to participants
</I>&gt;<i>         about &quot;potential micro agreements&quot; and if they accepts, they
</I>&gt;<i>         are shown in the discussion all the time to everyone, so they
</I>&gt;<i>         do not lose focus.
</I>&gt;<i>         =&gt; This way, things can slowly build up without repeating
</I>&gt;<i>         everything all the time.
</I>&gt;<i>         =&gt; It also gives motivation to focus on micro agreements
</I>&gt;<i>         instead of creating big blobs of text to drown others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Alex, YES! Great statement of one of the problems-to-be-solved!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The Blinap design will address this problem, but there are many
</I>&gt;<i>     other possible designs that would as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Do you know of any such designs (that would at least be better
</I>&gt;<i>     than email) that are up and running at this point that we could use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (We -- or at least I -- have still not taken Airesis out for a
</I>&gt;<i>     spin, so I don't know the extent to which it addresses this problem.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I have seen that you like Git these days -- could you jury-rig a
</I>&gt;<i>     progress-tracking/applying system in Git?
