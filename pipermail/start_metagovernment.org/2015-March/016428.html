</I>
True enough, I should work on one.

&gt;<i> No rating or flagging?  How is this any different from what Loomio
</I>provides?

Rating is done on every post, the amount of up arrows a post gets (I call
it a prop) the quicker it rises on the feed and the higher the posters
overall rating is. A new post always starts on the top of the feed and then
drops down unless fueled by props. There is no down vote but there is a
report/flag button that can result in a suspension if a post receives many
reports/flags. There's also a search engine to look for any past posts.

&gt;<i> Seems like you've just introduced a SDAP at a key point in the
</I>&gt;<i> process.  What's to stop them from tweaking things to preserve their
</I>&gt;<i> power or the status quo?  Why isn't the original proposer responsible
</I>&gt;<i>for the revisions?
</I>
Every ideas man isn't an writer. The original proposer has swayed to the
public opinion as best as they can, adding comments and tweaking their idea
anywhere that there was public support for, this is all done in an attempt
to compromise to best suit public opinion. I argue you then need a trusted
source to summarize all the points at the end of the discussion because an
original proposer would just summarize whatever would get them votes, they
wouldn't include the damning facts of the proposal. This is why you need an
outsider to break it down truthfully, initially I would do it, but in time
we would establish trusted individuals who always reported the stories with
accuracy, they would become like our trusted reporters and be compensated
for their work.

&gt;<i> Right, the benevolent dictator model of government ;-)  What happens
</I>&gt;<i> when Stalin succeeds you?
</I>
The site is not at it's most capable yet, when all is done there will be no
need for a successor. It will all be run through an open source program
that regulates itself. Wired in to every interaction and transaction, it
would all be transparent. Improvements to the code would have to be checked
and approved by a super majority, otherwise they should never change. No
one need be in charge of the whole thing. We're all watching it equally.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's a pretty straight forward process, but it's hard to put into a

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyone can post a proposal for a change in the way the world works. Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anyone else can contribute to the idea with their own posts or by up

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The original proposer can then adopt any post into
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their proposal by check marking it, indicating that the post be included
</I>&gt;<i> in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the final version of the proposal. Once significant input has been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contributed the proposal can move to a voting stage where someone like a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; president will take all the adopted posts and highly up voted criticism
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posts and make a simplified version of what the whole idea will look
</I>&gt;<i> like in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; an easily read paragraph or two for the general voter.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I appreciate the irony don't worry. I think this is the most direct route
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though. If I'm elected I'll be able to release all the information
</I>&gt;<i> myself to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the site allowing people to run themselves. My task afterwards would
</I>&gt;<i> just be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as an active participant on the site, helping individuals legitimize
</I>&gt;<i> their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals. I'd also be redrafting proposals for the final vote initially
</I>&gt;<i> but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; we'll be able to establish a more public option later. The opposition can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say what they want but if I'm president ultimately what I say goes and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be subject to the people. Initiating our direct democracy without
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposition.
