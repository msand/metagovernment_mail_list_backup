Here are simple-minded descriptions of The Scientific Method and The 
Engineering Method:
<A HREF="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method.shtml">http://www.sciencebuddies.org/engineering-design-process/engineering-design-compare-scientific-method.shtml</A> 


Both of these methods involve testing the hypotheses/prototypes in 
harmless laboratory settings, before putting them into effect in &quot;lives 
at risk&quot; settings.

You have done great work in having traveled to the Olympian Heights of 
Mt. Raney and there having inscribed upon a single monolithic Stone 
Tablet (a.k.a. website) all of the scientific hypotheses and prototype 
designs of Matchism.

With that work having been done, now (for those of us interested in 
approaching social system change through science and engineering), the 
next step is to test all of those scientific hypotheses and prototype 
designs in LABORATORY SETTINGS, that do not immediately put &quot;lives at 
risk&quot; through &quot;betting the farm&quot; that completely untested new ideas will 
prove to be adequately workable in real-world practice.
