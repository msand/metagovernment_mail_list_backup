<PRE>personally, i'm not aware of any.
1. I still like &quot;medium.com&quot; as a blog engine a lot, because it allows to
comment on arbitrary selected text instead of just commenting below.
2. I like google docs and it's collaboration feature for the same reason.

(This would kind of make it possible to &quot;branch off&quot; for certain
&quot;statements&quot; in a text and discuss until it can be marked as solved by the
participants and the result &quot;merged&quot; back into the original text, closing
the discussion about a certain &quot;word&quot; or &quot;Sentence&quot; with was selected when
the discussion started.


GITHUB has this kind of mechanism in a very rough version in the sense,
that open source code repositories depend on others and (think of them as
words or sentences used in a bigger cross-repository software project) each
repository (the current one and all repositories of libraries it depends
on) has its own &quot;github issues&quot;, where you can discuss certain things and
closing it down using a &quot;pull request&quot; (that might solve it.  .... to
simplify this to &quot;medium.com&quot; or &quot;google docs&quot; discussion of sentences,
 .... in this side discussion, people could propose solutions (how to
rephrase things) ...and if it gets enough votes or the &quot;owner&quot; of the
proposal is happy, he merges it back into the original text, closing the
discussion.

If people are not happy with how a document owner evolves the document,
they can fork it and own it themselves.
Features like &quot;subscription to updates of the original document&quot; are
thinkable, so that, if people are fine with it, could immediately receive
all new versions of a certain solved conflict (in the sense of words or
sentences that were discussed and for which a solution was found for the
&quot;the original&quot; or a &quot;certain fork&quot; =&gt; all &quot;forks&quot; can be informed and maybe
accepting that change in their fork too - keeping forks closer to each
other, just being different in the parts that where the reasons for the
fork.


1. So this is one thing - each individual could now have his own
repositories and ongoing discussions and track his own progress in general

2. Each discussion (example: go to a blog entry in a medium.com blog and
select text) ... could in addition have some &quot;stats&quot; that show aggreements
and disaggrements in an attached info box. (Exactly how that would work and
what needs to be shown, has to be experimented with.


I believe, given enough time, github or tools around github that use the
github API, will evolve into this.
It could be done by people from metagovernment or anyone else.
Its perfect to prototype solutions (because github and its API exists and
lots of people are on there and have accounts)

=&gt; Once, a nice working solution has been prototyped, it can be thought of
how to make it &quot;independent&quot; from github and use it in other contexts, but
thinking about that and similar problems in the prototyping phase doesnt
make sense.

Basically, someone should just create a github repository and start hacking
on a solution - that could start with &quot;github issues&quot;
