<PRE>The payment do not need to be small, it may be big.
I have the disadvantage that I live in a small country, but it still works.
We have 11M citizens. If I ask every citizen that was born on March 1st 
with his year of birth ending ***5 I will get 3014 citizens that should 
make todays decisions. The may get paid 3650times the tax imposed on 
every citizen. So the tax worth $1 per capita is more than enough.

Moreover you can still combine this method with other methods that you 
have mentioned. Still proxies are not so economic a statistical sampling.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm still thinking proxies are the only viable option.  My

</I>&gt;<i> 1) provide tools to help identify suitable proxies (people who will
</I>&gt;<i> most likely vote like you would)
</I>&gt;<i> 2) allow selection of multiple proxies (redundancy in case some don't vote)
</I>&gt;<i> 3) have a two-phase voting process (you see how your proxies would
</I>&gt;<i> vote for you, then get a chance to make a direct vote if the
</I>&gt;<i> particular proposal is contentious).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 and 3 also require open voting.
