<PRE>There might be a way for successful syndicates. But it might be in some 
sense opposite of what was the recent proposal.

Basically it will be a syndicate. There will be some basic ideological 
values. You will make distinction between your syndicate employees 
(=owners) and the rest of economy. Now you try to educate your employees 
to do a good choices and produce the choices in your syndicate or find a 
good source and promote it. You are *not* selling this to the outer market.

To the outer economy your syndicate behaves like evil. Is producing 
fashionable stuff for good money and hurting society (like New Age 
courses :D , cigarettes, alcohol of lowest quality...) and spending good 
money on marketing, lobbying and corruption.
Yes, I think syndicate can corrupt, you just need to pay somebody well 
for some result, you do not need to know how he did it. Of course this 
is exception from equal distribution of income.

Now your are not total evils. You are so kind that you take care about 
unemployed people and you let them to enter your education courses and 
buy the same products as your employees enjoy. They prove themselves 
with their request for unemployment benefits.

What is your advantage ? You do not need to spend much money on 
recruitment, fluctuation should be low even with low wages, because you 
produce a lot of other stuff for your employees than just money. You are 
trying to make their lives easy and happy. Your morale and health should 
be also better than average, if you understand your tactics and you are 
OK with it.

If correct, your syndicate should grow. People in other businesses 
should suffer a little bit more, that should provide opportunity for 
growth. When you are big enough in some state you should be able to 
&quot;corrupt&quot; your state into direct democracy.

Kind regards
