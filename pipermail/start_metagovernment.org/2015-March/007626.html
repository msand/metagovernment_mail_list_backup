Again, I don't think you need to &quot;solve&quot; this at all: Just design the
system such that the Neurotypical preference is always included at it
will just go away...

&gt;<i> I will try to give different names for we are trying to achieve. I hope it
</I>&gt;<i> will produce some new points of view.
</I>
The art of social engineering: A lot of it is just reframing the
question such that people's prejudices are exposed and they are forced
to rationally deal with the issue rather than just going with those
unexamined prejudices.

&gt;<i> At this moment we are trying to produce a system that is able to guess
</I>&gt;<i> future decisions according to the decisions done. Is statistical analysis
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable here ?
</I>
Yes, but you've got to use the right data as input. I'm actually in
the middle of the design for this and have found that I don't like any
of my options. Using past votes for matching proxies sounds
reasonable, but has several serious flaws:
1) The new voter doesn't have a voting record, so there's a
bootstrapping problem.
2) Most proposals provide very little information about a persons
general inclinations. People hold their nose and vote for compromises
even if they disagree with major portions of a bill. They vote against
things because they disagree with technical details in a particular
proposal.
3) An individual's position on the issues evolves over time. There is
no way to incorporate this into a vote-based matching system.

My next run at this was to consider personality characteristics.  The
Political Compass quiz (<A HREF="http://www.politicalcompass.org/">http://www.politicalcompass.org/</A>) seemed to do
what I want, but it's too long and is proprietary. Haidt's Moral
Foundations Theory questionaire (<A HREF="http://www.yourmorals.org/">http://www.yourmorals.org/</A>) looked
good to me for awhile, but it too is a bit long, and concentrates on
things that should not be used to match proxies. There's a crucial
distinction here in that we're trying to match voting preferences, not
ideologies.

So I'm thinking of doing the social engineering thing and reframing
the question. My current idea is to use a &quot;power&quot; based list in hopes
of extracting the general tendencies without falling into the trap of
matching ideologies or positions on a few contentious issues. Here's
my current draft. It's based on a 5-point rating scale. Have I missed
anything? Is there a better way to do this?

=================================================
This section concerns your perceptions of the balance of power in your
country. Be sure to consider all sources of influence (people, money,
laws/regulations/policies, threat of violence, etc.) and its effect on
all types of freedom and behavior (economic, political, social, etc.).
Note that in some cases the power doesn't originate in a group/entity
itself, but is exercised on its behalf.

Rate from &quot;way too little&quot; through &quot;about right&quot; to &quot;way too much&quot;.
Choose &quot;no answer&quot; if you're not sure or don't want to have your
opinion on that issue used to match you to proxies.

Local government

National government

Other national governments

Individuals in your country

Individuals in other countries

Rich people

Poor people

Old (retired) people

Children

Immigrants and racial/cultural minorities

Businesses/Corporations/Developers

Unions

Organized Religion/Moral Leaders

The media

Educators and scientists

The environment

Military of your country

Military of other countries

=================================================

&gt;<i> The guess is proposed to the voter for revision.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it so ?
</I>
That's my proposal: Do a simple averaging of an individual's chosen
proxies to determine the vote, present that to them in an email (or
SMS) and ask if they want to override it. No response means the proxy
vote goes through.

   Scott
