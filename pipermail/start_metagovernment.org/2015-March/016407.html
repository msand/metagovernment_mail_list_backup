</I>
I actually think it's easier than that: There is no need to &quot;liberate&quot;
from authoritarians because they will join and even promote the
movement once it gets large enough. Authoritarians aren't going to be
opposed to direct democracy in principle, they'll only oppose it
because it's different and so poses a threat to stability. But once
it's been shown to be effective and stable and has a sufficiently
large mindshare (it's got to be a lot, but probably significantly less
than even half) &quot;The People&quot; will become &quot;Their People&quot; and they'll
actually start to turn against those who *aren't* followers of the new
system.

&gt;<i> 1... both in one step. This might be too difficult. An attempt to do this
</I>&gt;<i> may unite them temporary in one interest group.
</I>
This seems to me inevitable, at least at first. But again, SDAPs (at
least if you only include the chronically activated Authoritarians)
make up less than a third of the population. Once you've got even
close to half of the remainder, the tide will turn. Of course this
only works if we can keep the activation level low: Stenner says a
slight majority of the population has authoritarian tendencies, and
this is also what the Milgram experiment showed, but most of them
aren't activated (which is usually caused by fear of resource
shortages) and so act like Neurotypicals in non-threatening contexts.
But this is why taking advantage of a crisis is not a likely option
for a DD revolution: Once the authoritarians are activated, you get
Hitler (or Putin) and promoting a better solution to them is not an
easy sell.

&gt;<i> 2... one first, second after that. Two options again
</I>&gt;<i>     Authoritarians first (2-1)
</I>&gt;<i>     Plutocrats first (2-2)
</I>&gt;<i> 2-1...Authoritarians first. Here I assume that it will be about direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. Authoritarians will be against. And plutocrats ? They might loose
</I>&gt;<i> their puppets in government. We would be facing the both again. Moreover
</I>&gt;<i> plutocrats will not be target here, so they will be able to &quot;hit us
</I>&gt;<i> incognito&quot;.
</I>
I think it's inevitable that Plutocrats, and most Social Dominators,
will steadfastly oppose any direct democracy system because it's them
that will be taking the haircut.  I don't see any way to avoid this
other than appealing to the old saw about a rising tide lifting all
boats, but fortunately they are a small minority so even if they don't
buy that they'll have to go along with the majority whether they like
it or not.

&gt;<i> 2-2...Plutocrats first. Here I assume democratization of business.
</I>&gt;<i> Plutocrats are against, but authoritarian might be quite happy. They will
</I>&gt;<i> have an opportunity to get rid of their global masters.
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not try this at your home or US will bomb you as &quot;terrorists&quot;. US
</I>&gt;<i> must go first. As a result of democratization of business a lot of capital
</I>&gt;<i> and plutocrats will move outside of US.
</I>
I specifically call out the US as a *bad* early candidate for a
variety of reasons (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/implementation-schedule/">http://www.matchism.org/implementation-schedule/</A>).
And, again, I see no reason to democratize business.  Business is fine
the way it is.  What we lack is adequate regulation, which is
something that will be easily imposed on it by The People with no real
opportunity for those businesses to do anything about it (except maybe
move, as you suggest).

&gt;<i> Now, how will authoritarians in US behave without plutocratic supervision ?
</I>
Again, they don't owe any allegiance to plutocrats.  Stenner claims
that a third of them lean left instead of right (something Altemeyer
never did really get a handle on). They're primarily concerned with
keeping the group together and they'll follow whatever leadership
claims (or shows) that it can do that.

&gt;<i> We may expect them trying to mobilize Americans for their prejudices. Will
</I>&gt;<i> they be successful ? In other words, might we expect scarcity in the US
</I>&gt;<i> without plutocrats ? Please, excuse me now, I need to have a look at US
</I>&gt;<i> economy and resources.
</I>&gt;<i> Before that. Does this email make sense to you ?
</I>
The big improvement in Matchism over The Plan is that Matchism is much
less adversarial.  We don't need to single out any group for specific
treatment: If we design the system right, the dynamics will just
naturally steer things toward their natural Matchist conclusion. The
problem we have now is *purely* caused by this imbalance because the
Neurotypicals are just not getting their say (a significant minority
of them remain outside the political process entirely). Make it easier
(indeed automatic) for them to do so and the authoritarian and
plutocrat problems just go away.
  Regards,
    Scott
