<PRE>(snip)


I've contemplated the pro and con list idea before, I came to a few
problems that you might be able to address. 1) You would need a neutral
category as well, if a user has a question about the proposal, this is
neither pro nor con. 2) Do you intend to have a pro con list to each
comment or just the proposal? I think this would gum up any flow of
conversation once a debate began. 3) People gaming the system, say adding a
pro to the con list instead and getting it 5 star rated so it stays at the
top. Makes for additional moderating/flagging that isn't necessary
otherwise.


Having every comment listed on one feed is easier visually I think. The
comment header should be enough to determine if this comment is a pro or
con statement.

(snip)

&gt;&gt;<i> Each time a comment gets a reply it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bumped to the top of the feed, however the comment falls down the feed if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's not supported by props, This gives us a mixture of both types, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> helps highlight the best debates which will fuel conversation. The final
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of a proposal should be brief but the discussion beforehand
</I>should
&gt;&gt;<i> be engaging. Keeping comment limited to just props won't rank the
</I>comments
&gt;&gt;<i> in any order of goodness, it instead helps them all fluctuate which adds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> variety. Only at the end will the highest rated comments be ranked, at
</I>this
&gt;&gt;<i> time it will be proven that this comment speaks to a lot of people and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be taken into consideration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you propose to support threading (comments on comments)? I'm trying
</I>&gt;<i> to figure out if there's a way to do this and allow sorting by
</I>&gt;<i> rating...
</I>

My site is a fully threaded forum yes. I assume yours will be as well?

&gt;&gt;<i> Each proposal gets redrafted by a bunch of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;professionals&quot; and the most accurate one gets chosen by the
</I>participants of
&gt;&gt;<i> the discussion. As long as the re-drafter included the key points the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participants would give that individual a good rating and a trust system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be established.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know, still seems complicated, timeconsuming, and vulnerable
</I>&gt;<i> to exploit to me. My prediction is still that the vast majority of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals will come from the Managers (the executive branch), which
</I>&gt;<i> means all this stuff just isn't necessary except in the rare case when
</I>&gt;<i> you want to provide support for a marginally competent proposer.
</I>

If these re-drafts were fair enough to gain the support of the original
proposer as well as all the highest rated commenters then there would be no
issue, right? Everyone agreed this was an accurate summary. I think this is
achievable, the re-drafters include the top comments in the summary and
gain their approval. Original proposers want to see their proposal go
through to the vote so they would approve as many redrafts as they thought
was fair in hopes that top commenters would do so as well.


It's only time consuming for the people already invested in the proposal,
they should not mind one final step in selecting the best re-draft. For the
casual user it minimizes excessive text, allowing them to understand the
proposal easier, instead of combing though what could be very technical
talk.


I don't think it's venerable to exploit, the re-drafters need to be true to
the original discussion if they hope to be chosen as the final proposal,
this ensures only the most accurate one is chosen.

&gt;<i> I don't know, you'd have to pay me *a lot* before I'd be willing to do
</I>&gt;<i> this as a job. But I'd be willing to do it for free if it can be made
</I>&gt;<i> easy and interesting (maybe fun, even). A system that requires
</I>&gt;<i> payments to function also has a pretty major bootstrapping problem:
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow we need to get enough people to use the system to show that it
</I>&gt;<i> works and so is worthy of spending tax dollars on. We surely won't
</I>&gt;<i> have enough money to pay the numbers needed to get to that point...
</I>

True enough, but really what's a lot? As long as I'm getting paid more for
the hour then I make in an hour that's worthwhile. I'd have no issue
stepping up every once and a while and helping out, especially if it was
easy and fun.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First priority is to separate the streams into pro and con: Mixing

</I>&gt;<i> run the risk of people putting a 1-star rating on a really
</I>&gt;<i> informative/insightful comment in an attempt to game the system and
</I>&gt;<i> push it down. But that's really a separate problem from the issue of
</I>&gt;<i> agree/disagree. I'm inclined to think this won't be a significant
</I>&gt;<i> problem, but if it turns out to be one we could impose some
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions to prevent it (like Slashdot does: You have limited
</I>&gt;<i> moderation points, you can't rate and comment in the same category,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) For example, we might restrict people to only rating in either
</I>&gt;<i> the pro *or* con stream, not both. Attacking the opposition by
</I>&gt;<i> down-rating posts in their stream would be a lot less effective than
</I>&gt;<i> upvoting the best ideas in the stream you're supporting. We might also
</I>&gt;<i> honey-pot people by allowing them to attempt to game the system by
</I>&gt;<i> 1-starring the opposition, but if their ratings are significantly
</I>&gt;<i> different from others, the system *automatically* flags them as a
</I>&gt;<i> troll.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sometimes the unpopular opinion needs to be said though and I don't think
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be labeled as bad just because people don't agree with it. In my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system the controversial posts will get equal exposure as the highly
</I>&gt;<i> rated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; posts (the ones with most props).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is important, and why flagging needs to be designed correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a big problem on slashdot with posts being flagged &quot;Troll&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> when it seems to me that they're merely controversial.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if this &quot;professional&quot; was approved time and time again by the people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then it wouldn't be an SDAP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's an assumption I'm not sure I'd make. SDAP doesn't mean stupid,
</I>&gt;<i> it (mostly) means prejudiced and prejudiced people can be popular and
</I>&gt;<i> skillful (Hitler, for example ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Sampling like this does have it's uses, and was a big part of at least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the previous version of Blinap, but my claim is that if there is any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; way for neurotypicals to get out of doing it, even if it requires
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; jumping through hoops like getting out of jury duty does, there's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; fatal flaw in the system: The people who are left to do the work with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; be SDAP, and that's what's primarily wrong with our current systems.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pay them enough to do it and you'll get your neurotypical participation
</I>&gt;<i> no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem.
