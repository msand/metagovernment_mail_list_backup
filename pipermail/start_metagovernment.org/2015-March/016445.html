And yet here you are ;-) I'm guessing you're not a big Facebook or
Reddit or Slashdot fan either, all of which I find to be far worse.
Not sure whether it's the subject matter or the   whole feeling of
impermanence those sites promote, but &quot;conversations&quot; there are even
more superficial and unproductive. I actually prefer email over all of
those and in most cases even an in-person discussion because you have
to bring your &quot;A&quot; game. Sure it takes a little longer, but it requires
both parties (and I benefit as much as the other) to really, deeply,
understand their own positions.

&gt;<i> I heartily agree with you that it would be best that we focus on actual
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, and on deciding whether to adopt/implement them. The question is:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Where and how shall we do that work together?&quot; My first answer is, &quot;Not
</I>&gt;<i> here (on the email list) just endlessly talking at one another.&quot;
</I>
Agreed, and this is not exactly what I was expecting. I don't want to
get into the details of gun control or abortion here even though there
are proposals for these things on matchism.org. I'm looking more for a
meta-level discussion of things like:
1) Is Matchism an &quot;a priori&quot; utopia, or an evolution over existing systems?
2) Can you (must you?) design new political and economic systems, or
must they evolve?
3) Are SDAPs really the problem I make them out to be?
4) What are &quot;mob rule&quot; and &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; and will they
plague the MatchSys?
5) Are there proposals on matchism.org that have already been tried
and failed (or succeeded)?

&gt;<i> With that, the prospect of putting time into reading closely the material on
</I>&gt;<i> the new Matchism site, without there being any immediate useful thing to DO
</I>&gt;<i> as I am reading and pondering the material, is again not productive enough
</I>&gt;<i> to warrant the expenditure of time and focus. I am too busy doing useful
</I>&gt;<i> things to be interested in spending time doing something useless. There
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be a use, and it needs to be an immediate use, with enduring and
</I>&gt;<i> cumulative effect.
</I>
Sounds like the instant-gratification zeitgeist, and something
Alexander already proposed: Build first and then test. I'm pretty sure
this is the wrong way to go about it. You don't put a man on the moon
by launching him into the air with a bungie, and then if that works,
building bigger and bigger chairs and bungies to get him ever closer.
You have to *design* the system first. And to design a system to get
to the moon, you've got to study rocket science until you have it
down. Matchism isn't rocket science, but in many ways it's harder than
that because the source material (social psychology, economics,
philosophy, etc.) mostly wasn't done with foreknowledge that it would
be used in an engineering endeavor. Sure, even after we've looked at
all that we're going to have some rockets blow up on the launchpad
(I'm sure you've seen the clips, but if you haven't, check out
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McbCwSW2moo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McbCwSW2moo</A>). But we can minimize the
number of these failures by bringing everything we as a species has
learned to bear on the issue.

&gt;<i> (The software decision system that I am working on will provide what I want.
</I>&gt;<i> At the point that it is operational (maybe 2018 with just me working on it),
</I>&gt;<i> proposals drawn from the Matchism material will probably be among the first
</I>&gt;<i> proposals that I pump into it, to test it out.)
</I>
Pretty far out: I'll be damned if I don't have something out years
before that. It's probably true that there is no big rush: There's
very little competition nor is there ever likely to be (since there's
no money to be made) and it's *unlikely* that some existential crises
will arise before it's ready. Still, I've probably only got one
project in me and if the design I've proposed turns out to be
completely unworkable I'm not likely to take a second stab at it. I'd
appreciate your help to ensure that I don't end up off in the weeds.
  Regards,
    Scott
