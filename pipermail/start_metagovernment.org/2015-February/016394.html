You have a real knack for presenting brilliant setups only to head off
into the weeds in the actual proposal ;-)  The equivalent evolutionary
statement would be something like &quot;any mutation that results in more
limbs will increase fitness&quot;.  But your &quot;novel&quot; 5-legged frog
*doesn't* have a fitness advantage over the normal 4-legged variety in
most environments it must function in.  Of course, people might
*breed* 5 or even 6 legged frogs because of this novelty, and thereby
provide for its survival, but that's a different environment.

My claim about open source would be the same: It only survives because
it is able to take advantage of some human Clination that allows it to
escape the environment that other memes must compete in.  In that
sense, open source is the functional equivalent of an Amish community:
It would have to be considered maladaptive except for the fact that it
takes advantage of a human Clination to lift it out of the environment
it would normally have to compete in (our religious Clination for the
Amish, our love of technology for open source, this framework being
described in more detail on the relevant pages on the Matchism site,
such as <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/clinations/">http://www.matchism.org/clinations/</A>)

Note that I have nothing against open source: I use open source, I've
contributed to open source, and the Matchist System I'm working on
will be released open source.  But IMHO it's ludicrous to claim that
open source could outcompete a proprietary product in any highly
competitive domain.  The only reason Linux survived is because there
*wasn't* adequate competition in the OS market for such a long time as
the result of monopolistic behavior by Microsoft.  If there had been,
SCO or maybe even Sun would have beat Microsoft and we'd all be using
some derivative of one of those now instead of Windows.

&gt;<i> Notice that I am not advocating equal pay for everyone or perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> democratic operations. People are paid for their work and innovation. Some
</I>&gt;<i> people may put in more than others, so they will get paid more. Another way
</I>&gt;<i> to promote such a model is using another open source technique.
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing people to use what they have created for other purposes. In order
</I>&gt;<i> for this to be advantageous to both parties, the parent company would
</I>&gt;<i> receive some sort of benefit from the child company, but the child company
</I>&gt;<i> would be able to use parent company resources. The child company also must
</I>&gt;<i> retain the same business model.
</I>
Sounds similar to anarcho-syndicalism (you can &quot;fork&quot; a syndicate).
Doesn't work because it's a legal and logistical nightmare (who
decides what the fair compensation is when there is no market economy
to establish price?)

&gt;<i> So basically this is a model that outperforms the others because it seeks
</I>&gt;<i> better ways to work with the environment (people), providing efficiency
</I>&gt;<i> through mutual benefit. A concept know to Richard Dawkin's Selfish Gene
</I>&gt;<i> Theory of the mutual benefit that can form between species.
</I>
Problem is, most of these relationships took millions of years to
develop and billions of individuals dying to work out the details.  We
don't have those kinds of resources ;-)

&gt;<i> It's quite possible that I have completely overlooked something and such a
</I>&gt;<i> model is destine for failure. Its also very important to looks at examples
</I>&gt;<i> that history has given us and rule out that which does not work as you did
</I>&gt;<i> in your response.
</I>
The 3000 failed communes that I referenced in my previous post would
be Exhibit A.  Mutations *can* increase fitness, but as it turns out
the vast majority of them either make no significant difference or are
actually harmful.  Seems to me extremely unlikely that you're going to
be able to come up with one that could outcompete capitalism, even if
you were an expert in all of the relevant fields and a wiz at design.
Which is why I recommend we concentrate on the other path: Changing
the environment that *all* corporations must compete in.
  Regards,
   Scott
