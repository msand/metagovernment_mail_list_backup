Nope: Authoritarianism is a fundamental human characteristic, like
being smart or shy or conscientious. Plutocrats don't create
authoritarians, though they may use them to achieve their goals.  But
the plutocrats didn't elect Hitler as dictator, nor did they even want
the chaos he promised (in Mein Kampf) and then later delivered on.  It
was the authoritarians that did that, all by themselves.

&gt;<i> Who financed NSDAP anyway ?
</I>
Again, Hitler sold 8 million copies of Mein Kampf, and his party
received massive financial support from the population as a whole.
Plutocrats had nothing to do with it, and indeed in many cases opposed
him (I will grant you, though, that many of them were probably
conflicted, especially any of them that worked in the arms business or
dealt extensively with Jews in the financial industry and so approved
of Hitler's plan to seize the assets of the Jews).

&gt;<i> This is about Putin. It is a weak argumentation, anyway for some reason they
</I>&gt;<i> still support him.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102424534#.">http://www.cnbc.com/id/102424534#.</A>
</I>
Note that being a plutocrat and authoritarian aren't mutually
exclusive.  Indeed, at least in the political class the two are highly
correlated.  When threatened, authoritarian plutocrats will favor
aggression against outsiders even if doing so risks their plutocrat
status (i.e., authoritarian tendencies wins in a head-to-head
competition against greed).

&gt;<i> Even if this would be a flaw of the model. I see the model as useful.
</I>
Maybe, but why intentionally leave out half (or more) of the
explanatory power?  You certainly can't fix our political system by
constraining just the plutocrats (it's been tried: Lenin and Stalin
and Mao and Pol Pot's systems all failed).  Indeed, if you were going
to pick only one aspect to deal with, authoritarianism is the far
bigger problem.  Sure, it doesn't fit the cliche that Occupy or Avaaz
or any of the other &quot;slacktivism&quot; movements have latched onto, but if
you read Altemeyer and matchism.org I think you'll find they make a
convincing case that it is authoritarianism we need to design our
systems to deal with, plutocracy being a side issue that itself
becomes far easier to deal with once you solve the authoritarian
problem.
