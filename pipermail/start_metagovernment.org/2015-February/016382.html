<PRE>have fun guys wasting time with debating exact wording.
the problem is complex and i'm sure it can be put into a math formula - the
details of that formula can be debated until the last day of the universe.
...while every day life of billions of people is going on as usual.

If you figure out a definition you agree on, you will then shake hands and
have a nice warm feeling of hapiness... then the next guy comes along who
has slightly different definitions or perspective and he will again go with
you through all the history of discussion and if you are lucky it will just
take you a few months of talking in circles to get yet a third ally or
maybe you will even fight because for some reason its hard to agree of
whether &quot;global&quot; or &quot;worldwide&quot;  ...or &quot;resource&quot; or &quot;money&quot; or &quot;debt&quot; or
&quot;centralbanking&quot; or &quot;capitalism&quot; is the main word that should be put the
focus on.

And in addition, once agreen on that, then the strategic discussion starts,
whats smarter to talk about to the general public? should it be more
careful and use new words like &quot;plutocracy&quot; and add a little &quot;twist&quot; to it
so that people need to look up the word and think, or is it easier to
mobilize with using &quot;capitalism&quot; or dont we live in the world of the
internet? maybe something more 2.0ish?


RI would suggest, stop WASTING time with talking weeks and months over the
difference between certain words and phrases, but instead start creating a
new practice of collaboration - in particular: programming to improve this
world :-)

Vilfredo is a project that seems to be a success compared to the average
project somehow associated with metagovernment and they work their asses of
and figure out the details while they learn. This approach uses the same
forces used by &quot;traditional entrepreneurship&quot; to build the next sucessful
global corporation.

I think open source can do something similar and its these day more true
than ever...

&gt;<i>  Hi Tom,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was also considering a &quot;democratic business&quot; (for others, see wiki
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;workplace democracy&quot;, &quot;syndicate&quot; or &quot;syndicalism&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was thinking that I want to do &quot;rational things&quot; in a democratic
</I>&gt;<i> business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But when I do the rational things, that is nohow preventing the others
</I>&gt;<i> from the &quot;irrational things&quot;. In fact the may focus more on their
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;irrational totalitarian&quot; business, because I do the rational better than
</I>&gt;<i> they did. Is it so ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the moment when I have considered that I may make some &quot;irrational
</I>&gt;<i> business&quot; just for money and *power* of the business, I looked back at what
</I>&gt;<i> I do. I do as others do, but we just share our money in a different way. In
</I>&gt;<i> a way that prevents corruption, but just in my business.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see future in &quot;democratic business&quot;, but first we need to outlaw
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;totalitarian business&quot; IMHO.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Kind regards

</I>&gt;<i> stock market, legal loopholes, and the manipulation of law itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Corporations use their resources to study the complex systems of economics,

</I>&gt;<i> Change things where change is already taking place, corporate influence on
</I>&gt;<i> politics, corporate influence on information. Build a machine that has

</I>&gt;<i> what's solely good for profit. Build that machine with the mechanisms of
</I>&gt;<i> business, solid technologies, open source innovation, and competition.
</I>&gt;<i> Build a machine in which resources do not concentrate wealth to the degree
</I>&gt;<i> of modern capitalism. This successful machine is a business with the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of making profit for its participants and the surrounding
</I>&gt;<i> community, the true investors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lets turn the tide by understanding the mechanisms of the modern world and
</I>&gt;<i> work with those mechanisms rather than against them. Let science pave the
</I>&gt;<i> way.
