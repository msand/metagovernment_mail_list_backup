<PRE>Okay, good arguments (unfortunately I do not know anybody who was there 
to verify it).  I see here might be a question. Who is more problematic 
? I will create a small table here.
                    Authoritarians         Plutocrats
location       national                  global
personality  prejudiced              selfish
job security voted                      inherited
education    poor                        best
safety          public person         hidden
deadliness   World war II           World war I, Vietnam,...

I hope you will add some more lines.

</I>&gt;<i> Again, Hitler sold 8 million copies of Mein Kampf, and his party
</I>&gt;<i> received massive financial support from the population as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i> Plutocrats had nothing to do with it, and indeed in many cases opposed
</I>&gt;<i> him (I will grant you, though, that many of them were probably
</I>&gt;<i> conflicted, especially any of them that worked in the arms business or
</I>&gt;<i> dealt extensively with Jews in the financial industry and so approved
</I>&gt;<i> of Hitler's plan to seize the assets of the Jews).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is about Putin. It is a weak argumentation, anyway for some reason they

</I>&gt;<i> Note that being a plutocrat and authoritarian aren't mutually
</I>&gt;<i> exclusive.  Indeed, at least in the political class the two are highly
</I>&gt;<i> correlated.  When threatened, authoritarian plutocrats will favor
</I>&gt;<i> aggression against outsiders even if doing so risks their plutocrat
</I>&gt;<i> status (i.e., authoritarian tendencies wins in a head-to-head
</I>&gt;<i> competition against greed).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if this would be a flaw of the model. I see the model as useful.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe, but why intentionally leave out half (or more) of the
</I>&gt;<i> explanatory power?  You certainly can't fix our political system by
</I>&gt;<i> constraining just the plutocrats (it's been tried: Lenin and Stalin
</I>&gt;<i> and Mao and Pol Pot's systems all failed).  Indeed, if you were going
</I>&gt;<i> to pick only one aspect to deal with, authoritarianism is the far
</I>&gt;<i> bigger problem.  Sure, it doesn't fit the cliche that Occupy or Avaaz
</I>&gt;<i> or any of the other &quot;slacktivism&quot; movements have latched onto, but if
</I>&gt;<i> you read Altemeyer and matchism.org I think you'll find they make a
</I>&gt;<i> convincing case that it is authoritarianism we need to design our
</I>&gt;<i> systems to deal with, plutocracy being a side issue that itself
</I>&gt;<i> becomes far easier to deal with once you solve the authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> problem.
