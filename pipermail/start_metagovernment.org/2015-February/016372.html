No problem at all.  These are all long term projects and it's better
to have your contribution at whatever delay than not at all.

&gt;<i> I don't understand why you think corporations would be allowed to draft
</I>&gt;<i> proposals though? Only citizens would be allowed to and any corporation that
</I>&gt;<i> made an individual submit a proposal on their behave would run the risk of
</I>&gt;<i> being exposed and fined or whatever.
</I>
Seems very difficult to enforce to me.  I agree that only individuals
being able to submit (and of course vote) is a reasonable requirement,
but how would you propose to prevent shills (paid or otherwise) from
just passing on, or even constructing from whole cloth, a proposal
that benefits some corporation(s)?  I'd rather have them be open about
it, with the proposals being submitted by an officer of the
corporation.  These would of course be treated with the appropriate
level of skepticism but hopefully not any outright prejudice.
Sometimes, perhaps even often, the corporations' needs align with The
Peoples'.

&gt;<i> I'm also considering the idea of only
</I>&gt;<i> allowing an individual to submit a certain amount of proposals in a year,
</I>&gt;<i> maybe even one, to stem the influx that might flood and complicate the
</I>&gt;<i> process, which would allow particular proposals to slip through more easily
</I>&gt;<i> as their not being as closely monitored. The more we can focus the general
</I>&gt;<i> population on specific proposals at a time the higher quality of a result
</I>&gt;<i> we'll yield.
</I>
Agreed with latter, not as sure about the rest: The way to ensure that
only quality proposals make it to the popular vote stage is not merely
to limit their number, but rather to have their *quality* assessed by
a sufficient number of people and have that quality be above some
threshold (e.g., 4+ out of 5 stars).  The trick to that is to figure a
way to ensure that people can give a high quality rating to a proposal
that they would vote against (i.e., it's about the wording, not the
specific policy).  We definitely don't want to design a system where
trolls can prevent any proposal from making it out of &quot;committee&quot; by
badmouthing it (we've already got a system like that ;-)  How exactly
do this is not completely clear to me yet (it may just be an empirical
question!) but I'm thinking that separating out the pro and con
comments into separate streams is one aspect, as is utilizing
meta-rating information (the ratings and flags on the pro and con
comments themselves).  Hopefully we can count on people's ability to
identify trolls: There's rarely any question in my mind when a post
(and in some cases even a person) on Slashdot qualifies as a troll
regardless of its position on the OP, and I'm optimistic that with a
little training that most people will be able to do this too.

Another thing I'm planning is a &quot;consent agenda&quot;, which will consist
of the majority of proposals by the Managers.  Looking at how our city
and county councils work the vast majority of decisions these bodies,
or their subsidiaries, make concern land use (zoning changes and
variances, permitting, etc.)  There needs to be a way to have every
decision these bureaucrats make reviewed by The People, but only on a
pass-fail basis.  They should get a list of the decisions made every
week with the opportunity to &quot;thumbs down&quot; anything on that list which
if some threshold was reached would trigger it being removed from the
consent agenda and resubmitted as a regular proposal.

&gt;<i> Manager will be less self interested which could open them up more easily to
</I>&gt;<i> be influenced by outside forces and bribery. You're clearly defining
</I>&gt;<i> individuals that should be targeted in order to get to get an idea
</I>&gt;<i> presented, you're creating a median for these corporations to go through
</I>&gt;<i> instead of having none at all and letting anyone create submit their own
</I>&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>
Scenario time (actual case currently being debated here in Boulder):
Suppose Google wants to come in a develop an empty lot (former card
dealership) zoned commercial and wants to stuff it full of buildings
with several variances required on setbacks, height, number of parking
spaces, etc.  How does this project get approved, modified, or denied
by The People?  Now the Manager needs to have reviewed the proposal
first to actually assess what zoning changes/variances are required,
right?  Why not just have them do the additional work of making sure
that all the information necessary to make the decision is included
and then submit it on behalf of the corporation?  They're functional
equivalents (bureaucrats) do this now, although in most places the
proposal goes to a appointed Planning Board and only if they have
problems does the city or county representatives actually get
involved.

The only potential for corruption I see here would be the Manager
sprucing up a weak submission, which would hardly be dangerous as
compared with the way things are done now with those Planning Board
members having very little oversight and many of them (or maybe even
all of them) having undisclosed conflicts of interest (ours approved
the Google project despite the fact that the 1500 new employees will
just add to the 60K in-commuters we already deal with during rush
hours twice a day).

Also keep in mind that Managers are employees with clearly specified
contractual duties, unlike representatives or executive government
officials who only have to follow some sort of &quot;code of ethics&quot;,
violations of which don't trigger dismissal (which in my design would
be approved by the People in a process that would take at most weeks)
but rather impeachment proceedings or a recall election which takes
months during which very little else gets done.  Which is why
politicians are more often removed from office by the police than they
are by The People.

&gt;<i> The 'passionate individuals' need not have all the answers to a problem they
</I>&gt;<i> just need a willingness to work on the problem. They present the issue and
</I>&gt;<i> start a discussion with everyone else, adjusting as they go to fit public
</I>&gt;<i> opinion in hopes of coming to a solution that the majority of people agree
</I>&gt;<i> with. This is a much more flexible system this way. A lot of people have a
</I>&gt;<i> cause that they believe in enough to engage in discussion about it and if
</I>&gt;<i> the opportunity is there to actually change something I think we'll see a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of these passionate individuals contributing.
</I>
Sounds good, and my system would definitely allow this, I'm just
predicting that this will definitely be the road less traveled.  The
important thing is to ensure that the 95% of proposals that are made
by the Managers and corporations are subjected to the same level of
scrutiny and debate.
  Regards,
     Scott
