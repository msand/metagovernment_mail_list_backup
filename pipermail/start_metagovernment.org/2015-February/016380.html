<PRE>I also believe that we live in global plutocracy. Resources are power weather it's money, people, product, service, energy, or intelligence. It's a game of probability and manipulation of human psychology. Give a dog a bone, give a politician that which fulfills desire. The more you have the more you can do, opening new doors of opportunity. If ten doors lead to nowhere you still have hundreds more to try.

Humans are good at milking resources, continually expanding on knowledge and technology to more efficiently extract what is considered wealth. First came the gathering of basic needs, studying animals behavior and hunting them. Next came farming. Alongside were the exraction of resources for tools. This continued to grow into more complex forms of extraction. Now we have people extracting wealth from extremely complex systems, like the stock market, legal loopholes, and the manipulation of law itself. Corporations use their resources to study the complex systems of economics, politics, advertisement, etc, in order to find ways in gaining more resources. The most successful corporations are like clockwork machines, that find exploits in systems or efficient ways to extract from the systems.

Why reinvent the wheel when we see examples in our environment of what actually works to influence continuous political change? The best example that has been given to us throughout the centuries are those who have lots of resources. In modern times these are the corporations. Isn't the one who controls the most resources the actual politician or true leader? Kings, elites, and corporations, they make the true decisions.

This is exactly what I want to do. I want to create a business that pays people fairly to do what they enjoy, finding market opportunities that better society, and make a lot of profits to reinvest back into society. Change things where change is already taking place, corporate influence on politics, corporate influence on information. Build a machine that has foundational policies that rest upon what's good for society rather than what's solely good for profit. Build that machine with the mechanisms of business, solid technologies, open source innovation, and competition. Build a machine in which resources do not concentrate wealth to the degree of modern capitalism. This successful machine is a business with the purpose of making profit for its participants and the surrounding community, the true investors.

Lets turn the tide by understanding the mechanisms of the modern world and work with those mechanisms rather than against them. Let science pave the way.
