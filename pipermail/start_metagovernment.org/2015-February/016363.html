Good stuff, although like the Spanish revolution it's still mostly a
matter of describing people's *intentions*, not the systems they will
actually end up with because everything is still in flux.  I'd have to
place the odds of success even lower than the Spanish revolution
because they're under so much more stress.  The tribalism angle is
going to be a serious problem, for example, because that's the thing
that most closely binds them together and yet also the thing that
leads most directly to SDAP leadership and continuous conflict with
their neighbors and even within their new state.

I hadn't read Bookchin, who is reportedly the major inspiration.
Unfortunately I didn't get much more out of his &quot;Post-Scarcity
Anarchism&quot; than I have any of the other anarchist works: It's long on
history, short on specific proposals.  Because it's more modern it
does have a lot more on technology (he pretty much nails the current
climate change debate, and that was 40 years ago!) but a lot of it
still strikes me as proposing to put the genie back in the bottle.
The idea that each community will grow it's own food and make it's own
products (he even recommends every town to have its own steel mill ;-)
and that every worker will rotate jobs is just impractical in a
competitive world where inefficiencies like that will put you right
out business.  And the same problems with money and what happens when
somebody ends up with more than they need and so decides to invest it
(the dreaded &quot;Capital&quot;) and so begins the leveraging process all over
again.

I'm growing increasingly fond of my electricity analogy: Money is like
electricity in that if you concentrate too much of it in one person,
bad things happen, and if you don't properly design and maintain the
tools (power saws vs. corporations) that use them, people get hurt
too.  But just as it would be ridiculous to propose a society that
shuns electricity (like we're all Amish or something ;-) it's also
ridiculous to propose a society without money and the tools
(corporations) that generate and utilize it. The problem is our lack
of ability to regulate corporations and money as well as we do
electricity. But that's just a technological problem (albeit political
technology, which is something we know very little about at this
point) and so calls for a technological solution, not any sort of
blanket prohibition.
