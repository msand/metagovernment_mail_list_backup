I like a good hook, but as Einstein said &quot;Everything should be made as
simple as possible, but not simpler&quot;.  This is too simple, I think
because it only captures one of the factors in each area.  You can't
explain things like authoritarian governments (everything from Hitler
to Putin) by relying on plutocrats as the driving force.  IMHO, our
failure to regulate plutocrats is not related to our preference for
authoritarian leaders in times of resource scarcity.

Secondly, I think a (small) majority of people do understand the
system, their problem is that there hasn't been any convincing
examples of any better way to run things and so they don't move to
change it.  This is where we come in ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
