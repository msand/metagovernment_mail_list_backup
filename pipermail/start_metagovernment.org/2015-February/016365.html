</I>&gt;<i> Thats not true and has never been true.
</I>&gt;<i> There are 193 countries in the UN and a handfull more not members.
</I>&gt;<i> Each country has its own laws and we live in a global world, where people
</I>&gt;<i> travel and move around like never before and this trend will continue.
</I>
This is irrelevant: Within a jurisdiction there can only be one law.
You're literally talking apples and oranges (forks of JS have
absolutely nothing to do with forks of Gnome or any other totally
unrelated package).

&gt;<i> So beside from all the private contract law that exists between people even
</I>&gt;<i> within a country and even there, it depends on the situation people are in
</I>&gt;<i> to tell what kind of law applies to them.
</I>
Right, and the solution to that is, again, to have ONE LAW, with minor
addendums for specific localities/contracts.  This problem is
specifically addressed in the Matchism manifesto
(<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/law/">http://www.matchism.org/law/</A> and about contracts in
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/competion-corporations-monopolies/">http://www.matchism.org/competion-corporations-monopolies/</A>).  The
optimal situation is exactly the opposite of your proposal, with
vastly *fewer*, not more, sets of laws being the design goal.

&gt;<i> Then again, different districts even within a country can have again
</I>&gt;<i> different laws applied to their people...
</I>&gt;<i> So, whatever you want to say, you have to be way more precise, otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> this cannot be a fruitful discussion.
</I>
The problem here isn't with precision, it's with underlying and
unspecified assumptions.  You seem to be coming from a &quot;independent
city-states&quot; model of civilization, whereas my position, I think shown
clearly in many places in the Matchism manifesto, is that that
position is fundamentally flawed and actually an existential threat to
our species.  SDAP control, which is our primary governmental need as
a species, can't happen unless we *all* live under the same system.

&gt;<i> @TOOLS
</I>&gt;<i> When it comes to people using tools, crafting their own &quot;laws&quot;, this
</I>&gt;<i> requires a sophisticated process that includes all the information from all
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;stakeholders&quot; involved and it needs complex tooling, otherwise you can
</I>&gt;<i> only do that with a closed group of people. This is what github excels in.
</I>&gt;<i> Once people actually USE github to craft those proposals and gather
</I>&gt;<i> substantial it is time for searching how to pave the way for passing them
</I>&gt;<i> into law.
</I>
May be, I would just argue that the second step is the far more
important one and so the one that needs to be handled first.  It
doesn't really matter who crafts the proposals or how they do it.
What matters is how they are adopted.  In representative democracy we
mostly have proposals written by corporations or other special
interests.  Making their job easier doesn't seem to me to be a great
leap forward.  The real problem is the bought-and-paid-for politicians
who approve the proposals.

&gt;<i> Only actions will inspire people and INSPIRATION is needed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> mobilize the masses to give those &quot;new tools&quot; a try.
</I>
Maybe true, but &quot;inspiring the masses&quot; is pretty hard, especially in a
non-crisis environment (and in a crisis environment about the only
thing that's easy to do is inspire them to violence).  So IMHO the key
to success is to make the new (voting) system as quick and easy as
possible.  Design goals for improving discussion and debate being
secondary to that primary goal.

&gt;<i> There are modern parties, like the &quot;pirate party&quot; which is a world wide
</I>&gt;<i> phenomenon and they would also be targets in trying tools and techniqes.
</I>
Don't know if you're on the pirate party mailing list, but apparently
it's not going well.  Looks to me like every other
designed-by-committee project I've heard of with constant
interpersonal conflicts and lowest-common-denominator thinking
becoming standard.  This is not how great software, or great
government, will be developed.  Not to mention their negligible
political clout: An endorsement by the pirate party would seem to me
to have only negative consequences...

(snip)

&gt;&gt;<i> Right, but who's in charge of merging the changes until that point,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and indeed after that point?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You and everyone who believes in. You don't need approval of authority.
</I>
So if I submit a change to the Linux kernel, there is no &quot;authority&quot;
who decides whether it makes it into the distribution everyone uses?
Sorry, but I think Linus would disagree with that: HE decides.  No one
else.  Same with every other major open source package: They each have
their benevolent dictator who makes the final decision.

&gt;<i>  - The largest community of open source programmers is in javascript.
</I>&gt;<i>  - <A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A> is empowering that community (see the exponential grows
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;npm&quot; - click on &quot;show all time data&quot;) =&gt; <A HREF="http://www.modulecounts.com/">http://www.modulecounts.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>  - &quot;nodejs&quot; is a piece of technology that makes javascript powerful and its
</I>&gt;<i> trademark is owned by a company called &quot;joyent&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>  - The team of core developers behind &quot;nodejs&quot; largely did not give a shit,
</I>&gt;<i> forked &quot;nodejs&quot; into &quot;iojs&quot; and the open source community is following.
</I>&gt;<i> =&gt; proving that the community is stronger than some authority
</I>&gt;<i> They even started to make fun of it:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://nodejsreactions.tumblr.com/post/110551026973/hitler-finds-out-about-io-js">http://nodejsreactions.tumblr.com/post/110551026973/hitler-finds-out-about-io-js</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ...there is no need to merge it back
</I>
The analogy would be that some people in my town decide to legalize
cocaine and they &quot;fork&quot; the law, remove the part that prohibits
cocaine purchase or use, and then starts following the new law instead
of the old one.  &quot;No need to merge the changes back in!&quot;  That is not
government, it's anarchy.

&gt;<i> Maybe 20 years in the past, nobody would have thought, that &quot;the media&quot; will
</I>&gt;<i> get serious competition online, but in todays world, traditional media is
</I>&gt;<i> struggeling a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> There is a whole movement called &quot;open data&quot; which grabs all the official
</I>&gt;<i> data of any institutions they can lay hands on and try to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> accessible.
</I>
I'm counting on that, as I'm sure we all are, to help people get used
to the idea that a transition is possible.  It's not going well: Here
in Boulder, which has one of the most educated and politically aware
populations in the world, we still regularly find out about decisions
(and sometimes even whole decision-making bodies) that operate in the
shadows outside public awareness or oversight.  For this reason I've
kind of backed off on my previous plan to have a sort of &quot;mirror&quot;
government that votes on exactly the same bills as the real
government.  If we don't have access to what we need here in Boulder,
it's going to be even more unworkable to try it in most other places.
We should all push for as much openness in our existing governments as
we can get, but IMHO we can't count on their help at all to ease the
transition because they don't even feel obligated to share this
information when they're *not* under threat of organized
second-guessing or replacement.

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know about node.js specifically,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but every other open source software package I know of relies on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model of government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It doesnt, because you can just fork it, and the &quot;iojs&quot; model has proven
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i> They flashed out an &quot;open governance model&quot; see HERE:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme">https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme</A>
</I>&gt;<i> It's just a beginning, but it's a HUGE STEP from corporate environment it
</I>&gt;<i> was in before.
</I>
Like I said, government by a junta that selects its own replacement
members.  What could go wrong?  ;-)

&gt;&gt;<i> Ultimately there is one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> person or at most a small &quot;junta&quot; who makes the decision of what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes are merged in and which aren't.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was the case in the corporate world - but the open governance model
</I>&gt;<i> they are experimenting with is just the beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> I urge you do read the following 2 articles:
</I>&gt;<i> 1.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://medium.com/@mikeal/how-io-js-built-a-146-person-27-language-localization-effort-in-one-day-65e5b1c49a62">https://medium.com/@mikeal/how-io-js-built-a-146-person-27-language-localization-effort-in-one-day-65e5b1c49a62</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5">https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5</A>
</I>
Reminiscent to me of the tremendous flash of optimism present at the
start of the Russian and Spanish revolutions: Massive numbers of
highly idealistic and motivated members rush in to help create and
proselytize the New World Order.  And node.js has the huge advantage
of not having to deal with abortion or gun control or immigration or
any issue where instinctive biases play a significant role in
decisionmaking.  This is not a model for government, it's a toy
example.  Nevertheless I'll still predict that within 5 years that
this model of government for node.js will fail, to be replaced by a
more hierarchical and authoritarian form (as works for just about
every other open source project).  Not that there is anything wrong
with that: I repeatedly point out in the Matchism manifesto that this
form of organization works great for corporations and even the
executive branch of government.  It just isn't appropriate for
government in general, especially not for the legislative branch.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, people are free to fork
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if they want to ensure that their particular change is included in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiled version of the package they use, but then maintenance becomes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a nightmare because they have to manually track and selectively
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> integrate all future changes in all the other forks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even then, github makes it easy to fetch all future changes from UPSTREAM,
</I>&gt;<i> including your changes.
</I>&gt;<i> So maintainance nightmare is manageable.
</I>
Finding and downloading the patches isn't the hard part, it's managing
the conflicts.  I'll grant you that this problem is somewhat easier in
law than in software because the should be designed with fewer
dependencies.  But you've still got the anarchy problem in law that
you don't have with software...

&gt;<i> 1. Nobody has the answer, but at least open source is trying and its winning
</I>&gt;<i> ground faster and faster. See links above please.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Javascript is a serious language and a genius and its foundation lies in
</I>&gt;<i> the spirit of LISP. More and more people are switching over to javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> You should google &quot;nodejs&quot; and you should google &quot;ECMA6&quot; or as its now
</I>&gt;<i> called &quot;ECMA2015&quot;.
</I>
I know Lisp, I've programmed extensively in Lisp.  JS is not Lisp.  JS
is popular for one reason and one reason only: It's the only choice
you have for development in web browsers.  Browsers I predict are a
doomed technology, to replaced by apps, which is how the technology
should have developed in the first place if it were not for
Microsoft's failure to forsee and properly implement support for this
(they tried with ActiveX, but missed the fundamental assumption that
they didn't need to make the technology subsidiary to the browser,
they could have just built it like the Google Play or Apple app
distribution systems).

&gt;<i> Javascript breaks free from the dictatorship model. The evolution of the
</I>&gt;<i> language is in the community if you compare it to any other programming
</I>&gt;<i> language.
</I>
Again, not a big fan of &quot;design by committee&quot;.  In my previous life I
mostly programmed in C/C++ using Emacs, none of which were &quot;designed
by committees&quot;.  Fixing JS by committee has all the relevance of the
development of Fortran, Pascal, and the C++ template package, all of
which were (fortunately) irrelevant even before a committee went and
mucked them all up.

&gt;<i> And it works amazingly well. Its performance in the context of iojs is
</I>&gt;<i> outstanding and the way you organize your code is nothing but AWESOME,
</I>&gt;<i> mainly because of
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;commonJS&quot; standard put forward by nodejs (<A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A>)
</I>
&gt;<i> You are obviously not writing javascript, otherwise you wouldnt say that.
</I>
I've looked at it enough to develop a strong dislike for it.  Take the
star rating widgets you see on Amazon and Netflix.  Each of them
require over 200 lines of Javascript code (and that's condensed,
probably 2 or 3 times that with comments and whitespace), and probably
took weeks to write, and continue to require constant tweaking because
of browser updates and incompatibilities.  I wrote a smoother working
version in Livecode in 10 lines in a couple of hours (and that was
picking up the tool cold after almost 10 years).  Programming in JS is
strictly for amateurs and strictly for those who are blind to the fact
that browsers are doomed as a technology (ever used an android or
ipad?  Would you read gmail or do Facebook or query Yelp in a browser
window instead of the app?  Only if you're clueless).

&gt;<i> Google Docs is a farce. Yes it works well, but its owned by google and they
</I>&gt;<i> are in control of the data.
</I>
Agreed, but that's a separate issue from using it as a model for
revision management UI.

&gt;<i> In addition, its behind a login and not easily accessible by people.
</I>&gt;<i> How do you discuss in the process of crafting a document collaboratively.
</I>&gt;<i> You always have a dictator in the google context and forking is not so easy.
</I>&gt;<i> Same is true for checking out other versions or connecting via API.
</I>&gt;<i> In the context of open source and open governance, google docs can never be
</I>&gt;<i> a serious contender.
</I>
Agreed, but again, I was just talking about how it shows and manages
revisions which in my experience is a lot easier than any &quot;check-in
and diff&quot; based tool like Github.

&gt;&gt;<i> These too, unfortunately,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO are recipes for SDAP-led government.  I'd rather write the whole
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal myself, asking for feedback along the way, then have people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote it up or down.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's exactly why you do not have upvotes or downvotes an git commits on
</I>&gt;<i> github, because its not substential.
</I>&gt;<i> Its all in the focused and constructive discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> The MEDIUM Blog posts above have a feature, where you can comment on certain
</I>&gt;<i> lines in the blog, but you do not upvote or downvote them.
</I>&gt;<i> The same feature exists in github - remember my last link.
</I>
Again, my point is that the important part of the process *is* the
voting part.  Git not supporting that to me is like endorsing
Microsoft word or Vim as the tool we need to build a new government
system.  Sure, you can write your proposals in those tools, but they
are not in anyway crucial to the process of direct democracy and
neither is Git or Google Docs or any other revision management system.
To paraphrase Clinton &quot;It's the decisionmaking, stupid&quot;.

    Scott
