<PRE>I would strongly suggest you to take a look at the iojs.org community, as
they experiment with improving &quot;open governance&quot; and have a highly
successful real world project.
Other than that, i co-built a community of freelancers and otherwise self
employed people in berlin/germany meetup.com/codingamgios and we currently
try to experiment with ways how to collaborate openly as partners with no
employees and a high degree of transparency.

If you are a programmer, maybe we can outsource each other work and try to
come up with fair conditions, brainstorming on how to use &quot;open governance&quot;
methods and technology like &quot;blockchains&quot; and emerging &quot;crypto contracts&quot;
to make it even better...

&gt;<i> I am reaching out to the metagovernment.org participants as recommended
</I>&gt;<i> by Ed. Please see my original message to Ed below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was very please to find the website that you created while reading a
</I>&gt;<i> Wikipedia article, metagovernment.org. To shortly introduce myself I have
</I>&gt;<i> an IT consulting and support background with a great interest in using
</I>&gt;<i> technology to improve lives rather than complicate them. I also have a
</I>&gt;<i> passion for correcting the problems and corruption that exist within our
</I>&gt;<i> current government models and have always believed that there is vast room
</I>&gt;<i> for improvement using digital means to better drive democracy. My passion
</I>&gt;<i> for this has driven me to quit my job in pursuit of contributing to a
</I>&gt;<i> future that brings democracy back to the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that I currently have no source of income that is my highest
</I>&gt;<i> priority, which is one reason that I am using this opportunity to develop
</I>&gt;<i> my business ventures into an open-source type of business. I am calling the
</I>&gt;<i> concept the Open Business Platform. Using the successful attributes of the
</I>&gt;<i> open-source development model this platform is designed to combat the
</I>&gt;<i> current pitfalls of runaway capitalism and return wealth back to the
</I>&gt;<i> community. Openness, open-source governance, crowd-sourcing, and incentive
</I>&gt;<i> are key principals of the Open Business Platform. Alongside the development
</I>&gt;<i> of the Open Business Platform I am developing my company, Peradym.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Through life I have come to realize that anything is possible when
</I>&gt;<i> developed upon the right framework. Organizing interactions in particular
</I>&gt;<i> ways will achieve a particular outcome. When organized properly a desired
</I>&gt;<i> outcome can be achieved, but it's difficult to effectively predict these
</I>&gt;<i> outcomes partially due to unforeseen consequences. History has taught us
</I>&gt;<i> so. History, nature, and experimentation also has taught us examples of
</I>&gt;<i> what does and what does not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most of the greatest and quickest advancements of human progress have been
</I>&gt;<i> driven by capitalism and competition. Even our best computer security
</I>&gt;<i> algorithms are driven by competitions. For-profit business provides the
</I>&gt;<i> resource means to compete effectively using innovation and influence. I
</I>&gt;<i> believe a 'for-profit with limitations model' can provide incentive and
</I>&gt;<i> resources for great progress in the positive direction of society. This
</I>&gt;<i> includes open-source governance and clean energy, also combating wealth
</I>&gt;<i> disparity, climate change, and many other social matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am currently in the early stages of these parallel projects but I would
</I>&gt;<i> be grateful if you could visit my website, peradym.com. I was very
</I>&gt;<i> surprised when I started exploring metagovernment.org because it reflects
</I>&gt;<i> very similarly to my current progress at peradym.com. My ultimate goal is
</I>&gt;<i> to create a company that betters the community and then free myself to
</I>&gt;<i> innovate ways to better the community. If successful, then I will have a
</I>&gt;<i> team of paid individuals that will create better open-source governance
</I>&gt;<i> systems among other things. For now my experience will serve as an example
</I>&gt;<i> of a type of open-source governance model from which the community can
</I>&gt;<i> learn. I would be happy if there is potential for any sort of
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration, advice, help, or direction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your time.&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
