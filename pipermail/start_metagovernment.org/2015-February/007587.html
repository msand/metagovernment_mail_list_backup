<PRE>I am reaching out to the metagovernment.org participants as recommended by Ed. Please see my original message to Ed below.

&quot;Hi Ed,

I was very please to find the website that you created while reading a Wikipedia article, metagovernment.org. To shortly introduce myself I have an IT consulting and support background with a great interest in using technology to improve lives rather than complicate them. I also have a passion for correcting the problems and corruption that exist within our current government models and have always believed that there is vast room for improvement using digital means to better drive democracy. My passion for this has driven me to quit my job in pursuit of contributing to a future that brings democracy back to the people.

Given that I currently have no source of income that is my highest priority, which is one reason that I am using this opportunity to develop my business ventures into an open-source type of business. I am calling the concept the Open Business Platform. Using the successful attributes of the open-source development model this platform is designed to combat the current pitfalls of runaway capitalism and return wealth back to the community. Openness, open-source governance, crowd-sourcing, and incentive are key principals of the Open Business Platform. Alongside the development of the Open Business Platform I am developing my company, Peradym.

Through life I have come to realize that anything is possible when developed upon the right framework. Organizing interactions in particular ways will achieve a particular outcome. When organized properly a desired outcome can be achieved, but it's difficult to effectively predict these outcomes partially due to unforeseen consequences. History has taught us so. History, nature, and experimentation also has taught us examples of what does and what does not work.

Most of the greatest and quickest advancements of human progress have been driven by capitalism and competition. Even our best computer security algorithms are driven by competitions. For-profit business provides the resource means to compete effectively using innovation and influence. I believe a 'for-profit with limitations model' can provide incentive and resources for great progress in the positive direction of society. This includes open-source governance and clean energy, also combating wealth disparity, climate change, and many other social matters.

I am currently in the early stages of these parallel projects but I would be grateful if you could visit my website, peradym.com. I was very surprised when I started exploring metagovernment.org because it reflects very similarly to my current progress at peradym.com. My ultimate goal is to create a company that betters the community and then free myself to innovate ways to better the community. If successful, then I will have a team of paid individuals that will create better open-source governance systems among other things. For now my experience will serve as an example of a type of open-source governance model from which the community can learn. I would be happy if there is potential for any sort of collaboration, advice, help, or direction.

Thank you for your time.&quot;
