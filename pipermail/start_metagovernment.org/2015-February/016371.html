<PRE>Sorry again for the length of time between responses, hard to find spare
hours of the day for this sort of thing. I'd like to go back to Scott's
last e-mail in response to me.

&gt;<i> But I think your proposal about &quot;passionate individuals&quot; doing the work
</I>is overlooking a fundamental fact: The most passionate source of proposals
are going to be corporations. Which is who writes a lot of the stuff that
at least the US federal and state congresses ends up rubber stamping far
too often.


I don't understand why you think corporations would be allowed to draft
proposals though? Only citizens would be allowed to and any corporation
that made an individual submit a proposal on their behave would run the
risk of being exposed and fined or whatever. I'm also considering the idea
of only allowing an individual to submit a certain amount of proposals in a
year, maybe even one, to stem the influx that might flood and complicate
the process, which would allow particular proposals to slip through more
easily as their not being as closely monitored. The more we can focus the
general population on specific proposals at a time the higher quality of a
result we'll yield.


&gt;<i> Which means the Managers are actually going to be *less* self interested
</I>than the &quot;passionate individuals&quot; and so less likely to try to game the
system (they'll still sometimes try to do it, of course, but their
motivation is more likely to be just something that will make their jobs
easier than the kind of rent-seeking that corporations routinely engage
in).


Manager will be less self interested which could open them up more easily
to be influenced by outside forces and bribery. You're clearly defining
individuals that should be targeted in order to get to get an idea
presented, you're creating a median for these corporations to go through
instead of having none at all and letting anyone create submit their own
proposals.


&gt;<i> IMHO the kind of passionate individual you're conceiving of will rarely
</I>play a role, so the system needs to be designed to accommodate them, but we
surely can't count on them to do more than a very small part of the heavy
lifting.


The 'passionate individuals' need not have all the answers to a problem
they just need a willingness to work on the problem. They present the issue
and start a discussion with everyone else, adjusting as they go to fit
public opinion in hopes of coming to a solution that the majority of people
agree with. This is a much more flexible system this way. A lot of people
have a cause that they believe in enough to engage in discussion about it
and if the opportunity is there to actually change something I think we'll
see a lot of these passionate individuals contributing.


You need to have room for the creative solutions to come out. If you only
have disinterested Managers creating proposals, we'll get uninspired
solutions that might be half measures for fear of reaching to far and
upsetting the base of people that could have them removed from their
position. You need risk takers and you need to trust the public to realize
when a proposal is flawed and expose it before it goes to a vote.


Regards,

Reid
