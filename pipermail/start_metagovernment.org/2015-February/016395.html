<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I propose that higher novelty will statistically 'always' out compete lower 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> novelty. 
</I>
&gt;<i> You have a real knack for presenting brilliant setups only to head off 
</I>&gt;<i> into the weeds in the actual proposal ;-) The equivalent evolutionary 
</I>&gt;<i> statement would be something like &quot;any mutation that results in more 
</I>&gt;<i> limbs will increase fitness&quot;. But your &quot;novel&quot; 5-legged frog 
</I>&gt;<i> *doesn't* have a fitness advantage over the normal 4-legged variety in 
</I>&gt;<i> most environments it must function in. Of course, people might 
</I>&gt;<i> *breed* 5 or even 6 legged frogs because of this novelty, and thereby 
</I>&gt;<i> provide for its survival, but that's a different environment.
</I>
Let's see if I can stay out of the weeds this time lol. Novelty does not infer a positive innovation, but only increased variety, randomness, or information. I am also not applying it on an individual scale, but rather to a macroscopic pool. I'll use numbers to demonstrate my statement that higher novelty will statistically 'always' out compete lower novelty.

In a closed evolutionary environment let's add up all novelty that exists within a finite time period. We'll say that at any given second there are 100 new ideas on average generated in our evolutionary environment (using small numbers for simplicity). Out of those 100 new ideas on average only 2% of them are positive attributes within the environment (again, if this could be measured the numbers would be vastly different). Let's say there is a super corporation that owns 10 out of 100 of those ideas, Google. The rest are distributed among the population of companies in different proportions. Using more incentive than the other companies I would attract this innovation to my company. Let's say my company found the right incentives to gain 20 out of 100 of ideas. Given correct governance of my company, I will now statistically out compete Google because on average I will gain more of those 2% of ideas that are positive ones.

A real world example of this is Google's 20% time. They are essentially devoting 20% of their company to capture innovation by providing the right incentives. The real problem with such a model is being able to efficiently weed out all of the garbage novelty and this is currently done by management groups with expertise in different fields.

&gt;<i> Sounds similar to anarcho-syndicalism (you can &quot;fork&quot; a syndicate). 
</I>&gt;<i> Doesn't work because it's a legal and logistical nightmare (who 
</I>&gt;<i> decides what the fair compensation is when there is no market economy 
</I>&gt;<i> to establish price?) 
</I>
Spreading such a model would come with it's own problems. Perhaps a market could be created in which a certain number of credits were bid on. 100 tokens each worth $1000 dollars for a marketable idea. Cryptocontracting would make such logistics much easier. Many real world tests would have to be performed in order to fine-tune and test value of positive novelty. There are many questions to be asked regarding the details.

I have read a little of your website and completely agree that a better form of government is one that works around natural human psychology. It's really the only way. Your website is a really good piece of work and hopefully there may be a time in which I can help it come to fruition.
