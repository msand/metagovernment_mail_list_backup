</I>&gt;<i> now statistically out compete Google because on average I will gain more of
</I>&gt;<i> those 2% of ideas that are positive ones.
</I>
Right, or you, or some other company, might inadvertently gain a
significant number of &quot;5-legged&quot; ideas, failing to recognize them as
such because you have to make a substantial investment before being
able to distinguish the good from the bad.  The result will be the
failure of your company.  This means not only the loss of all the
resources you consumed developing bad ideas, but the need for the rest
of us to support all the employees afterward (i.e., unemployment
insurance). Contrary to your premise, too many mutations is *always* a
bad thing, regardless of whether you're talking about the individual
or the systemic level.  Optimal is just a few at a time, enough to
facilitate evolution, but not so many as to jeopardize the individual
or the species.

&gt;<i> A real world example of this is Google's 20% time. They are essentially
</I>&gt;<i> devoting 20% of their company to capture innovation by providing the right
</I>&gt;<i> incentives.
</I>
This is just what has always been called R&amp;D. What Google has proposed
is to distribute these costs among all their engineers rather than
have dedicated departments for it.  It might be better than the way
it's traditionally been done,  but it's an experiment in itself.
Certainly in my experience it's not a good option: When I'm engrossed
in some project the last thing I want is to be distracted by spending
20% of my time working on toys.  Creativity is also not evenly
distributed among individuals: Turning the most creative individuals
loose on this kind of research full time might work better.  I guess
we'll find out in 10 or 15 years ;-)

&gt;<i> The real problem with such a model is being able to efficiently
</I>&gt;<i> weed out all of the garbage novelty and this is currently done by management
</I>&gt;<i> groups with expertise in different fields.
</I>
Weeding out failures isn't a problem, that's what the market does.

&gt;&gt;<i> Sounds similar to anarcho-syndicalism (you can &quot;fork&quot; a syndicate).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Doesn't work because it's a legal and logistical nightmare (who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decides what the fair compensation is when there is no market economy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to establish price?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Spreading such a model would come with it's own problems. Perhaps a market
</I>&gt;<i> could be created in which a certain number of credits were bid on. 100
</I>&gt;<i> tokens each worth $1000 dollars for a marketable idea. Cryptocontracting
</I>&gt;<i> would make such logistics much easier. Many real world tests would have to
</I>&gt;<i> be performed in order to fine-tune and test value of positive novelty. There
</I>&gt;<i> are many questions to be asked regarding the details.
</I>
Or again, you could take advantage of what history (and biology) has
taught us and conclude that a competitive (capitalistic) system is
already optimal and the challenge is not to fix it or somehow come up
with a better alternative (essentially requiring that you outcompete a
competitive system ;-) but to step outside the box and work on better
ways to regulate it instead.

&gt;<i> I have read a little of your website and completely agree that a better form
</I>&gt;<i> of government is one that works around natural human psychology. It's really
</I>&gt;<i> the only way. Your website is a really good piece of work and hopefully
</I>&gt;<i> there may be a time in which I can help it come to fruition.
</I>
Yeah, a major upgrade to our political, economic, and legal systems is
a big project, and I'm sure there will be lots of opportunities to
participate ;-)

    Scott
