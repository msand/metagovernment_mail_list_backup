<PRE>In response to Scott, let me first say that I will take your words into deep consideration and I greatly appreciate the constructive criticism. I am willing to change my approach when better methodologies are represented or the current methodologies are demonstrated to be in error.

I'll need to go a little deeper to describe my line of reasoning when it comes to &quot;trying to change it or out-compete it 
from within&quot;. First, the concept of evolution heavily inspires my reasoning. On a grand scale evolution is the continuous change of the Universe, a path of least resistance guided by the Laws of the Universe. As you understand, this concept also applies to systems like capitalism. I believe you are saying that my idea 'cripples' itself because of the constraints which my business would follow that others would not follow, therefore lessening my competitive advantage and becoming less efficient than the competition. My business would eventually die to others that have no constraints because they are able to thrive in the environment. Or the business model would fail to introduce any sort of big change.

The primary 'ingredient' to obtaining successful forms through evolution is novelty, or diversity. Most of this diversity fails to take hold as a stable evolutionary form in it's environment, but a few changes take hold, and some changes revolutionize a form making it super successful. Capitalism is also a competing pool of diversity in the environment composed of law and people. The better the idea, the more power it has to compete over existing ideas. That idea can be a product, service, law exploitation, better management structure, etc.

The open source software community has proven to add a higher level of novelty to the market than existing corporate models, the trade off is that everyone has access to these new innovations which gives the ability for other business to compete for that market share and polish the idea. However, there are companies that have been successful at making a profit on open source software by offering support or premium services. They never become super corporations but they do make a profit and reinvest back into the open source software to better 'polish' it.

I propose that higher novelty will statistically 'always' out compete lower novelty. This novelty comes from people (or simulations). People follow incentive (mechanism upon which open source operates as well as employment itself). Increase the novelty factor of a business by increasing incentive for the people to contribute to business (Paying them more, giving them investment, etc). This increase in innovation helps out compete even while there are some 'self crippling attributes' (mostly limitations of select markets that harm society).

Notice that I am not advocating equal pay for everyone or perfectly democratic operations. People are paid for their work and innovation. Some people may put in more than others, so they will get paid more. Another way to promote such a model is using another open source technique.
Allowing people to use what they have created for other purposes. In order for this to be advantageous to both parties, the parent company would receive some sort of benefit from the child company, but the child company would be able to use parent company resources. The child company also must retain the same business model.

So basically this is a model that outperforms the others because it seeks better ways to work with the environment (people), providing efficiency through mutual benefit. A concept know to Richard Dawkin's Selfish Gene Theory of the mutual benefit that can form between species.

It's quite possible that I have completely overlooked something and such a model is destine for failure. Its also very important to looks at examples that history has given us and rule out that which does not work as you did in your response.


Best regards,
Tom
