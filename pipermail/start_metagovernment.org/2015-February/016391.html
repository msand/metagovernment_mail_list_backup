</I>
This seems to me a good start and could be a very useful tool for
convincing people that plutocrats are not the only thing our new
systems need to focus on.

&gt;<i>                    Authoritarians         Plutocrats
</I>&gt;<i> location       national                  global
</I>
This sounds more like &quot;orientation&quot; to me: Authoritarians are
nationalist (or more accurately tribalist), but plutocrats are more
oriented toward economic boundaries than geopolitical boundaries.

&gt;<i> personality  prejudiced              selfish
</I>
I'd probably use &quot;aggressive&quot; over &quot;prejudiced&quot;.  Both groups are prejudiced.

&gt;<i> job security voted                      inherited
</I>
Good, although maybe &quot;source of power&quot; would be a better name for this category.

&gt;<i> education    poor                        best
</I>
Not exactly: There are a lot of very well educated authoritarians
(Bush/Cheney, Hitler, and Mao were all quite well educated).  If there
is an educational distinction, it's that plutocrats use educational
institution as a filter (their associates all also were educated at
famous private schools) whereas authoritarians will pick their
associates from the public at large.

&gt;<i> safety          public person         hidden
</I>
Again, not exactly: Authoritarian *leaders* have to be very public,
but the followers do not have to be.  Maybe call this &quot;exercise of
power&quot;, and for authoritarians it would be &quot;through an authoritarian
leader&quot; whereas plutocrats exercise power through *any* leadership.

&gt;<i> deadliness   World war II           World war I, Vietnam,...
</I>
I'd break this into &quot;scale of conflicts&quot;, with authoritarians being
oriented toward large-scale and bet-the-farm conflicts whereas
plutocrats are more into small scale &quot;strategic advantage&quot; types of
conflicts.  Plutocrats are also more &quot;regime change&quot; oriented (the
installation and support of corrupt regimes in central and south
america and the Iraq war being better examples than any of the more
typical wars).

A few more:
power goals              political/social       economic
individual freedom     suppressed           permitted
favorite prejudice      racial/cultural         economic class

It's a hard exercise, because there are so many individuals (again
Bush/Cheney, Koch brothers, etc.) who are both.
  Regards,
    Scott
