Umm, it's called &quot;design&quot;: Before you build a product, you find out
what the market needs, what kinds of things you can design might meet
those needs, what resources (what costs) will be required to design
and build them them, and how you will sell them.  Obsessing over a
philosophy or some bit of technology as an non-negotiable principle
component is just not how successful products are developed, and in
fact are exactly how extremely dangerous ones are developed.

Right, so reinventing &quot;soviets&quot; wouldn't be a problem by your
philosophy.  Do you know why soviets failed as a viable form of
government, and why nearly all other communal/cooperative government
experiments have failed?  If you don't understand the process of
designing a product, or are unwilling to do that design, how do you
know you're not going to invent something that's even worse than what
we have now?

&gt;<i> Vilfredo is a project that seems to be a success compared to the average
</I>&gt;<i> project somehow associated with metagovernment and they work their asses of

The people that bought into the &quot;soviet&quot; proposal believed this too,
and I submit the failure mode would be exactly the same.  As I've
pointed out before, the anarcho-syndicalists are pretty weak on
describing how their systems would work, but what they do have a
pretty good handle on is the failure modes of other systems
(capitalism and communism in particular).  To cut to the punchline:
The reason the Bolshevik &quot;soviet&quot; system failed is because it was too
burdensome.  People just didn't want to sit in a room arguing all
night to make even the most trivial decision (which also just happens
to be my experience with Vilfredo), so the soviet meetings became more
and more infrequent. The power vacuum that resulted from that decline
in the number of decisions resulted in a gradual transfer of power to
organizations that *could* make decisions.  Unfortunately those new
organizations were based on Lenin's &quot;Vanguard of the Revolution&quot; which
unsurprisingly enough (at least in hindsight) means they were composed
primarily of authoritarians.

In summary, it is my continued hope for a quick and merciful failure
for anyone who doesn't understand authoritarianism and/or designs
their products/companies/systems/philosophies without including
specific features to deal with it.  If they were somehow successful
they would most likely drag us all into another era of
totalitarianism. I of course also include in that category anyone who
proposes &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; as a primary design goal, because
those too are fundamentally incompatible with the need to make
decisions, and will result in the same sort of power vacuum that the
soviets created, which in turn will cause the exact same rise in power
of totalitarian alternatives that *are* capable of making decisions.
  Regards,
    Scott
