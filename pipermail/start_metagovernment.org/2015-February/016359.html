<PRE>good. We were quite abstract. I do not believe that we can know 
everything in advance.

As I understand what anarcho-syndicalists try to do today, they are 
trying to make our businesses democratic. Approximately one stakeholder 
= one vote.
It seems nice to me. And to you ?

Cheers
Michael

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO anarchist believe that social redistribution by &quot;elites&quot; e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government happens mostly under the threat of revolution, that social
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redistribution is natural to society of people and that &quot;elites&quot; are just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preventing it.
</I>&gt;<i> In other words &quot;charity&quot;.  This position (shared by most libertarians)
</I>&gt;<i> is clearly wrong as it's been tried and doesn't work (there's a page
</I>&gt;<i> on the Matchism site that specifically addresses the issue:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/charity/">http://www.matchism.org/charity/</A>)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I is about faith, but I thing it is better to believe that people are good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and be a little bit wrong, than to believe that we are all rotten and force
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people to act according to it.
</I>&gt;<i> Adding a moral categorization phase to the process is IMHO not
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.  We can design the system to work well regardless of how many
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; people there are and under what particular
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances they behave those ways.  Indeed we can design the system
</I>&gt;<i> so that it functions without the requirement of making this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> moral classification at all...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There were a few insightful comments about communism in there, particularly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the need to go *through* an anarchist phase before true communism can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> achieved.  But even this was oddly reminiscent, albeit completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contradictory, to what Trotsky had to say about the need to go through a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bourgeois phase to get from peasant farmers to communism.  Which is it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO it is meant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1st  - peasant -&gt; bourgeois  -&gt; anarchist   -&gt; communist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2nd - peasant -&gt; bourgeois  -&gt; ?                -&gt; communist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but it could be absolutely wrong
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds reasonable to me, but you're extrapolating.  None of the
</I>&gt;<i> (other) theorists I'm aware of include all 4 steps.  And I think the
</I>&gt;<i> whole premise is probably wrong too: Much as I like Trotsky in general
</I>&gt;<i> (though he does tend to whine and hold grudges) his claim about the
</I>&gt;<i> need to pass through a bourgeoisie phase neglects what I find to be
</I>&gt;<i> the biggest problem with the bourgeois: Their sense of entitlement.
</I>&gt;<i> Once that is established it is very difficult to get them to give up
</I>&gt;<i> anything for the &quot;common good&quot;.  I think you'd have a better chance of
</I>&gt;<i> success by selectively educating peasants to turn them directly into
</I>&gt;<i> communists than trying to push an entire population *through* two
</I>&gt;<i> other phases, both of which are pretty sticky because of that acquired
</I>&gt;<i> sense of entitlement (anarchists, or at least libertarians, also
</I>&gt;<i> positively reek of that in my experience).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I'm still stuck with the basic question: How does any form of anarchism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really deal with any sort of wealth inequality other than handwaving about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how it won't ever develop if the participants are truly motivated to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prioritize the enterprise over their individual preferences?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we look back at Spanish revolution, there was initial forced
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redistribution in Robin Hood style. I believe they were ready to repeat it,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if they would see that there is some unjustified inequity again.
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  You see the same thing in the Trotsky's &quot;permanent
</I>&gt;<i> revolution&quot; where anytime the system starts to revert a good top-down
</I>&gt;<i> whack will bring it back into shape.  Not exactly great social
</I>&gt;<i> engineering IMHO: Better to design the system so that regulation is a
</I>&gt;<i> little more continuous and fine tuned...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also not really convinced by the Spanish civil war examples that
</I>&gt;<i> the anarchists always point to: Sure, they had great numbers of people
</I>&gt;<i> *claiming* to be members of this movement, but it didn't last long
</I>&gt;<i> enough (a few years) to see if it was really a stable system.  People
</I>&gt;<i> will put up with a lot for short periods of time, but until the system
</I>&gt;<i> stabilizes to the degree necessary for them to say &quot;yeah, I could live
</I>&gt;<i> this way for the rest of my life&quot;, it's hard to call it a success.
</I>&gt;<i> And the Spanish revolution didn't last long enough to make that kind
</I>&gt;<i> of claim.  My prediction would be that it would fare far worse than
</I>&gt;<i> the kind of top-down communism the Soviets imposed (which at least did
</I>&gt;<i> last a very long time, albeit requiring fairly brutal &quot;adjustments&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> a regular basis).
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
