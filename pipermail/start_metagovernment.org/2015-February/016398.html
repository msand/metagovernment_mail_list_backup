Never heard anyone trying this, but there is a &quot;stick&quot; complement to
your &quot;carrot&quot; proposal:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting</A>

Those Australians sure are a creative bunch ;-)

&gt;<i> I mean we will tax ourself first and than we will pay ourself for deciding.
</I>&gt;<i> (Not such a big nonsense as to pay somebody who is deciding against you :D)
</I>
I assume the payment would have to be small (or collection of the
additional taxes would be very difficult), which means the most highly
motivated people would be those who are just doing it for the money.
Unfortunately those are probably the least suitable people to be
making (especially) budget decisions.  It would probably also backfire
for everyone else (the best way to turn play into work is to pay
someone to do it ;-)

Plus, direct democracy requires a lot more work for each individual
than representative democracy, something Australia's results indicates
that even compulsory voting isn't viable so a small payment probably
wouldn't be sufficient.

&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
I'm still thinking proxies are the only viable option.  My
specification includes:
1) provide tools to help identify suitable proxies (people who will
most likely vote like you would)
2) allow selection of multiple proxies (redundancy in case some don't vote)
3) have a two-phase voting process (you see how your proxies would
vote for you, then get a chance to make a direct vote if the
particular proposal is contentious).

1 and 3 also require open voting.

    Scott
