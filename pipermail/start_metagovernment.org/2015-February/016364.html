</I>&gt;<i> Why?  Can we have everyone pass their own pet leash laws, or smoking
</I>&gt;<i> laws, or anything else for that matter?  That's one major way software
</I>&gt;<i> is different from law: There can be many versions of a software
</I>&gt;<i> package, but there can be only one legal code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

*[The first paragraph is the longest - please skip it and read the rest if
you don't have so much time]@STATUS QUO + TALKING*
Thats not true and has never been true.
There are 193 countries in the UN and a handfull more not members.
Each country has its own laws and we live in a global world, where people
travel and move around like never before and this trend will continue.
So beside from all the private contract law that exists between people even
within a country and even there, it depends on the situation people are in
to tell what kind of law applies to them.
Then again, different districts even within a country can have again
different laws applied to their people...
So, whatever you want to say, you have to be way more precise, otherwise,
this cannot be a fruitful discussion.

*@TOOLS*
When it comes to people using tools, crafting their own &quot;laws&quot;, this
requires a sophisticated process that includes all the information from all
the &quot;stakeholders&quot; involved and it needs complex tooling, otherwise you can
only do that with a closed group of people. This is what github excels in.
Once people actually USE github to craft those proposals and gather
substantial it is time for searching how to pave the way for passing them
into law.
Maybe there can be pilot projects in certain communities or it can be used
for businesses or in some country who voluntarily are willing to give it a
try.
But in any way, it's a route to action, while discussion is not. Everything
that can be said about improving democracy was said already, but without
actions, all that is worth nothing.
Only actions will inspire people and INSPIRATION is needed in order to
mobilize the masses to give those &quot;new tools&quot; a try.

There are modern parties, like the &quot;pirate party&quot; which is a world wide
phenomenon and they would also be targets in trying tools and techniqes.

GITHUB has an API and a ton of tools exist that customize the visual
interface for parts of the GITHUB functionality
(e.g. <A HREF="http://gitter.im,">http://gitter.im,</A> <A HREF="http://waffle.io,">http://waffle.io,</A> ...)






&gt;<i> &gt; It's about democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The repository WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data is theirs, but you can have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You/2016-budget-data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You may say, that is theory, but there is one very successful project out
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there, called &quot;nodejs&quot;. It's bringing javascript to the server side and
</I>&gt;<i> its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trademark is owned by a company called joyent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The way they stirred the project sucked and so most of the core
</I>&gt;<i> developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decided to fork it and bring it under an open governance model.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's now called iojs and it's more successful than the original already,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because those programmers have high standing in the community and people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; believe in them, so they make the switch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but who's in charge of merging the changes until that point,
</I>&gt;<i> and indeed after that point?
</I>

You and everyone who believes in. You don't need approval of authority.
 - The largest community of open source programmers is in javascript.
 -* <A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A>&gt;* is empowering that community (see
the exponential grows of &quot;npm&quot; - click on &quot;show all time data&quot;) =&gt;
*<A HREF="http://www.modulecounts.com/">http://www.modulecounts.com/</A>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.modulecounts.com/">http://www.modulecounts.com/</A>&gt;*
 - &quot;*nodejs*&quot; is a piece of technology that makes javascript powerful and
its trademark is owned by a company called &quot;*joyent*&quot;
 - The team of core developers behind &quot;nodejs&quot; largely did not give a shit,
forked &quot;nodejs&quot; into &quot;*iojs*&quot; and the open source community is following.
=&gt; proving that the community is stronger than some authority
They even started to make fun of it:

...there is no need to merge it back

Maybe 20 years in the past, nobody would have thought, that &quot;the media&quot;
will get serious competition online, but in todays world, traditional media
is struggeling a lot.
There is a whole movement called &quot;open data&quot; which grabs all the official
data of any institutions they can lay hands on and try to make it more
accessible.






&gt;<i> I don't know about node.js specifically,
</I>&gt;<i> but every other open source software package I know of relies on the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model of government.
</I>


It doesnt, because you can just fork it, and the &quot;iojs&quot; model has proven
that.
They flashed out an &quot;open governance model&quot; see HERE:
*<A HREF="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme">https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme">https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme</A>&gt;*
It's just a beginning, but it's a HUGE STEP from corporate environment it
was in before.






&gt;<i> Ultimately there is one
</I>&gt;<i> person or at most a small &quot;junta&quot; who makes the decision of what
</I>&gt;<i> changes are merged in and which aren't.
</I>


This was the case in the corporate world - but the open governance model
they are experimenting with is just the beginning.
I urge you do read the following 2 articles:
1.*

2. *<A HREF="https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5">https://medium.com/node-js-javascript/building-a-better-node-community-3f8f45b45cb5</A>

&gt;<i> Sure, people are free to fork
</I>&gt;<i> if they want to ensure that their particular change is included in the
</I>&gt;<i> compiled version of the package they use, but then maintenance becomes
</I>&gt;<i> a nightmare because they have to manually track and selectively
</I>&gt;<i> integrate all future changes in all the other forks.
</I>


Even then, github makes it easy to fetch all future changes from UPSTREAM,
including your changes.
So maintainance nightmare is manageable.





&gt;<i> They are still open to resolve issues with joyent and merge it back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; eventually, but the whole point is, that - yes it's unpleasent in many
</I>&gt;<i> ways
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to use github, but awesome systems do not get build by single persons
</I>&gt;<i> over
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; night - all this steady experimentation and moving back and forth is
</I>&gt;<i> kind of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like an &quot;open research&quot; and once someone figured something out, people
</I>&gt;<i> start
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; adopting it. This kind of model works particularly well in the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;javascript
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; world&quot; with a very liberal or anarchic approach towards having an open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source society in general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I've said before, I'm quite fond of the metaphor that
</I>&gt;<i> political/economic/cultural systems are &quot;software&quot; that we're running
</I>&gt;<i> on human beings as the hardware (or &quot;wetware&quot;).  But I'm hoping that
</I>&gt;<i> we can do a better job than most software, especially most open source
</I>&gt;<i> software.  Sometimes I'm ashamed to call myself a software engineer:
</I>&gt;<i> JavaScript in particular is a pox on humanity, a
</I>&gt;<i> designed-over-the-weekend language that never should have been
</I>&gt;<i> elevated to the level of &quot;industry standard&quot; but for time pressures
</I>&gt;<i> and lack of foresight in the management at Netscape.
</I>


1. Nobody has the answer, but at least open source is trying and its
winning ground faster and faster. See links above please.
2. Javascript is a serious language and a genius and its foundation lies in
the spirit of LISP. More and more people are switching over to javascript.
You should google &quot;nodejs&quot; and you should google &quot;ECMA6&quot; or as its now
called &quot;ECMA2015&quot;.
Javascript breaks free from the dictatorship model. The evolution of the
language is in the community if you compare it to any other programming
language.
And it works amazingly well. Its performance in the context of iojs is
outstanding and the way you organize your code is nothing but AWESOME,
mainly because of
the &quot;commonJS&quot; standard put forward by nodejs (<A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A>)







&gt;<i> We've truly made
</I>&gt;<i> very little progress in the development of software in the 30+ years
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

You are obviously not writing javascript, otherwise you wouldnt say that.






&gt;<i> Everyone can code whatever and just publish it for everyone easy to use -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and its just a command away, (e.g. &quot;npm install You/2016-budget-data) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then i start the project with (e.g. &quot;npm start&quot;) and my browser opens
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; showing me what you worked on ....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I then change some parts, give it a nice message (e.g. &quot;git commit &quot;I
</I>&gt;<i> added
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more colors to your charts&quot;) and then push it back to you... or if you do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not like the terminal, you do that on github,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where you can comment on every line of code, PLEASE CHECK:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://github.com/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client/commit/bfc73baba1bf99228ceb376bb6ac03e310a92662#commitcomment-9656318">https://github.com/fairdemocracy/vilfredo-client/commit/bfc73baba1bf99228ceb376bb6ac03e310a92662#commitcomment-9656318</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is a comment on a project run by guys that also participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; context of metagovernment.org and i try to explain how github works.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you used Google Docs much?  Seems to do the same things, but with
</I>&gt;<i> a much easier to use interface.  But I'm not a big fan of that either,
</I>&gt;<i> nor of wikis in general because of the experiences I've had with
</I>&gt;<i> others undoing or overwriting my changes.
</I>


Google Docs is a farce. Yes it works well, but its owned by google and they
are in control of the data.
In addition, its behind a login and not easily accessible by people.
How do you discuss in the process of crafting a document collaboratively.
You always have a dictator in the google context and forking is not so easy.
Same is true for checking out other versions or connecting via API.
In the context of open source and open governance, google docs can never be
a serious contender.






&gt;<i> These too, unfortunately,
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO are recipes for SDAP-led government.  I'd rather write the whole
</I>&gt;<i> proposal myself, asking for feedback along the way, then have people
</I>&gt;<i> vote it up or down.
</I>


That's exactly why you do not have upvotes or downvotes an git commits on
github, because its not substential.
Its all in the focused and constructive discussion.
*The MEDIUM Blog posts above have a feature, where you can comment on
certain lines in the blog, but you do not upvote or downvote them.*
The same feature exists in github - remember my last link.
