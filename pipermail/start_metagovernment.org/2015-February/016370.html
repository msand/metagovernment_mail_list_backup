<PRE>People search for AWESOME USER EXPERIENCE - it doesnt matter what your
&quot;Matchism&quot; is about if its not a nice interactive user interface! Because
everyone can produce tons of text which are TL;DR

If you want alpha testers or beta testers, then figure out who could be
potential &quot;early birds&quot; who need your software and are living on the
bleeding edge of tech, so that they would be willing to try it.... then
build a prototype (MVP = Minimum Viable Product) and get it out there. Host
it, ship it, .... etc..
There are facebook groups, linkedin groupd, twitter discussions, online
forums u can find through google, and lots of places.
Imagine who would be those early birds and go out there and search for them.

Create a so called &quot;Landing Page&quot; for your product, and PITCH it to them.
Make them subscribe to newsletter.
Create a Blog and inform them. In short =&gt; Build your audience.

So u feed and build your audience or community one step at a time and you
will have your users.
Put in &quot;Google Analytic Script Tags&quot; or use URL shortener like &quot;bit.ly&quot; to
be able to see what your users like and what not and adapt.

You PIVOT as long as necessary to get your testers and followers and grow
the movement.

GITHUB is just THE SOCIAL NETWORK for programmers and they constantly add
nice new features to make that collaboration more fun.
They have an API which is now heavily used by third parties to build
products around the GITHUB ECOSYSTEM :-)
Not that github is the answer, because in the long run, you would want
something more decentralised, but before you can decentralize, you need a
standard.
The standard is built using github - later you can build an open source
system that has the same &quot;user experience&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I discussed in forums and mailing lists forever and they are in fact a
</I>&gt;<i> nice
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; place to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bounce ideas and get inspired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but what I've been expecting, and yet unfortunately received
</I>&gt;<i> very little of on this list, is criticism.  I look at this process as
</I>&gt;<i> like software engineering, a key phase of which are alpha and beta
</I>&gt;<i> tests where you send a partially completed work out to be reviewed by
</I>&gt;<i> people who find the flaws in it.  I've taken it as my responsibility
</I>&gt;<i> to do this for others, though I'm sure it's not always appreciated.
</I>&gt;<i> But just as it's impossible to build great software without great bug
</I>&gt;<i> reports, IMHO it's impossible to develop new political/economic/social
</I>&gt;<i> systems unless people are willing to take the time to take them for a
</I>&gt;<i> spin and then report any flaws they find.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm hoping the limitation here is mainly just free time, but I also
</I>&gt;<i> get a sense that people don't want to criticize other people's work.
</I>&gt;<i> My point here is that this position isn't doing anyone any favors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course it's also possible that my experience with people on FB is
</I>&gt;<i> representative and that my real problem is that people don't like
</I>&gt;<i> Matchism but can't provide a coherent argument about what's wrong with
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Which is actually fine, I think, because that would mean that
</I>&gt;<i> it's just ahead of its time and that I've primarily got a marketing
</I>&gt;<i> problem rather than an engineering problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once you are, the time of doing comes and that is the time at which you
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to leave
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the discussion place and actually do something.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thats what i try to do. I just occasionally observe metagovernment these
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; days, thats all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may think you're farther along than you are though, or are maybe
</I>&gt;<i> heading off into the weeds.  Which is why I'm asking for backup for
</I>&gt;<i> some of your assertions (which I note you didn't provide ;-)
