<PRE>The
&gt;<i> optimal situation is exactly the opposite of your proposal, with
</I>&gt;<i> vastly *fewer*, not more, sets of laws being the design goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Yes - but the way to get there is to make it more open and let people
opt-in into what they prefer.
Yes - *all* live under the same system - but there need to be extreme
freedom for people to be able
to vote with their feet for giving immediate feedback as to what &quot;system&quot;
is the best.
In between there will be different oppinions and some &quot;forking/splitting&quot;
going on, but then
it will come together again :-) ...but it needs that freedom.



... In representative democracy we
&gt;<i>
</I>mostly have proposals written by corporations or other special
&gt;<i> interests.  Making their job easier doesn't seem to me to be a great
</I>&gt;<i> leap forward.  The real problem is the bought-and-paid-for politicians
</I>&gt;<i> who approve the proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

AGREE :-)
Thats why i like &quot;open source&quot;. Tools become better and projects more
ambitious.
There is no money involved and it works.
The nice thing is - that because of the ability to fork everything all the
time,
money cannot BUY the evolution of the project.
And &quot;iojs.org&quot; is the perfect example.




&gt;<i> &gt; Only actions will inspire people and INSPIRATION is needed in order to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mobilize the masses to give those &quot;new tools&quot; a try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe true, but &quot;inspiring the masses&quot; is pretty hard, especially in a
</I>&gt;<i> non-crisis environment (and in a crisis environment about the only
</I>&gt;<i> thing that's easy to do is inspire them to violence).
</I>

Disagree - i was part of the occupy movement and i am now part of open
source.
People there are not driven by anger and violence, but by very constructive
ideas.
The major problem is, that it's not so easy to come up with an alternative
and proof
to existing institutions that they might work better - all in a crisis
environment and
all without focusing on &quot;earning a living&quot; instead.
Breaking away from mainstream to discover alternatives makes it hard to
earn.



&gt;<i> So IMHO the key to success is to make the new (voting) system as quick and
</I>&gt;<i> easy as
</I>&gt;<i> possible.  Design goals for improving discussion and debate being
</I>&gt;<i> secondary to that primary goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think this approach is fundamentally flawed.
Discussion is what drives democracy towards consensus.
*Time constraints make it hard to reach that, so with VOTING, you can*
*create a &quot;snapshot&quot; of current oppinion to be able to move forward, but*
*then discussion has to continue in order to move forward.*

Ideally, you have continuous discussion + continuous voting, to make
refinement of
the system a continuous process that adapts all the time.
I think GITHUB is the best working real-life-large-scale-example we
currently have.
I dont know of any larger system that evolves a &quot;SOURCE CODE BASE&quot;
(which might be libraries, programs or proposals or basically anything -
like the 2016 budget of the white house)
The techniques work regardless of the content of a repository!




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are modern parties, like the &quot;pirate party&quot; which is a world wide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; phenomenon and they would also be targets in trying tools and techniqes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't know if you're on the pirate party mailing list, but apparently
</I>&gt;<i> it's not going well.  Looks to me like every other
</I>&gt;<i> designed-by-committee project I've heard of with constant
</I>&gt;<i> interpersonal conflicts and lowest-common-denominator thinking
</I>&gt;<i> becoming standard.  This is not how great software, or great
</I>&gt;<i> government, will be developed.  Not to mention their negligible
</I>&gt;<i> political clout: An endorsement by the pirate party would seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> to have only negative consequences...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I am. But i agree with your assessment. I am more optimistic,
but its true. In the end, i believe the pirate party are all the &quot;non
technical people&quot;,
who believe in the ideas and would like to help.
Given existing tools, they might be willing to adapt those in order to be
able to
end the situation you describe.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You and everyone who believes in. You don't need approval of authority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if I submit a change to the Linux kernel, there is no &quot;authority&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> who decides whether it makes it into the distribution everyone uses?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

:<i>-)
</I>NO. Not like that. There are different *&quot;Linux distributions&quot;* and there
are different
*&quot;Open Source Unix&quot;* Projects. If you really believe there is a better way
to do the
Linux kernel, you are either a &quot;lonesome nut&quot; or have some people who see
that too.
So you could FORK the kernel and start to maintain it yourself, together
with all those,
who believe in the same ideas as you do. Then - if you can convince others
with your vision,
they start building systems on top of your alternative kernel.
...probably it offers some kind of neat features that made the FORK worth
the effort.
...if not, then you can probably solve the thing in &quot;user land&quot; by adding a
package installable
on existing or new linux distributions with the same kernel.




&gt;<i> Sorry, but I think Linus would disagree with that: HE decides.  No one
</I>&gt;<i> else.  Same with every other major open source package: They each have
</I>&gt;<i> their benevolent dictator who makes the final decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
iojs is wildly successful and has OPEN GOVERNANCE RULES without a
&quot;benevolent dictator&quot; + every group of people can just FORK the project
and do their own thing.
IOJS was forked from NODEJS and the first release of that alternative
version
came out on the 13.1.2015.
Its very fresh.






&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - The largest community of open source programmers is in javascript.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - <A HREF="http://npmjs.org">http://npmjs.org</A> is empowering that community (see the exponential
</I>&gt;<i> grows
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of &quot;npm&quot; - click on &quot;show all time data&quot;) =&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.modulecounts.com/">http://www.modulecounts.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - &quot;nodejs&quot; is a piece of technology that makes javascript powerful and
</I>&gt;<i> its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trademark is owned by a company called &quot;joyent&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - The team of core developers behind &quot;nodejs&quot; largely did not give a
</I>&gt;<i> shit,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forked &quot;nodejs&quot; into &quot;iojs&quot; and the open source community is following.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; =&gt; proving that the community is stronger than some authority
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; They even started to make fun of it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://nodejsreactions.tumblr.com/post/110551026973/hitler-finds-out-about-io-js">http://nodejsreactions.tumblr.com/post/110551026973/hitler-finds-out-about-io-js</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...there is no need to merge it back
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The analogy would be that some people in my town decide to legalize
</I>&gt;<i> cocaine and they &quot;fork&quot; the law, remove the part that prohibits
</I>&gt;<i> cocaine purchase or use, and then starts following the new law instead
</I>&gt;<i> of the old one.  &quot;No need to merge the changes back in!&quot;  That is not
</I>&gt;<i> government, it's anarchy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

This would be pretty neat if that was possible.
I believe all drugs should be legal and instead of investing into police
and some force
to ENFORCE that, the money should be spend on EDUCATION (about drugs) and
DEVELOPING people so that they can handle their lifes and be more
responsible
and have strong citizens... Its way cheaper in the long run and more sane.

But anyway - being able to FORK LAW just needs rules for people who meet
and come
from different &quot;jurisdictions&quot;, but SUPRISE :-) Mankind has a lot
experience with that,
because this is REALITY :-) We do not have a world government, but many
countries, who
do contracts between each other to solve those problems.

THAT's the way to go. *Why?*
*BECAUSE: *We want ONE LAW or ONE SYSTEM and finding the best rules needs a
lot of
experimenting and evolution, which is faster if we have millions of micro
experiments every day.
Our current system with all its slow government systems is holding back
progress A LOT.



&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe 20 years in the past, nobody would have thought, that &quot;the media&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get serious competition online, but in todays world, traditional media is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; struggeling a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is a whole movement called &quot;open data&quot; which grabs all the official
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; data of any institutions they can lay hands on and try to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; accessible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm counting on that, as I'm sure we all are, to help people get used
</I>&gt;<i> to the idea that a transition is possible.  It's not going well: Here
</I>&gt;<i> in Boulder, which has one of the most educated and politically aware
</I>&gt;<i> populations in the world, we still regularly find out about decisions
</I>&gt;<i> (and sometimes even whole decision-making bodies) that operate in the
</I>&gt;<i> shadows outside public awareness or oversight.  For this reason I've
</I>&gt;<i> kind of backed off on my previous plan to have a sort of &quot;mirror&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> government that votes on exactly the same bills as the real
</I>&gt;<i> government.  If we don't have access to what we need here in Boulder,
</I>&gt;<i> it's going to be even more unworkable to try it in most other places.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You have access to everything you need.
I think sitting back and being frustrated that their are &quot;shadow
organisations&quot; that decide,
and because they exist, its not worth do doing double work ...is the wrong
move.
Its all about building an alternative system - even if it doesnt succeed,
it creates
evolutionary PRESSURE for the current institutions to work hard and evolve
too,
because if they dont, the alternative will win.
So this it how it goes, you do it, not to be abe to take over, but to take
over in case
the existing institutions become lazy... and if they manage to stay in
power, they
probably do a good job, motivated by you.

Just make sure, that you never go for confrontation but for constructive
alternatives instead.




&gt;<i> We should all push for as much openness in our existing governments as
</I>&gt;<i> we can get, but IMHO we can't count on their help at all to ease the
</I>&gt;<i> transition because they don't even feel obligated to share this
</I>&gt;<i> information when they're *not* under threat of organized
</I>&gt;<i> second-guessing or replacement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Its true - it cannot be changed over night. Its a very long process
and i think its the essence of the open source movement.
