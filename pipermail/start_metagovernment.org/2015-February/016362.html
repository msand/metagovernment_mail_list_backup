Why?  Can we have everyone pass their own pet leash laws, or smoking
laws, or anything else for that matter?  That's one major way software
is different from law: There can be many versions of a software
package, but there can be only one legal code.

&gt;<i> It's about democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> The repository WhiteHouse/2016-budget-data is theirs, but you can have
</I>&gt;<i> You/2016-budget-data
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You may say, that is theory, but there is one very successful project out
</I>&gt;<i> there, called &quot;nodejs&quot;. It's bringing javascript to the server side and its
</I>&gt;<i> trademark is owned by a company called joyent.
</I>&gt;<i> The way they stirred the project sucked and so most of the core developers
</I>&gt;<i> decided to fork it and bring it under an open governance model.
</I>&gt;<i> It's now called iojs and it's more successful than the original already,
</I>&gt;<i> because those programmers have high standing in the community and people
</I>&gt;<i> believe in them, so they make the switch.
</I>
Right, but who's in charge of merging the changes until that point,
and indeed after that point?  I don't know about node.js specifically,
but every other open source software package I know of relies on the
&quot;benevolent dictator&quot; model of government.  Ultimately there is one
person or at most a small &quot;junta&quot; who makes the decision of what
changes are merged in and which aren't.  Sure, people are free to fork
if they want to ensure that their particular change is included in the
compiled version of the package they use, but then maintenance becomes
a nightmare because they have to manually track and selectively
integrate all future changes in all the other forks.  Law can't work
that way or we end up with the kind of SDAP government we already have
now, with the only difference being instead of people complaining
about the (supposedly benevolent) dictator being an asshole, he's out
starting wars or imprisoning or murdering his own people...

&gt;<i> They are still open to resolve issues with joyent and merge it back
</I>&gt;<i> eventually, but the whole point is, that - yes it's unpleasent in many ways
</I>&gt;<i> to use github, but awesome systems do not get build by single persons over
</I>&gt;<i> night - all this steady experimentation and moving back and forth is kind of
</I>&gt;<i> like an &quot;open research&quot; and once someone figured something out, people start
</I>&gt;<i> adopting it. This kind of model works particularly well in the &quot;javascript
</I>&gt;<i> world&quot; with a very liberal or anarchic approach towards having an open
</I>&gt;<i> source society in general.
</I>
As I've said before, I'm quite fond of the metaphor that
political/economic/cultural systems are &quot;software&quot; that we're running
on human beings as the hardware (or &quot;wetware&quot;).  But I'm hoping that
we can do a better job than most software, especially most open source
software.  Sometimes I'm ashamed to call myself a software engineer:
JavaScript in particular is a pox on humanity, a
designed-over-the-weekend language that never should have been
elevated to the level of &quot;industry standard&quot; but for time pressures
and lack of foresight in the management at Netscape.  We've truly made
very little progress in the development of software in the 30+ years
I've been developing it, most progress only occurring because of the
massive resources we have devoted to the problem.  Developing an app
for the web today actually takes *longer* than developing something
that did the same thing in HyperCard or Visual Basic 25 years ago
(though I'd concede that the vastly improved hardware we're running
means we save a lot of time on tuning and scalability issues).
Fortunately for me LiveCode is still kicking or I wouldn't even
consider developing a prototype for my proposed System.

&gt;<i> Everyone can code whatever and just publish it for everyone easy to use -
</I>&gt;<i> and its just a command away, (e.g. &quot;npm install You/2016-budget-data) and
</I>&gt;<i> then i start the project with (e.g. &quot;npm start&quot;) and my browser opens
</I>&gt;<i> showing me what you worked on ....
</I>&gt;<i> I then change some parts, give it a nice message (e.g. &quot;git commit &quot;I added
</I>&gt;<i> more colors to your charts&quot;) and then push it back to you... or if you do
</I>&gt;<i> not like the terminal, you do that on github,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where you can comment on every line of code, PLEASE CHECK:

</I>&gt;<i> This is a comment on a project run by guys that also participate in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of metagovernment.org and i try to explain how github works.
</I>
Have you used Google Docs much?  Seems to do the same things, but with
a much easier to use interface.  But I'm not a big fan of that either,
nor of wikis in general because of the experiences I've had with
others undoing or overwriting my changes.  These too, unfortunately,
IMHO are recipes for SDAP-led government.  I'd rather write the whole
proposal myself, asking for feedback along the way, then have people
vote it up or down.  My belief is that most other Neurotypicals have
had (or will have) the same experience.  That's generally how all the
software I worked on was developed, how *all* of the truly great
software I've ever used was developed, and how I believe that great
government will be developed.
  Regards,
    Scott
