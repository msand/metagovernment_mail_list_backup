Right, and 88% of Germans voted for that &quot;awesome user experience&quot; of
making Hitler dictator in 1934. Giving people what they think they
want without knowing enough about psychology, sociology, political
science, etc. to ensure that your system isn't going to enable a
repeat of something like that is naive and reckless. Granted the
actual danger from any of our proposals is actually quite small
because the odds of any of them becoming popular enough to be
destabilizing are probably negligible. But IMHO using TL;DR as an
excuse for not understanding how your proposed system could be misused
pretty much disqualifies you as a viable contributor to the process of
the evolution of government. IMHO your time and effort would be far
better spent learning about these fields than dicking around with
things when you don't even understand the risk you're exposing people
to:

1) Hey, I've discovered this great substance called &quot;Radium&quot; that
glows in the dark: Let's paint it on everything we need to see at
night!
2) This chlorofluorocarbon stuff is great, it's nonflammable and is
the liquid-gas transition happens right around room temperature.
Let's make tons of it and use it in all of our spray cans!
3) DDT will finally solve our bug problems because it's very lethal to
them but almost non-toxic to humans.  Let's spray it everywhere bugs
are found!

Right: Who needs to know whether your project will result in the
destruction of the human species, as long as it's POPULAR.  Granted,
Marx I'm sure never considered that Stalin/Mao/Pol Pot would use his
theories (as expressed in The Communist Manifesto) to enslave the
entire populations of their countries and collectively kill tens of
millions of people. Hitler I think had a better idea that the path
laid out in Mein Kampf would result in great amounts of death and
destruction (and not just of Jews), but apparently most of his &quot;users&quot;
did not (Mein Kampf sold 8 million copies prior to Hitlers &quot;election&quot;
to the post of dictator and I'd guess that most of those ended up
being classified by their purchasers as TL;DR). How will your project
be coopted and misused by SDAPs once it becomes popular? Do you even
understand *why* our existing systems don't work right? Have you
designed in adequate safeguards to prevent your system from being used
to achieve FAIL even faster and more reliably? Do you even have any
idea what those safeguards might look like?
  Regards,
    Scott
