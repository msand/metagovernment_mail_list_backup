<PRE>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The major problem is, that it's not so easy to come up with an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and proof
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to existing institutions that they might work better - all in a crisis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; environment and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all without focusing on &quot;earning a living&quot; instead.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Breaking away from mainstream to discover alternatives makes it hard to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; earn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still not sure what the main hangup is, but there are a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> potential factors:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What you said: No developer has the time to do this
</I>&gt;<i> 2) There's no money in it, so it doesn't attract organized (corporate)
</I>&gt;<i> development
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The People aren't asking for it, so developers aren't inspired
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The &quot;breakthrough idea&quot; hasn't hatched yet
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Developers, and The People are afraid of being called cranks, or
</I>&gt;<i> treasonous.
</I>

&gt;<i> I'm thinking #1 isn't a major factor because those developers seem to
</I>&gt;<i> have plenty of time to devote to open source projects.  My project
</I>&gt;<i> mostly hinges on #4, which leads directly to #3: Most people just
</I>&gt;<i> don't consider that there are better ways to run a government, and
</I>&gt;<i> won't believe it's possible until they actually can *use* it.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> also running up against #5 a lot on social media: Even in the US
</I>&gt;<i> people are paranoid about what their friends (and the NSA) will think
</I>&gt;<i> of them if they start promoting any really radical change.  Even if
</I>&gt;<i> they agree with you, or at least can't refute any of your arguments,
</I>&gt;<i> getting them to take any step beyond complaining (which *everyone*
</I>&gt;<i> seems to love to do!) is very difficult.
</I>


Somebody has to make the move and inspire and believe in the idea.
A leader without followers is always the lone nut in the beginning.



&gt;<i> Hence my frequent tirades
</I>&gt;<i> against &quot;slacktivism&quot; where people are willing to sign any petition
</I>&gt;<i> that puts a band-aid on one specific small problem, but won't commit
</I>&gt;<i> to anything beyond that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So IMHO the key to success is to make the new (voting) system as quick
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; easy as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; possible.  Design goals for improving discussion and debate being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; secondary to that primary goal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think this approach is fundamentally flawed.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Discussion is what drives democracy towards consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oooh, the dreaded &quot;consensus&quot; word.  I've said this before and I'll
</I>&gt;<i> say it again: If you think consensus, or even large supermajority,
</I>&gt;<i> decisions are possible for most real-world political proposals, you're
</I>&gt;<i> delusional.  It just doesn't work!  There are just too many people who
</I>&gt;<i> won't play the game fair if you propose this as an objective:  I once
</I>&gt;<i> was a member of an HOA where one of the Board members always voted
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no&quot;.  On EVERYTHING!  She was pretty conservative, which is part of
</I>&gt;<i> it, but I think more of it was that she was simply afraid of ever
</I>&gt;<i> being held responsible if some change she had voted for went bad.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you don't recognize that there are people like that out there, and
</I>&gt;<i> design your decisionmaking system to accommodate this fact, you're
</I>&gt;<i> doomed to failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

I dont know what to tell you.
It possible to talk forever. Its possible to not do anything.
Or the alternative is just start doing what you think is the right thing
and search for people
who join. Google and Github is full of things.
Check out all the existing projects that go into the direction you like,
attend meetups,
check out conferences or other user groups.
Promote your project or join others or fork theirs.
BUILD COMMUNITY.
Eventually you get somewhere. Otherwise nothing will change.
I discussed in forums and mailing lists forever and they are in fact a nice
place to
bounce ideas and get inspired.
Once you are, the time of doing comes and that is the time at which you
have to leave
the discussion place and actually do something.
Thats what i try to do. I just occasionally observe metagovernment these
days, thats all.



Ok, just wanted to say something.
Have fun, i'll go back to my projects now.
