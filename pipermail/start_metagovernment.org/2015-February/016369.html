Obligatory youtube link, especially obligatory for anyone on this list
contemplating starting a movement, or joining one (it's the First
Follower):

Right, but what I've been expecting, and yet unfortunately received
very little of on this list, is criticism.  I look at this process as
like software engineering, a key phase of which are alpha and beta
tests where you send a partially completed work out to be reviewed by
people who find the flaws in it.  I've taken it as my responsibility
to do this for others, though I'm sure it's not always appreciated.
But just as it's impossible to build great software without great bug
reports, IMHO it's impossible to develop new political/economic/social
systems unless people are willing to take the time to take them for a
spin and then report any flaws they find.

I'm hoping the limitation here is mainly just free time, but I also
get a sense that people don't want to criticize other people's work.
My point here is that this position isn't doing anyone any favors.

Of course it's also possible that my experience with people on FB is
representative and that my real problem is that people don't like
Matchism but can't provide a coherent argument about what's wrong with
it.  Which is actually fine, I think, because that would mean that
it's just ahead of its time and that I've primarily got a marketing
problem rather than an engineering problem.

</I>&gt;<i> Thats what i try to do. I just occasionally observe metagovernment these
</I>&gt;<i> days, thats all.
</I>
You may think you're farther along than you are though, or are maybe
heading off into the weeds.  Which is why I'm asking for backup for
some of your assertions (which I note you didn't provide ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
