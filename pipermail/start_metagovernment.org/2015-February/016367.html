I'm still not sure what the main hangup is, but there are a lot of
potential factors:
1) What you said: No developer has the time to do this
2) There's no money in it, so it doesn't attract organized (corporate)
development
3) The People aren't asking for it, so developers aren't inspired
4) The &quot;breakthrough idea&quot; hasn't hatched yet
5) Developers, and The People are afraid of being called cranks, or treasonous.

I'm thinking #1 isn't a major factor because those developers seem to
have plenty of time to devote to open source projects.  My project
mostly hinges on #4, which leads directly to #3: Most people just
don't consider that there are better ways to run a government, and
won't believe it's possible until they actually can *use* it.  I'm
also running up against #5 a lot on social media: Even in the US
people are paranoid about what their friends (and the NSA) will think
of them if they start promoting any really radical change.  Even if
they agree with you, or at least can't refute any of your arguments,
getting them to take any step beyond complaining (which *everyone*
seems to love to do!) is very difficult.  Hence my frequent tirades
against &quot;slacktivism&quot; where people are willing to sign any petition
that puts a band-aid on one specific small problem, but won't commit
to anything beyond that.

&gt;&gt;<i> So IMHO the key to success is to make the new (voting) system as quick and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible.  Design goals for improving discussion and debate being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secondary to that primary goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think this approach is fundamentally flawed.
</I>&gt;<i> Discussion is what drives democracy towards consensus.
</I>
Oooh, the dreaded &quot;consensus&quot; word.  I've said this before and I'll
say it again: If you think consensus, or even large supermajority,
decisions are possible for most real-world political proposals, you're
delusional.  It just doesn't work!  There are just too many people who
won't play the game fair if you propose this as an objective:  I once
was a member of an HOA where one of the Board members always voted
&quot;no&quot;.  On EVERYTHING!  She was pretty conservative, which is part of
it, but I think more of it was that she was simply afraid of ever
being held responsible if some change she had voted for went bad.  If
you don't recognize that there are people like that out there, and
design your decisionmaking system to accommodate this fact, you're
doomed to failure.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; You and everyone who believes in. You don't need approval of authority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So if I submit a change to the Linux kernel, there is no &quot;authority&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who decides whether it makes it into the distribution everyone uses?
</I>&gt;<i> :-)
</I>&gt;<i> NO. Not like that. There are different &quot;Linux distributions&quot; and there are
</I>&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Open Source Unix&quot; Projects. If you really believe there is a better way to
</I>&gt;<i> do the
</I>&gt;<i> Linux kernel, you are either a &quot;lonesome nut&quot; or have some people who see
</I>&gt;<i> that too.
</I>&gt;<i> So you could FORK the kernel and start to maintain it yourself, together
</I>&gt;<i> with all those,
</I>&gt;<i> who believe in the same ideas as you do. Then - if you can convince others
</I>&gt;<i> with your vision,
</I>&gt;<i> they start building systems on top of your alternative kernel.
</I>&gt;<i> ...probably it offers some kind of neat features that made the FORK worth
</I>&gt;<i> the effort.
</I>&gt;<i> ...if not, then you can probably solve the thing in &quot;user land&quot; by adding a
</I>&gt;<i> package installable
</I>&gt;<i> on existing or new linux distributions with the same kernel.
</I>
So, effectively you concede my point: There is no way to get any
arbitrary change of the kernel source past Linus without his approval.
Your claim about forking is therefore just handwaving: The resulting
distribution won't be Linux and no one will use it if it doesn't have
that benevolent dictator's stamp of approval on it.  And of course the
problem is far worse with real government because you can't even have
multiple versions.

&gt;<i> iojs is wildly successful and has OPEN GOVERNANCE RULES without a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;benevolent dictator&quot; + every group of people can just FORK the project
</I>&gt;<i> and do their own thing.
</I>&gt;<i> IOJS was forked from NODEJS and the first release of that alternative
</I>&gt;<i> version
</I>&gt;<i> came out on the 13.1.2015.
</I>&gt;<i> Its very fresh.
</I>
One fork does not a process make.  And your own reference shows that
the iojs process is run by a junta/politburo:
<A HREF="https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme">https://github.com/iojs/io.js/blob/v1.x/GOVERNANCE.md#readme</A>

What is your proposed alternative to that?

&gt;<i> THAT's the way to go. Why?
</I>&gt;<i> BECAUSE: We want ONE LAW or ONE SYSTEM and finding the best rules needs a
</I>&gt;<i> lot of
</I>&gt;<i> experimenting and evolution, which is faster if we have millions of micro
</I>&gt;<i> experiments every day.
</I>&gt;<i> Our current system with all its slow government systems is holding back
</I>&gt;<i> progress A LOT.
</I>
I hear this a lot, and it gives me the willies: I'm all for
experiments, but what you're saying is that millions of people
*needed* to die under Hitler or the various attempts at communism
because, well, that kind of &quot;experimentation&quot; is just necessary for
progress.  I take the opposite view: Rather than letting SDAPs run
experiments on us (mostly with the goal of increasing their own
power), we should *design* our government and economic systems.  Sure,
some tweaking will be required because we're not going to get it
exactly right the first time, but nobody engineers any other project
the way our government and economic systems have been designed, as a
series of hacks to patch the broken parts (there's a long section on
this issue on matchism.org in my attempt to resuscitate the concept of
social engineering).

I'm also not buying the &quot;vote with your feet&quot; option for real
government.  I see this a lot as a dig at libertarians on social media
(e.g., &quot;If you don't like the way the power company treats you, move
to Texas where they have choice!&quot;)  Localities ought to have some
flexibility on having their own laws, sure, but only as an experiment
to figure out how to administer them (Colorado's marijuana experiment
I think fits this).  But nobody moves from Kansas to Colorado because
they want legal marijuana or evolution instead of creationism taught
in schools.  Kansas just needs better government (i.e., one with less
SDAP control).

So, I'm still thinking the onus is on you to answer these three
questions that distinguish direct democracy (or, really, any
democracy) from github:
1) Who makes the decisions, a benevolent dictator/junta/politburo or The People?
2) How do they make these decisions, by some sort of ongoing
collaboration on the text of the proposal, or by having a vote?
3) How do multiple forks exist in a world government, or is allowing
some Localities to experiment with Hitler/Stalin/Mao just part of the
process?
   Regards,
     Scott
