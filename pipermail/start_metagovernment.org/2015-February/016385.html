The rest of the post seems very insightful to me, with appropriate
appreciation for the power of competition and capitalism, and of the
utility of the social sciences for understanding how we got here and
as a source of tools for how to design a new and better system.
Unfortunately this line makes me question whether you understand
capitalism, or other competitive environments (e.g., evolution) at
all: There is no point in even creating a business (or a species, or
even an idea) that is significantly hobbled by a characteristic that
reduces its fitness because that starting requirement guarantees
eventual failure.  Which leaves two alternatives: Only propose things
that increase fitness (and any sort of ethical or egalitarianism
constraint surely does not, as has been shown thousands of times in a
vast array of domains) *OR* you can propose a new system where these
constraints are applied equally to *ALL* of the competitors (i.e.,
*replacing* the government, not trying to change it or out-compete it
from within).

I've been reading a lot about communes lately.  Most of the research
(e.g., Sosis 2000 and 2003, Bader 2006) concentrates whether survival
rates are dependent on on factors like whether they are religious or
secular, their size, their leadership styles, or economic variables
(whether they own the land, whether there is a viable local market for
their products, etc).  But the most remarkable thing to me is simply
that there have been over 3000 documented experiments like this, only
a small fraction of which survived more than a few years and only a
handful of which continue to exist.  The Hutterites being the only
only long-survival example in the US, and they, like the Amish and
other highly religious communities would not even survive but for
their ability to parasitize the rest of the US (they would not survive
if not for charity, nor if they were not able to offload onto the
outside word roughly 20% of their birth population, which for various
reasons turn out to be incompatible with the group's functioning).
The Isreali kibbutzim are $4 BILLION USD in debt (about $15,000 per
person in them), and again this doesn't even include a wide variety of
other subsidies provided to them (direct donations, volunteer labor,
favorable tax rates, consumers paying more for their lower quality
products to support them, the ability to offload incompatible
individuals to the outside, etc.)

I've seen the same (or larger) failure rates for companies that try to
require any sort of collectivism, either in their work process or even
just in their management.

My conclusion from all of this is &quot;go big, or go home&quot;.  You can't
change the system by chipping away at from the inside, and so the goal
from the outset has to be to replace *all* governments with something
better.  Sure we can alpha and beta test on smaller groups, but it is
a fundamentally flawed proposal that we can build a company (or a
commune) that will organically grow to gradually &quot;consume&quot; the systems
still functioning outside of it.  That's just not how competition, or
revolution, works.  At some point there must be a single popular
majority-rules vote and the new system will replace the old one
immediately upon passage.  I realize this is scary and may seem like
there is a huge risk of biting off more than you can chew, but at this
point I am absolutely sure that you design for that goal or you're
just wasting your, and everyone else's, time.
  Regards,
    Scott
