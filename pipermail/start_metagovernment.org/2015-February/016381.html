<PRE>Hi Tom,

I was also considering a &quot;democratic business&quot; (for others, see wiki 
&quot;workplace democracy&quot;, &quot;syndicate&quot; or &quot;syndicalism&quot;).

I was thinking that I want to do &quot;rational things&quot; in a democratic business.

But when I do the rational things, that is nohow preventing the others 
from the &quot;irrational things&quot;. In fact the may focus more on their 
&quot;irrational totalitarian&quot; business, because I do the rational better 
than they did. Is it so ?

In the moment when I have considered that I may make some &quot;irrational 
business&quot; just for money and *power* of the business, I looked back at 
what I do. I do as others do, but we just share our money in a different 
way. In a way that prevents corruption, but just in my business.

I see future in &quot;democratic business&quot;, but first we need to outlaw 
&quot;totalitarian business&quot; IMHO.

Kind regards
Michael
