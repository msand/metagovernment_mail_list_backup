Subject: [MG] "good country" disappears down the slacktivism rabbit hole...
Message-ID: <CACobxW3+F4psWb1Uf241ohNdnpyR6yu+3yxjxO9yrexMCtqGJA@mail.gmail.com>

The "good country" project was very interesting to me when it first
launched several years ago. What they produced was a ranking of
countries using objective criteria to assess the living conditions of
the population (standard of living, crime rate, measures of individual
freedom, etc.).  I thought this might be useful as a tool for
evaluating existing governments and informing people about when they
needed to be changed.

Unfortunately they've decided to pivot and join the ranks of
slacktivism organizations like Avaaz, MoveOn, and change.org which are
based on the premise that the way to change the world is to give up
the hope of wielding any actual political power in favor of limiting
us to begging the elites for a little consideration on individual
issues. Worse, they've jumped on the AI bandwagon such that no one
really can understand how "The Will of The People" is determined. Oh
well. I guess we can at least be thankful that they didn't drink the
blockchain Kool-Aid:

Anyone still working on a system that will give The People *actual*
power instead of just reinforcing systems whose fundamental operating
characteristic is deference to elites?
