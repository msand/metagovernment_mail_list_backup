You should also imo make anonymity not priority. Anonymity is achieved by 
tweaking different subsystems in ways to drop information. This might be 
wanted, but it might also limit the approach or simply not a real need for the 
social process being reflected. I would therefore try to get the different parts 
of the architecture split and then design single authentication or sign-up 
mechanism which fit their political environment. Trust networks, current 
anonymity concepts like TOR, cryptographic functions all provide the means to 
spread trust from certain levels/identities on the web and combine that with 
anonymity, but you need entities which you can trust and this is definetly a 
problem when it comes to structures of power. There are many issues besides 
anonymity in regards to voting which have to be dealt with, just have a look 
at the Wiki pages Ed mentioned. 

Best is imo to always think about how this process can be controlled 
democratically (-&gt;socially transparent + solidarity of the users) and if we 
can come up with an infrastructure which allows different mechanisms (for 
different parts), before we blow the concepts with technical details. We then 
get some competition and playground for different projects in different parts of 
the infrastructure. It also helps to avoid that a project simply fails because 
one process is too complex or not working (like authentication). This is all 
new lands, we should not try to put technical details in there first.

The problem with being able to verify your own vote is that the vote server 
simply can give you a different view than somebody else. Even when the server 
regularly dumps the encrypted data for everybody to verify you then lose 
anonymity again, because you can get tracked down by statistics (at least when 
you intend to use the system for some time and different issues). There is no 
way to guarantee anonymity if you leak it in your drafting or communication no 
matter what kind of fancy cryptography you come up with. But since everybody 
is allowed to draft you can simply ask somebody not threatened to raise the 
issue for you and ask others to vote on it.

If you have a sane proposal, go ahead join the Wiki and create a draft in your 
namespace. I am also interested in this (as many others here), so we might 
come up with different models and can then define ways to build a trustworthy 
voters register independently from issues like drafting or delegation and 
voting. To build trust between different vote servers and share the registers 
to compete for voters and not registered users we need to find common processes 
how the registers are created and shared.
