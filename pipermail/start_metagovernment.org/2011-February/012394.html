<PRE>&gt;<i> Looking for &#8364; 0.02 ;-)
</I>
Haha, very funny :)

&gt;<i> The problem is not how to come up with a decision, the problem is how
</I>&gt;<i> face the fact that some decisions are taken now for things that need
</I>&gt;<i> to be done in the future. Which essentially mean that some people (the
</I>&gt;<i> people participating in the community now) will be in charge to decide
</I>&gt;<i> for the people in the future.
</I>
Yes, that's true, that's why I was suggesting to allow a fixed period
to try the &quot;initial&quot; decision whereupon any dissent can be revisited
*in light of* the successes or failures of that initial trial.  (Come
to think of it, that's similar to the democratic political process in
general -- you have two or four years to see if it was a good
decision, and then get to decide again....)

If no one is willing to take responsibility in the event of failure,
then it is premature to demand a decision.  The best that one can do
is proceed &quot;tentatively&quot;, entering a &quot;contingency mode&quot; where any risk
of failure is distributed among all and no *one* person is responsible
for the blame (or pick up the cause yourself :).

&gt;<i> I fail to understand how your process solves that. You explain how to
</I>&gt;<i> make a decision, sure. But what about what happens after. Should the
</I>&gt;<i> people in the future be forced to remain faithful to that? Will they
</I>&gt;<i> not protest, and call it undemocratic. Because those decisions have
</I>&gt;<i> been taken before they could participate? Please explain me.
</I>
Sorry for any confusion, I was operating under an unspoken and assumed
premise that no decision could/should remain binding forever.  So
processes for feedback and evaluation, redressing of grievences, etc
were already part of the mindset when answering the question.

Hopefully that's better....
