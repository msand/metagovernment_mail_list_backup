i am confused about the discussion on decision making

there is no such thing as decision making which is not about the future

that is an oxymoron

in the iroquois confederation's constitution first a well defined objective goal [such as building a meeting structure to house meetings of x number members and participants or negotiating an agreement with another state] was agreed on by the parliament and then legislation set up executives specific to that goal with powers and logistical support specific to that goal, and when the goal was complete, the executives returned all materials remaining and all mandates automatically expired. 

all laws were sunset laws, with built in expirations.

there was no single executive power, but every agreed upon goal had its own executive mandate built into its legislation which sunsets when the specified goal was achieved. parliament also placed time restrictions. 

majority rule is not democratic since minorities have rights regardless of the will of the majority so consensus not majority is the mechanism by which decisions are made. the rules protect the minority. 

as for the future, if my aunts decide to plant a maple tree, they have no way of knowing how much my children will appreciate maple syrup. they decide what is in everybody's best interest as well as they can... add value and wealth and equity... 

when that equity matures it is that community which THEN has the responsibility to decide for their successors: we don't own it we borrow it from our children

decision makers have that responsibility, to decide the best way they can for the future which is unforeseeable... 

that is the essence of decision making

you cannot leave decisions to a future which does not cannot exist now

equity. transparency and accountability not some mechanism of decision making since all rules can be manipulated and gamed.

accountability transparency and equity: everyone has a personal stake every knows how decisions are made and everyone knows the consequences of wrong decisions

that is how futures get decided 

there is no perfect system other than being a community
