<PRE>&gt;<i> Hey Conseo,
</I>Hey,
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't get very far.  I committed my changes:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/crossforum.xht#diff">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/crossforum.xht#diff</A>
</I>
Ok. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think I took a wrong turn at Albuquerque.  I figured I'd store the
</I>&gt;<i> harvester's incoming messages on my mailserver, but then I realized it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't have IMAP or POP, so I'd have to install Courier.  That seems
</I>&gt;<i> like too much work.
</I>
Well you need postfix as a mailer anyway right?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was going to ask if the harvester could read from a local mailbox,
</I>&gt;<i> or take delivery directly from the mailserver.  But most admins won't
</I>&gt;<i> have a mailserver already running, so scratch that.
</I>
I already have courier running here. I can set it up for you, if you like to, 
it shouldn't be a lot of work. 

I have only IMAP enalbed, since POP3 is crippled anyway if you want to run 
your own mailserver.

I have tweaked a Debian Lenny (courier-imap  4.4.0-2) default config to my 
needs quickly (with a howto back then some years ago). My imapd (configfile) for 
courier reads (without comments):

ADDRESS=192.168.0.1001 # ;-)
PORT=143
MAXDAEMONS=40
MAXPERIP=20
PIDFILE=/var/run/courier/imapd.pid
TCPDOPTS=&quot;-nodnslookup -noidentlookup&quot;
LOGGEROPTS=&quot;-name=imapd&quot;
IMAP_CAPABILITY=&quot;IMAP4rev1 UIDPLUS CHILDREN NAMESPACE THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT 
THREAD=REFERENCES SORT QUOTA IDLE&quot;
IMAP_KEYWORDS=1
IMAP_ACL=1
IMAP_CAPABILITY_ORIG=&quot;IMAP4rev1 UIDPLUS CHILDREN NAMESPACE 
THREAD=ORDEREDSUBJECT THREAD=REFERENCES SORT QUOTA AUTH=CRAM-MD5 AUTH=CRAM-
SHA1 AUTH=CRAM-SHA256 IDLE&quot;
IMAP_PROXY=0
IMAP_PROXY_FOREIGN=0
IMAP_IDLE_TIMEOUT=60
IMAP_MAILBOX_SANITY_CHECK=1
IMAP_CAPABILITY_TLS=&quot;$IMAP_CAPABILITY AUTH=PLAIN&quot;
IMAP_CAPABILITY_TLS_ORIG=&quot;$IMAP_CAPABILITY_ORIG AUTH=PLAIN&quot;
IMAP_DISABLETHREADSORT=0
IMAP_CHECK_ALL_FOLDERS=0
IMAP_OBSOLETE_CLIENT=0
IMAP_UMASK=022
IMAP_ULIMITD=65536
IMAP_USELOCKS=1
IMAP_SHAREDINDEXFILE=/etc/courier/shared/index
IMAP_ENHANCEDIDLE=1
IMAP_TRASHFOLDERNAME=Trash
IMAP_EMPTYTRASH=Trash:7
IMAP_MOVE_EXPUNGE_TO_TRASH=0
SENDMAIL=/usr/sbin/sendmail
HEADERFROM=X-IMAP-Sender
IMAPDSTART=YES
MAILDIRPATH=.maildir

Mail will be read from ~/.maildir of the user. I also have imapd-ssl configured 
accordingly. Authentication works through authmodulelist=&quot;authpam&quot; with me, so 
you only need to setup a system account.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe gmail with IMAP enabled?  It won't scale, but it should be OK
</I>&gt;<i> for starters.  I'll look into it tomorrow.
</I>This is how it is supposed to work when you start to install crossforum 
somewhere on some webspace not necessarily related to the project. But I am 
not a friend of Google as a service provider and it would be likely more 
default to run it locally on your own mail server. I have developped it with a 
freemail account though.
