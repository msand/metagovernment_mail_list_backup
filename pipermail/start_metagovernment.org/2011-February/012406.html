Yep. I think this is far more than a simple new feature. The problem you 
describe is imo rooted in the question of how do you classify e.g. health-care 
issues? The group you describe might not even know about the polls they are 
automatically assigned to and will not be able to follow all the discussions.

The problem of categorizing might not go undemocratically, e.g. when defining a 
poll, so if issues are summarized under a category, this should imo happen by 
drafting and be part of the content being discussed. This kind of 
metainformation can then be advertised by your delegates who will show you 
what similar issues they vote upon and you can then over time push your 
position not on every political issue, but on those you are interested in or 
in where you trust your delegates. Grouping all polls in a category will 
simply be overwhelming and very unspecific. It is also not good to simply 
delegate (a.k.a. vote) on categories, because as you have put it Thomas, this 
avoids synthesis and creates blind mass action imo. If you have a split 
consensus which differentiates over too many polls than what will happen 
(hopefully) in Votorola's case is, that people will start to talk to each 
other. If they try to outrun a poll with an oppositional consensus, then the 
oppositional poll can simply join the polls of each other to change the 
consensus to their liking which will result in a single poll over time. So you 
will be able to create polls for a bunch of similiar problems and even 
systematical questions and positions and not only for single issues during the 
collective learning process.
