<PRE>Decisions will be made like breaths will be drawn, an inhalation of
deliberation and an exhalation of action.

I think the more difficult question is how online communities gain the
authority to make decisions.  Right now all of that authority rests in the
real world.

I also think it's important to note that there will be no one right answer
concerning how to make decisions.  Marcos, your solution sounds sensible,
but would not be the right choice for every decision context.

For example, I just took place in a group process that worked under a
consensus model - 90% of the group needed to be at &quot;yes&quot; before the proposal
moved forward, and the commitment was to take as long as necessary to get to
90%, or if that wasn't possible, to walk away.

Another example might be decision environments where consent isn't needed,
only critical mass for action.  For instance, my homeowners association
decides to have a work party on Saturday when 5 people commit to showing up
at 10:00 AM.

There would be many other decision environments that could be imagined.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to take a stab at cataloguing them?  Perhaps
someone's already done this?

</I>&gt;<i> Haha, very funny :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is not how to come up with a decision, the problem is how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; face the fact that some decisions are taken now for things that need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be done in the future. Which essentially mean that some people (the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people participating in the community now) will be in charge to decide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the people in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's true, that's why I was suggesting to allow a fixed period
</I>&gt;<i> to try the &quot;initial&quot; decision whereupon any dissent can be revisited
</I>&gt;<i> *in light of* the successes or failures of that initial trial.  (Come
</I>&gt;<i> to think of it, that's similar to the democratic political process in
</I>&gt;<i> general -- you have two or four years to see if it was a good
</I>&gt;<i> decision, and then get to decide again....)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If no one is willing to take responsibility in the event of failure,
</I>&gt;<i> then it is premature to demand a decision.  The best that one can do
</I>&gt;<i> is proceed &quot;tentatively&quot;, entering a &quot;contingency mode&quot; where any risk
</I>&gt;<i> of failure is distributed among all and no *one* person is responsible
</I>&gt;<i> for the blame (or pick up the cause yourself :).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I fail to understand how your process solves that. You explain how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make a decision, sure. But what about what happens after. Should the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people in the future be forced to remain faithful to that? Will they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not protest, and call it undemocratic. Because those decisions have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been taken before they could participate? Please explain me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for any confusion, I was operating under an unspoken and assumed
</I>&gt;<i> premise that no decision could/should remain binding forever.  So
</I>&gt;<i> processes for feedback and evaluation, redressing of grievences, etc
</I>&gt;<i> were already part of the mindset when answering the question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hopefully that's better....
