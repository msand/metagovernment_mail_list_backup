<PRE>Jonas, maybe we should work together.

It looks to me, as if you are working on an aspect of e-dem, which we 
still have to with Votorola and vice versa.

You are about delegation which could maybe be called &quot;range delegation&quot;, 
where a single delegation covers a whole range of polls:

&quot;I delegate to one party for healthcare, another party for school, a third party for nature preservation, and so on.&quot;

And this range can include at maximum all existing polls (like in the current political system) and at minimum one poll.

Votorola only covers the last case so far: I can delegate my vote in each single poll only. I am really keen on this type of delegation, so more developement is necessary here.

On the other side, another really important question, which needs to be answered is: Once thousands of these &quot;range-delegates&quot; come together in a single poll, how do they find consensus?  A simple list of their positions/ideas is not good, because it forces them to vote strategic. It suppresses good ideas, and therefore favoures compromises over synthesis.

Here Votorola has already a working solution: &quot;communicative delegation&quot;. The &quot;range-delegates&quot; become communicative and delegate to each other.

To exaggerate a bit:

&quot;range delegation&quot; means: &quot;I delegate my vote to you  because you are an expert and I trust you and I want you to do the work for me.&quot;

&quot;communicative delegation&quot; means: &quot;I delegate my votes to you, because I want to influence your position. We are both experts and I want to work and negotiate with you. Our positions are pretty close and I have 10000 votes behind me. If you would be willing to merge this little paragraph into your position, we would have a consensus and our combined 20000 votes behind it. If you are not interested in cooperation, we go elsewhere ...&quot;

Both types of delegation are needed, both adress different needs. You have put work in one, we in the other ...

Thomas

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is an active discussion going on between a lot of direct
</I>&gt;<i> democratic parties right now. I post some of my own texts from that
</I>&gt;<i> email discussion, as an illustration of things I think about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LIQUID ADVISERS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A key aspect of the web is the ability to give tools for better informed
</I>&gt;<i> decisions. Easier evaluation of facts and reasoning. This can happen
</I>&gt;<i> collectively without any fixed authority, but in a way that will make it
</I>&gt;<i> clear and easy to find the facts and logic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A key aspect of &quot;liquid democracy&quot; is the delegation to trusted decision
</I>&gt;<i> makers. The model used in &quot;Aktiv Demokrati&quot; is that you can delegate to
</I>&gt;<i> as many delegates as you like. It can be different delegates for
</I>&gt;<i> different topics. A single person may have delegated to hundreds of
</I>&gt;<i> different delegates that in many cases will vote on the same things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One source of information is the overview of the stances of YOUR
</I>&gt;<i> delegates in each specific question, along with their arguments and
</I>&gt;<i> their sources and links to discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another source is &quot;LIQUID ADVISERS&quot;. They may be a decision maker, but
</I>&gt;<i> you only select them for giving you information in a question, without
</I>&gt;<i> delegating your vote to them. You will see their stance in each
</I>&gt;<i> question, with arguments and links to sources and discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;LIQUID ADVISERS&quot; also includes FACT SOURCES. They may not have a stance
</I>&gt;<i> for the question, but they give you the material for basing the
</I>&gt;<i> conclusions. The advicers may include organisations that does
</I>&gt;<i> statistical compilations and other research organisations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A &quot;delegate&quot; or &quot;adviser&quot; may be another person, a political party or an
</I>&gt;<i> organisation. But it may also be an algoritm or any type of program.
</I>&gt;<i> That means that you are free to construct your own way to gather
</I>&gt;<i> information from delegates or from any source you can think of, and
</I>&gt;<i> arrive at your own conclusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Liquid&quot; refers to the system of cascade delegation. A delegate or
</I>&gt;<i> adviser may use one or many other delegates or advisers, that may in
</I>&gt;<i> turn use other sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The web makes it possible to present all this information in a clear way
</I>&gt;<i> and to sort it based on who you trust and respect.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> MULTIPLE DELEGATION
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like everybody
</I>&gt;<i> the ability to choose their own system for delegation. A ranking system
</I>&gt;<i> is the just one of the simplest way to give more options.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Every person should be able to have different delegates for different
</I>&gt;<i> types of votings. She may want to delegate to one party for healthcare,
</I>&gt;<i> another party for school, a third party for nature preservation, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> She may want to have diffrent priorities of the delegates for different
</I>&gt;<i> categories. And for some categories she may want to not delegate to any
</I>&gt;<i> of them if two or more of her chosen delegates votes in different
</I>&gt;<i> directions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ALL of these functions can be described as the choise to delegate to
</I>&gt;<i> choosen alghoritms. That means that you can have a system there you only
</I>&gt;<i> can delegate to ONE delegate. But this delegate may be a computer
</I>&gt;<i> program that makes the choise based on a whole lot of other delegates
</I>&gt;<i> and systems of categorisation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The voting system can function a bit like the Firefox web browser. There
</I>&gt;<i> should be a clean and easy interface that will cover at least 95% of the
</I>&gt;<i> users. This interface may have advanced functions that can be unlocked
</I>&gt;<i> for those who desire. But everyone should also have the option to
</I>&gt;<i> install plugins that suit their needs for navigating the democracy
</I>&gt;<i> system (intellisphere). Popular plugins should be integrated in the
</I>&gt;<i> core. That is a way to make the democracy system in itself democratic.
</I>&gt;<i> There should never be one group of people that decide what the best way
</I>&gt;<i> for reaching decisions is for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One simple step, with this vision in mind, is to give the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> rank delegates and to assign different delegates for different categories.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the DEFAULT behaviour would be to give all chosen delegates the same
</I>&gt;<i> priority. If two or more delegates votes on the same thing, in opposite
</I>&gt;<i> directions, the default will be to NOT delegate to any of them and to
</I>&gt;<i> NOTIFY the person of the deadlock. The person would be encouraged to
</I>&gt;<i> examine the issue, look at the arguments, and make a decision. That
</I>&gt;<i> would counter-act most &quot;populistic&quot; votings, since you would expect that
</I>&gt;<i> at least one of the chosen delegates has a deeper understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> CONTINUOUS ELECTIONS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There should be room for different types of votings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The yes/no vote is just one of many. I can think of maybe 10-20
</I>&gt;<i> different types, used for different situations. Here is just one example
</I>&gt;<i> that I am going to implement soon:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Government and organisations usually has people on positions that is
</I>&gt;<i> trusted to perform specific jobs. Those persons can be selected by
</I>&gt;<i> ranked choice of persons willing to take the job. The result can be
</I>&gt;<i> summarized using the Schulze method. You will have a discussion thread
</I>&gt;<i> for each candidate with background information and argumenst for and
</I>&gt;<i> against. And you will have a main thread for the election as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no need to have the election at specific intervals. The result
</I>&gt;<i> can be summarized each time a person makes a change in her ranking of
</I>&gt;<i> the candidates. If a new person takes the first place in the summary,
</I>&gt;<i> and holds that place for a specific number of days, that person will
</I>&gt;<i> automatically be given the job after a certain number of days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The buffer period, ie the number of days a person must be the top
</I>&gt;<i> candidate before she is elected, can be a the point of another continous
</I>&gt;<i> election. This will be a median vote. Everyone can suggest any number of
</I>&gt;<i> days. The median value of all votes will be the number of days in the
</I>&gt;<i> buffer period. (That may be a different value for different posts.) Then
</I>&gt;<i> a person changes her vote and the median changes, it will take affect
</I>&gt;<i> after the buffer period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
