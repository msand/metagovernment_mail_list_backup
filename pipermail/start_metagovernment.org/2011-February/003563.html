<PRE>Dear All,
Are you all realizing that in this big demonstration in Egypt, and
those big protests, there is no leader.

Yes there are people and organisations protesting. But not one (or
few) figure to which everybody refers to.

This is a protest that has grown bottom up.
It might have had some help from the USA (as WikiLeaks suggests),
but the important thing is that people MUST be organizing on the net,
because there simply is no other way to organise all those people in a
way that is not hierarchical without the net!

Even with the internet down, and people only connecting through phones.

I keep on reading a lot of critics saying that the internet does not
automatically generate a revolution.
And in a sense I agree. And I do wonder what more could be done if we
have developed proper tools.
But in a sense twitter is an organizational tool. It has hashtags that
permit people to define a space dedicated to a topic.
It has voting power (number of retweets).
And it is simple and easy to use.

During the iranian revolution I was able to ask a question (and got it answered)
from the leader of the opposition, just by writing it on twitter, and
kept repeating it until other people picked it up.
The question was:
&quot;revolution like Che Guevara or like Gandhi?&quot;
His answer was:
&quot;when I was young I understood only Che, but now I say like Gandhi&quot;
(or something similar).

Now he did not answer the question to me personally, but it was
answered, and it was answered from his twitter account.
So we also have this, as things are repeated by people they detach
from the original author. And so the author is irrelevant. The idea
lives on.
We can do better. But twitter IS a tool that can be used for protests.

Interesting times ahead!
Pietro

</PRE>
