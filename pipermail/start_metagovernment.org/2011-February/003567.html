<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (a) Free-range drafting - Enabling us to continue working from the
</I>&gt;<i>       Metagov wiki as is.  (new, 2 days work)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (b) Difference bridge - Tying together our draft-work in the wiki
</I>&gt;<i>       and our discussions in the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   (c) Vote-server - Structuring the discussion/drafting cells, keeping
</I>&gt;<i>       them to human scales.  Exposing the shape of the emerging
</I>&gt;<i>       consensus or dissensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be the state-of-the-art (so far as I know) in light touch
</I>&gt;<i> tool support.  Being light touch, it would help to clarify how the
</I>&gt;<i> vote-server (c) interconnects with the other essential facilities, and
</I>&gt;<i> what it might take to factor it out - as in Thomas's &quot;meta-tool&quot;, or
</I>&gt;<i> Ed's &quot;voting skin&quot; - as a user preference. [1]
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the dogfood we'd be eating (as Ed says) would be pretty much
</I>&gt;<i> cross-project right from the start.  All we'd need is to improve on
</I>&gt;<i> it.  Are you guys OK with this?  It shouldn't take longer than a day
</I>&gt;<i> or two to code what's needed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Conseo?  It might seem a bit of a distraction from our work, but I
</I>&gt;<i> think it would help us both to get our hands on the tools, especially
</I>&gt;<i> at this stage.  (I should mention that Conseo has a lot on his plate.
</I>&gt;<i> He's been learning Java in order to help with the coding.)
</I>
I am ok with it. I don't know exactly what is involved to get free-range 
drafting working, but I am open to tasks.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1] In that sense, it ties to social mapping in the theatre app.
