I started out as you suggest, then I tried to do more:

  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4047&amp;a=4042&amp;aR=2706&amp;bR=2720">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4047&amp;a=4042&amp;aR=2706&amp;bR=2720</A>

  (hit refresh)

I don't think I succeeded.  It's visually confusing - not sure why.
Maybe with fresh eyes tomorrow I'll see what's wrong.

&gt;<i> &gt; I'm working to clear a path of entry for new users, maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  1. Potential user is attracted by drafting chatter in the list
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     and follows one of the embedded diff links (like above).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a good point of entry? It just shows the diff fragments
</I>&gt;<i> without surrounding context. Shouldn't users be encouraged to start
</I>&gt;<i> on someone's full draft? And/or would it be hard to do a full
</I>&gt;<i> side-by- side, even if most of the content is duplicated?
</I>
I agree with your first intuition, the full draft is a natural for
context.  It's indispensible.

If we go with a full draft, then the problem is reduced to one of
traversal.  We traverse (2) in order to expand the context, then (3)
to collapse it back again.

        (1)         (2)

        --&gt;         --&gt;
  List       Bridge      Wiki
        &lt;--         &lt;--

        (4)         (3)

Currently only (1) is easily traversible.  In that sense, the bridge
is only 1/4 built.  For a user stranded in the wiki, the crucial
crossing is (3).  Maybe that's the next thing to code?

(I'll reply to other points, soon)
