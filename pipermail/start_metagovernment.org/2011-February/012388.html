<PRE>I think this is one of the most important questions this group could ever
hope to answer.  It's well within the realm of what we know how to do to
inform the decision making of existing power structures, but how can groups
take binding decisions from asynchronous online participation?  I think
there first would have to be a decision using the existing decision making
structures of the group to cede authority (probably first in a test case on
a specific issue) to a well defined online process.  But what online
process?  There are many possible decision models, many of which could be
appropriate in different decision contexts.

I have to run out the door to a meeting now, but will try to contribute some
thinking on this subject soon, and look forward to learning from others on
this issue.

Cheers,
Mark

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also imagine applying it all respect to the government level. With a

</I>&gt;<i> transparent. So people can read all the documents that use to be

</I>&gt;<i> know the modern versions of the &quot;Molotov&#8211;Ribbentrop Pact&quot;, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i> Will those pacts be respected? Will they be evaluated, and then
</I>&gt;<i> rediscussed? Will the new ones be respected' How can anyone trust a
</I>&gt;<i> government that is fully participative, so people can just ignore
</I>&gt;<i> whatever pact that was defined before.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we should make sure the problem is explained on the wiki, in some
</I>&gt;<i> pages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts?
