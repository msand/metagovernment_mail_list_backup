</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  (styles have changed, please hit refresh)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Note that we now have &quot;diff me&quot; links in the UI (Ed log out to see).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the interests of approachability, instead of &quot;diff me&quot; with

</I>&gt;<i> that collapses that long text into just &quot;diff me.&quot;
</I>
+1, that would be perfect.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm working to clear a path of entry for new users, maybe something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like this:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  1. Potential user is attracted by drafting chatter in the list and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     follows one of the embedded diff links (like above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this a good point of entry? It just shows the diff fragments 
</I>&gt;<i> without surrounding context. Shouldn't users be encouraged to start on 
</I>&gt;<i> someone's full draft? And/or would it be hard to do a full 
</I>&gt;<i> side-by-side, even if most of the content is duplicated?
</I>
Would the same be possible like above, i.e. have both possibilities? 
Show full text comparison or collapse to diffs only? That would be best 
I guess.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     He sees the diff, then he either:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       a) Follows a &quot;diff me&quot; link against one of two drafts (say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          Ed's), or similarly:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       b) Follows a link to Ed's draft where he sees another &quot;diff me&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>          link, and he follows that one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  2. He is presented with a login screen and logs in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  3. He sees a massive diff, which is Ed's entire text.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  4. He presses the patch button, which in this case is labeled
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;Create a voter draft&quot;.  He is warned that he is about to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       a) Create a draft in the Metagov wiki, a clone of Ed's text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> More explanatory text such as this should be in the original link. 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Create a voter draft&quot; is not easily understood. How about something 
</I>&gt;<i> really simplistic like: &quot;Want to make changes to this proposal? Create 
</I>&gt;<i> a new draft based on this one.&quot; With the second sentence linked.
</I>
+1

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       b) Cast a vote for Ed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is where Votorola confuses me. It seems very odd that this user 
</I>&gt;<i> should vote for me at the same time he is proposing something 
</I>&gt;<i> different. Can you help clarify that? And if so, then that 
</I>&gt;<i> clarification text should show up on the page here somewhere as well.
</I>
Generally speaking: I think at first glance it looks counter-intuitive 
to be allowed to have an own position and at the same time vote for 
another position. But on the other hand, if I (as your voter) suggest 
improvements to your position, I already have a (maybe just slightly) 
different position than yours.

But I guess your point is about: why should I automatically vote for 
someone, from whom I happened to first copy text? And I agree, this 
should be far less automatic. Since we are so few voters atm it doesn't 
seem to make any sense, but I can imagine, if there are thousands, the 
question &quot;Do you want to also cast a vote for Ed?&quot; makes sense, since 
this will be the most probable case.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  5. He presses OK.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This takes him to the new draft page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  6. He edits the text and saves it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  7. He presses the &quot;diff me&quot; link at the top of his draft.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  8. It presents him w/ a diff vs. Ed's, which amounts to the whole of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     his proposed amendment.  (The bridge will be smart enough to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     realize that he wants a diff against his candidate and not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     against himself.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  9. He copies the diff URL from his address bar, pastes it into the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     original thread and says, &quot;Hey what do you think of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     amendment?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steps 7-9 seem very unintuitive, since &quot;diff me&quot; serves the opposite 
</I>&gt;<i> purpose earlier (explanatory text aside, it's still confusing). 
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't these three steps be automated? After saving in step 6, it 
</I>&gt;<i> could then run the diff against my original and present the user with 
</I>&gt;<i> a convenient link to that diff, with the text: &quot;Here is the link to 
</I>&gt;<i> the differences between your draft and the one you based it on.&quot; or 
</I>&gt;<i> other such plain language.
</I>
I dont know, if I would want an automatic diff, after I finished my 
position. But to solve the problem: How if we would have a &quot;diff vs. 
candidate&quot; besides every &quot;diff me&quot;?
