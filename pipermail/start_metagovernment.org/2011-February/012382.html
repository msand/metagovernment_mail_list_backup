What I intended to say was: These are things that I am going to ignore
for now. But they are things that should be considered at some point in
the future, and I got the impression that you may have solutions for it.

It seems that you have given some thought on distributed voting systems.

If anybody can get a replica and/or some checksums they can check those
against each other.

There is an active discussion going on between a lot of direct
democratic parties right now. I post some of my own texts from that
email discussion, as an illustration of things I think about:


LIQUID ADVISERS

A key aspect of the web is the ability to give tools for better informed
decisions. Easier evaluation of facts and reasoning. This can happen
collectively without any fixed authority, but in a way that will make it
clear and easy to find the facts and logic.

A key aspect of &quot;liquid democracy&quot; is the delegation to trusted decision
makers. The model used in &quot;Aktiv Demokrati&quot; is that you can delegate to
as many delegates as you like. It can be different delegates for
different topics. A single person may have delegated to hundreds of
different delegates that in many cases will vote on the same things.

One source of information is the overview of the stances of YOUR
delegates in each specific question, along with their arguments and
their sources and links to discussions.

Another source is &quot;LIQUID ADVISERS&quot;. They may be a decision maker, but
you only select them for giving you information in a question, without
delegating your vote to them. You will see their stance in each
question, with arguments and links to sources and discussions.

&quot;LIQUID ADVISERS&quot; also includes FACT SOURCES. They may not have a stance
for the question, but they give you the material for basing the
conclusions. The advicers may include organisations that does
statistical compilations and other research organisations.

A &quot;delegate&quot; or &quot;adviser&quot; may be another person, a political party or an
organisation. But it may also be an algoritm or any type of program.
That means that you are free to construct your own way to gather
information from delegates or from any source you can think of, and
arrive at your own conclusion.

&quot;Liquid&quot; refers to the system of cascade delegation. A delegate or
adviser may use one or many other delegates or advisers, that may in
turn use other sources.

The web makes it possible to present all this information in a clear way
and to sort it based on who you trust and respect.


MULTIPLE DELEGATION

I would like everybody
the ability to choose their own system for delegation. A ranking system
is the just one of the simplest way to give more options.

Every person should be able to have different delegates for different
types of votings. She may want to delegate to one party for healthcare,
another party for school, a third party for nature preservation, and so on.

She may want to have diffrent priorities of the delegates for different
categories. And for some categories she may want to not delegate to any
of them if two or more of her chosen delegates votes in different
directions.

ALL of these functions can be described as the choise to delegate to
choosen alghoritms. That means that you can have a system there you only
can delegate to ONE delegate. But this delegate may be a computer
program that makes the choise based on a whole lot of other delegates
and systems of categorisation.

The voting system can function a bit like the Firefox web browser. There
should be a clean and easy interface that will cover at least 95% of the
users. This interface may have advanced functions that can be unlocked
for those who desire. But everyone should also have the option to
install plugins that suit their needs for navigating the democracy
system (intellisphere). Popular plugins should be integrated in the
core. That is a way to make the democracy system in itself democratic.
There should never be one group of people that decide what the best way
for reaching decisions is for you.

One simple step, with this vision in mind, is to give the ability to
rank delegates and to assign different delegates for different categories.

But the DEFAULT behaviour would be to give all chosen delegates the same
priority. If two or more delegates votes on the same thing, in opposite
directions, the default will be to NOT delegate to any of them and to
NOTIFY the person of the deadlock. The person would be encouraged to
examine the issue, look at the arguments, and make a decision. That
would counter-act most &quot;populistic&quot; votings, since you would expect that
at least one of the chosen delegates has a deeper understanding of the
issues.


CONTINUOUS ELECTIONS

There should be room for different types of votings.

The yes/no vote is just one of many. I can think of maybe 10-20
different types, used for different situations. Here is just one example
that I am going to implement soon:

Government and organisations usually has people on positions that is
trusted to perform specific jobs. Those persons can be selected by
ranked choice of persons willing to take the job. The result can be
summarized using the Schulze method. You will have a discussion thread
for each candidate with background information and argumenst for and
against. And you will have a main thread for the election as a whole.

There is no need to have the election at specific intervals. The result
can be summarized each time a person makes a change in her ranking of
the candidates. If a new person takes the first place in the summary,
and holds that place for a specific number of days, that person will
automatically be given the job after a certain number of days.

The buffer period, ie the number of days a person must be the top
candidate before she is elected, can be a the point of another continous
election. This will be a median vote. Everyone can suggest any number of
days. The median value of all votes will be the number of days in the
buffer period. (That may be a different value for different posts.) Then
a person changes her vote and the median changes, it will take affect
after the buffer period.
