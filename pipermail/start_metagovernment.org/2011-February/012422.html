</I>
Yes, probably.  We've spoken since (you, C and I) and I think we
agreed these are now the priorities:

  1. Diff feed.  C says it's ready to deploy for testing against the
     Metagov list.  So:

     a) When you have time C, please fill in setup instructions for
        the diff feed here:
        <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/crossforum.xht#diff">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/crossforum.xht#diff</A>

     b) I'll install a chat client (as you suggest) so we can hammer
        out issues on #Metagov instead of flooding the list.

     c) I'll give you SSH access to the reference server as we
        discussed, so you can monitor things.  What's your public key?

     d) I'll set up the feed services there.

        Then we'll start seeing Metagov messages in the theatre app.

     BTW, before I forget:
     <A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/db/repo/votorola/file/4a948e370d4d/votorola/a/web/base/WEB-INF/web.xml">http://zelea.com/var/db/repo/votorola/file/4a948e370d4d/votorola/a/web/base/WEB-INF/web.xml</A>
     That name (voff) won't work for the online pollserver (v), it'll
     hit the wrong database.  Better to fetch it at runtime like this:

        VOFaceWeb.contextPathToPollserverName(
          getServletContext().getContextPath() );

  2. Finish roughing out the bridge footings in the wiki.

     a) For a voter's draft, automatically highlight differences
        vs. candidate.

     b) Links from draft to bridge.  You'll click next to the
        highlighted text, and land at the corresponding diff segment
        in the draft.

     c) Indicate in the footed draft which user is on the other side
        of the diff (as you suggest), and link directly to his footed
        draft.

        And maybe:

     d) Stronger links from bridge to drafts.  The script runs faster
        than expected, so maybe we can do the same here: link from
        each diff segment in the bridge directly to the corresponding
        highlighted text.

        (much more later)

  3. Votespace map.
     
Correct me anyone, if these are wrong.
