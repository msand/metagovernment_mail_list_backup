I have been thinking this as well. In this thread and elsewhere we use  
one kind of decision-making scenario and generalize from it, making  
conclusions that wouldn't apply to other kinds of scenarios.

There is a ton of information out there about kinds of decision- 
making. For example:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_theory</A>
The problem seems to be not one of finding it, but of honing it down  
to relevant aspects for the purposes of this group. We may be better  
off making a page on the wiki and just making our own list.

Some exemplar scenarios that occur to me are:

- A civic regulation such traffic signal light. These sorts of laws  
are only useful if everyone follows them. An opt-in system of obeying  
traffic signals would make them entirely useless.

- A business regulation such as requiring the accurate statement of  
food ingredients, which helps protect the citizenry from harmful  
behavior by enterprises.

- A civic project such as building a road. Here there is the  
possibility for opt-in/opt-out. However, there are wider issues  
relating to opting. For example, do people who opt out of paying for  
the road still get to use it? Or, perhaps building the road will have  
environmental impacts that affect people nearby; so they want to not  
simply opt-out of the project but actively stop it.

- An ongoing community service such as a fire brigade or a homeless  
shelter. Another scenario where opt-in/opt-out is imaginable, but the  
service provides a social good to the entire community regardless of  
who in particular pays for it.

- Bureaucratic government actions, such as hiring and paying vendors  
to carry out community decisions. If the community decides to build a  
road, who administers the details of the project?

- Laws of civil order; and their enforcement. Laws against murder are  
easy to support, but there are countless other laws that become much  
more fuzzy. At what point does the community get to decide that this  
kind of law gets passed, and at what point do they get the authority  
to enforce such a law with the power of coercion? A 100% opt-in system  
certainly doesn't work against, say, crimes of property, because one  
person could break consensus and then claim the right to break into  
other peoples' houses and rob them.

- Responding to an impending disaster, invasion, etc. Consensus is not  
nearly as imperative as quick action; however there can be substantial  
disagreement about what action to take.

These are just some examples. I probably should have just started this  
list in the wiki, but my time is up for now. Anyone else, feel free to  
transcribe this there and start work on organizing it. Or point to a  
good list that is already out there, if you can find one.
