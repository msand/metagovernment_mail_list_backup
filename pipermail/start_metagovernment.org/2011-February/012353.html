<PRE>Hi,

I didn't want to write into this thread at first as I have already posted about 
the interesting situation in the arabian states before and am still in the 
process of contacting people in Egypt or Tunisia, but atm. they seem to be 
busy with first overthrowing their old regimes, which is of course important 
for democratization and self-understanding of the revolutionary change. 
Developing our tools is also more important than chatting about all kinds of 
stuff, esp. world history.
Yet some misconceptions strike me and I want to make clear that for me this is 
nonsense and could cost a lot of failed effort in the long run. As I develop 
tools for very open consensus building, I am of course ok with different 
opinions. But since the assumptions made here deeply influence the strategy of 
our development I have to add some critical and sometimes polemical notes.

&gt;<i> I am not so enthusiastic about all those means that make it easier
</I>&gt;<i> immediate reaction and short-term &quot;collaboration&quot;, because I am really
</I>&gt;<i> not a fan of street movements. 
</I>
Most people are not fans of street movements, thats why they have a 
comfortable home, if they can afford it.

&gt;<i> Almost every revolution crashes into a
</I>&gt;<i> despotic ruling, more despotic even than what you've had before - and
</I>&gt;<i> you know why? 
</I>
Now common and finally explain world history. 

&gt;<i> because well, you have overthrown your king or your
</I>&gt;<i> government, but have you prepared your next morning?
</I>
These people work every next morning and build the whole society up all the 
time, so their undemocratical rulers can enrich themselves and even corrupt 
their efforts. You have a very strange understanding of how society works when 
you think that people need to get ordered or even externally organized to 
work. At least this opposes a democratic approach on society. But see what 
happens with Mubarak when the general strike goes on... then dependencies 
become clear.

&gt;<i> do you know
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly well in how long time there will be free elections, and who
</I>&gt;<i> will be managing them, according to which rules etc.?
</I>
In Egypt there are no free elections and will not be without a revolution. 
Even now Mubarak and the West oppose that and want to have time to build up a 
successor regime, although the people want elections as soon as possible and 
want Mubarak to leave immediatly to organize elections freely and independant 
of the US, they write this on their posters.
Almost all elections in the arab world (and elsewhere too) are a fake. In 
these countries you have open faking and the international community (led by 
the west) cheers on them as long as it is the right party who wins. It is not 
the same well hidden fine systematic borders which keep opposition out in the 
West.
Remember the elections in Afghanistan? People were tortured by the Taliban 
when they voted and then they where fooled with Karsai.

&gt;<i> maybe tomorrow
</I>&gt;<i> you'll be engaged in street fighting over what is better, Condorcet or
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto or...?
</I>
Uhhh boy. A marxist would laugh at you and tell you that you follow the 
typical reformist pattern of argument which has been used and has greatly 
failed over the last 150 years. Just look at the shameful failure of the often 
mentioned german SPD up to date (they are vanishing atm.) to see how long 
planning and avoiding any revolutionary action has not only caused them to 
sign the loans for and therefore cause the first world war, but also put them 
on hold to call out a people's front together with the communists to stop 
Hitler until communists, unionists and many social democrats kicked the bucket 
in concentration camps. The great doctrine of self-driven historical progress 
in the forms of capitalistic society has always claimed that the time of 
crisis is over and the future will bring no more violence but steady progress 
into freedom and wealth. It always leads to passiveness, no-action, 
compromised vocabulary of the status quo and then failure. 
They have sacrificed any socialist and democratic agenda they had and have only 
reached some confused compromises while even abandoning their rhetorics. The 
biggest achievement they made was a relaxed foreign policy for the GDR under 
Brandt.
Marx criticizes this misconception of society in the whole of Capital already 
as a narrowed perspective on human freedom and the true meaning of revolution. 
Revolutions have a violent component, but they do not represent in street 
violence. Its only the most visible and propagated part of a revolution.
Now the last government of the SPD until 2005 has brought the worst 
compromises which wouldn't have been possible under a conservative government 
with SPD in opposition and has brought them down to 20%+.

Don't get me wrong, I don't say the communists where judging the situation 
better in the case of Hitler (esp. Stalin with his stupid social fascist 
doctrine) or that I impose a marxist view point. But to stick to reasoning and 
historical facts, since we want to be successful and work democractic tools 
out together, I do have to insist, that both revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt 
are democratical at heart compared to their predecessors and not &quot;ill-
planned&quot;. As I have told Ed already, revolutions come always too early, this 
has been the cant at least since the commune of Paris by all bureaucrats and 
organisators, who actually didn't want a change at all, because they could 
claim a privileged mediating position in the old system and risk a lot in a 
revolution.
If you have not only watched the chauvinist and at times racist media coverage 
by mainstream media, which only talks about chaos, instability and shows 
selected pictures of &quot;shocking&quot; violence with young demonstrators throwing 
stones and burning cars, you will have noticed that douzens of demonstrators 
where killed by the police and hidden away as shown by Al-Jazeera. The 
military, the same as in Tunisia, support the people where ex-governmentals 
and police drove around in all kind of official cars shooting at people to 
create chaos and give a reason for a new &quot;stable&quot; dictatorship. What a 
surprise that in both countries the governmental police has lost control over 
several thousands prisoners who came free and are threatening public safety 
now. The demonstrators behave peacefully and have joined the military. They 
sing and it is an atmosphere like a concert or giant public event. 
Now you tell me why this boy had to be killed, I really don't understand:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebcc1ZbXnCE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebcc1ZbXnCE</A>
Even several children have been shot as reported by Al-Jazeera.

The mainstream media have claimed that Mubarak is a moderate dictator and 
longstanding friend of the West while now islamisation follows. This is pure 
propaganda and a form of racism which claims that arab people are not able to 
organize democratically. The muslim brotherhood has no majority in Egypt and 
for example a woman wearing a Burka in the streets of Cairo said in an 
interview that she by no means wants to have an islamic state, but a 
constitutional state with proper human rights. Hamas has also oppressed 
demonstrations in Gaza strip as protestors wanted to show solidarity with the 
Egyptians there. All slogans of the demonstrators are about freedom of speech 
and democracy, not about religion or voilence. They know what they want and 
that is why they have finally the guts to unite and go on the streets after 
decades of brutal oppression and hunger (look at the food price speculations 
on Wallstreet). You would like to send them back home? 

Mubarak has been supported by the US and EU with billions every year to keep 
the largest Arab nation controlling the Suez canal and Gaza strip quiet. The 
revolution jeopardizes the whole Nato/US/EU strategy from the Maghreb to 
Afghanistan if it succeeds. 
Did you know that even the US-military estimates that only 10% of the 
rebellions in Afghanistan are motivated by fundamentalists? The rest is 
poverty driven grass-roots movements with unemployment rates between 50%-70%. 
The IMF's strategy has only worked for capital investment not for the Afghan 
people. For them there is a &quot;robust&quot; peace mission to keep them quiet. All 
these countries share a common phenomenon which has now finally also arrived 
the outer countries of the EU and US and already generated similar pictures in 
Greece: massive unemployment, esp. of the in parts well-educated youth. What 
do you think would you do with less then 2$ a day, no rights and no 
perspective after 30 years of dictatorship? Work on Concordet methods? They 
have burned themselves alive, because of desparity.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sit at your houses instead, and do some tedious long work, that of
</I>&gt;<i> elaborating basic rules (Constitution, and first of all, what kind of
</I>&gt;<i> elections, how and when). 
</I>
You don't have a clue about the deeply corrupted structures of theses regimes 
and the situation of the peasants when EU agrar subventions kill their living 
in the whole of Africa and cause the highest deaths rate on EU borders. 
And you don't have a clue either about the violence that was necessary to 
bring and save our constitutions. They are historical documents of social 
compromise, not of devine enlightenment.
Their governments, educated in elite institutions of the West, get paid to 
keep the people quiet while Western companies maraud their resources and pay 
us our small privileges to feel superiour and accept that. It is not even a 
secret, just have a look at all the documentaries about the IMF or at the 
recent leaks. It is a continous bureaucratic work which is done exactly the 
way inside democratically legitimized institutions you would impose on the 
oppressed in the name of your picture of order. Don't you know there have been 
oppositional movements in Egypt in the past, which have been brutally 
oppressed and tortured in their prisons? Where do you think do fundamentalists 
and esp. the Taliban come from? They come from oppressed revolutions by the 
West. Afghanistan had one of the largest (independant) communist parties 
before the soviet invasion. The Arabian left has been killed by the US, which 
left the field for the fundamentalists.
This is the real threat, that if they don't get democracy now, they will 
truely radicalize and turn against us, who support their oppression. Then 
islamism might be an acceptable ideology to attack the West, as it has 
happened in Iran, Afghanistan (the Taliban are CIA financed mercenaries from 
all over the arab countries, not Afghans) and is happening in Pakistan atm.
You have a really &quot;strange&quot; perspective on the abilities of reasoning of Arab 
people. You think you have done &quot;long&quot; work which justifies your privileges 
over them and they need to learn your theoretical ways before they have the 
right to emancipate? 

&gt;<i> Do it openly (not only transparently, but
</I>&gt;<i> open to any new participant, however numerous, stupid and even
</I>&gt;<i> ill-intentioned they might be). If you are not ready with your work
</I>&gt;<i> when some revolution happens on the street down your windows - it's
</I>&gt;<i> not for you this time, this one, you should just quietly continue the
</I>&gt;<i> same job. 
</I>
LOL. You assume freedom of speech. You cannot wait on that, it would be 
absurd. You completely unreflectedly project your lifestyle into their 
situation.

&gt;<i> YOUR revolution will be not for overthrowing the next
</I>&gt;<i> monarch or next bolsheviks or Jacobeans (French jacobins), but for
</I>&gt;<i> installing something positive that you have elaborated meantime.
</I>
Neither the bolsheviks nor the Jacobins have made a revolution. It is in the 
very definition of a revolution to try to solve a deeply rooted social conflict. 
People only revolutionize, as Marx has put it, when they have nothing else to 
lose than their chains. They won't risk their asses for any organisation.
And of course you have to overthrow the overcome regime to do that first as its 
the most static part of the overcome structure. After each revolution, 
including 68, there has been a large productive impulse on society from the 
experiences made, which ultimately, as you suggest, have always lead to new 
forms of power and government and have deeply driven the whole history of the 
19th and 20th century. 
It's the people who make a revolution and if the currently leading 
organisation does not fit, it is simply put out of the way and a new 
organisation is created, because the problems causing the revolution need to 
be solved. That is where the soviets came from. They had nothing to do with 
the Bolshevik party. In fact Lenin opposed the idea in the beginning and has 
later killed them off to get more flexible in the fight against the white 
gardists, although he has teamed up with them during the revolution. Now you 
tell me the sowjets weren't positive. It is also no doubt that the sovjet 
regime was a immense progress over the czaristic Russia, even if it was brutal 
too.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cyril, the leader of a sit-at-home revolution...
</I>
Honestly, before you judge the right for other people to revolt from an a 
formalistic and therefore false view point, I would propose you sit-at-home 
and surf the Internet for the facts about the revolutions in present and past. 
Start with some classics on historical materialism to not get fooled too quick 
in dumb ideology and then have a look at what happened in the last 200 years. 
It is all out there, you don't even have to leave your mighty home. We really 
cannot afford to misjudge history if we want to build tools for true democracy.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is one idea floating around (I forget the author), which is to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use smartphones to run ad hoc mesh networks. Each phone connects to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearby phones using wifi, and they form a grid amongst the mob on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; street.  Once this network is in place, a layer of encryption and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anonymisation works on top, and then on top of that the applications.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The original suggestion was that each phone would act as a Diaspora
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; node, but they could equally be running Vilfredo or something else.
</I>
Exactly. This is why I have proposed to reach Tunisian opposition, to get them 
in touch with us and help them and us to gain experience. I have mailed the 
very famous blogger and now secretary of youth and sports: 
<A HREF="http://nomemoryspace.wordpress.com/">http://nomemoryspace.wordpress.com/</A>
He has not shown up on the list yet.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As the crowd moves through the streets, it carries its own cloud
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; network, its own means of sharing ideas, photos and video, and of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; making decisions using deliberation software. And of course, it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; more difficult to shut down than the internet proper.
</I>
This is truely an interesting perspective. Yet we should hammer that out into 
the respective layers of OSI and concentrate on what we do. I don't think this 
will be practicable in the next two years (esp. since most of them likely 
don't have an wifi-enabled android phone yet and Diaspora is still &quot;alpha&quot;), 
Until then IPv6 will be standard for example.
Remember half of the Egyptian population has only 2$ /day. This doesn't mean 
they are not in the Internet but it means they won't buy a 300$ smart phone + 
internet flat soon. We need to get in touch with them to understand what they 
need now.

&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Immediately, it could carry information on where the riot cops, medic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; stations and water cannons are, but could be used to discuss and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide where to go, what to do or what should happen once the riots
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are over.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Are you all realizing that in this big demonstration in Egypt, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; those big protests, there is no leader.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Yes there are people and organisations protesting. But not one (or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; few) figure to which everybody refers to.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This is a protest that has grown bottom up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It might have had some help from the USA (as WikiLeaks suggests),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; but the important thing is that people MUST be organizing on the net,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; because there simply is no other way to organise all those people in a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; way that is not hierarchical without the net!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Even with the internet down, and people only connecting through phones.
</I>
They have serious problems. They don't go away with the internet. I wouldn't 
say that there is no other way, historically, take the Spain civil war for 
example, there have been anarchist forms of society which could reproduce 
themselves in an interesting form and even extended productivity quite a bit. 
They where not strong enough to succeed against fascism though.
The Internet makes the communicative medium flexible and reprogrammable, which 
should help to create truely democratical processes and adjust them on the 
way.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I keep on reading a lot of critics saying that the internet does not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; automatically generate a revolution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And in a sense I agree. And I do wonder what more could be done if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have developed proper tools.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But in a sense twitter is an organizational tool. It has hashtags that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; permit people to define a space dedicated to a topic.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; It has voting power (number of retweets).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And it is simple and easy to use.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; During the iranian revolution I was able to ask a question (and got it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; answered) from the leader of the opposition, just by writing it on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; twitter, and kept repeating it until other people picked it up.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The question was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;revolution like Che Guevara or like Gandhi?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; His answer was:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;when I was young I understood only Che, but now I say like Gandhi&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (or something similar).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now he did not answer the question to me personally, but it was
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; answered, and it was answered from his twitter account.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; So we also have this, as things are repeated by people they detach
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; from the original author. And so the author is irrelevant. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; lives on.
</I>
You sound like Anonymous ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We can do better. But twitter IS a tool that can be used for protests.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Interesting times ahead!
</I>
Indeed! Hope we can finally work together on a common infrastructure. The 
things to come are large enough to give us all a good perspective toghether 
with the people we reach.
