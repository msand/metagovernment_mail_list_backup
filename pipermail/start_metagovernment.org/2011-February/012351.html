<PRE>There is one idea floating around (I forget the author), which is to
use smartphones to run ad hoc mesh networks. Each phone connects to
nearby phones using wifi, and they form a grid amongst the mob on the
street.  Once this network is in place, a layer of encryption and
anonymisation works on top, and then on top of that the applications.
The original suggestion was that each phone would act as a Diaspora
node, but they could equally be running Vilfredo or something else.

As the crowd moves through the streets, it carries its own cloud
network, its own means of sharing ideas, photos and video, and of
making decisions using deliberation software. And of course, it is
more difficult to shut down than the internet proper.

Immediately, it could carry information on where the riot cops, medic
stations and water cannons are, but could be used to discuss and
decide where to go, what to do or what should happen once the riots
are over.

&gt;<i> Dear All,
</I>&gt;<i> Are you all realizing that in this big demonstration in Egypt, and
</I>&gt;<i> those big protests, there is no leader.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes there are people and organisations protesting. But not one (or
</I>&gt;<i> few) figure to which everybody refers to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a protest that has grown bottom up.
</I>&gt;<i> It might have had some help from the USA (as WikiLeaks suggests),
</I>&gt;<i> but the important thing is that people MUST be organizing on the net,
</I>&gt;<i> because there simply is no other way to organise all those people in a
</I>&gt;<i> way that is not hierarchical without the net!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even with the internet down, and people only connecting through phones.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I keep on reading a lot of critics saying that the internet does not
</I>&gt;<i> automatically generate a revolution.
</I>&gt;<i> And in a sense I agree. And I do wonder what more could be done if we
</I>&gt;<i> have developed proper tools.
</I>&gt;<i> But in a sense twitter is an organizational tool. It has hashtags that
</I>&gt;<i> permit people to define a space dedicated to a topic.
</I>&gt;<i> It has voting power (number of retweets).
</I>&gt;<i> And it is simple and easy to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the iranian revolution I was able to ask a question (and got it answered)
</I>&gt;<i> from the leader of the opposition, just by writing it on twitter, and
</I>&gt;<i> kept repeating it until other people picked it up.
</I>&gt;<i> The question was:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;revolution like Che Guevara or like Gandhi?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> His answer was:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;when I was young I understood only Che, but now I say like Gandhi&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (or something similar).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now he did not answer the question to me personally, but it was
</I>&gt;<i> answered, and it was answered from his twitter account.
</I>&gt;<i> So we also have this, as things are repeated by people they detach
</I>&gt;<i> from the original author. And so the author is irrelevant. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> lives on.
</I>&gt;<i> We can do better. But twitter IS a tool that can be used for protests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting times ahead!
