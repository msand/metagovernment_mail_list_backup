<PRE>You know that I am going to present Vilfredo in Milan with the help of
a bottom up political group.
Also I am right now presenting an application for a grant on similar topics.
The proposal will have a theoretical part, a coding part, and some pilots.

So it was just natural to ask this political group if they were
interested in participating in the pilots.
Please pay attention to the answer, because I think it is important.

They said:
&quot;Sure we are interested in testing those tools, but we cannot sign a
letter [which would be needed for the application],
because each decision is taken on the spot, and no one can take a
decision that would be binding for the group in the future.&quot;

I think this is a really important problem.
Here we have a bottom up group, who is used to take decisions (only)
in a democratic way,
but who, because of this, cannot give its word that it will do something.

As we want to build tools that can be used as the decision making tool
in a group,
how are we going to handle those situations? Will the groups that use
our tool always be limited to live in the ever present now. Without
ever being able to promise something in the future? That would be a
really big limitation. But what other options are there?

Also imagine applying it all respect to the government level. With a
magic wand touch, now the US is a participative democracy, and fully
transparent. So people can read all the documents that use to be
secret. Among them also all the secret agreements between nations. You
know the modern versions of the &quot;Molotov&#8211;Ribbentrop Pact&quot;, and so on.
Will those pacts be respected? Will they be evaluated, and then
rediscussed? Will the new ones be respected' How can anyone trust a
government that is fully participative, so people can just ignore
whatever pact that was defined before.

Maybe we should make sure the problem is explained on the wiki, in some pages.

Your thoughts?
Pietro
