<PRE>Hi Marcos,

I might not have understood your point.

On 12 February 2011 02:02, Marcos &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">stalkingtime at gmail.com</A>&gt; wrote:

The problem is not how to come up with a decision, the problem is how
face the fact that some decisions are taken now for things that need
to be done in the future. Which essentially mean that some people (the
people participating in the community now) will be in charge to decide
for the people in the future.

Sometimes it will be the same people, but they might have changed
idea. Sometimes they will have discovered some new elements. And
sometimes the people of the community have changed. Just look at how
people have changed in our community in the last years.

I fail to understand how your process solves that. You explain how to
make a decision, sure. But what about what happens after. Should the
people in the future be forced to remain faithful to that? Will they
not protest, and call it undemocratic. Because those decisions have
been taken before they could participate? Please explain me.


Looking for &#8364; 0.02 ;-)

Cheers
Pietro
