<PRE>I did some work on the phrasing, Ed.  Just little things:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4025&amp;a=4026&amp;aR=2678&amp;bR=2591">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?b=4025&amp;a=4026&amp;aR=2678&amp;bR=2591</A>

What do you think?  If you agree, just hit the patch button.

I'm a little slow off the mark, but here I am.  Lead on! :-)

You and Conseo are set up and ready to go, whenever you're ready:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho</A>

Does anyone else want to give it a spin?  It's got wires sticking out,
so it isn't self-serve yet.  To set you up, we need your usernames in
both wikis: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w">http://u.zelea.com/w</A>
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki">http://metagovernment.org/wiki</A>

It definitely needs work.  But maybe it's best for now just to use it
and get a feel for it.  It's tied to your work on the diff feed ofc,
and the two support each other.  (You already understand how, ofc.
But almost nobody else does, not till they get their hands on one, or
the other - at least that's how it was for me.)

User instructions (once you're setup):

  1. Start at the poll page in the pollwiki:
     <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/mho</A>

  2. From the poll page, follow links to the position pages of the
     various users.

  3. From each position page, follow diff links.  You get a diff from
     which you can cherry-pick the user's changes, or invite that user
     to cherry-pick yours (example at top).

Please let me know if you find bugs, or run into other problems.  It
still needs lots of work, ofc.
