That's what I was talking about. There is no &quot;visual concept&quot; which enables
users to intuitively understand the voting tool. Users cannot really learn
what the tools can do for them by experimenting with them. They have to read
the manual to know how thing work... but there first has to be an &quot;up to
date&quot;-manual that a user could read.... and still they would hate to do so.

I agree with Ed, that it is confusing, if you have two voters, both 
suggesting the same diff among other diffs. Because after you patched 
this diff from your first voter and go to the diff-page your second 
voter send you, it is already outdated.

Possible solution: Have a message on top of the page: &quot;This diff is 
outdated! For the current one click here.&quot;

Problem: The numbering of the diffs gets out of order. Could be solved 
by numbering diffs according to the line of text, they appear in. E.g. 
diff 12, diff 232 and diff 234 instead of diff 1, diff 2 and diff 3. But 
its not so nice, isnt it? Or in the case, a diff has dissolved (which is 
maybe the only confusing case) just leave out this number, so what 
remains is: diff 1 and diff 3.

I find confusing to have two links per person, which both link to the 
same draft. And it is also not clear that they link to their drafts. 
Maybe we could have buttons besides the names &quot;Show draft&quot;? And the 
little buttons for me to diff could be larger and ideally real buttons 
like the patch-button.

&gt;<i> If we go with a full draft, then the problem is reduced to one of
</I>&gt;<i> traversal.  We traverse (2) in order to expand the context, then (3)
</I>&gt;<i> to collapse it back again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          (1)         (2)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          --&gt;          --&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>    List       Bridge      Wiki
</I>&gt;<i>          &lt;--&lt;--
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          (4)         (3)
</I>
I think Ed and I mean, to have the full text-option in the diff-bridge 
itself. And thinking about it, we wouldnt even need both text side by 
side, but just one full text and the diffs in it. I'd like to have such 
a view-possibility.

&gt;<i> Currently only (1) is easily traversible.  In that sense, the bridge
</I>&gt;<i> is only 1/4 built.  For a user stranded in the wiki, the crucial
</I>&gt;<i> crossing is (3).  Maybe that's the next thing to code?
</I>
Definatly also very needed :-)

PS: Ah, this is the right thread for the technical stuff. No need to 
open a new one as I intended.
