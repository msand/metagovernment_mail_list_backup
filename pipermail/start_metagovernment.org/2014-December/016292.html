</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Michal, speaking for myself, I also am fully occupied in working on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own project (though I am monitoring all that you are presenting, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; appreciate it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Me too!  I'm just about ready to launch my new site, matchism.org,
</I>&gt;<i> with a greatly beefed up version of The Plan (it's now a whole
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy called, I guess not surprisingly, Matchism).  It's all up
</I>&gt;<i> there now, though I do have some more cosmetic stuff to do yet, and
</I>&gt;<i> the mailing lists on my hosting site are still broken...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other thing is, I do mind being outvoted. Casting, collecting and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; counting votes can be very useful in guiding the iterative, recursive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process of thesis-antithesis-synthesis that can lead to &quot;collective best&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proposals and decisions. (Vilfredo is an example of a decision system
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; uses voting in that way.) But any decision system that features
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;outvoting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as the primary basis for decision making is in my view a bad system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I of course disagree.  I'm now quite confident in claiming any system
</I>&gt;<i> that *doesn't* have that, at least as the final step in the process,
</I>&gt;<i> is just unworkable (i.e., I've still found no support for the claim
</I>&gt;<i> that it can work except for small and homogeneous groups, and I've
</I>&gt;<i> looked for counter-evidence just about everywhere).  You can wish for
</I>&gt;<i> a consensus-based decisionmaking system all you want, but you run a
</I>&gt;<i> serious risk of just appearing to be naive and so kill off your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal before it even gets out of the gate.   I could be wrong, but
</I>&gt;<i> the only way I can see to convince any skeptic that will work is to
</I>&gt;<i> actually build a working system (i.e., enough with the handwaving!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Outvoting&quot; decision systems have been producing bad results for
</I>&gt;<i> thousands
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of years. We can do better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct observation of the problem, completely wrong analysis of the
</I>&gt;<i> cause.  The decision rules we're using has almost nothing to do with
</I>&gt;<i> why our society is so broken.  The problem is that the wrong people
</I>&gt;<i> are making the decisions and voting for &quot;representatives&quot; is the real
</I>&gt;<i> underlying cause of that.  The only way to fix that is to make it
</I>&gt;<i> *easier* for people to influence the decisions directly, and
</I>&gt;<i> consensus-based systems are exactly the opposite of that.  I recommend
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Stealth Democracy&quot; if you want an eye-opening view of what The People
</I>&gt;<i> really want.  I think the title of that book is wrong, though: It
</I>&gt;<i> should have been called &quot;Stealth Benevolent Dictator&quot; ;-)
