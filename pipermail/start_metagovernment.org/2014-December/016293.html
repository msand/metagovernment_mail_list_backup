I would propose that you haven't found an example in the past because the technology and mindset had not existed then.

But more to the point, there is merit to a system which works within small homogeneous groups: communities of interest. Let us get used to finding consensus within a group of people who think like us... and then over time, it is entirely plausible that we will gradually open our minds to expanding our opinion of who is &quot;like ourselves.&quot;  As long as we remain in the confrontational model, we'll never get there.

&gt;<i> You can wish for

</I>&gt;<i> serious risk of just appearing to be naive and so kill off your
</I>&gt;<i> proposal before it even gets out of the gate.   I could be wrong, but
</I>&gt;<i> the only way I can see to convince any skeptic that will work is to
</I>&gt;<i> actually build a working system (i.e., enough with the handwaving!)
</I>
Equally valid reasoning for building a consensus-based technology. ;)
