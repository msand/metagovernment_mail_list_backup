&gt;<i> how many people support your Matchism ?
</I>
Well, considering it hasn't even been released, let alone promoted,
the number is of course insignificant now.  That's not an argument
against it.  To argue against it, you'd have to read it, understand
it, and find the flaws in it.  Otherwise it's just another case of
saying that human flight is impossible.

&gt;<i> I hope that the answer will give you
</I>&gt;<i> a clue, how much you critical you should be to other movements.
</I>
Right, so what you're saying is that the only movements that are
successful are those that &quot;play nice with others&quot;.  The clue that I
get here is that you don't understand how revolutions occur.

&gt;<i>  Even genial
</I>&gt;<i> and absolutely right ideas are useless, if there is not enough support for
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>
Agreed.  But Communism, fascism, democracy, etc. didn't get adopted
because their promoters were afraid to criticize their competition.
So in addition to not understanding revolutions you also need to brush
on the concept of &quot;marketing&quot;: Designing your &quot;product&quot; to enable
criticizing the competition not only makes your product better, it
indirectly makes their products better too.

&gt;<i> As much as I know, people like a very limited amount of criticism and their
</I>&gt;<i> support is corresponding to it.
</I>
Right, but this isn't about making people feel good about their
existing biases and prejudices, it's about challenging, and then
changing, those things.  If you think we're going to change the world
without ruffling a few feathers, you're one of the people who's biases
and prejudices needs to change.

    Scott

</I>&gt;<i> hard on Avaaz and Moveon in particular, comparing them to putting a

</I>&gt;<i> existing broken system they are displaying a deference to it and to
</I>&gt;<i> the corrupt and/or incompetent people running it.  The same is true of
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much all our other current protest movements (occupy,
</I>&gt;<i> #blacklivesmatter), which, unlike those of the 1960s (civil rights,
</I>&gt;<i> Vietnam war, etc.) are far too vague and so are serving to beef up the
</I>&gt;<i> existing system by allowing it to get away with making conciliatory
</I>&gt;<i> gestures.  That's not how you achieve real change, that's how you take
</I>&gt;<i> the rough-edges off the existing system and leaders and so enable them
</I>&gt;<i> to perpetuate their power over the rest of us.

</I>&gt;<i> As to the call to be deferent to each other and each other's projects,
