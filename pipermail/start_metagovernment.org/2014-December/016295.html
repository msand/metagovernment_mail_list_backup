Could be, and I can definitely relate to this because I'm in the same
boat with my direct-democracy proposal.

&gt;<i> But more to the point, there is merit to a system which works within small homogeneous groups: communities of interest. Let us get used to finding consensus within a group of people who think like us... and then over time, it is entirely plausible that we will gradually open our minds to expanding our opinion of who is &quot;like ourselves.&quot;  As long as we remain in the confrontational model, we'll never get there.

This is where the engineer in me says that while this sounds nice in
theory, there are just some things that don't scale, and mass public
input into the proposal generation process is one of them.  It's fine
to build bicycles, the world needs bicycles.  But it sounds to me like
you're proposing to replace all transportation with bicycles and it
just won't work unless it devolves into something not any better than
we have now (i.e., 99% of the people's input, assuming they can even
be bothered to provide it, is simply ignored and only the most
persistent (who as it turns out will mostly be SDAPs according to
Matchism) end up getting their way).  I suppose it wouldn't be
terrible if we ended up using different types of systems to run small
organizations vs. the entire world, but I'm convinced that we don't
need to and that the global-scale problem is so much more important
that working on the small end of things isn't the best use of our very
limited resources.
