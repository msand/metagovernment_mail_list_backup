<PRE>Thanks, Ned. I get the point, but in a sense I am trying to avoid it.

The things that are important to people from day to day are typically not war or pollution or rainforests... people worry about whether or not the tennis court is available, or how they're going to get food on the table, or how bad the traffic is going to be today, or what their kids are being taught in school.

I'm saying we help people make those decisions collectively and on a micro scale, and let them get used to making decisions cooperatively and working through differences of opinion within those small communities. Then as people get used to the idea, they will be better equipped to deal with the big, haunting issues like adults; instead of in the childish, confrontational/authoritarian approach we take now.

If we want to solve the problem of war this decade, we will fail. If we spend this decade training people to work together on problem-solving, war will eventually solve itself.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Ed (and Scott),

</I>&gt;<i> Ed, using community park management as your example does not permit you to make a very compelling case for local-only government. Maybe try using something like water rights instead as your example, or pollution, or rainforest management, or the phenomenon of war.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My point is... why do we need large scale governance? I don't see the benefit in the existence (anymore) a nation as huge as the United States or Russia trying to make policy for everyone. Those states are artifacts of our primitive history. The &quot;natural unit&quot; of human society is the city or town.*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And even within a city, decisions should be fractured into smaller units. A city has a park system, and then within that there are individual parks, and within an individual park there may be a set of tennis courts. Each has its own set of rules and most of the important decisions can be made at the lowest level. The city doesn't have to decide the rules for reserving a tennis court... leave that to the people who play tennis in that particular park (or are affected by its play... whomever is interested).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Driving decision-making up to a high level and then having that level impose on the smaller levels is a form of authoritarianism. And often quite counter-productive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, we'd like to solve all the world's problems. But there are billions of problems. I say we start solving the small ones. As people get used to collaborating on and participating in governance, they will start to build ways to scale that none of us can yet imagine. Because their minds will work differently: they will be used to the idea and have plenty of practical experience under their belts.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * Another natural unit of society is the community of interest, regardless of geography. And those are by definition relatively homogeneous and can approach collaborative governance even with large numbers. And if they have a schism in their community... they can always break into two communities.
