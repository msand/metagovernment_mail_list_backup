There is some overlap in goals, I suppose, but it certainly has a
different (and to my mind, very weird) feel to it.  It seems to be a
quasi-governmental organization, which by my thinking is an obvious
dead end because it ignores one crucial fact: The people in power want
to remain in power, and have, and will always, structure any system
that they have any control over to ensure that end.  That is, if there
is going to be a revolution, or indeed any significant change in the
way things are done, it'll be a ground-up process, not top-down as
they are proposing (think Gandhi, Mandela, Hitler, Mao, or even the
American revolutionaries).  The process of gaining power was the same
kind of bottom-up process in all of those cases (though of course what
they did with it afterward varied a lot ;-)

Even their submission process feels odd to me: There is no public
forum to debate or collaborate, instead you submit your proposal to
some &quot;elected&quot; elites and they review it...

Could be because you're off in the weeds.  Which is not in itself a
bad thing (I find myself out there quite often!) but if nobody follows
you after awhile you might want to try a different path...
  Regards,
    Scott
