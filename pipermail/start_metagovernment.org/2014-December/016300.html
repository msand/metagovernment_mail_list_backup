<PRE>Hi Scott,

I am sorry but I did not understand your message.

Let me open it up so you can unravel it for me:

I said:

&gt;<i> &gt; Please remember that between voting and consensus based system there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; still consent based systems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You answered:
</I>

&gt;<i> Meh,
</I>

I ignore this as I do not understand


&gt;<i> in the current zeitgeist
</I>

zeitgeist??


&gt;<i> political &quot;consent&quot; basically means &quot;resignation&quot; (i.e., apathy,
</I>&gt;<i> disenchantment, disillusionment,
</I>&gt;<i> alienation, etc.).
</I>

Yes, it does. But that is a learned response. Once we train ourselves that
ignoring means that you are happy with something. And the only ones who
speak are the ones who have a reason to protest, AND WE TAKE SERIOUSLY
their protest, then this can change. Of course this will only scale up to
groups of maybe a dozen people/units. But already within that group you are
eliminating the dominance factor of the majority imposing something to the
minority.




&gt;<i> It's not that people fundamentally disagree with
</I>&gt;<i> the philosophy that &quot;every vote counts&quot;,
</I>

Here I have completely lost. Who have spoken about &quot;every vote counts&quot;
unless you refer to &quot;every vote against&quot; counts.


&gt;<i> it's that they instinctively
</I>&gt;<i> realize that the return on invest for any action they take is so small
</I>&gt;<i> as to ensure that it's not worth the effort.
</I>

I am lost.



&gt;<i> IMHO the only way to fix
</I>&gt;<i> this is to lower the barriers so far that even a trivial amount of
</I>&gt;<i> effort really does make a difference (e.g., the Matchism upgrade has a
</I>&gt;<i> lot more on proxies and individuals participating in the process of
</I>&gt;<i> setting goals for the government than The Plan did.  And this will be
</I>&gt;<i> the main emphasis for The System which I hope to be able to resume
</I>&gt;<i> working on soon).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is all in your HO. Fair enough. But you have basically put in the
trash a very good technical system out of cultural reasons that can be more
easily fixed than the technical side. And then used this to promote our
system. I don't want to put that down. I don't know it. But please stop
trashing a really good system simply because people would misinterpret it.


Pietro
