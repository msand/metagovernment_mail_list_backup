<PRE>I wrote that list yesterday. Than I was thinking about the laws of 
cybernetics.
I have seen so many efforts to create some direct e-democracy and all 
seem to be so isolated. Also the relevant academic data are often stored 
in deep web.

Maybe we just need more deep linking. Maybe we just need to get relevant 
information to relevant people. We may just need more good links to 
attract more traffic.

I would like to give this tactics a try. But do you know what ? I need 
relevant information. I am searching for some service that will allow me 
to create links quickly with relevant descriptions and broadcast them 
effectively in categories. User rating for links would be helpful.
What do you think would be most suitable service for this purpose ? It 
will help me a lot

Kind regards
     Michael

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> we cannot see clearly and that it is a major obstacle in formulating

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We may try to get closer, but that is quite difficult if we do not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> know our relative direction.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We may also try to look a little bit closer and find out if we see 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the same, that is what I support.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So this will NOT be a vision about new governance, that is too far. 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We need to find some closer vision.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would like us to create a half-way vision.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> It may be a vision about our community portal (metagovernmet.org 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> today) or just community.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What is your vision of our community ?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I will create my community vision soon...
