<PRE>Scott,

how many people support your Matchism ? I hope that the answer will give 
you a clue, how much you critical you should be to other movements. Even 
genial and absolutely right ideas are useless, if there is not enough 
support for them.
As much as I know, people like a very limited amount of criticism and 
their support is corresponding to it.

Regards
     Michael

</I>&gt;<i> existing broken system they are displaying a deference to it and to
</I>&gt;<i> the corrupt and/or incompetent people running it.  The same is true of
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much all our other current protest movements (occupy,
</I>&gt;<i> #blacklivesmatter), which, unlike those of the 1960s (civil rights,
</I>&gt;<i> Vietnam war, etc.) are far too vague and so are serving to beef up the
</I>&gt;<i> existing system by allowing it to get away with making conciliatory
</I>&gt;<i> gestures.  That's not how you achieve real change, that's how you take
</I>&gt;<i> the rough-edges off the existing system and leaders and so enable them
</I>&gt;<i> to perpetuate their power over the rest of us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to the call to be deferent to each other and each other's projects,
</I>&gt;<i> I also reject that.  Competition is a necessary component in the
</I>&gt;<i> process of coming up with a better system.  Certainly we should avoid
</I>&gt;<i> just being mean or taking anything personally, but seeing a flaw in
</I>&gt;<i> someone's proposal that you don't point out is not helping anyone.  It
</I>&gt;<i> will be exposed eventually anyway, better it be exposed sooner rather
</I>&gt;<i> than later, and by someone who can be specific and at least somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> impersonal rather than what we'll get from the trolls out on the
</I>&gt;<i> Internet.
