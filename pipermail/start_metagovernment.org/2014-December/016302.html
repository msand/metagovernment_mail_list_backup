&gt;<i> Thanks, Ned. I get the point, but in a sense I am trying to avoid it.

</I>&gt;<i> The things that are important to people from day to day are typically not war or pollution or rainforests... people worry about whether or not the tennis court is available, or how they're going to get food on the table, or how bad the traffic is going to be today, or what their kids are being taught in school.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, but you've made a fundamental mistake if you think that most of
these problems are not local problems.  Despite locavore fantasies,
food, and more particularly the energy required to produce and deliver
it, is not something any local area can have more than a limited
control over.  Same with traffic: No City/County can build an
interstate system, fund research into high speed rail, or deal with
the energy efficiency issues of air travel.  We do have examples of
completely local control over schools, they're the Amish and the
Islamic Madrasas.

&gt;<i> I'm saying we help people make those decisions collectively and on a micro scale, and let them get used to making decisions cooperatively and working through differences of opinion within those small communities. Then as people get used to the idea, they will be better equipped to deal with the big, haunting issues like adults; instead of in the childish, confrontational/authoritarian approach we take now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You're with Ned here, accurate description of the problem, completely
wrong analysis of the cause.  The tendency toward authoritarian
solutions comes from our *leaders* and the fact that our systems allow
certain types of people (in Matchism they're SDAPs (Social Dominators,
Authoritarians, and Psychopaths)) to rise to positions of power.  It
has nothing to do with our decision rules or whether our governments
are local or global.  Designing a system, even a consent or consensus
based system, that doesn't take this fundamental difference in
individual behavior into account is doomed to failure.  We'll be far
worse off with a million Hitlers each running their own city/state
than we are now, and if you're system doesn't specifically constrain
them, that's exactly what you're proposing (e.g., the &quot;last man
standing&quot; outcomes in Vilfredo).

&gt;<i> If we want to solve the problem of war this decade, we will fail. If we spend this decade training people to work together on problem-solving, war will eventually solve itself.
</I>
&quot;Local&quot; solutions have been tried.  It's the warring-states period (in
China), Spartans vs. Athenians, Feudalism, city-states in Italy (i.e.,
Machiavelli), etc.  I think we can be pretty sure that what you
propose is a recipe for global instability.  Unless maybe you propose
to train *all* people the world over on these new systems
simultaneously.  In which case I think it's a good idea, but then,
it's a ground-up global government and not a local-oriented system as
you're claiming it to be.  It also happens to be what Matchism is
based on (i.e, a fundamental component of that is that we need to find
a way to ensure that each of us considers every other human being to
be a member of our group/band/tribe).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed (and Scott),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ed, using community park management as your example does not permit you to make a very compelling case for local-only government. Maybe try using something like water rights instead as your example, or pollution, or rainforest management, or the phenomenon of war.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> his is where the engineer in me says that while this sounds nice in

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My point is... why do we need large scale governance? I don't see the benefit in the existence (anymore) a nation as huge as the United States or Russia trying to make policy for everyone. Those states are artifacts of our primitive history. The &quot;natural unit&quot; of human society is the city or town.*
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And even within a city, decisions should be fractured into smaller units. A city has a park system, and then within that there are individual parks, and within an individual park there may be a set of tennis courts. Each has its own set of rules and most of the important decisions can be made at the lowest level. The city doesn't have to decide the rules for reserving a tennis court... leave that to the people who play tennis in that particular park (or are affected by its play... whomever is interested).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Driving decision-making up to a high level and then having that level impose on the smaller levels is a form of authoritarianism. And often quite counter-productive.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, we'd like to solve all the world's problems. But there are billions of problems. I say we start solving the small ones. As people get used to collaborating on and participating in governance, they will start to build ways to scale that none of us can yet imagine. Because their minds will work differently: they will be used to the idea and have plenty of practical experience under their belts.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> * Another natural unit of society is the community of interest, regardless of geography. And those are by definition relatively homogeneous and can approach collaborative governance even with large numbers. And if they have a schism in their community... they can always break into two communities.
