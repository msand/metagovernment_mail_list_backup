&gt;<i> The original topic here was outvoting. How is a system where 51% dominate not a form of authoritarianism?
</I>
By definition, I guess.  You seem to be confusing authoritarianism
with collectivism.  Once you have 51% approving each of the decisions,
it's by definition not authoritarian, it's collectivist.  Which of
course has its own problems, but being subject to the whims of SDAPs
isn't one of them (and if you try to respond to this, please don't
make the naive mistake of claiming that communists were collectivists
because they weren't because at least at the nation-scale they've all
been ruled by highly authoritarian dictatorships).

&gt;<i> Many projects here are specifically designed to not allow dominators. Or Vilfredo if I understand it properly lets the weakest dominate (using the mathematical term of dominance). None allow for positions of power; as nobody has authority over anyone else unless it is consensual and withdrawable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sort of, but this I think ignores the issue of &quot;human nature&quot;.  The
problem with Vilfredo is the same problem that plagues representative
democracy: The people that persist and that seek power are exactly the
people we don't want running the government.  They already *are* a
minority, the problem then being how to marginalize them without
simultaneously allowing these SDAPs to use this same ability to
enforce marginalization of any other minority (which is exactly what
SDAPs by their very nature do, and why we don't want them running the
government).

&gt;<i> I do understand that some people will inherently be more dominant in some aspects of governance. But they will be the people who are most engaged in the topic, and not necessarily people who have any agreement among themselves. Let the avid tennis players decide the rules of the tennis court... but if someone who lives nearby is annoyed by late-night tennis, they also can join in and mess with the consensus in order to have their needs met. What's wrong with that? Why do I have to be involved in the rules of that court if it's nowhere near me and I don't play tennis?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
All well and good if you're a localist.  But do you breathe air?
Drink water?  Eat food?  Need to get someplace?  The purpose of
government is to solve *those* problems.  If you whack off the 90% of
the problems that are hard and affect everyone, you're not doing
&quot;government&quot;, you're doing &quot;party planning&quot;.

&gt;<i> We're not going to remove the fact of people wanting to satisfy their own selfish needs. All we can do is make systems that allow people to find ways to get those needs met in a way that also work for people who have seemingly opposing needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.  I think all we disagree on is the issue of scale.  You seem
to think that if we come up with a solution to a small-scale problem
that it will automatically scale up to larger problems.  My
engineering sense is that that is not the case and we need to design
for the large-scale problems from the start.


&gt;<i> But as a part of that, I anticipate the gradual dissolution of the nation-state, as it is an artifact of our barbaric, authoritarian past and has no place in a globally-connected, maturely-governed world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agree 100%, but perhaps you can help me.  I'm struggling with the fact
that this seems to mean that *all* patriotic displays are barbaric and
that we need to shun them in the same way we (now) shun racism,
sexism, etc.  I personally don't have a problem with that (and have
been a pain in the ass since I was a kid and refused to say the pledge
of allegiance in school), but am having a little more trouble with the
marketing of this idea.  Any suggestions?
  Regards,
    Scott
