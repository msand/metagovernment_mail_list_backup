I looked at those, but didn't find what I was looking for.  I'm also a
member of avaaz.org and moveon.org, but now believe that those are
misguided as well.  IMHO what we need is a specific plan for how to
get from where we are to where we need to be, not a lot of handwaving
about how if everyone believes the same thing as us and works toward
the 1 or 2 goals that we can all agree on that all of our problems
will be solved.  In the current 0.5 version of Matchism I'm pretty
hard on Avaaz and Moveon in particular, comparing them to putting a
band-aide over a skin cancer lesion.  By proposing to work within the
existing broken system they are displaying a deference to it and to
the corrupt and/or incompetent people running it.  The same is true of
pretty much all our other current protest movements (occupy,
#blacklivesmatter), which, unlike those of the 1960s (civil rights,
Vietnam war, etc.) are far too vague and so are serving to beef up the
existing system by allowing it to get away with making conciliatory
gestures.  That's not how you achieve real change, that's how you take
the rough-edges off the existing system and leaders and so enable them
to perpetuate their power over the rest of us.

As to the call to be deferent to each other and each other's projects,
I also reject that.  Competition is a necessary component in the
process of coming up with a better system.  Certainly we should avoid
just being mean or taking anything personally, but seeing a flaw in
someone's proposal that you don't point out is not helping anyone.  It
will be exposed eventually anyway, better it be exposed sooner rather
than later, and by someone who can be specific and at least somewhat
impersonal rather than what we'll get from the trolls out on the
Internet.
  Regards,
    Scott
