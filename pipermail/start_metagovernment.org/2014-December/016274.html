<PRE>Another thing is a definition of our community. Where I do not support 
definition. I support just to describe a typical imaginary member.
It is a similar approach as to sport. Soccer is a typical sport. Chess 
is less sport and sex is even less sport.

Kind regards

</I>&gt;<i> We may also try to look a little bit closer and find out if we see the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So this will NOT be a vision about new governance, that is too far. We 
</I>&gt;<i> need to find some closer vision.
</I>&gt;<i> I would like us to create a half-way vision.
</I>&gt;<i> It may be a vision about our community portal (metagovernmet.org 
</I>&gt;<i> today) or just community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is your vision of our community ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will create my community vision soon...
