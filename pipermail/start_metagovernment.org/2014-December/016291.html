Me too!  I'm just about ready to launch my new site, matchism.org,
with a greatly beefed up version of The Plan (it's now a whole
philosophy called, I guess not surprisingly, Matchism).  It's all up
there now, though I do have some more cosmetic stuff to do yet, and
the mailing lists on my hosting site are still broken...

</I>&gt;<i> as the primary basis for decision making is in my view a bad system.
</I>
I of course disagree.  I'm now quite confident in claiming any system
that *doesn't* have that, at least as the final step in the process,
is just unworkable (i.e., I've still found no support for the claim
that it can work except for small and homogeneous groups, and I've
looked for counter-evidence just about everywhere).  You can wish for
a consensus-based decisionmaking system all you want, but you run a
serious risk of just appearing to be naive and so kill off your
proposal before it even gets out of the gate.   I could be wrong, but
the only way I can see to convince any skeptic that will work is to
actually build a working system (i.e., enough with the handwaving!)

&gt;<i> &quot;Outvoting&quot; decision systems have been producing bad results for thousands
</I>&gt;<i> of years. We can do better.
</I>
Correct observation of the problem, completely wrong analysis of the
cause.  The decision rules we're using has almost nothing to do with
why our society is so broken.  The problem is that the wrong people
are making the decisions and voting for &quot;representatives&quot; is the real
underlying cause of that.  The only way to fix that is to make it
*easier* for people to influence the decisions directly, and
consensus-based systems are exactly the opposite of that.  I recommend
&quot;Stealth Democracy&quot; if you want an eye-opening view of what The People
really want.  I think the title of that book is wrong, though: It
should have been called &quot;Stealth Benevolent Dictator&quot; ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
