<PRE>Scott,

you are master of long discussions and I do not want to compete with 
you. I have lost this one. You are victorious.

Regards
     Michael

</I>&gt;<i> Well, considering it hasn't even been released, let alone promoted,
</I>&gt;<i> the number is of course insignificant now.  That's not an argument
</I>&gt;<i> against it.  To argue against it, you'd have to read it, understand
</I>&gt;<i> it, and find the flaws in it.  Otherwise it's just another case of
</I>&gt;<i> saying that human flight is impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I hope that the answer will give you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a clue, how much you critical you should be to other movements.
</I>&gt;<i> Right, so what you're saying is that the only movements that are
</I>&gt;<i> successful are those that &quot;play nice with others&quot;.  The clue that I
</I>&gt;<i> get here is that you don't understand how revolutions occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Even genial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and absolutely right ideas are useless, if there is not enough support for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  But Communism, fascism, democracy, etc. didn't get adopted
</I>&gt;<i> because their promoters were afraid to criticize their competition.
</I>&gt;<i> So in addition to not understanding revolutions you also need to brush
</I>&gt;<i> on the concept of &quot;marketing&quot;: Designing your &quot;product&quot; to enable
</I>&gt;<i> criticizing the competition not only makes your product better, it
</I>&gt;<i> indirectly makes their products better too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As much as I know, people like a very limited amount of criticism and their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support is corresponding to it.
</I>&gt;<i> Right, but this isn't about making people feel good about their
</I>&gt;<i> existing biases and prejudices, it's about challenging, and then
</I>&gt;<i> changing, those things.  If you think we're going to change the world
</I>&gt;<i> without ruffling a few feathers, you're one of the people who's biases
</I>&gt;<i> and prejudices needs to change.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the wild-eyed radicals. We may seem like that. I agree that we should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have some good results. And I also believe that we con do more for it. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> propose to declare our support to some organisation with higher renown. My
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal was World justice movement and Forum social mondial. What do you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think about this step ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I looked at those, but didn't find what I was looking for.  I'm also a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> member of avaaz.org and moveon.org, but now believe that those are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> misguided as well.  IMHO what we need is a specific plan for how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get from where we are to where we need to be, not a lot of handwaving
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about how if everyone believes the same thing as us and works toward
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the 1 or 2 goals that we can all agree on that all of our problems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be solved.  In the current 0.5 version of Matchism I'm pretty
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hard on Avaaz and Moveon in particular, comparing them to putting a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> band-aide over a skin cancer lesion.  By proposing to work within the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing broken system they are displaying a deference to it and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the corrupt and/or incompetent people running it.  The same is true of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pretty much all our other current protest movements (occupy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> #blacklivesmatter), which, unlike those of the 1960s (civil rights,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vietnam war, etc.) are far too vague and so are serving to beef up the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing system by allowing it to get away with making conciliatory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gestures.  That's not how you achieve real change, that's how you take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the rough-edges off the existing system and leaders and so enable them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to perpetuate their power over the rest of us.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As to the call to be deferent to each other and each other's projects,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also reject that.  Competition is a necessary component in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process of coming up with a better system.  Certainly we should avoid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just being mean or taking anything personally, but seeing a flaw in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone's proposal that you don't point out is not helping anyone.  It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will be exposed eventually anyway, better it be exposed sooner rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than later, and by someone who can be specific and at least somewhat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> impersonal rather than what we'll get from the trolls out on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Internet.
