</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The things that are important to people from day to day are typically not war or pollution or rainforests... people worry about whether or not the tennis court is available, or how they're going to get food on the table, or how bad the traffic is going to be today, or what their kids are being taught in school.

</I>&gt;<i> food, and more particularly the energy required to produce and deliver

</I>&gt;<i> completely local control over schools, they're the Amish and the
</I>&gt;<i> Islamic Madrasas.
</I>
Granted. I'm just saying we shouldn't tackle interstate commerce first. Start at the more local things and then scale as we learn. More color below.


&gt;&gt;<i> I'm saying we help people make those decisions collectively and on a micro scale, and let them get used to making decisions cooperatively and working through differences of opinion within those small communities. Then as people get used to the idea, they will be better equipped to deal with the big, haunting issues like adults; instead of in the childish, confrontational/authoritarian approach we take now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You're with Ned here, accurate description of the problem, completely
</I>&gt;<i> wrong analysis of the cause.  The tendency toward authoritarian
</I>&gt;<i> solutions comes from our *leaders* and the fact that our systems allow
</I>&gt;<i> certain types of people (in Matchism they're SDAPs (Social Dominators,
</I>&gt;<i> Authoritarians, and Psychopaths)) to rise to positions of power.  It
</I>&gt;<i> has nothing to do with our decision rules or whether our governments
</I>&gt;<i> are local or global.  Designing a system, even a consent or consensus
</I>&gt;<i> based system, that doesn't take this fundamental difference in
</I>&gt;<i> individual behavior into account is doomed to failure.  We'll be far
</I>&gt;<i> worse off with a million Hitlers each running their own city/state
</I>&gt;<i> than we are now, and if you're system doesn't specifically constrain
</I>&gt;<i> them, that's exactly what you're proposing (e.g., the &quot;last man
</I>&gt;<i> standing&quot; outcomes in Vilfredo).
</I>
The original topic here was outvoting. How is a system where 51% dominate not a form of authoritarianism? Many projects here are specifically designed to not allow dominators. Or Vilfredo if I understand it properly lets the weakest dominate (using the mathematical term of dominance). None allow for positions of power; as nobody has authority over anyone else unless it is consensual and withdrawable.

I do understand that some people will inherently be more dominant in some aspects of governance. But they will be the people who are most engaged in the topic, and not necessarily people who have any agreement among themselves. Let the avid tennis players decide the rules of the tennis court... but if someone who lives nearby is annoyed by late-night tennis, they also can join in and mess with the consensus in order to have their needs met. What's wrong with that? Why do I have to be involved in the rules of that court if it's nowhere near me and I don't play tennis?

We're not going to remove the fact of people wanting to satisfy their own selfish needs. All we can do is make systems that allow people to find ways to get those needs met in a way that also work for people who have seemingly opposing needs.


&gt;&gt;<i> If we want to solve the problem of war this decade, we will fail. If we spend this decade training people to work together on problem-solving, war will eventually solve itself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Local&quot; solutions have been tried.  It's the warring-states period (in
</I>&gt;<i> China), Spartans vs. Athenians, Feudalism, city-states in Italy (i.e.,
</I>&gt;<i> Machiavelli), etc.  I think we can be pretty sure that what you
</I>&gt;<i> propose is a recipe for global instability.  Unless maybe you propose
</I>&gt;<i> to train *all* people the world over on these new systems
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously.  In which case I think it's a good idea, but then,
</I>&gt;<i> it's a ground-up global government and not a local-oriented system as
</I>&gt;<i> you're claiming it to be.  It also happens to be what Matchism is
</I>&gt;<i> based on (i.e, a fundamental component of that is that we need to find
</I>&gt;<i> a way to ensure that each of us considers every other human being to
</I>&gt;<i> be a member of our group/band/tribe).
</I>
Yes, that's exactly what I'm proposing: a slow form of global governance. (Sorry if I was unclear.) Because note I also am not talking just about local political decisions but also communities of interest (such as this group which is global). It's not just about the governance of a tennis court expanding out to larger and larger layers... but also of communities of any kind learning to govern themselves without anyone being in charge.

But as a part of that, I anticipate the gradual dissolution of the nation-state, as it is an artifact of our barbaric, authoritarian past and has no place in a globally-connected, maturely-governed world.
