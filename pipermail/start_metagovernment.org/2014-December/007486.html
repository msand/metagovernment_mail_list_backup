<PRE>I would like to reconsider my &quot;no-vision position&quot; and I hope that other 
supporters of this position will find some inspiration in my thoughts.

So, as I understand it, vision should describe some state of affairs 
that we want to achieve. There is often a hidden assumption that we 
should look as far as we can. We tried it, with the conclusion that you 
can see different things and that I am blind. We all know that it is not 
true.

I will continue my metaphor. That we can see different things, may be 
caused by many causes. We may be looking in different directions, but we 
may also look so far that we cannot see clearly. I think that we cannot 
see clearly and that it is a major obstacle in formulating our vision.
We may try to get closer, but that is quite difficult if we do not know 
our relative direction.
We may also try to look a little bit closer and find out if we see the 
same, that is what I support.

So this will NOT be a vision about new governance, that is too far. We 
need to find some closer vision.
I would like us to create a half-way vision.
It may be a vision about our community portal (metagovernmet.org today) 
or just community.

What is your vision of our community ?

I will create my community vision soon...

Kind regards
     Michael
