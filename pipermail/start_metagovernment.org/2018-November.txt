This message has a big spam warning on it, even though it's a
g-mail account, g-mail could not verify it really came from you. Might be a
reason for inactivity?

As for my own activity, it's fairly dormant but alive. Ready to participate
when required.

though I don't know how he intends to really bring power to the people, an
attempt is kinda being made.

Yours had that message too in my gmail reader :-(

I had to mothball proxyfor.me when my free trial on AWS expired and
they started charging me almost 40 bucks a month for it (most of that
was for ELB, which I didn't really need but that they require to
provide HTTPS support). I'm looking at the various alternatives: It'd
be good to port it at least once anyway to prove that it's not tied to
any particular platform. I also got the Colorado voter database and
started hacking that to create a way to authenticate voters without
risking exposing their information, sending them a postcard, or
require them to provide a credit card (like most of the other systems
have). Next round I plan to shadow the Boulder and/or Denver city
council proposals with authenticated voters, which ought to be
illuminating...

Looks to me like he underestimates the amount of "government" required
to keep a system like that working. Wikipedia is kind of a nightmare
because of that (lots of topics where the foxes are guarding the
henhouses).

Subject: [MG] proxyfor.me is back up!
Message-ID: <CACobxW3HoF7yxZ76gNchCOdy8WatSin0z9axf7L3pv56UFdruA@mail.gmail.com>

I've updated and restarted proxyfor.me. It's still on AWS, but uses an
internal HTTPS certificate and server rather than using the (much more
expensive) AWS ELB system for that. It's also updated to the latest
versions of the tools and libraries, and there has been a *lot* of
progress on those over the past year: The new app is about 80% smaller
and only takes a third of the time to start up, mostly due to AOT
compilation (which works in Angular now but didn't in the version I
started with).

I had to toss all the old profiles when I updated the database schema
to handle authentication, but have set it up in a "demo" mode where
you can log in as one of the bots to check it out without having to
fill out your profile first (instructions are on the startup screen).

I'm not going to do any PR for this release: I'll wait until I have
the authentication stuff and new local (Boulder/Denver) proposals
finished and will call that Beta 4.
  Regards,
    Scott
