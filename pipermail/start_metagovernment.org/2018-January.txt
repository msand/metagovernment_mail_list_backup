Subject: [MG]  Prediction of goodness
Message-ID: <CAEyrqBr_ytrRQ0x62kH1sZTHsrkysFGCBd836xRtBF0yLsnB8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi again :),

I am still working on the Prediction of goodness. I needed to add one layer
of evaluation, because the sum of decisions' evaluations does not make
institutions' evaluation even if isolated (sum of parts is not the same as
the whole :D, mainly because people tend to forget that they are animals).
Also I am no longer talking about laws and government, changed those words
for "decision" and "international institution" or "international actor".
If you like, there is still the old way to directly follow the project
researchgate.net/project/Prediction-of-goodness
but because I have found how much is this project changing my worldview, I
started posting some easy (different) updates on
facebook.com/predofg
twitter.com/predofg
too. I hope you will like one of the ways how to follow the project and
watch where it goes. And at last but not least, many thanks to those who
already follow and comment the project, it makes me happy.

Anyway, what do you do?

Cheers
m.

Hi Scott (and others),
My apologies for dropping the previous thread. I was away from my computer for several weeks visiting family. I?d like to continue the conversation, but rather than picking up the circular and protracted debate about the pros and cons of dictators vs. politburos  ;) I like to suggest that we just move on. I believe there?s a larger conversation needing our attention. 

I would though like to reference one comment you made in your last reply to the 'Multiple Proxies? thread, Scott. There?s a passage from a book I was reading while I was away that I feel correlates with it quite elegantly.  

[First my comment?]

From: Founding Brothers by Joseph J. Ellis
Vintage Books 2002 
p. 216

"As Adams remembered it?.'all great critical questions about men and measures from 1774 to 1778' we?re desperately contested and highly problematic occasions, usually decided by one vote of a single state, and that vote was often decided by a single individual. Nothing was clear, inevitable, or even comprehensible to the soldiers in the field at Saratoga or the statesman in the corridors at Philadelphia: 'It was patched and piebald policy then, as it is now, ever was, ever will be, world without end.' The real drama of the American Revolution, which was perfectly in accord with Adam?s memory, as well as with the turbulent conditions of his own soul, was its inherent messiness. This meant recovering the exciting but terrifying sense that all the major players had at the time?namely, that they were making it up as they went along, improvising on the edge of catastrophe."

[More about this at the end of my email.]

As I think we all know now, the "catastrophe? these *Brothers* were facing was multifold and ultimately came down to 'life or death' decisions for many of them individually as well as for their emerging Country. But the circumstances they faced were, by any reasonable measure, an order of magnitude less complex and dire than those we are currently facing as a planetary species.

In my mind, the confluence of tragedies we are soon to encounter on a colossal scale is an emerging crisis that can only be met by the massive synergistic intelligence of a collective global mind. I think it is our best and only survival option. It should be clear to any semi-conscious human that the structures we now rely on are not up to the task. For me personally, the preponderant question is: "How does a Meta-mind emerge?" Of course no one can really say, but I think attempting to design a Meta-governance system to replace what?s collapsing before our eyes is a fine place to start.

--------------------------------------------------

I really like the essential components of proxy4.me. I think it?s crucial that we achieve a comprehensive quorum if we are going to empower a truly comprehensive global democracy. And it seems to me that proxy4.me is a near perfect fit for this objective...if it works as intended. That said, I think it?s just one piece of a larger puzzle that will be needed for constructing a thriving and effective global platform. Listed below I believe is an inventory of a the baseline components that will be crucial, from the get go, for the creation of a self-organizing global body.

1 - I think we can all agree a crowdsourced *proposal driven platform* is key. One that is available to anyone willing to participate according to the rules and norms of the larger Organization. A Network for a global tribe that can generate and support the proposals and projects of a new paradigm?perhaps even an entirely new species.

2 - Perhaps we can also agree that proposals will need to be vetted in order to reduce the number of those which are poorly developed and/or that don?t fit the Mandate of the Organization at large.

3 - Because *we the people* will ultimately generate an enormous number of proposals at a global level (perhaps dozens or more daily), a sizable staff will be necessary to process them in a timely manner. 

4 - This staff will need to be managed by some Executive Oversight Structure. [To be run by either a Dictator, or a Politburo. ;]  

5 - The overall Platform will need to be developed and maintained as well by even more staff.

6 - I think it will be necessary to set up a customized crypto-economy with a Foundation to support proposals and the financial needs of the Organization at large. Many proposals will need significant resources to get them off the ground. And some will no doubt provide significant income for the Foundation once their projects become viable.

7 - A Voting Platform will be necessary to determine which proposals are adopted and funded.

8 - An ever-evolving crowdsourced Mandate will need to be drafted in order to reflect the Vision of the Organization as well as to determine it's Priority.

9 - And, as I see it, a blockchain Database will need to be set up to track the undertakings and operation of the Organization.

10 - A huge forum for Discourse will be necessary to debate the proposals that have been vetted prior to a vote.

11 - A Magistrate of sorts will be necessary to maintain order on the Intranet Platform of the Network.

12 - And finally, a Template for submitting proposals according to the Policy of the Organization will be extremely useful in saving time and effort both for those creating the proposals, as well as for those who are vetting them.

Obviously there are many more details to be fleshed out, but that is, I believe, a comprehensive summary of the fundamental elements necessary to get this project off the ground. 


Thanks in advance for your thoughtful response,
Steve

One final word in reference to the "on-the-fly-redesign? comment. 

I first encountered what might be called the substratum of these ideas back in the early eighties. My own personal journey through the decades since has precipitated many practical and theoretical iterations emerging from this basic substructure of ideas. But one of the values that has run through them all is a conviction that the Process and Structure must be crowdsourced and flexible enough to be continually self-organizing. I?m not sure if this qualifies as an "on-the-fly-redesign,? but either way, I?ll take it with your "design it right in the first place" comment as a misguided suggestion rather than an admonition. :) I think it?s critical that we remain open, flexible, and collaborative as we "improvise on the edge of catastrophe".

Well, of course people would have to vote to approve the new system,
but wouldn't it be better if we *designed* it right in the first place
to reduce the number of these on-the-fly redesigns?

I'm not sure what Harold is talking about either. I like your list Steve,
well spelled out. The only thing I disagree with is point 4 - This staff
will need to be managed by some Executive Oversight Structure. [To be run
by either a Dictator, or a Politburo. ;]

With a clearly defined mandate set by the public of what is expected from
the staff, they should require no managing. If they break their mandate
then they are able to be replaced by a vote. This 'Executive Oversight'
needs to be extremely limited in its power for me to consider this a
reasonable idea. As I perceive your system now I think they can do to much
damage in the short term, enough to disrupt everything and potentially
cause chaos.

Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me, not the number 4.

Hi Steve,

about that Meta-mind. Sorry, I know that you do not define it, but it
sounds like that if everybody is in the decision making process that it is
the best process. Well, it may be true when the best contribution of some
individuals is that they learn something from the process. Because they may
be biased, e.g. vulgar material thinking bias. They only way forward may be
learning.

Sure more people know more, but in my opinion it is worth testing how many
and what kind of people you need for decision-making that produces best
outcomes, before you ask everybody to participate.

Kind regars
m.

Hi everyone I was just curious if the metagovernance site's gone back
online somewhere in some form.

And if not, if you'd be interested in joining the International Direct
Democracy Union on FB so we can hear more from you, and grow the IDDU. -So
every individual project can have a larger union to link to so they don't
have to seem like they're just dreaming all this stuff up on their own.

Agreed. I haven't really defined what the filtering mechanism for
getting a proposal into the main queue should look like, but in
proxyfor.me inappropriate filtering is the only real means for the
executive branch to get up to any policy mischief (e.g., there is
basically no provision for "executive orders" other than the normal
regulatory stuff). I still believe that getting a proposal through
some sort of an "initiative" process on FB/reddit/etc. should be
sufficient. If the Manager rejects it anyway, they'd be obligated to
provide a rejection letter, and if that provides an obviously
inappropriate reason it would be sufficient cause to get people riled
up enough to vote to remove the  the manager (or maybe just the queue
manager). And as I've already suggested "remove the manager" should be
a permanent proposal in the queue and that the replacement manager
should be pre-identified (e.g, for the Globality Manager, the highest
rated (by some objective criteria) Locality Manager would
automatically be promoted. For Localities I guess you'd have to use a
lower-level board: Here in Boulder for example it'd probably be the
highest rated member of the Planning Board, which perhaps not
coincidentally is where many of the City Council candidates already
come from).

> Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me, not the number 4.

Yeah, proxy4.me is being used by some German sysadmin for his testing
purposes. At some point I was going make an offer to buy it from him,
but was planning to wait until confusion became an issue. I guess it
already has ;-)

Oh that was a reference to the 'state of the union' address presidents use
to discuss the state of the nation. I was just playing with words. I'm
curious what's going on with Metagovernance. Someone took the site down
saying they were gonna improve it and it simply never came back. Some years
later here I am, part of the IDDU, wondering if all you guys gave up or
dislike the idea of having a group page for direct representation
projects/[coalition].

This 'Executive Oversight' needs to be extremely limited in its power for me to consider this a reasonable idea. As I perceive your system now I think they can do to much damage in the short term, enough to disrupt everything and potentially cause chaos.

I appreciate your feedback Patrick. I'm probably missing something here. (I really mean that.) It?s difficult for me to comprehend how an organization of that scale would tick without some umbrella of management. But I?m considering your suggestion?."a clearly defined mandate [such that staff would] require no managing,? that to me would be ideal. 

I think one of the most inspiring examples of this is valvesoftware.com. They have a completely horizontal organizational structure. Their desks are literally on wheels and each employee gets to park themselves wherever they want, and work on what ever inspires them. I?m not a gamer, but I believe Valve is one of the premier companies of it?s kind on the planet. Apparently they're very successful. As I understand it, the only managers are ad hoc Projects Organizers who are completely self-selecting. Maybe their model is something to emulate. Whatever we wind up implementing, I agree with you and Scott that being able to vote managers out overnight is key.

Also, as we speed up the curve towards the *Singularity*, no doubt AI will be saddled with more of the tasks and duties associated with managing our general human infrastructure. If we can write algorithms to manage various aspects of oversight for the Organization, I?m all for it. 

The real question that continues to bewilder me is, ?How do we get this show on the road?? My guess is that a fair number of those souls with an interest in Meta-governance have at some point found their way to this list. If that?s so, what?s keeping us from a more active collaboration. Are we waiting for permission from the goddess of law and legislation...or is there some other group that?s movin' and groovin' with this? I don?t mean to be flippant but, what?s the hold up? I mean really. I just came from a trip to California where I have family in both Santa Rosa and Ventura and I can attest to you that Rome has already begun to burn. 

It seems to me that our apparent inability to organize a governance mechanism for a sovereign global people is the only thing that is keeping us from a reasonable response to the tragedies that lie before us. 

I?m puzzled to find the missing link? What will it take? 

What would a first step look like?

Wouldn?t any ?best outcome? determination be based on subjective criteria? Who would determine what "best outcome" looks like, and what are the criteria they would use to make this determination? 

Also, how do you exclude someone from this process? By their low IQ, their prison record, or their poor diet? :)  Is that what you mean by "vulgar material thinking bias??  I?m not sure I?m following you Michal. 

Sorry. Please try again.

Yes, best outcome is subjective, still it allows for 7.6 billions of
subjectivities. Just ask them whether their life is good, whether some
partial outcomes are good.

As in current system exclusion isn't the right word in many cases. It is
just so that some kinds of people are more likely to be in government. It
may be about election system that makes people with "better outcomes" (as
described above) more likely to be in some kind of government. Or it may be
about system that attracts certain kind of people who are likely to produce
"better outcomes".

Still the research about relation of election systems and "better outcomes"
is still very incomplete. On the other hand I believe it is in your powers
to run some research in this sense with your skills.

Kind regards

Theoretically, at least in my mind, the *precursors* to ?best outcome? would be described clearly in the Mandate of the Organization. Values like freedom, justice, and equality come to mind. 

The Mandate would drive the quality, intent, and material design of proposals submitted to the Organization. 

For me, ?best outcome? for proposal submissions would be based on values like brevity, clarity, and veracity. Or for staff selection - experience, passion, responsibility.

 I?m not sure exactly what you mean by "best outcomes?. Are you talking about the better legislation?.or better elected representatives?or both?

I seem to remember a thread where you discussed this with Scott. Is this something that a larger quorum would fulfill? More people voting = larger cross-section of sensible voter profiles = less assholes getting elected = "better outcome??

There are more options how to construct it as (thin moral) evaluation of
one's life has distribution in population, so you may use descriptive
statistics.

I have made some steps (hopefully forward :) since that time.

Well, we do not know really, there are too many effects in society for such
a simple thinking imho. I prefer the black box model, where we measure
outputs and we look for significant inputs. Everything else is black box.
Significant inputs we may also call as Meadows' "leverage points".

I think it could largely be a boilerplate *application* tailored to the type or category of proposal being submitted. Tutorials could be available to assist in making the application process more understandable. And as I said earlier, I think that ultimately AI could be utilized. My sense is that one would want to make the process as simple and painless as possible so that more people would be inclined to use the platform. And the boilerplate aspect would assist in the *vetting* as well by making proposals more uniform. Initially I think, maybe just a simple form with a tutorial listing the basics.

Agreed.

This is the biggest hurdle in my mind. How do you legitimize something like proxyfor.me except through widespread usage. It needs to be tested before it will be accepted by the mainstream. Chicken and egg. What kind of proposal could be run on Social Media that would have enough *value outcome* to attract the necessary population, not only to validate it, but to encourage it?s further usage?

I imagine this would cause a managers average cortisol levels to rise substantially.

Ok, so you could use descriptive statistics to predict the best outcome for the development specific legislation? Sorry, I don?t have a background in statistics (and I may be a little bit stupid as well). But I?m curious. Are you wanting to use statistics to gauge the outcome of decision-making by quantifying subjective values like freedom, and then use that data to predict/create better legislation?

What would be a "leverage point" for bootstrapping a global Polity?

Descriptive statistics is for description. E.g. regression or neural
networks are for prediction.
I would like to measure and later predict the red line. As I think it is
the most important statistics about thin moral evaluations. (But it is also
possible to try to measure the area under the hypothetical line or any
other area or line in the graph)

Good. First of all I would like to quantify thin moral evaluation of one's
life (sometimes called happiness, meaning, subjective well-being). Freedom
is already a thick moral (descriptive) concept.
For more see
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thick-ethical-concepts/

Next I will try to find that "leverage points" and also other significant
variables(like religion). I do have some candidates to leverage poins, but
it is worth testing. My main candidates are constitutions of global actors,
as they influence education, research, media, material flows, violence,
etc. One interesting exception is religion and churches as their constitutions
are written in brains and do not seem to be leverage points as they are too
stable.

When it comes to concrete changes, I do not know. We may get a lot of hints
from small scale testing. Cultivate those hints to some bigger test till we
get to global level. If I say it simply, I am for testing of promising
constitutions (inputs) and measurement of subjective well-being (outputs).
Compare it to arranging nice inputs and always finding some unspecifically
big mistakes in the output.

Kind regards
m.

For those who aren't familiar with it, Slashdot is a forum for
technical types where they're usually discussing technology but
frequently end up talking politics in cases where the two domains
overlap. This post last week got almost 500 followups, which is a
moderately high number. Unfortunately I find the results very
discouraging:
https://politics.slashdot.org/story/18/01/13/004233/ask-slashdot-how-would-you-use-computers-to-make-elections-better

The people on that forum should be our "early adopters", but it's
clear that we have a *lot* of work to do to inform them of their own
blindness before they'll be any use to anyone. To me it reads like
they're all just talking about the repercussions of the fact that the
sun revolves around the earth. How do we convince them that their
worldview is just fundamentally wrong?

Rare for me to stick my oar in these days but this one grabbed my 
attention.

Slashdot is notorious for its dystopian view of technology, despite, or, 
they might argue, because of their heightened familiarity with it, so it 
didn't surprise me that they would be so negative in response to the 
question put.

I would be too, but for different reasons, which most of us on this 
group would probably support. I'm not interested in computers or 
anything else "improving elections". Elections are nothing to do with 
democracy; they are designed, primarily to prevent it.

So the more appropriate question is "how could we use technology to 
introduce democracy?"  (I reject the word "improve" - it implies we've 
already got something worthy of being called "democracy" which is 
available for improvement)

And I've been banging on for some years about the most important thing 
we can do with technology which will give us a chance of introducing 
democracy but I don't thinkg I've ever mentioned it in this group. In 
short, the idea is to use technology to limit the damage governments are 
capable of.

It's been my principle focus for 20 years or so. With a lot of luck, 
this year, I might be able to announce the first live version of the 
project I've been working since about the turn of the century designed 
to achieve a number of things, the most important of which is the cure 
for what I call "Accountability Theatre"

https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/accountability-theatre/

but if you fancy a bit of fantasising about where the technology might  
eventually take us my fictional "history of digital telepathy" might 
entertain you.

https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/the-history-of-digital-telepathy-2/

My point is that I strongly believe that the laws, power structures and 
vested interests in society are so heavily weighted in favour of the 
elites and against WTP, that we need a much more strategic approach to 
the problem than is represented, for example, by the long standing 
efforts of a group like this. And this is not, in any way to denigrate 
all the effort and thought that has gone into MG; I'm sure it will pay 
off in the end.

But, personally I feel my own efforts are better spent on attacking the 
power structure more directly, with the long term ambition of opening 
the door to real democracy along the lines we're struggling with here.

Ciao

Harry

Hi Harry, 
I really enjoyed reading both of the papers you linked to below - though particularly the one on the *History of Digital Telepathy*. I?m currently reading another piece you wrote on *Ethical Identity Evaluation*. Very interesting. I really think you should "stick your oar in" here more often.

Thanks for the kind words.

I see you are burrowing deep into the rabbit hole.

> I really think you should "stick your oar in" here more often.

It's a bandwidth issue. I only have the one oar!

More seriously, the "real democracy" movement is basically healthy and 
up and running. Nothing, yet, like a consensus on what to do about 
getting it sorted but at least there is a considerable amount of 
activity in the field. It is also rare that I disagree with the main 
thrust of what I see being said and done in the group.

In contrast, the global level of activism or even comprehension about 
the extent and dangers of government surveillance against its own 
citizens is abysmal. We are living in a state of what I describe as 
Panopticon Plus which outperforms Bentham's wildest fantasies. It is a 
totalitarian wet dream and WTP have allowed it to happen without much 
more than the occasional whimper. People generally have no idea how 
serious a threat this poses to civilisation.

For example, it probably hasn't occurred to most members of this group
a) that every word ever posted by this group is now safely stored in 
archives held both by NSA and GCHQ
b) it's extremely unlikely that even they are aware of this. Yet. 
Because we haven't come up on their radar and, for the most part, they 
don't actually know what date they have captured.
c) if and when anything we do starts to make waves and thus bring 
ourselves to their attention, they'll go looking in their archives and 
discover the full history of the MG group.
d) they'll then churn all the material, particularly names and email 
addresses through their network matrix builders and construct the matrix 
which shows how we're all connected to the rest of the world. They'll 
trawl through all the messages we've ever sent (not just to each other 
but to ALL our contacts) in non encrypted channels, check our 
publications and public utterances and build complete profiles and 
activist pyramids to identify key players
e) then, if the waves we're making worry them in any way, for example 
because we're fuelling a growing movement in the USA to rewrite the 
constitution in ways they wouldn't approve, they'll go looking for the 
dirt (buried in the related data) they can use to undermine, blackmail 
or discredit those key players or ideas as appropriate

They started building that system, seriously, following 9-11. It isn't 
yet complete but it is up and running and we do occasionally see its 
ugly tentacles reaching out to grab its victims. China has a similar 
system, which is actually more honest - they openly tell their citizens 
that they're being watched for signs of subversion - but probably less 
powerful (it requires about 3 million human spies actively trawling 
their networks; NSA/GCHQ have fully automated their "passive" 
surveillance and are building fairly effective AI systems to search and 
correlate) Russia, Israel and sundry European countries are pursuing the 
same goals but aren't yet in the same league.

I'm in the Ed Snowden camp. For me the priority is to expose what's 
going on, but more importantly, I go one step further, to try to get 
people to realise that there ARE measures we can take to prevent the 
global Panopticon being used against us. Essentially it boils down to - 
first - using the same technology to watch the watchers and to store the 
data on immutable databases with trusted auditors having unfettered 
access.

And here's where we reconnect to Democracy. To begin with, the Auditors 
and Juries they'll need to report to are a fundamental democratic tool 
for the oversight of material where there is a legitimate need to 
preserve confidentiality. And that's something we could demand and 
create today. Ditto the laws required to mandate the use of the "Trusted 
Surveillance" protocols I advocate which would "watch the watchers" and 
provide the audit trails for the auditors and juries to examine.

But I'll leave you to ponder two examples of how democracy can (and, in 
my my view, must) control the technology more directly. I've actually 
touched on the first in the "Ethical ID" paper you're reading so you may 
already have encountered it. In short, Trusted Surveillance will only 
deserve that name if it acquires the Trust it needs. It will be trusted 
by all parties because they will (eventually) understand that
a) no one can cheat it
b) no one can extract data from it without the informed consent of the 
owner EXCEPT in circumstances defined, monitored and implemented by 
democratic means.

And here's the first example of how that democracy would manifest. I 
describe, in the Ethical ID paper, the possibility that Trusted 
Surveillance will permit us to prove the negative (eg that we were not 
at the scene of the crime) without revealing who we are or where we 
were. That would enable massive anonymous sweeps of the population to 
expose the handful of people who are unable or unwilling to prove that 
negative. It is an inherently democratic mechanism. Nobody could force 
you to comply. So it cannot work without a massive consensus that the 
question needs to be asked and answered in the first place.

You can imagine, for example, that if we learn that a rape/murder has 
taken place at a given location within a given time window, that once 
the horrific details were public and the police asked the community to 
take part in the "voluntary exclusion" exercise, there would be massive 
support and the vast majority of the population would comply, leaving 
exposed the handful who didn't. Amongst whom are likely to be the 
perpetrator and perhaps collaborators, as well as one or two innocent 
parties who happened to be close by but are not involved. The Policing 
task is now fairly trivial. In contrast, imagine that the Police had put 
out a similar request for those involved in the anti-trump protest which 
took place on inauguration day and for which they have tried to 
prosecute over 100 protestors (using, incidentally, some of the archive 
surveillance techniques outlined above) (and, fortunately, failing, so 
far, to get juries to cooperate). In that situation, the vast majority 
would simply refuse to participate, leaving the "perpetrators" safely 
hidden among the herd.

The second example of democratic control is the use of massively 
distributed escrow keys (I mention this in the History of Digital 
Telepathy). Heres the short version.

We're all (under Trusted Surveillance) monitoring our own lives 
digitally, in ways which cannot be subverted. This - for example - 
provides an instant cure for all sorts of abuse, from Police violence, 
through to sexual harrassment. You've got the evidence you need to 
convict the bastards. And you and only you can choose to release it. BUT 
that can also be abused. For example the same recordings could become 
Revenge Porn. Solution, joint keys and neither of you can view the 
material without reconstructing the key in a consensual fashion. BUT 
that too can be abused. If it began as consensual, so you've shared 
keys, then it turns nasty, the rapist can block your revelation by 
refusing to share his key. So now you need what I call the Jury key.

This is a key broken into 10,000 pieces and widely distributed amongst 
random key holding citizens who are all using the Trusted Surveillance 
system. If any 8000 of that 10000 all collaborate, they can reassemble 
the Jury Key. And the way the data is locked is such that any 2 of the 3 
keys can unlock it. i.e. the two consenting parties who originally 
locked it can unlock it at any time. But if a serious allegation like 
rape comes up and the other party refuses to co-operate, the potential 
victim can put out an appeal for democratic unlocking. Unless of course, 
they've died as a result of the attack, in which case, there's a much 
clearer case for democratic re-assembly of the Jury key. In either case, 
no one knows who is holding bits of the key. So no one can be coerced 
into sharing. The question has to be put to the population at large. If 
enough people are motivated to unlock the key, they'll go searching for 
the relevant matches in their key store and submit any matches to the 
"pool". If 80% of the key holders agree, the key will eventually emerge 
from the statistical fog.

I could ramble on for days. But you get the gist. I am deeply committed 
to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the 
technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who 
control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my 
view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a 
rational democratic debating process.

I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side of 
the struggle, please step forward...

If you have any further thoughts on "what to do about getting it sorted?, I for one would be interested in hearing your suggestions. Most of what I?ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated and I?m wondering what your current thinking is regarding leveraging a "real democracy".

We are living in a state of what I describe as Panopticon Plus which outperforms Bentham's wildest fantasies. It is a totalitarian wet dream and WTP have allowed it to happen without much more than the occasional whimper. People generally have no idea how serious a threat this poses to civilisation.

Agreed. My own research suggests that it?s even more sinister than what you describe. I?m quite sure the *powers that be* are actively engaged in the use of very effective mind-control mechanisms. (Perhaps a conversation for another day.) The take away is that the threat is serious enough, and that it?s up to WTP to respond effectively, or we risk losing freedoms on a scale that is perhaps unimaginable.

Given what you?ve written elsewhere, I?m guessing your presence here just about guarantees this.  :)

No doubt some scenarios bent towards engendering the successful inauguration of "real democracy" into our current *ecosystems of corruption* will bring the men in black suburbans to knocking on our doors. I don?t currently lose sleep over this because I think our overall lack of success has kept us securely in the "benign threat" file. Though I hope we can change this soon.

I?m still reading your "Ethical ID? paper. I?m a bit slow on the uptake when encountering new ideas such as this?and it?s rather long (that?s not a criticism). I think you adequately covered the basic idea though in your other paper that describes a fictional prelude to the potential future success this digital technology may realize. 

Related to this I found myself wondering if maybe Elon read your paper prior to coming up with his suggestion for a ubiquitous counter to the AI threat through the development of a neural lace. That would be quite a feather in your hat, heh. If not, you could just resort to the adage that "great minds think alike". :)

Yes. While the technological details are currently beyond my ability to fully comprehend, I do though get the gist. I?m impressed and heartened by both by the depth of your proposal as well as the clarity with which you present it.

> I am deeply committed to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a rational democratic debating process.

As you may have gathered from my previous contributions here, my own instinct has been to design and develop a global *platform for proposal* whereby projects such as the one you are proposing to could be presented, discussed, accepted, and potentially supported. Though I?ve been working on this for many years, with as much passion as I imagine you have in conjured in mustering you own, I am not tied to the details of how a *real democracy* might come about. 

I am encouraged by the variety of individual efforts emerging here and there and find myself wanting to bind them together into some cohesive and collaborative organism. The world is in such great flux these days I find myself wondering if maybe all it would take is for "a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens? to turn things around. Such widespread *Chaos equals Opportunity* right? 

Personally, I?m continually looking for individual trim tabs or leverage points. That said, I am convinced that unless we do this *together*, we?re simply blowing into a wind of ideas that will never find a (collective) soil in which to fully root and grow.

I?m in, (albeit with some ideas of my own). Please carry on?..  

As together we choose,

you might regret asking that. I was challenged by "The Prof" in 2007, 
over my support for Democracy. He made a cogent argument against 
democracy based on the notion that we're not sufficiently "equal" 
(chiefly in a cognitive sense) to allow democracy to work. In reply I 
laid out the most detailed case for and defense of Democracy I've so far 
attempted. In particular I took the arguments for Meritocracy head on. 
And, in the process published my first attempt at a democratic debating 
algorithm and outlining how the web is obvious platform for the 
democratic debate (your "Platform for Proposal"). There is even in a 
link back to "Metascore" in there somewhere, which shows how long I've 
been lurking on this group.

Its a forum discussion on my own website and I've "self certified" the 
entire forum (its a partial obstacle to automated state snooping) so as 
you enter you'll be confronted with the terrifying warning that you are 
entering the dangerous territory of an unvalidated certificate. If 
you're prepared to take your life in your own hands, and risk trusting 
me, then add the site as a "Security Exception" and proceed. But don't 
expect to surface for a few hours. And get someone to check, from time 
to time, that you haven't fallen over backwards frothing at the mouth...

This will take you to the Prof's case. My reply follows immediately.
https://www.fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=170&p=868#p868

I did argue, in the early days of this group, that we should have set up 
a forum of our own, not just in which to conduct our discussions 
somewhat more scalably than this, but also as a testbed for debating 
algorithms like my own or any alternatives which may exist or are 
provoked by it.

I'd have to say I am disappointed that after all these years, we still 
haven't managed that much.

that's no joke. I was "identified" by MI6, as an "anarchist - but one we 
can do business with" back in the early 80s (a close relative was 
"Positively Vetted" for the role he was about to take up at GCHQ) so I'm 
under no illusion that I'm at least on a list somewhere, but 
(regrettably?) I'm equally sure they don't (yet) see me as a threat. It 
is fascinating to speculate what effect discussions like these will have 
on the junior spooks who may one day read these comments and ask 
themselves what the fuck kind of system they're working for that thinks 
this kind of prurience is justifiable.

funny you should say that, before I settled on "Trusted Surveillance" I 
was rooting around for more "comforting" titles for my proposed system. 
I was close to choosing "Little Sister" (even less threatening than Big 
Sister). But then I decided that I had to take that challenge head on as 
well. My wife bluntly pointed out that a name like "Trusted 
Surveillance" instantly attracted distrust. I agree. But that's how it 
should be. Anyone proposing the kind of surveillance shield I'm 
proposing should be obliged to prove every claim, in order to earn 
whatever trust it requires and if we're not prepared to describe and 
defend every relevant choice, then nobody should be stupid enough to 
trust it.

That, in a sense, is a clue to why
> Most of what I?ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated

because, since about a year after that forum post, I've had the 
opportunity to start building the system which might make the beginnings 
of the Trusted Surveillance system possible and I am utterly focussed on 
getting the logic and every resulting definition, algorithm, protocol 
etc completely consistent with my starting principles. It is an 
extremely ambitious project and, candidly, I don't think I've got what 
it takes to complete it. My hope is that I can at least get it started 
to the extent that others will be able to jump on board and keep it 
going. One of the consequences of this level of focus is the near 
destruction of all my other creative effort. Like I said before. It's a 
bandwidth problem.

ah, I can't claim credit for that. The cyborg notion is not far short of 
a century old! (I think I've even heard arguments that Frankenstein's 
monster was the first example of the meme, but I don't think it 
qualified) I was certainly reading multiple sci fi stories containing 
cyborgs or similar concepts back in the 60s.

I oscillate between deep despair and cautious optimism. A phenomenon 
like the election of Trump is an extremely powerful argument against 
democracy and in support of the views put forward by "The Prof". But I 
prefer to see it as the necessary shock that it will take to wake a 
critical mass of intelligent Americans (who I would estimate at about 
25% of their population) to the need for revolutionary change in the 
direction of real Democracy.. And if a group like ours could get its own 
act together, we might even be able to build the model they need, in 
time for them to come along and adopt it...

yup, the eternal Anarchist problem. There's never another one to hold up 
the other end of the banner...

Message-ID: <83B3B7FB-FF32-482F-A103-5C2D54436218@stevecoffman.com>

In my struggle to understand what Michal ?t?p?nek has been trying to convey regarding his perspective of our efforts?or at least of mine, I decided to approach him *off-line* as I was becoming increasing frustrated (and somewhat embarrassed) at my inability to grasp what he was describing. This was partially due to some language barrier I suspect, but mostly due to my lack of understanding of the field/science of Systems Analysis, and likely as well (I think) to some reduced mental bandwidth issues on my part.  :)

That said, Michal very patiently continued and recommended I read the following link.

http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/

Here are some tantalizing excerpts:
From: Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System  

By Donella Meadows~

6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).

There was this subdivision of identical houses, the story goes, except that for some reason the electric meter in some of the houses was installed in the basement and in others it was installed in the front hall, where the residents could see it constantly, going round faster or slower as they used more or less electricity. With no other change, with identical prices, electricity consumption was 30 percent lower in the houses where the meter was in the front hall.

We systems-heads love that story because it?s an example of a high leverage point in the information structure of the system. It?s not a parameter adjustment, not a strengthening or weakening of an existing loop. It?s a NEW LOOP, delivering feedback to a place where it wasn?t going before.

A more recent example is the Toxic Release Inventory ? the U.S. government?s requirement, instituted in 1986, that every factory releasing hazardous air pollutants report those emissions publicly every year. Suddenly every community could find out precisely what was coming out of the smokestacks in town. There was no law against those emissions, no fines, no determination of ?safe? levels, just information. But by 1990 emissions dropped 40 percent. They?ve continued to go down since, not so much because of citizen outrage as because of corporate shame. One chemical company that found itself on the Top Ten Polluters list reduced its emissions by 90 percent, just to ?get off that list.?


Compelling feedback. Suppose taxpayers got to specify on their return forms what government services their tax payments must be spent on. (Radical democracy!) Suppose any town or company that puts a water intake pipe in a river had to put it immediately DOWNSTREAM from its own outflow pipe. Suppose any public or private official who made the decision to invest in a nuclear power plant got the waste from that plant stored on his/her lawn. Suppose (this is an old one) the politicians who declare war were required to spend that war in the front lines.
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.

The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human economies it?s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems lingo it?s called self-organization.

Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list ? adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or computers ? adding new negative or positive loops, or new rules. The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself. The human immune system has the power to develop new responses to (some kinds of ) insults it has never before encountered. The human brain can take in new information and pop out completely new thoughts.

2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system ? its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters ? arises.

Another of Jay Forrester?s famous systems sayings goes: it doesn?t matter how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the minds of the society about what a ?fair? distribution of the tax load is. Whatever the rules say, by fair means or foul, by complications, cheating, exemptions or deductions, by constant sniping at the rules, actual tax payments will push right up against the accepted idea of ?fairness.?

The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions ? unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows them ? constitute that society?s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the world works. There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of Homo sapiens. One can ?own? land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit obvious.

The ancient Egyptians built pyramids because they believed in an afterlife. We build skyscrapers, because we believe that space in downtown cities is enormously valuable. (Except for blighted spaces, often near the skyscrapers, which we believe are worthless.) Whether it was Copernicus and Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point that totally transforms systems.

You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not second-to-highest. But there?s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter ? they resist challenges to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else.

So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 <http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven> has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don?t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.

Systems folks would say you change paradigms by modeling a system, which takes you outside the system and forces you to see it whole. We say that because our own paradigms have been changed that way.

A Final Caution

Back from the sublime to the ridiculous, from enlightenment to caveats. There is so much that has to be said to qualify this list. It is tentative and its order is slithery. There are exceptions to every item that can move it up or down the order of leverage. Having had the list percolating in my subconscious for years has not transformed me into a Superwoman. The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it ? that?s why societies have to rub out truly enlightened beings.

Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tickets to mastery. You have to work hard at it, whether that means rigorously analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.


This helps a lot Michal. I imagine I'll be referring to this list for some time to come. Particularly # 1.  (if you never hear from me again...you?ll know why.)

Thanks so much,

Steve

email debate isn't scalable. Forum debates scale quite well.

they are also the obvious platform for formal democratic debates and we 
could use our own debates to test out the various algorithms which we'll 
need to develop to make the system work.

unfortunately that's exactly the kind of image which will fuel the 
authoritarian (and racist in this case) mysogynist.

One of the painful conclusions I have reached is that, unless you 
actually want fisticuffs and a shooting war, you have to find ways to 
make your opponents agree with you, not just bully or intimidate them 
(even if just with images) into submission. The problem is that the 
coercive strategy favoured by the authoritarians is much more effective, 
which is why, so often in human history, liberation movements have 
turned into tyrannies. It's so much easier. (That's a contributing 
motive to my Trusted Surveillance efforts - make the coercion 
permanently visible)

Only up to a point, and I'd argue that point is not more than a few
multiples of the email limit and still several orders of magnitude
smaller than would would be required to have even a locality-wide
debate on an issue where more than a few percent of the population
participates. And if you don't have at least a majority of the people
directly involved in making the decision, you've just reproduced
oligarchy ("government by the active participants"), not implemented
democracy.

Fortunately, little debate is actually required to make good
decisions. In fact if you have qualified and talented social engineers
writing the proposals, no debate at all should be required. Instead
the vastly simpler pro/con list (as implemented in proxyfor.me) will
be sufficient to ensure a good decisions since The People are merely
doing quality control at that point, not arguing about the details of
a proposal. To my mind the latter, and what you seem to be proposing,
is just "design by committee" which any engineer can tell you reliably
produces poor quality products.

Agreed, and it's not just authoritarians who will balk at one group
like this having control over the outcome out of proportion to their
numbers. With the exception of a small minority of social dominators
(the main leadership component of SDAPs) we *all* have an innate sense
of fairness that requires a much more egalitarian distribution of
input into the process.

Not just that, I believed we're actually instinctively programmed to
turn to authoritarian rule when decisions (and progress) don't get
made, especially when the group is under some sort of economic stress.
Which is of course why I find the consensus-oriented systems Ed and
others are insisting on so objectionable: They virtually *ensure*
authoritarian decisionmaking because *no* decision gets made
otherwise.

But you don't have to get everyone to agree, only to have a majority
not raise objections, a vastly lower hurdle. If people truly believe
that the decision reflects The Will of The People (which of course
applies to essentially zero of the decisions made by misrepresentative
democracy), they will follow the law with minimal coercion even if it
wasn't the one they preferred. But we're much less likely to follow an
authoritarian leader, especially if we didn't vote for that, which is
why coercion becomes so much more common (and necessary) when power is
all top-down.

Besides the possibility that they "know enough to be afraid" a related
issue is the personality psychology of engineers and other technical
types: They tend to be highly authoritarian with a unusually large
predilection for prejudice and violence. For example they are vastly
over-represented among the ranks of Jihadis:

To the extend that by "elections" you mean selection of
representatives for the legislative branch, I agree. Elections for
executive branch positions are much less problematic, I think,
although still a suboptimal way to do it.

Sorry, I think you went off into the weeds here: If you think you need
to limit the tools and techniques the government uses I submit that
you've already failed because you've made one of two fundamental
errors:
1) You believe that it's reasonable (or perhaps inevitable) that the
government implements something other than "The Will of The People".
2) You believe in some sort of "inalienable rights" independent of
those the rest of us are wiling to grant you (the libertarian
position).

Laboring under either of these misconceptions simply renders any of
your proposals non-viable because even if you succeed in achieving any
short-term goal it will be at best a bandaid covering up a cancerous
mole. The only solution to bad government is to replace it with good
government. *That* is what we should be working on, not merely
applying patches to a vessel that we know will eventually sink us all
unless it's replaced. While we might argue about what "good
government" is, I think most of us here would agree that some sort of
more egalitarian system must be designed/built/implemented. Whether or
not that will result in "good government" or not is an empirical
question, but since we've never tried it before it's at the very least
an experiment worth doing. Unfortunately working on anything else is
not just a distraction, it's actually counterproductive because it
serves to legitimize the existing system and make people substantially
less willing to abandon it even when something better comes along
("Maybe if we just patch this one biggest leak we can make it across
the river one more time before we all drown!").

At least from what I'm reading, that's not exactly his argument. I
found his claims amazingly reminiscent of the recent Damore/Google
kerfuffle last year (12 years later), albeit that's about the
composition of the engineering population rather than the
decisionmaking population:
https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320

It's of course also the general position taken by Wade in "A
Troublesome Inheritance" a 2014 book that SJWs and PC pressure has
caused the "scientific community" to denounce even though few of them
have even read it and none of them have made any convincing case that
any of it is fundamentally incorrect (all the negative reviews I've
read of it focus on obscure technicalities, attempting to discredit
the overwhelming evidence that his main conclusions are correct by
pointing out a little bit of fuzz on his characterizations of the raw
data):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Troublesome_Inheritance

The way I interpret it he's not exactly arguing against democracy or
even direct democracy, but only that different people are going to
have different roles in the system (which, BTW, is exactly what
proxyfor.me is designed to facilitate). You, on the other hand, seem
to be arguing the opposite (that it's *not* reasonable to make these
kinds of distinctions) without offering any proof that this is
necessary, desirable, or even achievable. IMHO differential
participation rates are inevitable and so no system that doesn't
account for this is even viable. Unfortunately this includes every
single system prior to proxyfor.me that I'm aware of with the possible
exception of the very earliest human decisionmaking system: Voting
with your feet or conspiring to eliminate a problematic individual in
your band, a system that worked for us for hundreds of thousands of
years prior to the development of agriculture (or more specifically,
the invention of money that can be used to purchase surplus goods).

And not to rain on your parade, but I'd say you're holding the wrong
end of the stick: All this paranoia about surveillance just tells me
that you're apparently looking at "the government" as an us vs. them
kind of thing, a perspective that's not only fundamentally backwards
but also all but guarantees that anything you come up with will be
unimplementable (why would the oligarchs give up any of their power if
you've already resigned yourself to the fact that they have the
power?). Worse, you've also squandered (or even misapplied) what
little intellectual and political capital you may have to bring to
bear on the issue making it even *more* difficult for anyone with an
actual solution to the problems of public policy decisionmaking to
succeed. IMHO widespread surveillance, even to the point of *complete*
surveillance, should be considered a good thing because it can be used
to solve so many problems with almost no downsides *provided* that The
People are the ones actually making the decisions as to how that data
is used (and by whom). Arguing against it is just arguing from a
position of fear and weakness: If you don't trust the government, your
problem is with the structure of government, not with the tools
they're using.

Scott, greetings,

some good and meaty, and some bizarre arguments you have in your 
response(s)
Probably take me a week to respond and right now I don't have that week 
available.

I'll also probably repost the whole thing onto my forum, a) because its 
a much better writing/quoting environment and b) because the whole 
argument - which looks like it could get quite interesting - will be 
more publicly available.

Will try to deal with it in the next couple of weeks but I'm actually at 
a crunch time for own development plans so they must take priority.

Apologies.

I'm game. There's a similar forum at http://www.matchism.org/forum,
but it seems your forum went dormant around the same time as I started
working in this area. If you're really interested in public access it
might be better to use the matchism forum instead of www.fullmoon.nu
because matchism.org works with http instead of requiring using https
without a certificate (something most people won't do because of all
the scary warnings browsers bring up before you can get to your
forum).

Although as I said I'm actually more comfortable working via email and
believe it works fine for discussions of this type.

I can certainly relate to that: Since none of us are getting paid for
this and there isn't even any possibility of a big payoff at the end
(other than maybe the opportunity to become a martyr for the cause ;-)
it's a miracle that any of us make any progress at all. I would
recommend, however, using us as a "sanity check" on your plans before
going all-in on them. Sure you might get some troll-type criticism
that will just be a noisy waste of time to deal with. But it might
also save you from making huge blunders that you're simply blind to
because you're too close to the problem (like, creating a system
that's designed to merely restrict the government rather than to fix
what's actually broken in it).

Message-ID: <CAEyrqBr_ytrRQ0x62kH1sZTHsrkysFGCBd836xRtBF0yLsnB8w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi again :),

I am still working on the Prediction of goodness. I needed to add one layer
of evaluation, because the sum of decisions' evaluations does not make
institutions' evaluation even if isolated (sum of parts is not the same as
the whole :D, mainly because people tend to forget that they are animals).
Also I am no longer talking about laws and government, changed those words
for "decision" and "international institution" or "international actor".
If you like, there is still the old way to directly follow the project
researchgate.net/project/Prediction-of-goodness
but because I have found how much is this project changing my worldview, I
started posting some easy (different) updates on
facebook.com/predofg
twitter.com/predofg
too. I hope you will like one of the ways how to follow the project and
watch where it goes. And at last but not least, many thanks to those who
already follow and comment the project, it makes me happy.

Anyway, what do you do?

Cheers
m.

Hi Scott (and others),
My apologies for dropping the previous thread. I was away from my computer for several weeks visiting family. I?d like to continue the conversation, but rather than picking up the circular and protracted debate about the pros and cons of dictators vs. politburos  ;) I like to suggest that we just move on. I believe there?s a larger conversation needing our attention. 

I would though like to reference one comment you made in your last reply to the 'Multiple Proxies? thread, Scott. There?s a passage from a book I was reading while I was away that I feel correlates with it quite elegantly.  

[First my comment?]

From: Founding Brothers by Joseph J. Ellis
Vintage Books 2002 
p. 216

"As Adams remembered it?.'all great critical questions about men and measures from 1774 to 1778' we?re desperately contested and highly problematic occasions, usually decided by one vote of a single state, and that vote was often decided by a single individual. Nothing was clear, inevitable, or even comprehensible to the soldiers in the field at Saratoga or the statesman in the corridors at Philadelphia: 'It was patched and piebald policy then, as it is now, ever was, ever will be, world without end.' The real drama of the American Revolution, which was perfectly in accord with Adam?s memory, as well as with the turbulent conditions of his own soul, was its inherent messiness. This meant recovering the exciting but terrifying sense that all the major players had at the time?namely, that they were making it up as they went along, improvising on the edge of catastrophe."

[More about this at the end of my email.]

As I think we all know now, the "catastrophe? these *Brothers* were facing was multifold and ultimately came down to 'life or death' decisions for many of them individually as well as for their emerging Country. But the circumstances they faced were, by any reasonable measure, an order of magnitude less complex and dire than those we are currently facing as a planetary species.

In my mind, the confluence of tragedies we are soon to encounter on a colossal scale is an emerging crisis that can only be met by the massive synergistic intelligence of a collective global mind. I think it is our best and only survival option. It should be clear to any semi-conscious human that the structures we now rely on are not up to the task. For me personally, the preponderant question is: "How does a Meta-mind emerge?" Of course no one can really say, but I think attempting to design a Meta-governance system to replace what?s collapsing before our eyes is a fine place to start.

--------------------------------------------------

I really like the essential components of proxy4.me. I think it?s crucial that we achieve a comprehensive quorum if we are going to empower a truly comprehensive global democracy. And it seems to me that proxy4.me is a near perfect fit for this objective...if it works as intended. That said, I think it?s just one piece of a larger puzzle that will be needed for constructing a thriving and effective global platform. Listed below I believe is an inventory of a the baseline components that will be crucial, from the get go, for the creation of a self-organizing global body.

1 - I think we can all agree a crowdsourced *proposal driven platform* is key. One that is available to anyone willing to participate according to the rules and norms of the larger Organization. A Network for a global tribe that can generate and support the proposals and projects of a new paradigm?perhaps even an entirely new species.

2 - Perhaps we can also agree that proposals will need to be vetted in order to reduce the number of those which are poorly developed and/or that don?t fit the Mandate of the Organization at large.

3 - Because *we the people* will ultimately generate an enormous number of proposals at a global level (perhaps dozens or more daily), a sizable staff will be necessary to process them in a timely manner. 

4 - This staff will need to be managed by some Executive Oversight Structure. [To be run by either a Dictator, or a Politburo. ;]  

5 - The overall Platform will need to be developed and maintained as well by even more staff.

6 - I think it will be necessary to set up a customized crypto-economy with a Foundation to support proposals and the financial needs of the Organization at large. Many proposals will need significant resources to get them off the ground. And some will no doubt provide significant income for the Foundation once their projects become viable.

7 - A Voting Platform will be necessary to determine which proposals are adopted and funded.

8 - An ever-evolving crowdsourced Mandate will need to be drafted in order to reflect the Vision of the Organization as well as to determine it's Priority.

9 - And, as I see it, a blockchain Database will need to be set up to track the undertakings and operation of the Organization.

10 - A huge forum for Discourse will be necessary to debate the proposals that have been vetted prior to a vote.

11 - A Magistrate of sorts will be necessary to maintain order on the Intranet Platform of the Network.

12 - And finally, a Template for submitting proposals according to the Policy of the Organization will be extremely useful in saving time and effort both for those creating the proposals, as well as for those who are vetting them.

Obviously there are many more details to be fleshed out, but that is, I believe, a comprehensive summary of the fundamental elements necessary to get this project off the ground. 


Thanks in advance for your thoughtful response,
Steve

One final word in reference to the "on-the-fly-redesign? comment. 

I first encountered what might be called the substratum of these ideas back in the early eighties. My own personal journey through the decades since has precipitated many practical and theoretical iterations emerging from this basic substructure of ideas. But one of the values that has run through them all is a conviction that the Process and Structure must be crowdsourced and flexible enough to be continually self-organizing. I?m not sure if this qualifies as an "on-the-fly-redesign,? but either way, I?ll take it with your "design it right in the first place" comment as a misguided suggestion rather than an admonition. :) I think it?s critical that we remain open, flexible, and collaborative as we "improvise on the edge of catastrophe".

I'm not sure what Harold is talking about either. I like your list Steve,
well spelled out. The only thing I disagree with is point 4 - This staff
will need to be managed by some Executive Oversight Structure. [To be run
by either a Dictator, or a Politburo. ;]

With a clearly defined mandate set by the public of what is expected from
the staff, they should require no managing. If they break their mandate
then they are able to be replaced by a vote. This 'Executive Oversight'
needs to be extremely limited in its power for me to consider this a
reasonable idea. As I perceive your system now I think they can do to much
damage in the short term, enough to disrupt everything and potentially
cause chaos.

Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me, not the number 4.

Hi Steve,

about that Meta-mind. Sorry, I know that you do not define it, but it
sounds like that if everybody is in the decision making process that it is
the best process. Well, it may be true when the best contribution of some
individuals is that they learn something from the process. Because they may
be biased, e.g. vulgar material thinking bias. They only way forward may be
learning.

Sure more people know more, but in my opinion it is worth testing how many
and what kind of people you need for decision-making that produces best
outcomes, before you ask everybody to participate.

Kind regars

Hi everyone I was just curious if the metagovernance site's gone back
online somewhere in some form.

And if not, if you'd be interested in joining the International Direct
Democracy Union on FB so we can hear more from you, and grow the IDDU. -So
every individual project can have a larger union to link to so they don't
have to seem like they're just dreaming all this stuff up on their own.

Agreed. I haven't really defined what the filtering mechanism for
getting a proposal into the main queue should look like, but in
proxyfor.me inappropriate filtering is the only real means for the
executive branch to get up to any policy mischief (e.g., there is
basically no provision for "executive orders" other than the normal
regulatory stuff). I still believe that getting a proposal through
some sort of an "initiative" process on FB/reddit/etc. should be
sufficient. If the Manager rejects it anyway, they'd be obligated to
provide a rejection letter, and if that provides an obviously
inappropriate reason it would be sufficient cause to get people riled
up enough to vote to remove the  the manager (or maybe just the queue
manager). And as I've already suggested "remove the manager" should be
a permanent proposal in the queue and that the replacement manager
should be pre-identified (e.g, for the Globality Manager, the highest
rated (by some objective criteria) Locality Manager would
automatically be promoted. For Localities I guess you'd have to use a
lower-level board: Here in Boulder for example it'd probably be the
highest rated member of the Planning Board, which perhaps not
coincidentally is where many of the City Council candidates already
come from).

> Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me, not the number 4.

Yeah, proxy4.me is being used by some German sysadmin for his testing
purposes. At some point I was going make an offer to buy it from him,
but was planning to wait until confusion became an issue. I guess it
already has ;-)

Oh that was a reference to the 'state of the union' address presidents use
to discuss the state of the nation. I was just playing with words. I'm
curious what's going on with Metagovernance. Someone took the site down
saying they were gonna improve it and it simply never came back. Some years
later here I am, part of the IDDU, wondering if all you guys gave up or
dislike the idea of having a group page for direct representation
projects/[coalition].

I appreciate your feedback Patrick. I'm probably missing something here. (I really mean that.) It?s difficult for me to comprehend how an organization of that scale would tick without some umbrella of management. But I?m considering your suggestion?."a clearly defined mandate [such that staff would] require no managing,? that to me would be ideal. 

I think one of the most inspiring examples of this is valvesoftware.com. They have a completely horizontal organizational structure. Their desks are literally on wheels and each employee gets to park themselves wherever they want, and work on what ever inspires them. I?m not a gamer, but I believe Valve is one of the premier companies of it?s kind on the planet. Apparently they're very successful. As I understand it, the only managers are ad hoc Projects Organizers who are completely self-selecting. Maybe their model is something to emulate. Whatever we wind up implementing, I agree with you and Scott that being able to vote managers out overnight is key.

Also, as we speed up the curve towards the *Singularity*, no doubt AI will be saddled with more of the tasks and duties associated with managing our general human infrastructure. If we can write algorithms to manage various aspects of oversight for the Organization, I?m all for it. 

The real question that continues to bewilder me is, ?How do we get this show on the road?? My guess is that a fair number of those souls with an interest in Meta-governance have at some point found their way to this list. If that?s so, what?s keeping us from a more active collaboration.

I mean really. I just came from a trip to California where I have family in both Santa Rosa and Ventura and I can attest to you that Rome has already begun to burn. 

It seems to me that our apparent inability to organize a governance mechanism for a sovereign global people is the only thing that is keeping us from a reasonable response to the tragedies that lie before us. 

I?m puzzled to find the missing link? What will it take? 

What would a first step look like?

Wouldn?t any ?best outcome? determination be based on subjective criteria? Who would determine what "best outcome" looks like, and what are the criteria they would use to make this determination? 

Also, how do you exclude someone from this process? By their low IQ, their prison record, or their poor diet? :)  Is that what you mean by "vulgar material thinking bias??  I?m not sure I?m following you Michal. 

Sorry. Please try again.

Yes, best outcome is subjective, still it allows for 7.6 billions of
subjectivities. Just ask them whether their life is good, whether some
partial outcomes are good.

As in current system exclusion isn't the right word in many cases. It is
just so that some kinds of people are more likely to be in government. It
may be about election system that makes people with "better outcomes" (as
described above) more likely to be in some kind of government. Or it may be
about system that attracts certain kind of people who are likely to produce
"better outcomes".

Still the research about relation of election systems and "better outcomes"
is still very incomplete. On the other hand I believe it is in your powers
to run some research in this sense with your skills.

Kind regards
m.

Theoretically, at least in my mind, the *precursors* to ?best outcome? would be described clearly in the Mandate of the Organization. Values like freedom, justice, and equality come to mind. 

The Mandate would drive the quality, intent, and material design of proposals submitted to the Organization. 

For me, ?best outcome? for proposal submissions would be based on values like brevity, clarity, and veracity. Or for staff selection - experience, passion, responsibility. 

> As in current system exclusion isn't the right word in many cases. It is just so that some kinds of people are more likely to be in government. It may be about election system that makes people with "better outcomes" (as described above) more likely to be in some kind of government. Or it may be about system that attracts certain kind of people who are likely to produce "better outcomes?.

 I?m not sure exactly what you mean by "best outcomes?. Are you talking about the better legislation?.or better elected representatives?or both?

> Still the research about relation of election systems and "better outcomes" is still very incomplete. On the other hand I believe it is in your powers to run some research in this sense with your skills.

I seem to remember a thread where you discussed this with Scott. Is this something that a larger quorum would fulfill? More people voting = larger cross-section of sensible voter profiles = less assholes getting elected = "better outcome??

There are more options how to construct it as (thin moral) evaluation of
one's life has distribution in population, so you may use descriptive
statistics.

Well, we do not know really, there are too many effects in society for such
a simple thinking imho. I prefer the black box model, where we measure
outputs and we look for significant inputs. Everything else is black box.
Significant inputs we may also call as Meadows' "leverage points".

I think it could largely be a boilerplate *application* tailored to the type or category of proposal being submitted. Tutorials could be available to assist in making the application process more understandable. And as I said earlier, I think that ultimately AI could be utilized. My sense is that one would want to make the process as simple and painless as possible so that more people would be inclined to use the platform. And the boilerplate aspect would assist in the *vetting* as well by making proposals more uniform. Initially I think, maybe just a simple form with a tutorial listing the basics.

Agreed.

This is the biggest hurdle in my mind. How do you legitimize something like proxyfor.me except through widespread usage. It needs to be tested before it will be accepted by the mainstream. Chicken and egg. What kind of proposal could be run on Social Media that would have enough *value outcome* to attract the necessary population, not only to validate it, but to encourage it?s further usage?

I imagine this would cause a managers average cortisol levels to rise substantially.

Ok, so you could use descriptive statistics to predict the best outcome for the development specific legislation? Sorry, I don?t have a background in statistics (and I may be a little bit stupid as well). But I?m curious. Are you wanting to use statistics to gauge the outcome of decision-making by quantifying subjective values like freedom, and then use that data to predict/create better legislation?

What would be a "leverage point" for bootstrapping a global Polity?

Descriptive statistics is for description. E.g. regression or neural
networks are for prediction.
I would like to measure and later predict the red line. As I think it is
the most important statistics about thin moral evaluations. (But it is also
possible to try to measure the area under the hypothetical line or any
other area or line in the graph)

Good. First of all I would like to quantify thin moral evaluation of one's
life (sometimes called happiness, meaning, subjective well-being). Freedom
is already a thick moral (descriptive) concept.
For more see
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thick-ethical-concepts/

Next I will try to find that "leverage points" and also other significant
variables(like religion). I do have some candidates to leverage poins, but
it is worth testing. My main candidates are constitutions of global actors,
as they influence education, research, media, material flows, violence,
etc. One interesting exception is religion and churches as their constitutions
are written in brains and do not seem to be leverage points as they are too
stable.

When it comes to concrete changes, I do not know. We may get a lot of hints
from small scale testing. Cultivate those hints to some bigger test till we
get to global level. If I say it simply, I am for testing of promising
constitutions (inputs) and measurement of subjective well-being (outputs).
Compare it to arranging nice inputs and always finding some unspecifically
big mistakes in the output.

Kind regards

For those who aren't familiar with it, Slashdot is a forum for
technical types where they're usually discussing technology but
frequently end up talking politics in cases where the two domains
overlap. This post last week got almost 500 followups, which is a
moderately high number. Unfortunately I find the results very
discouraging:
https://politics.slashdot.org/story/18/01/13/004233/ask-slashdot-how-would-you-use-computers-to-make-elections-better

The people on that forum should be our "early adopters", but it's
clear that we have a *lot* of work to do to inform them of their own
blindness before they'll be any use to anyone. To me it reads like
they're all just talking about the repercussions of the fact that the
sun revolves around the earth. How do we convince them that their
worldview is just fundamentally wrong?

Rare for me to stick my oar in these days but this one grabbed my 
attention.

Slashdot is notorious for its dystopian view of technology, despite, or, 
they might argue, because of their heightened familiarity with it, so it 
didn't surprise me that they would be so negative in response to the 
question put.

I would be too, but for different reasons, which most of us on this 
group would probably support. I'm not interested in computers or 
anything else "improving elections". Elections are nothing to do with 
democracy; they are designed, primarily to prevent it.

So the more appropriate question is "how could we use technology to 
introduce democracy?"  (I reject the word "improve" - it implies we've 
already got something worthy of being called "democracy" which is 
available for improvement)

And I've been banging on for some years about the most important thing 
we can do with technology which will give us a chance of introducing 
democracy but I don't thinkg I've ever mentioned it in this group. In 
short, the idea is to use technology to limit the damage governments are 
capable of.

It's been my principle focus for 20 years or so. With a lot of luck, 
this year, I might be able to announce the first live version of the 
project I've been working since about the turn of the century designed 
to achieve a number of things, the most important of which is the cure 
for what I call "Accountability Theatre"

eventually take us my fictional "history of digital telepathy" might 
entertain you.

https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/the-history-of-digital-telepathy-2/

My point is that I strongly believe that the laws, power structures and 
vested interests in society are so heavily weighted in favour of the 
elites and against WTP, that we need a much more strategic approach to 
the problem than is represented, for example, by the long standing 
efforts of a group like this. And this is not, in any way to denigrate 
all the effort and thought that has gone into MG; I'm sure it will pay 
off in the end.

But, personally I feel my own efforts are better spent on attacking the 
power structure more directly, with the long term ambition of opening 
the door to real democracy along the lines we're struggling with here.

Ciao

Hi Harry, 
I really enjoyed reading both of the papers you linked to below - though particularly the one on the *History of Digital Telepathy*. I?m currently reading another piece you wrote on *Ethical Identity Evaluation*. Very interesting. I really think you should "stick your oar in" here more often.

Thanks for the kind words.

I see you are burrowing deep into the rabbit hole.

> I really think you should "stick your oar in" here more often.

It's a bandwidth issue. I only have the one oar!

More seriously, the "real democracy" movement is basically healthy and 
up and running. Nothing, yet, like a consensus on what to do about 
getting it sorted but at least there is a considerable amount of 
activity in the field. It is also rare that I disagree with the main 
thrust of what I see being said and done in the group.

In contrast, the global level of activism or even comprehension about 
the extent and dangers of government surveillance against its own 
citizens is abysmal. We are living in a state of what I describe as 
Panopticon Plus which outperforms Bentham's wildest fantasies. It is a 
totalitarian wet dream and WTP have allowed it to happen without much 
more than the occasional whimper. People generally have no idea how 
serious a threat this poses to civilisation.

For example, it probably hasn't occurred to most members of this group
a) that every word ever posted by this group is now safely stored in 
archives held both by NSA and GCHQ
b) it's extremely unlikely that even they are aware of this. Yet. 
Because we haven't come up on their radar and, for the most part, they 
don't actually know what date they have captured.
c) if and when anything we do starts to make waves and thus bring 
ourselves to their attention, they'll go looking in their archives and 
discover the full history of the MG group.
d) they'll then churn all the material, particularly names and email 
addresses through their network matrix builders and construct the matrix 
which shows how we're all connected to the rest of the world. They'll 
trawl through all the messages we've ever sent (not just to each other 
but to ALL our contacts) in non encrypted channels, check our 
publications and public utterances and build complete profiles and 
activist pyramids to identify key players
e) then, if the waves we're making worry them in any way, for example 
because we're fuelling a growing movement in the USA to rewrite the 
constitution in ways they wouldn't approve, they'll go looking for the 
dirt (buried in the related data) they can use to undermine, blackmail 
or discredit those key players or ideas as appropriate

They started building that system, seriously, following 9-11. It isn't 
yet complete but it is up and running and we do occasionally see its 
ugly tentacles reaching out to grab its victims. China has a similar 
system, which is actually more honest - they openly tell their citizens 
that they're being watched for signs of subversion - but probably less 
powerful (it requires about 3 million human spies actively trawling 
their networks; NSA/GCHQ have fully automated their "passive" 
surveillance and are building fairly effective AI systems to search and 
correlate) Russia, Israel and sundry European countries are pursuing the 
same goals but aren't yet in the same league.

I'm in the Ed Snowden camp. For me the priority is to expose what's 
going on, but more importantly, I go one step further, to try to get 
people to realise that there ARE measures we can take to prevent the 
global Panopticon being used against us. Essentially it boils down to - 
first - using the same technology to watch the watchers and to store the 
data on immutable databases with trusted auditors having unfettered 
access.

And here's where we reconnect to Democracy. To begin with, the Auditors 
and Juries they'll need to report to are a fundamental democratic tool 
for the oversight of material where there is a legitimate need to 
preserve confidentiality. And that's something we could demand and 
create today. Ditto the laws required to mandate the use of the "Trusted 
Surveillance" protocols I advocate which would "watch the watchers" and 
provide the audit trails for the auditors and juries to examine.

But I'll leave you to ponder two examples of how democracy can (and, in 
my my view, must) control the technology more directly. I've actually 
touched on the first in the "Ethical ID" paper you're reading so you may 
already have encountered it. In short, Trusted Surveillance will only 
deserve that name if it acquires the Trust it needs. It will be trusted 
by all parties because they will (eventually) understand that
a) no one can cheat it
b) no one can extract data from it without the informed consent of the 
owner EXCEPT in circumstances defined, monitored and implemented by 
democratic means.

And here's the first example of how that democracy would manifest. I 
describe, in the Ethical ID paper, the possibility that Trusted 
Surveillance will permit us to prove the negative (eg that we were not 
at the scene of the crime) without revealing who we are or where we 
were. That would enable massive anonymous sweeps of the population to 
expose the handful of people who are unable or unwilling to prove that 
negative. It is an inherently democratic mechanism. Nobody could force 
you to comply. So it cannot work without a massive consensus that the 
question needs to be asked and answered in the first place.

You can imagine, for example, that if we learn that a rape/murder has 
taken place at a given location within a given time window, that once 
the horrific details were public and the police asked the community to 
take part in the "voluntary exclusion" exercise, there would be massive 
support and the vast majority of the population would comply, leaving 
exposed the handful who didn't. Amongst whom are likely to be the 
perpetrator and perhaps collaborators, as well as one or two innocent 
parties who happened to be close by but are not involved. The Policing 
task is now fairly trivial. In contrast, imagine that the Police had put 
out a similar request for those involved in the anti-trump protest which 
took place on inauguration day and for which they have tried to 
prosecute over 100 protestors (using, incidentally, some of the archive 
surveillance techniques outlined above) (and, fortunately, failing, so 
far, to get juries to cooperate). In that situation, the vast majority 
would simply refuse to participate, leaving the "perpetrators" safely 
hidden among the herd.

The second example of democratic control is the use of massively 
distributed escrow keys (I mention this in the History of Digital 
Telepathy). Heres the short version.

We're all (under Trusted Surveillance) monitoring our own lives 
digitally, in ways which cannot be subverted. This - for example - 
provides an instant cure for all sorts of abuse, from Police violence, 
through to sexual harrassment. You've got the evidence you need to 
convict the bastards. And you and only you can choose to release it. BUT 
that can also be abused. For example the same recordings could become 
Revenge Porn. Solution, joint keys and neither of you can view the 
material without reconstructing the key in a consensual fashion. BUT 
that too can be abused. If it began as consensual, so you've shared 
keys, then it turns nasty, the rapist can block your revelation by 
refusing to share his key. So now you need what I call the Jury key.

This is a key broken into 10,000 pieces and widely distributed amongst 
random key holding citizens who are all using the Trusted Surveillance 
system. If any 8000 of that 10000 all collaborate, they can reassemble 
the Jury Key. And the way the data is locked is such that any 2 of the 3 
keys can unlock it. i.e. the two consenting parties who originally 
locked it can unlock it at any time. But if a serious allegation like 
rape comes up and the other party refuses to co-operate, the potential 
victim can put out an appeal for democratic unlocking. Unless of course, 
they've died as a result of the attack, in which case, there's a much 
clearer case for democratic re-assembly of the Jury key. In either case, 
no one knows who is holding bits of the key. So no one can be coerced 
into sharing. The question has to be put to the population at large. If 
enough people are motivated to unlock the key, they'll go searching for 
the relevant matches in their key store and submit any matches to the 
"pool". If 80% of the key holders agree, the key will eventually emerge 
from the statistical fog.

I could ramble on for days. But you get the gist. I am deeply committed 
to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the 
technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who 
control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my 
view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a 
rational democratic debating process.

I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side of 
the struggle, please step forward...

Harry

If you have any further thoughts on "what to do about getting it sorted?, I for one would be interested in hearing your suggestions. Most of what I?ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated and I?m wondering what your current thinking is regarding leveraging a "real democracy".

Agreed. My own research suggests that it?s even more sinister than what you describe. I?m quite sure the *powers that be* are actively engaged in the use of very effective mind-control mechanisms. (Perhaps a conversation for another day.) The take away is that the threat is serious enough, and that it?s up to WTP to respond effectively, or we risk losing freedoms on a scale that is perhaps unimaginable.

Given what you?ve written elsewhere, I?m guessing your presence here just about guarantees this.  :)

No doubt some scenarios bent towards engendering the successful inauguration of "real democracy" into our current *ecosystems of corruption* will bring the men in black suburbans to knocking on our doors. I don?t currently lose sleep over this because I think our overall lack of success has kept us securely in the "benign threat" file. Though I hope we can change this soon.

Yes. My own fantasy is to summon *Big Sister* in order to keep an eye on *Big Brother*. Perhaps the precursor of this could be seen this past weekend wearing a hundred thousand pink hats. One must remain imaginative and hopeful?no?

I?m still reading your "Ethical ID? paper. I?m a bit slow on the uptake when encountering new ideas such as this?and it?s rather long (that?s not a criticism). I think you adequately covered the basic idea though in your other paper that describes a fictional prelude to the potential future success this digital technology may realize. 

Related to this I found myself wondering if maybe Elon read your paper prior to coming up with his suggestion for a ubiquitous counter to the AI threat through the development of a neural lace. That would be quite a feather in your hat, heh. If not, you could just resort to the adage that "great minds think alike". :)

> And here's the first example of how that democracy would manifest.

(Big snip)

> I could ramble on for days. But you get the gist.

Yes. While the technological details are currently beyond my ability to fully comprehend, I do though get the gist. I?m impressed and heartened by both by the depth of your proposal as well as the clarity with which you present it.

> I am deeply committed to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a rational democratic debating process.

As you may have gathered from my previous contributions here, my own instinct has been to design and develop a global *platform for proposal* whereby projects such as the one you are proposing to could be presented, discussed, accepted, and potentially supported. Though I?ve been working on this for many years, with as much passion as I imagine you have in conjured in mustering you own, I am not tied to the details of how a *real democracy* might come about. 

I am encouraged by the variety of individual efforts emerging here and there and find myself wanting to bind them together into some cohesive and collaborative organism. The world is in such great flux these days I find myself wondering if maybe all it would take is for "a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens? to turn things around. Such widespread *Chaos equals Opportunity* right? 

Personally, I?m continually looking for individual trim tabs or leverage points. That said, I am convinced that unless we do this *together*, we?re simply blowing into a wind of ideas that will never find a (collective) soil in which to fully root and grow. 

> I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side of the struggle, please step forward?

I?m in, (albeit with some ideas of my own). Please carry on?..  

As together we choose,

Steve

you might regret asking that. I was challenged by "The Prof" in 2007, 
over my support for Democracy. He made a cogent argument against 
democracy based on the notion that we're not sufficiently "equal" 
(chiefly in a cognitive sense) to allow democracy to work. In reply I 
laid out the most detailed case for and defense of Democracy I've so far 
attempted. In particular I took the arguments for Meritocracy head on. 
And, in the process published my first attempt at a democratic debating 
algorithm and outlining how the web is obvious platform for the 
democratic debate (your "Platform for Proposal"). There is even in a 
link back to "Metascore" in there somewhere, which shows how long I've 
been lurking on this group.

Its a forum discussion on my own website and I've "self certified" the 
entire forum (its a partial obstacle to automated state snooping) so as 
you enter you'll be confronted with the terrifying warning that you are 
entering the dangerous territory of an unvalidated certificate. If 
you're prepared to take your life in your own hands, and risk trusting 
me, then add the site as a "Security Exception" and proceed. But don't 
expect to surface for a few hours. And get someone to check, from time 
to time, that you haven't fallen over backwards frothing at the mouth...

This will take you to the Prof's case. My reply follows immediately.
https://www.fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=170&p=868#p868

I did argue, in the early days of this group, that we should have set up 
a forum of our own, not just in which to conduct our discussions 
somewhat more scalably than this, but also as a testbed for debating 
algorithms like my own or any alternatives which may exist or are 
provoked by it.

I'd have to say I am disappointed that after all these years, we still 
haven't managed that much.

that's no joke. I was "identified" by MI6, as an "anarchist - but one we 
can do business with" back in the early 80s (a close relative was 
"Positively Vetted" for the role he was about to take up at GCHQ) so I'm 
under no illusion that I'm at least on a list somewhere, but 
(regrettably?) I'm equally sure they don't (yet) see me as a threat. It 
is fascinating to speculate what effect discussions like these will have 
on the junior spooks who may one day read these comments and ask 
themselves what the fuck kind of system they're working for that thinks 
this kind of prurience is justifiable.

funny you should say that, before I settled on "Trusted Surveillance" I 
was rooting around for more "comforting" titles for my proposed system. 
I was close to choosing "Little Sister" (even less threatening than Big 
Sister). But then I decided that I had to take that challenge head on as 
well. My wife bluntly pointed out that a name like "Trusted 
Surveillance" instantly attracted distrust. I agree. But that's how it 
should be. Anyone proposing the kind of surveillance shield I'm 
proposing should be obliged to prove every claim, in order to earn 
whatever trust it requires and if we're not prepared to describe and 
defend every relevant choice, then nobody should be stupid enough to 
trust it.

That, in a sense, is a clue to why
> Most of what I?ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated

because, since about a year after that forum post, I've had the 
opportunity to start building the system which might make the beginnings 
of the Trusted Surveillance system possible and I am utterly focussed on 
getting the logic and every resulting definition, algorithm, protocol 
etc completely consistent with my starting principles. It is an 
extremely ambitious project and, candidly, I don't think I've got what 
it takes to complete it. My hope is that I can at least get it started 
to the extent that others will be able to jump on board and keep it 
going. One of the consequences of this level of focus is the near 
destruction of all my other creative effort. Like I said before. It's a 
bandwidth problem.

ah, I can't claim credit for that. The cyborg notion is not far short of 
a century old! (I think I've even heard arguments that Frankenstein's 
monster was the first example of the meme, but I don't think it 
qualified) I was certainly reading multiple sci fi stories containing 
cyborgs or similar concepts back in the 60s.

I oscillate between deep despair and cautious optimism. A phenomenon 
like the election of Trump is an extremely powerful argument against 
democracy and in support of the views put forward by "The Prof". But I 
prefer to see it as the necessary shock that it will take to wake a 
critical mass of intelligent Americans (who I would estimate at about 
25% of their population) to the need for revolutionary change in the 
direction of real Democracy.. And if a group like ours could get its own 
act together, we might even be able to build the model they need, in 
time for them to come along and adopt it...

Subject: [MG] Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System
Message-ID: <83B3B7FB-FF32-482F-A103-5C2D54436218@stevecoffman.com>

In my struggle to understand what Michal ?t?p?nek has been trying to convey regarding his perspective of our efforts?or at least of mine, I decided to approach him *off-line* as I was becoming increasing frustrated (and somewhat embarrassed) at my inability to grasp what he was describing. This was partially due to some language barrier I suspect, but mostly due to my lack of understanding of the field/science of Systems Analysis, and likely as well (I think) to some reduced mental bandwidth issues on my part.  :)

That said, Michal very patiently continued and recommended I read the following link.

http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/

Here are some tantalizing excerpts:
From: Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System  

By Donella Meadows~

6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).

There was this subdivision of identical houses, the story goes, except that for some reason the electric meter in some of the houses was installed in the basement and in others it was installed in the front hall, where the residents could see it constantly, going round faster or slower as they used more or less electricity. With no other change, with identical prices, electricity consumption was 30 percent lower in the houses where the meter was in the front hall.

We systems-heads love that story because it?s an example of a high leverage point in the information structure of the system. It?s not a parameter adjustment, not a strengthening or weakening of an existing loop. It?s a NEW LOOP, delivering feedback to a place where it wasn?t going before.

A more recent example is the Toxic Release Inventory ? the U.S. government?s requirement, instituted in 1986, that every factory releasing hazardous air pollutants report those emissions publicly every year. Suddenly every community could find out precisely what was coming out of the smokestacks in town. There was no law against those emissions, no fines, no determination of ?safe? levels, just information. But by 1990 emissions dropped 40 percent. They?ve continued to go down since, not so much because of citizen outrage as because of corporate shame. One chemical company that found itself on the Top Ten Polluters list reduced its emissions by 90 percent, just to ?get off that list.?


Compelling feedback. Suppose taxpayers got to specify on their return forms what government services their tax payments must be spent on. (Radical democracy!) Suppose any town or company that puts a water intake pipe in a river had to put it immediately DOWNSTREAM from its own outflow pipe. Suppose any public or private official who made the decision to invest in a nuclear power plant got the waste from that plant stored on his/her lawn. Suppose (this is an old one) the politicians who declare war were required to spend that war in the front lines.
4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.

The most stunning thing living systems and some social systems can do is to change themselves utterly by creating whole new structures and behaviors. In biological systems that power is called evolution. In human economies it?s called technical advance or social revolution. In systems lingo it?s called self-organization.

Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list ? adding completely new physical structures, such as brains or wings or computers ? adding new negative or positive loops, or new rules. The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience. A system that can evolve can survive almost any change, by changing itself. The human immune system has the power to develop new responses to (some kinds of ) insults it has never before encountered. The human brain can take in new information and pop out completely new thoughts.

2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system ? its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters ? arises.

Another of Jay Forrester?s famous systems sayings goes: it doesn?t matter how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the minds of the society about what a ?fair? distribution of the tax load is. Whatever the rules say, by fair means or foul, by complications, cheating, exemptions or deductions, by constant sniping at the rules, actual tax payments will push right up against the accepted idea of ?fairness.?

The shared idea in the minds of society, the great big unstated assumptions ? unstated because unnecessary to state; everyone already knows them ? constitute that society?s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the world works. There is a difference between nouns and verbs. Money measures something real and has real meaning (therefore people who are paid less are literally worth less). Growth is good. Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purposes. Evolution stopped with the emergence of Homo sapiens. One can ?own? land. Those are just a few of the paradigmatic assumptions of our current culture, all of which have utterly dumfounded other cultures, who thought them not the least bit obvious.

The ancient Egyptians built pyramids because they believed in an afterlife. We build skyscrapers, because we believe that space in downtown cities is enormously valuable. (Except for blighted spaces, often near the skyscrapers, which we believe are worthless.) Whether it was Copernicus and Kepler showing that the earth is not the center of the universe, or Einstein hypothesizing that matter and energy are interchangeable, or Adam Smith postulating that the selfish actions of individual players in markets wonderfully accumulate to the common good, people who have managed to intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point that totally transforms systems.

You could say paradigms are harder to change than anything else about a system, and therefore this item should be lowest on the list, not second-to-highest. But there?s nothing physical or expensive or even slow in the process of paradigm change. In a single individual it can happen in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind, a falling of scales from eyes, a new way of seeing. Whole societies are another matter ? they resist challenges to their paradigm harder than they resist anything else.

So how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 <http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/#seven> has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don?t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.

Systems folks would say you change paradigms by modeling a system, which takes you outside the system and forces you to see it whole. We say that because our own paradigms have been changed that way.

A Final Caution

Back from the sublime to the ridiculous, from enlightenment to caveats. There is so much that has to be said to qualify this list. It is tentative and its order is slithery. There are exceptions to every item that can move it up or down the order of leverage. Having had the list percolating in my subconscious for years has not transformed me into a Superwoman. The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it ? that?s why societies have to rub out truly enlightened beings.

Magical leverage points are not easily accessible, even if we know where they are and which direction to push on them. There are no cheap tickets to mastery. You have to work hard at it, whether that means rigorously analyzing a system or rigorously casting off your own paradigms and throwing yourself into the humility of Not Knowing. In the end, it seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.


This helps a lot Michal. I imagine I'll be referring to this list for some time to come. Particularly # 1.  (if you never hear from me again...you?ll know why.)

Thanks so much,

Steve

email debate isn't scalable. Forum debates scale quite well.

they are also the obvious platform for formal democratic debates and we 
could use our own debates to test out the various algorithms which we'll 
need to develop to make the system work.

unfortunately that's exactly the kind of image which will fuel the 
authoritarian (and racist in this case) mysogynist.

One of the painful conclusions I have reached is that, unless you 
actually want fisticuffs and a shooting war, you have to find ways to 
make your opponents agree with you, not just bully or intimidate them 
(even if just with images) into submission. The problem is that the 
coercive strategy favoured by the authoritarians is much more effective, 
which is why, so often in human history, liberation movements have 
turned into tyrannies. It's so much easier. (That's a contributing 
motive to my Trusted Surveillance efforts - make the coercion 
permanently visible)

Only up to a point, and I'd argue that point is not more than a few
multiples of the email limit and still several orders of magnitude
smaller than would would be required to have even a locality-wide
debate on an issue where more than a few percent of the population
participates. And if you don't have at least a majority of the people
directly involved in making the decision, you've just reproduced
oligarchy ("government by the active participants"), not implemented
democracy.

Fortunately, little debate is actually required to make good
decisions. In fact if you have qualified and talented social engineers
writing the proposals, no debate at all should be required. Instead
the vastly simpler pro/con list (as implemented in proxyfor.me) will
be sufficient to ensure a good decisions since The People are merely
doing quality control at that point, not arguing about the details of
a proposal. To my mind the latter, and what you seem to be proposing,
is just "design by committee" which any engineer can tell you reliably
produces poor quality products.

Agreed, and it's not just authoritarians who will balk at one group
like this having control over the outcome out of proportion to their
numbers. With the exception of a small minority of social dominators
(the main leadership component of SDAPs) we *all* have an innate sense
of fairness that requires a much more egalitarian distribution of
input into the process.

Not just that, I believed we're actually instinctively programmed to
turn to authoritarian rule when decisions (and progress) don't get
made, especially when the group is under some sort of economic stress.
Which is of course why I find the consensus-oriented systems Ed and
others are insisting on so objectionable: They virtually *ensure*
authoritarian decisionmaking because *no* decision gets made
otherwise.

But you don't have to get everyone to agree, only to have a majority
not raise objections, a vastly lower hurdle. If people truly believe
that the decision reflects The Will of The People (which of course
applies to essentially zero of the decisions made by misrepresentative
democracy), they will follow the law with minimal coercion even if it
wasn't the one they preferred. But we're much less likely to follow an
authoritarian leader, especially if we didn't vote for that, which is
why coercion becomes so much more common (and necessary) when power is
all top-down.

    Scott

Besides the possibility that they "know enough to be afraid" a related
issue is the personality psychology of engineers and other technical
types: They tend to be highly authoritarian with a unusually large
predilection for prejudice and violence. For example they are vastly
over-represented among the ranks of Jihadis:

To the extend that by "elections" you mean selection of
representatives for the legislative branch, I agree. Elections for
executive branch positions are much less problematic, I think,
although still a suboptimal way to do it.

Sorry, I think you went off into the weeds here: If you think you need
to limit the tools and techniques the government uses I submit that
you've already failed because you've made one of two fundamental
errors:
1) You believe that it's reasonable (or perhaps inevitable) that the
government implements something other than "The Will of The People".
2) You believe in some sort of "inalienable rights" independent of
those the rest of us are wiling to grant you (the libertarian
position).

Laboring under either of these misconceptions simply renders any of
your proposals non-viable because even if you succeed in achieving any
short-term goal it will be at best a bandaid covering up a cancerous
mole. The only solution to bad government is to replace it with good
government. *That* is what we should be working on, not merely
applying patches to a vessel that we know will eventually sink us all
unless it's replaced. While we might argue about what "good
government" is, I think most of us here would agree that some sort of
more egalitarian system must be designed/built/implemented. Whether or
not that will result in "good government" or not is an empirical
question, but since we've never tried it before it's at the very least
an experiment worth doing. Unfortunately working on anything else is
not just a distraction, it's actually counterproductive because it
serves to legitimize the existing system and make people substantially
less willing to abandon it even when something better comes along
("Maybe if we just patch this one biggest leak we can make it across
the river one more time before we all drown!").

At least from what I'm reading, that's not exactly his argument. I
found his claims amazingly reminiscent of the recent Damore/Google
kerfuffle last year (12 years later), albeit that's about the
composition of the engineering population rather than the
decisionmaking population:
https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320

It's of course also the general position taken by Wade in "A
Troublesome Inheritance" a 2014 book that SJWs and PC pressure has
caused the "scientific community" to denounce even though few of them
have even read it and none of them have made any convincing case that
any of it is fundamentally incorrect (all the negative reviews I've
read of it focus on obscure technicalities, attempting to discredit
the overwhelming evidence that his main conclusions are correct by
pointing out a little bit of fuzz on his characterizations of the raw
data):
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Troublesome_Inheritance

The way I interpret it he's not exactly arguing against democracy or
even direct democracy, but only that different people are going to
have different roles in the system (which, BTW, is exactly what
proxyfor.me is designed to facilitate). You, on the other hand, seem
to be arguing the opposite (that it's *not* reasonable to make these
kinds of distinctions) without offering any proof that this is
necessary, desirable, or even achievable. IMHO differential
participation rates are inevitable and so no system that doesn't
account for this is even viable. Unfortunately this includes every
single system prior to proxyfor.me that I'm aware of with the possible
exception of the very earliest human decisionmaking system: Voting
with your feet or conspiring to eliminate a problematic individual in
your band, a system that worked for us for hundreds of thousands of
years prior to the development of agriculture (or more specifically,
the invention of money that can be used to purchase surplus goods).

And not to rain on your parade, but I'd say you're holding the wrong
end of the stick: All this paranoia about surveillance just tells me
that you're apparently looking at "the government" as an us vs. them
kind of thing, a perspective that's not only fundamentally backwards
but also all but guarantees that anything you come up with will be
unimplementable (why would the oligarchs give up any of their power if
you've already resigned yourself to the fact that they have the
power?). Worse, you've also squandered (or even misapplied) what
little intellectual and political capital you may have to bring to
bear on the issue making it even *more* difficult for anyone with an
actual solution to the problems of public policy decisionmaking to
succeed. IMHO widespread surveillance, even to the point of *complete*
surveillance, should be considered a good thing because it can be used
to solve so many problems with almost no downsides *provided* that The
People are the ones actually making the decisions as to how that data
is used (and by whom). Arguing against it is just arguing from a
position of fear and weakness: If you don't trust the government, your
problem is with the structure of government, not with the tools
they're using.

Scott, greetings,

some good and meaty, and some bizarre arguments you have in your 
response(s)
Probably take me a week to respond and right now I don't have that week 
available.

I'll also probably repost the whole thing onto my forum, a) because its 
a much better writing/quoting environment and b) because the whole 
argument - which looks like it could get quite interesting - will be 
more publicly available.

Will try to deal with it in the next couple of weeks but I'm actually at 
a crunch time for own development plans so they must take priority.

Apologies.

Harry

I look forward to seeing your categorization of my points.

I'm game. There's a similar forum at http://www.matchism.org/forum,
but it seems your forum went dormant around the same time as I started
working in this area. If you're really interested in public access it
might be better to use the matchism forum instead of www.fullmoon.nu
because matchism.org works with http instead of requiring using https
without a certificate (something most people won't do because of all
the scary warnings browsers bring up before you can get to your
forum).

Although as I said I'm actually more comfortable working via email and
believe it works fine for discussions of this type.

I can certainly relate to that: Since none of us are getting paid for
this and there isn't even any possibility of a big payoff at the end
(other than maybe the opportunity to become a martyr for the cause ;-)
it's a miracle that any of us make any progress at all. I would
recommend, however, using us as a "sanity check" on your plans before
going all-in on them. Sure you might get some troll-type criticism
that will just be a noisy waste of time to deal with. But it might
also save you from making huge blunders that you're simply blind to
because you're too close to the problem (like, creating a system
that's designed to merely restrict the government rather than to fix
what's actually broken in it).
