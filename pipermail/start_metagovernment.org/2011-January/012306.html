:<i>-)
</I>I am sorry, I don't get this.
You are suggesting that you cast votes from another application that
is then received by Vilfredo?

Because right now we don't have any API to make it happen.

What we were thinking was to create an API so people could create a
question on the fly from the outside, and Vilfredo would respond with
a URL (the address of the question).

So it was possible to have people automatically run questions from the
net. Having people vote, is harder, there is the whole issue of who is
who. Also right now there is no feed for questions. So we say in the
feed when a question has moved into a different phase, but we do not
automatically send in xml the answers. I suppose that it could be done
quite easily. Maybe even making an rss for each question. But again is
a matter of priorities, we have a long list of to do things, but if
any of you wants to come and mess around with the rss.php he is
welcome.

Speaking about using Vilfredo to brainstorm a name. It sounds good. We
had mixed results with V as a tool for brainstorming names. The name
vilfredo.org was chosen on vilfredo. But we could not give a name to
the type of society we want to build. Part of the problem is that V
works with open questions, and although &quot;what name should we give
to...&quot; is an open question, is also a question where there are not
many in between solutions. If some people like a name, and some other
like another name, it is hard to find a compromise between those
names. So I think it is great to brainstorm, and to find many possible
options, and filter out the options we don't want. But for the final
decision might need to be selected using Condorcet voting among the
winning alternatives, once the solutions are stable.


Cheers,
Pietro
