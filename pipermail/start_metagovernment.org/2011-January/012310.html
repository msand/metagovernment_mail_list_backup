This goes back to our earlier thread, regarding a vote-server state
feed?  I had a question about that:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-January/003407.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-January/003407.html</A>

Just to be sure: please don't code anything on the server side of
that, till we know there'll be a theatre client to consume it. (!)

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; BTW - Imagine casting Pareto votes in the theatre app!  We could

</I>
Think of a window that pops up in the theatre app.  (Conseo suggests a
floating AJAX window.)  That window is coded by Vilfredo.

It reminds me, we're finally working on the &quot;meta-tool&quot; that Thomas
evisioned: <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Meta-Tool">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Meta-Tool</A>

&gt;<i> Because right now we don't have any API to make it happen.
</I>
In a sense, you might have it already.  We can cast Vilfredo votes
from our browsers without logging in every time.  That alone might be
a sufficient &quot;API&quot; for your in-theatre voting window - or it might not
be.  But I bet it's 80% of it.

OTOH, maybe this is all premature, as Thomas suggests.
