Hi Alex,

Yes, of course.  But how soon do we need this?  It'll be easier to
document the design after we have a piece of it coded and running.  It
shouldn't take long, especially if we make it a priority.

We wrote lots of technical documentation last year, and we discussed
it in the mailing lists (Thomas and I).  I don't have the impression
that any of the project leaders are waiting for more.  On the other
hand, we're now close to demonstrating a cross-project capability in
the theatre app, here in Metagov.  It could add something new to the
picture, in particular by making it more visible and accessible to
non-technical users.

About pollwikis: they have nothing in common with Votorola's
vote-server (formerly &quot;pollserver&quot;) except in the history of their
development.  They are purely a cross-project facility intended for
the support of voters and other users, not vote-servers and their
admin staff.  They are wikis and as such are nothing but editable
content in the hands of their users.  However, that content is not
merely the documentation of something, as in Wikipedia, but rather it
is the thing itself.

What is that thing?  Some of us are trying to name it, or conjure up a
forward description of it, or frame its essence in some other fashion;
but we'll soon have the capability of actually demonstrating it (in
part).  Then we could document it for the technical people and the
project leaders.  We could use their help up front, but we don't
absolutely depend on it and realistically we can't expect it.  They're
too busy competing for the success of their projects, of course.  But
their projects are under the umbrella (if not the control) of the
cross-project facilities, which in turn are controlled by the users.
This much we can demonstrate.

Anyway, it's my fault for babbling obscurely about this stuff, when I
should have been coding.  There was no need to go on about pollwikis.
You're right to ask for an explanation.
