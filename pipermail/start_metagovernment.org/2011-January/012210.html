<PRE>I was contemplating &quot;anonymous polls&quot; today.  Let's say we have a
group of people that all knows and trust each other, 100 of them.

1 person decides there's an elephant in the room and asks a question.
It is hated by all and even though the group is tolerant they punish
him in some way, perhaps socially, for posing the poll.

What if he could pose it anonymously, then?  And everyone could chime
in anonymously?

Would this not be useful?  Perhaps in my example group anonymous polls
don't &quot;count&quot; and won't effect an outcome, but they could be useful
for gathering opinion.

&#8220;It&#8217;s no longer possible for a country to collapse in isolation. Now
we all collapse. &#160;The only path to stability is to equalize the
consumption rates of the first and developing world. Our dream is no
longer possible in the new world.&#8221; - Jared Diamond

&gt;<i> A few links and informations that I think might be useful to this community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all the movie UsNow.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.usnowfilm.com/">http://www.usnowfilm.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which although a few years old is still very recent in its concepts.
</I>&gt;<i> It presents a lot of concept we all know. But somehow hearing them
</I>&gt;<i> always gives you new intuition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In particular consider 3 things:
</I>&gt;<i> the soccer club where people vote which player should go in which position.
</I>&gt;<i> This is relevant to the kind of direct democracy where a lot of the
</I>&gt;<i> power is given to the citizen, but the only questions posed are closed
</I>&gt;<i> questions. The roles are defined. The players are listed, you can only
</I>&gt;<i> chose who plays where.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then the website zopa, that permit to single people to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> finances from other people. Instead of going through a bank. Sadly the
</I>&gt;<i> website has been stopped by Italian Bureaucracy, and you are not
</I>&gt;<i> allowed to use the Zopa of a country where you are not residing. But
</I>&gt;<i> for the nations where it is legal (like the UK) it seems to be working
</I>&gt;<i> great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The website the point:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.thepoint.com/">http://www.thepoint.com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> where people find other people to &quot;make things happen&quot;. In the UsNow
</I>&gt;<i> they advertise how you can use it to find other people to &quot;build a
</I>&gt;<i> railway&quot; (no kidding). In other words without hacking the government,
</I>&gt;<i> finding ways to do things that normally would only be done by the
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could use Zopa or The Point to build our tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there was an interesting article on blog.okcupid.com.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> okcupid is one of the biggest dating site, and they have hugs data,
</I>&gt;<i> and statistics. They use them to write interesting articles for their
</I>&gt;<i> blog with statistics that dwarf any statistics taken by any
</I>&gt;<i> university.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well in the latest article they analysed what kind of women get more
</I>&gt;<i> messages, and they found out that women that are liked by some guys
</I>&gt;<i> and not liked by others, receive more messages than women that are
</I>&gt;<i> liked by everybody.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-mathematics-of-beauty/">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-mathematics-of-beauty/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> You can find the whole article here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have always been a fan of simple ways for people to show their
</I>&gt;<i> appreciation, with the thumbs up more than the rating. Well, I am now
</I>&gt;<i> partially reconsidering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the fact of rating proposals in a multivalued way can give some
</I>&gt;<i> side effects that are independent of the average. Like finding out how
</I>&gt;<i> consistently are the proposal liked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Often the proposals that are liked by everybody are hardly
</I>&gt;<i> interesting, while the proposals that are very much liked by some and
</I>&gt;<i> very much hated by others are more interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I still don't know how this can be used to develop new proposals.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we could ask people who hate a proposal why they hate it.
</I>&gt;<i> Where as when a proposal is just warmly liked by everybody it might be
</I>&gt;<i> more an issue that it does not fit the bill, but not that it's wrong.
