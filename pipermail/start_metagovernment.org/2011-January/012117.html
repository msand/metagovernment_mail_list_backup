<PRE>Hi Conseo,

nice to have you back on board ! :-)

Even though I voted for &quot;open democracy&quot; all the time, also because it 
confronts people with the painful fact, that the democracy which they 
thought was open by its nature, actually is pretty closed ... I must 
admit that I also like &quot;Consensual democracy&quot; a lot. Because 
&quot;consensual&quot; describes in a positive way the main basic difference.

Cheers,
Thomas

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sorry for the late posting, I have been busy with my other project and 
</I>&gt;<i> am now back to development on Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> I have written a diff feed service for Votorola so far and am sorting 
</I>&gt;<i> that out so Mike can pull it from my repo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am definetly against using the term open. Open is even weaker than 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;free&quot; for people knowing the FOSS discussions and is a buzz word 
</I>&gt;<i> since the web 2.0 and social networking. If we really want to stick 
</I>&gt;<i> with open, we could use &quot;libre&quot; instead to give it at least a more 
</I>&gt;<i> international and distinct meaning.
</I>&gt;<i> But &quot;open&quot; is almost pointless and as it has been explained before it 
</I>&gt;<i> is actually redundant. Democracy implies some degree of 
</I>&gt;<i> openness/transparency. We should definitely brand the term democracy 
</I>&gt;<i> in a concrete way where we want to go. Having a look at the Metagov 
</I>&gt;<i> wiki I think we seem to have a consensus that consensus (synthesis) 
</I>&gt;<i> building is the way. So instead of simply using some technical term we 
</I>&gt;<i> should put this focus on socially reflected synthesis (as in hegelian) 
</I>&gt;<i> in it. We don't want to write simply another management tool, but what 
</I>&gt;<i> we want to do is to map social reflection and consensus building 
</I>&gt;<i> inside society as closely as possible, to get the most efficient (read 
</I>&gt;<i> reflected) decision and work processes.
</I>&gt;<i> My proposal therefore is to put that in front. &quot;Consensual democracy&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> for example. Democracy as implemented today is a very weak and 
</I>&gt;<i> crippled form of it actually and does not imply the principle of 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus building, although this is in reality the core strength of 
</I>&gt;<i> democracy (as it is also being pointed out on the Wiki) and not its 
</I>&gt;<i> weakness (as often wrongly argued). Still even the current form has 
</I>&gt;<i> always been advertised with its openness, so this would be nothing new 
</I>&gt;<i> then.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another possibility would be to use the term &quot;universal&quot; to imply that 
</I>&gt;<i> we hack a system that is not bound to the principle of states any 
</I>&gt;<i> more, but rather recognizes each subject as a member of a universal 
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process. I don't know if this is really a consensus here, 
</I>&gt;<i> though. One could of course always combine several attributes.
</I>&gt;<i>
