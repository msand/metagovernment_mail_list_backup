Yes, and today  learned a lot about GWT based on his cues and I can
understand why you want to do it this way.

In all, i was really just offering caution before going wild and crazy
with so many bells and whistles.  In no way was it meant to be a
critique of you or Conseo or your work; just a caution and a pointer
to massive work already done on feed processing that might be helpful.

This is all very self-serving, for me, and I'm aware of how and why;
you see, I am interested in returning to the Votorola app, at some
point sooner rather than later, to begin more work on
updating/creating-anew an interface that &quot;does communicative
assent/action&quot; and I realize that while I may not be able to help with
GWT coding of such a thing, if it did serve the purpose I would offer
to build some wild bells and whistles feed processing app, if that
would help us meet the prototype case you have, so we could also, as a
now larger group, look again at votorola and how y/our novel approach
will become whatever is next.
