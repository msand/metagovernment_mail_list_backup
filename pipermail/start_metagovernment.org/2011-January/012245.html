I think you guys are on the right track, if I understand.  We want to
move the machine to where people are.  That seems to be the
opportunity we're chasing.  In that sense we're politically driven.
So if Alex has a machine of his own, then we probably want to build a
bridge to it.  Because that's political too, and it'll attract people.
Right?

If there's a danger (just speaking generally), it might be in trying
to cover too great of a distance in a single trek, or in a single span
of the bridge.  We need to show meaningful progress at frequent
intervals or I think we'll lose people.  (Not that I see this as a
danger in what you suggest, in particular.)
