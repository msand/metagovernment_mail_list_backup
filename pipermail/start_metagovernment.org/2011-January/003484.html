<PRE>For those that read Italian,
we are going to run an event in Milan on the 15th of February.

We are planning to make it a bigger event than anything we did so far
(hopefully, if the social network gods will be with us).
We are also making some change in the code to accomodate for people to
vote anonymously, sharing a computer.
So we can have many people around each terminal.

We are also right now asking the metaquestion, to decide what question to ask.
The question is being asked here.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=106&amp;room=Milano15Febbraio">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=106&amp;room=Milano15Febbraio</A>

It will run quite rapidly with a maximum time of 2 days. We expect to
have an answer by generation 3.

If you understand italian and you want to participate in the
metaquestion, be our guest.

If you kind of understand (you can still use google translate to get
an idea of what the proposal are), and have an idea, you can tell it
to me, and I will translate it in italian and post it.

Cheers.
Pietro

</PRE>
