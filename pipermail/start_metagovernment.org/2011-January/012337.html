Great news, Pietro. This sounds like a really promising experiment.

&gt;<i> This event represent a test in so many ways:
</I>&gt;<i> we are testing if Vilfredo can be used by a group of people who are
</I>&gt;<i> all at the same time in a room.
</I>&gt;<i> We would be testing if Vilfredo can be used for more than 15 people.
</I>
THis sounds amazing. One of the shortcomings of Vilfredo as it is now  
built is its inability to incorporate discussions. It is fascinating  
to think of it in an environment where people can hold those  
discussions audibly, in person, in real time. I can imagine very fast  
evolutions of proposals. They can discuss not only why the disagree  
and/or what they agree on, but also they can easily help each other  
draft proposals that can attain consensus.

I have always thought physical meetings are an important component of  
collaborative governance, especially when it is centered around small  
geographic communities. It not only helps solidify the community, but  
it also helps empower/enfranchise those who do not have computers or  
who are not technologically sophisticated. This page is a remainder  
from the original Metagovernment draft:
