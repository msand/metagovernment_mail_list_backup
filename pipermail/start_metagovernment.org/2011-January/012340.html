Yes, I do. I appreciate your continued doggedness in trying to bring  
StratML to Metagovernment and in this case vice versa. I don't think  
there is any resistance to either idea within the project... it is  
just a very slow process by which we are coming to it. StratML seems  
like a great fit in the crossforum project, and I believe Michael et  
al have been on board with that.

Hello, Andre. I would encourage you to check out the Metagovernment  
project a little more. Our solutions are not about voting as an end in  
itself, but about opening participation at every level. Our projects  
are oriented toward building consensus, and that does not happen by  
asking people to vote yes/no on a few hot-button issues. Rather, we  
use voting as one tool which helps people find their differences and  
commonalities, and bring them to a point where voting is simply an  
acknowledgement of their agreement.
