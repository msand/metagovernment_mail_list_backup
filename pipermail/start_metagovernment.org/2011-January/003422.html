<PRE>A few links and informations that I think might be useful to this community.


First of all the movie UsNow.
<A HREF="http://www.usnowfilm.com/">http://www.usnowfilm.com/</A>


Which although a few years old is still very recent in its concepts.
It presents a lot of concept we all know. But somehow hearing them
always gives you new intuition.

In particular consider 3 things:
the soccer club where people vote which player should go in which position.
This is relevant to the kind of direct democracy where a lot of the
power is given to the citizen, but the only questions posed are closed
questions. The roles are defined. The players are listed, you can only
chose who plays where.

Then the website zopa, that permit to single people to ask for
finances from other people. Instead of going through a bank. Sadly the
website has been stopped by Italian Bureaucracy, and you are not
allowed to use the Zopa of a country where you are not residing. But
for the nations where it is legal (like the UK) it seems to be working
great.

The website the point:
<A HREF="http://www.thepoint.com/">http://www.thepoint.com/</A>
where people find other people to &quot;make things happen&quot;. In the UsNow
they advertise how you can use it to find other people to &quot;build a
railway&quot; (no kidding). In other words without hacking the government,
finding ways to do things that normally would only be done by the
government.

Maybe we could use Zopa or The Point to build our tools.


Then there was an interesting article on blog.okcupid.com.

okcupid is one of the biggest dating site, and they have hugs data,
and statistics. They use them to write interesting articles for their
blog with statistics that dwarf any statistics taken by any
university.

Well in the latest article they analysed what kind of women get more
messages, and they found out that women that are liked by some guys
and not liked by others, receive more messages than women that are
liked by everybody.

<A HREF="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-mathematics-of-beauty/">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-mathematics-of-beauty/</A>
You can find the whole article here.

I have always been a fan of simple ways for people to show their
appreciation, with the thumbs up more than the rating. Well, I am now
partially reconsidering.

Maybe the fact of rating proposals in a multivalued way can give some
side effects that are independent of the average. Like finding out how
consistently are the proposal liked.

Often the proposals that are liked by everybody are hardly
interesting, while the proposals that are very much liked by some and
very much hated by others are more interesting.

But I still don't know how this can be used to develop new proposals.
Maybe we could ask people who hate a proposal why they hate it.
Where as when a proposal is just warmly liked by everybody it might be
more an issue that it does not fit the bill, but not that it's wrong.
