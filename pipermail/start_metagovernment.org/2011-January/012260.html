I watched the video.  Spigit appears to be a tool for large business
firms.  It's designed to harvest ideas out of an extended workforce,
while simultaneously keeping the executives informed, in control and
on top of things.  Presumeably there is little need of transparency
for that, as Pietro notes.

</I>
You put it clearly.  There are no end of problems, solutions and
implementations in society.  Everywhere we find them in confusing
abundance.  Yet nowhere do we find the means of expressing what we
actually want - expressing our &quot;decisions&quot;, as you say.  That is
indeed the missing link.  Spigit contributes nothing to it - I think
you are right again - they leave it entirely to us.

Or did we miss something?  Could Spigit (even as it is) help us in
some way?

Cheers,
