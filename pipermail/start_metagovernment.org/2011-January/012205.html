&gt;<i> In Part 1, for example, the &lt;Identifier&gt; elements associated with other

</I>&gt;<i> unique referencing.&#160; Here are a couple examples:
</I>
&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A Google query in which OMB is discoverable via its GUID in three
</I>&gt;<i> different StratML files
</I>

I was considering this earlier, this exact issue of a unique ID for
each section of a document, when I wrote to you.  It's certainly an
important piece of the puzzle when looking for a comparison, say,
between mission and objectives between 2 separate organizations.


On the subject of Objectives, is how are versions for the plans
handled?  Is there one ID for the plan, and then another for the
version?  Are there also ways to list the previous versions?


&gt;<i> Applications and services can leverage the &lt;Identifier&gt;s to enable explicit
</I>&gt;<i> referencing in providing input and feedback on goals and objectives, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> by presenting renditions that have mailto links embedded and automatically
</I>&gt;<i> inserting the goal/objective name in the subject line and a link in the text
</I>&gt;<i> of the message.&#160; On the receiving end, applications can automatically route
</I>&gt;<i> input and feedback based upon the &lt;Identifier&gt;s of the goals/objectives to
</I>&gt;<i> which it pertains.
</I>
So, between a unique identifier for an objective and the
idintifier/contact information for the person/stakeholder responsible
for the objective you get a very specific Person to talk to.

Is there an expectation of a standard for a comment?  For example,
could a person that comments on the plan also be labelled with a
stakeholder role?  And is there going to be a GUID for the comment
itself?

&gt;<i> Applications and services can also:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Apply semantic analysis to the text of goal and objective
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Description&gt;s to identify those that are similar and/or may be
</I>&gt;<i> complementary and, thus, candidates for joint pursuit by potential
</I>&gt;<i> performance partners.
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leverage the &lt;Stakeholder&gt; element to provide value-added services
</I>&gt;<i> to particular groups of stakeholders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Support each of the other purposes of the standard:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Facilitate the sharing, referencing, indexing, discovery, linking,
</I>&gt;<i> reuse, and analyses of the elements of strategic plans, including goal and
</I>&gt;<i> objective statements as well as the names and descriptions of stakeholder
</I>&gt;<i> groups and any other content commonly included in strategic plans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Enable the concept of &quot;strategic alignment&quot; to be realized in literal
</I>&gt;<i> linkages among goal and objective statements (leveraging the &lt;Identifier&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> elements as well as the &lt;Relationship&gt; element of StratML Part 2) and all
</I>&gt;<i> other records created by organizations in the routine course of their
</I>&gt;<i> business processes.
</I>
When I asked about tracking comments and the makers of the comments it
seems like it might fit in here then.

I was the tech support for a lobby group for awhile.  We pushed a lot
of letter writing campaigns and a few times we wrote back to...the
FDA, I think,...to get a list of all the people who had commented
during a public comment period along with the text of what they wrote.
 I think it was all scanned or dumped from email.  it was messy.
Nevertheless, such a thing was available.  One of them has something
like 50,000 pieces in it.  Huge, and a tremendous amount of work for
whoever collated it.

How can StratML help with this kind of thing?  Is there going to be
markup for structural relationships, like government representatives,
senators, particular offices and titular roles, or is it always going
to be an email address?

I think part of why I'm asking is because part of the issue seems to
me to be supplying some form of interface for &quot;claiming&quot; which kind of
stakeholder you are when you write in to comment.  This helps the
information get to the right place/person, as well as insuring that
anyone who has real responsibility to a specific stakeholder can/does
fulfiill the obligation of their office and &quot;write back!&quot; to that
person.  Or, at least collect that feedback in some way so that the
reprinting of the 52,000 comments can be done more easily and more
regularly next time.  I can only imagine the huge cost of doing such a
thing currently.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Facilitate updating and maintenance of&#160; discrete elements of strategic
</I>&gt;<i> plans without requiring review and approval of the entire plan through
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucratic channels, thereby helping to make the strategic planning
</I>&gt;<i> process more agile and responsive to stakeholder feedback and changing
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances, thus helping to overcome the tendency of strategic plans to
</I>&gt;<i> become outdated &quot;shelfware&quot;.
</I>
Would this be something like breaking an objective and stakeholder
group &quot;out of the plan&quot; so that group could focus on that one
objective and then integrate it back into the over all plan?

So, is there, then, a way of doing &quot;versions&quot; and &quot;version dates&quot; for
each of the sections that receives a OMB/GUID?  What's the diff
between an OMB and a GUID, btw?

&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Work together to link their performance goals to key groups, including
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, businesses, and other governments, as well as internal Federal
</I>&gt;<i> Government operations;
</I>
When we say &quot;link&quot; here, what do we mean?  Putting up a &quot;tweet&quot; that
says a new plan has been published that effect &quot;citizens&quot; or is there
more detail to be had?

I think this goes back to feedback, again.  It's not just about
publishing the stuff, though that's a great start.  We need to get
feedback/new drafts into the process and adjust more quickly with more
input from broader groups.

When they say link what do they really mean?

&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Adopt open standards (e.g., StratML) enabling the organization and
</I>&gt;<i> categorization of Government information in a way that is searchable
</I>&gt;<i> electronically and interoperably across agencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since StratML Part 2 still needs to be finalized as an ANSI/AIIM standard,
</I>&gt;<i> we have not yet begun to consider Part 3.
</I>
Can you say more about ANSI/AIIM?  I'm not familiar with that.  What
should eDemocracy projects know about ANSI/AIIM?  How could that help
us to bring our tools to bear on these deliverables?

However, whereas we have kept
&gt;<i> Parts 1 &amp; 2 as simple as possible, in Part 3 we will be free to begin to
</I>&gt;<i> take on more complexity and, thus, more risk of failure as well as more
</I>&gt;<i> potential for gain.&#160; Some preliminary candidates for inclusion in Part 3 are
</I>&gt;<i> outlined at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>
</I>
Geospatial referencing of organizations, goals, objectives, and stakeholders
Gannon Dick's thoughts on &quot;encoded resources&quot; (e.g., country codes),
February 7, 2010

Good stuff.  This is the kind of metadata we are working on for the
crossforum app now.

Citation of relevant legal or other authorities

I think I saw that citations are already included in some form, now,
yes?  This helps to further contextualize a strategy plan, then, and
also to publish &quot;what we think we know about what law governs this
plan&quot; kind of thing?

Categorization of goals and objectives based upon various taxonomies,
This is interesting.  These are all linked on the page at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A> .  I recommend folks take a
look at these.  Structured taxonomies are important when we have
hugely generalized facilities like stratml.  All of our Metagov
projects are generalized.  We could have a process for introducing
these structured schemas and linking them to our projects.

Note: StratML Part 2 includes the Relationship element as a child of
PerformanceIndicator to enable users to link inputs, processes,
outputs, and outcomes to each other in the ValueChain, if they wish
Point of contact elements as children of the Stakeholder element to
enable automated transmission of input and feedback to designated
points of contact for each Goal and Objective
Personal attributes of individuals and groups of Stakeholders
Version control at the element level, perhaps by applying a time/date
element or attribute

This is quite powerful.  This is one way that the product of
government funding can end up back in the hands of the people who paid
for the work in the first place.

Referencing of &lt;Project&gt;s and &lt;Program&gt;s.
See, for example, Project Management XML Schema (PMXML)
Also interesting at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Program">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Program</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As AIIM&#8217;s StratML Committee &#160;begins to consider Part 3, I hope that you and
</I>&gt;<i> others will participate in helping to identify and specify additional
</I>&gt;<i> elements and attributes that can add the greatest value, including support
</I>&gt;<i> for the kind of interactivity that is required to make strategic and
</I>&gt;<i> performance plans more meaningful to and productive for stakeholders.
</I>
Well, I know for myself, at least, that StraML is more comprehensive
than I can fully encompass at the moment as far as structured data is
concerned.  My research into applying StratML at the local level
showed me that most organizations are still struggling with thee
basics of what must have been version 1 of the specification, and that
includes myself!

That said, I think that we have 2 sides of a coin here.  Most of the
metagov projects are concerned with methods for deliberation online,
and a strategy document is the product of such a deliberation.  I go a
step further and say also that the product needs go back and inform
the method to the extent to which that is possible, and hence the
progress in identifying ways in which StratML can be integrated into
the way we write positions and strategies and format, from the very
beginning, a proposal that is to be deliberated.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Owen,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if you could give us some detail about the interactive
</I>&gt;<i> features of StratML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of the Metagov projects are focused on the interaction between
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders of various types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I asked you a similar question about the newest and latest version of
</I>&gt;<i> StratML that was just being approved, v2? &#160;and I didn't really understand
</I>&gt;<i> what you had planned for interaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been considering the next steps in documenting the options that
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola users have. &#160;As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in
</I>&gt;<i> doing additional work to format the positions that are used in Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> which might be considered a strategic plan, in many cases. &#160;I have explored
</I>&gt;<i> the MediaWiki semantic wiki options and seen some possibilities for
</I>&gt;<i> exporting the positions in XML, which is neat, too. &#160;Over time I expect to
</I>&gt;<i> make more process, but in the mean time I wanted to ask you to inform us on
</I>&gt;<i> what you are looking to support for commenting and feedback in StratML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several criteria that make Votorola special and near and dear to
</I>&gt;<i> my heart and of course the bulk of this is due to Michael's deep study into
</I>&gt;<i> the theory of communication and interaction, and how stuff gets done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I mull over how to write this down in some way I was wondering what
</I>&gt;<i> process you have in your mind for how Strategic Plans become a &quot;focus point&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> for community and stakeholder action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does one or more of the MetaGov projects come closer to what you have in
</I>&gt;<i> mind?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine that you must be frustrated, sometimes, with the machine
</I>&gt;<i> readability of the software here :) &#160;In working with Michael the last year I
</I>&gt;<i> have seen how much thought he is putting into his coding work, and I am sure
</I>&gt;<i> the same is true for everyone else as well. &#160;I think it'll come sooner
</I>&gt;<i> rather than later, and we are still working on prototyping the basic
</I>&gt;<i> services before we implement a data standard for the positions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, how will stakeholders interact around a StratML plan in this and later
</I>&gt;<i> versions? &#160;Will they be commenting on particular objectives? &#160;Contacting
</I>&gt;<i> particular stakeholders? &#160;Are you planning on offering some form of
</I>&gt;<i> notification standard that delivers comments on a plan back to the public as
</I>&gt;<i> well, so that these comments can then be seen by others? &#160;Will there be a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for notifications, so that stakeholders can receive
</I>&gt;<i> notifications of comments on their or other objectives?
