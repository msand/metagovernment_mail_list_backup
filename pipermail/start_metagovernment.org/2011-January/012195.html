<PRE>&gt;<i> Also, Michael, do you actually want to be such an admin? (As opposed
</I>&gt;<i> to not being an admin, or being an admin of only one section.) If
</I>&gt;<i> so, all I need from you is for you to create an account on tux at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/subscribe">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/subscribe</A>
</I>
Thanks Ed, I've registered as &quot;mcallan&quot;.  I'm not familiar with the
admin sections there, but in order to set up crossforum theatre, I'd
need control of two Web directories:

  /_/votorola.Crossforum/
  /crossforum/

They could be placed anywhere.  If they're placed at the root, then the
launch URL would be: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/</A>

Another facility that's needed (I should mention) is a pollwiki.  It's
a common database for cross-project applications.  I mention it
because the theatre app won't work without it.  Also because it's a
prominent end-user facility.  For these reasons, we might want to host
it here under Metagov.  I agree with Thomas (if he doesn't mind me
repeating) that Metagov is the best place for doing cross-project
stuff.

If we decide to host it here, then it could also serve as the wiki for
ordinary Metagov content.  (In the meantime, we can continue to use my
own pollwiki as the database.)  About pollwikis:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki</A>

&gt;<i> If any other active list members would like to assist in administering  
</I>&gt;<i> the site at a full or limited level (i.e. admining one section such as  
</I>&gt;<i> creating a blog or bulletin board), please say so on-list, and see if  
</I>&gt;<i> anyone else objects.
</I>
If someone with admin skills were to set up a vanilla install of
Semantic MediaWiki on the tuxfamily site (assuming the pollwiki's a go
with you guys) then that would be a great help.  Myself, I'd only need
to be made a Sysop of the wiki, and I could do the rest.
