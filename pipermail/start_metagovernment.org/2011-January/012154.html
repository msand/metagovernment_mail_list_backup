<PRE>Hello everybody,
I am back.
I saw a lot of email exchanges.

I am also ok with Michael Allen.

One thing that came to me was that I wished that no one, not Michael,
not me, not Ed, just no single person had the power to destroy the
whole project.

It would be interesting to set up a system where an action (let's say,
an email get sent, which then could trigger a number of other actions)
only when everybody inside a group, (or at least n people out of a
group, or at least ... but considering that this person counts
more...) agrees on it.

Think about this simple tool. You set up an online system, you set up
what the action would be, and you program the rules. In the most basic
form when one calls for the action to be taken, then the system would
automatically contact the other users. If they agree too (clicking on
a specific unique link), then the system sends the email. And if
necessary also adds the signature of the people that have agreed. I
have seen many such systems in one form or another around the
internet. But always only as a part of a bigger system. For example to
destroy a question in stackoverflow you need so many votes by users
who each has at least a karma of...

But no system seem to be general enough that anyone can just set it up.

Cheers,
Pietro
