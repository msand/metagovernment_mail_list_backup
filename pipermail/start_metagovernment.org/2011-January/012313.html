<PRE>Hello Alexander,

I agree with what you wrote.

&gt;<i> I still cannot grasp how
</I>&gt;<i> it might be possible to unify the results of different approaches from
</I>&gt;<i> different voting tools.
</I>&gt;<i> Nevertheless, if the crossforum theater succeeds, everyone will benefit from
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Like you say: it is a top-down integration, where the theatre starts as 
an overview from the top. Top-down or somehow also: abstract-concrete.

We just start with the lowest common denominator of all e-dem-tools. 
This dont even need to be results yet, but information like: subject X 
is being worked on here in place Y with an activity Z. Actually it 
doesnt even need to be e-dem: like we talked in the other thread it 
could be information about political demonstrations, ...

Now, if results appear out of e-dem-tools, the lowest common denominator 
would be to just display them side by side. For some this is maybe 
already the deepest possible integration into the theatre. But thats 
fine and still of benefit for everyone.

But for others it will go down very deep, e.g. users might be identified 
across different tools and in case they voted in two or more, the counts 
could be revised and therefore unified for these tools. The deepest I 
can imagine, would be: a delegate from one tool voting with all his 
votes in another tool. But I guess, thats too far out for now.

Thomas
