<PRE>What I can do in advance is done.  The default base layer is now
configurable: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/config.js">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/config.js</A>
I set it to Osmarender OSM, as suggested by Conseo.

  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumG">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumG</A>
  (you may need to hit refresh, to clear your cache)

Also the user's choice is now persistent.  So use the (+) control at
top right to select your favourite map rendering, and (if you have
cookies enabled) the browser will remember it.

If there are any problems, please let me know,

</I>&gt;<i> A couple of things I can do in advance: I can make the default
</I>&gt;<i> rendering (Google or Mapnik or whatever) a config option for admins.
</I>&gt;<i> I can also make the user's runtime choice (the rendering you see by
</I>&gt;<i> default) persistent through cookies.  These changes should be easy
</I>&gt;<i> enough to code.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Later, I'll allow the admin to remove map renderings from the choice
</I>&gt;<i> list entirely.  So he could scratch Google if he needed to.  This is
</I>&gt;<i> slightly more difficult.  I'll put this off till we decide we
</I>&gt;<i> definitely need it (or someone else codes it - that's cool).

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; having discussed with Mike about the usage of Google services in Crossforum, I 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have had a look at the terms of usage directly linked on the Google mapper on 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Crossforum:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.google.com/intl/de-DE_US/help/terms_maps.html">http://www.google.com/intl/de-DE_US/help/terms_maps.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Appropriate Conduct; Compliance with Law and Google Policies.  You agree 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you are responsible for your own conduct and content  while using the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Products, and for any consequences thereof. You agree to  use the Products 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only for purposes that are legal, proper and in  accordance with the Terms and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any applicable policies or guidelines  Google may make available. By way of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; example, and not as a limitation,  you agree that when using the Products or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the Content, you will not:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the  legal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (b) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; inappropriate, defamatory, obscene, or unlawful content;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (c) upload, post, transmit or otherwise make available any content that  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infringes any patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or other  proprietary 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; right of any party, unless you are the owner of the rights,  or have the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; permission of the owner or other legal justification to use  such content;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (d) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available messages  that 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; promote pyramid schemes, chain letters, or disruptive commercial  messages or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; advertisements;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available any other  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; content, message, or communication prohibited by applicable law, the  Terms or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any applicable Product policies or guidelines;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (f) download any file posted by another that you know, or reasonably should 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (g) impersonate another person or entity, or falsify or delete any  author 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; attributions or proprietary designations or labels of the origin  or source of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Content, software or other material;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (h) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Products or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Google services;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (i) interfere with or disrupt Google services or servers or networks  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connected to Google services, or disobey any requirements, procedures,  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policies or regulations of networks connected to Google services;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (j) use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other  device 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to retrieve or index any portion of the Google services or  Content, or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; collect information about users for any unauthorized  purpose;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (k) submit content that falsely expresses or implies that such content is 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sponsored or endorsed by Google;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (l) create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pretenses;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (m) promote or provide instructional information about illegal activities;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (n) promote physical harm or injury against any group or individual; or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (o) transmit any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, or any items of a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; destructive nature.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. Additional Terms for Google Earth.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) Export Restrictions. The Google Earth software is subject to United  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; States export controls. By using the Google Earth software, you agree to  use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the software only for purposes that are legal, proper and in  accordance with 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; these Terms. Specifically, you agree to comply with all  applicable export and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reexport control laws and regulations, including  the Export Administration 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regulations (&quot;EAR&quot;)  maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and trade 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and economic  sanctions maintained by the Treasury Department's Office of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Foreign  Assets Control.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This locks us seriously in and makes us more than vulnarable to legal attacks 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or restricting the service in a situation of conflict. There is no way to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ensure that we cannot be attacked by that broad terms when we provide an 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; international service (Crossforum).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I propose that we avoid using proprietary web services for our infrastructure 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; completely and make them opt-in if(!) there is no similar free replacement. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This also ensures that we can bend our solutions to our liking later-on by 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hacking upstream. Single vote server projects embedded in the network of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; course can still decide on their own, but we don't need it in Crossforum or 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any of the common network infrastructure imo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What do you think? Do you want to have Google services available and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if so for which concrete use cases?
