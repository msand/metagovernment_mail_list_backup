<PRE>Hi Alex,

Pointing it out is really helpful! I haven't taken it personal and it is 
really important to build a consensus on the best way in my opinion. If the 
reasoning is unclear, please ask! I also really don't want to identify with 
Votorola/my implementation since this can get in the way of a proper approach.
Even if Drupal does not satisfy the perspective of Crossforum in the first 
place it is really important to get the best overview and build a common 
ground on how we approach Crossforum best and where we might have a look then. 
We might also want to document that on the Wiki?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is all very self-serving, for me, and I'm aware of how and why;

</I>&gt;<i> now larger group, look again at votorola and how y/our novel approach
</I>&gt;<i> will become whatever is next.
</I>
Good to hear that you think our approach is legitimate. In fact I think your 
ideas about plugging in Drupal is worth investigating. If we can reuse their 
visualization or even only define an interface for Drupal to pull data from 
Bite-services and poll-servers this would be very valuable, so if you really 
want to help us a bit you could write the necessary parsing for Drupal's feeds 
to understand our JSON. It shouldn't be a lot of work and can be done over 
time, I guess, but will be very valuable in demonstrating a rich 
represantation of the data like they do in your proposal: 
<A HREF="http://afghanistanelectiondata.org/election/2009/data/">http://afghanistanelectiondata.org/election/2009/data/</A>
Is the software behind this site completely open? 
It would also prove that we really implement &quot;cross&quot;-forum in a very nice 
example.

Conseo
