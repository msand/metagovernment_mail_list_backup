<PRE>Hi Ed,

Thanks for your comment and invitation. I do appreciate what 
Metagovernment is working on and I absolutely respect democracy and the 
importance of voting.  I especially took care to add on top of my 
message, the sentence: &quot;As it seems that other contributors to this 
thread have also been doing.&quot;  And I do mean it.

Especially the statistics that said that:

&quot;If 2% votes &quot;yes&quot; and 1% votes &quot;no&quot;, it will be resolved in 700 days.
If a single person proposes and votes for a suggestion, and it doesn't
attract any mote attention, it will be resolved in about 20.000 years.
(Plenty of time for at least 1 person to find it and vote against it.)&quot;

Did bring some historical memories, and I felt that highlighting them 
could help show the role and importance of StratML as well as the 
responsibility and accountability processes.

My comment was in no way against the major efforts that are on going and 
that we all need to continue together.  In that sense, please tell me 
how I can effectively contribute in any way.  Please allow me to also 
note that for decades already, we have been developing distributed 
collaboration support tools and platforms, including our knowledge 
resource entitlement, modeling, management, and sharing DNAOS 
thechnology, that we are currently using to support StratML applications.

Just for fun, I will add that many years already, realizing the 
importance of the design of our DNAOS knowledge resource entitlement 
technology, we have been trying (e.g. working, paying, opening-up our 
IP) to contribute to new knowledge sharing and management standards 
(e.g. OMG) that could really enable a knowledge and information economy, 
for generations to come, and have been systematically out-voted by all 
the IT majors (and governments that base their IT decisions on advices 
from IT majors), as they are doing very good business in the current 
mayhem, apart from being afraid of a leveled playing field.  They all 
each still hope to &quot;win&quot; and that everyone will adopt their 
(ill-defined) ways.  Still we are not too worried about that, as indeed 
it could take more than 20000 years before Google adopts Microsoft's 
ways or IBM, Oracle's, or vice versa.

In the mean time many are suffering, and as the industrial economy is 
saturating, and not providing the required wealth and growth anymore, if 
a proper knowledge economy is not available, the only option left may be 
a global reboot of the industrial age, through a big war.

But, we are out-voted, out-financed, and the &quot;majority&quot; wins.

Thank you also for the reference and I will at least keep myself posted 
on the Metagovernment project.

Regards,
Andre

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ed, that might be a good way to increase the visibility of the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, I do. I appreciate your continued doggedness in trying to bring
