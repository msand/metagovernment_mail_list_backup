<PRE>Hi everybody,

(I haven't been active for a while, because I changed my pc from Windows 
XP to Linux/Ubuntu. What an adventure! Right now I feel, it was very 
much worth the effort. But in between I had some really doubtful 
moments! LOL ...)

Wow, so much happend on the list in the meantime.

Welcome Alex, good to see you here!

I agree, that would be really really helpful!
And additionally I believe it also would be very helpful to demonstrate 
the tools to new people, i.e. really use them together. Isn't it always 
best to do both: Explain *and* show how something works?

For a start for the explanatory part of the crossforum theatre I drafted 
a use case scenario in our wiki here:

Since you have experiences with Power Point, ... would this be a good 
way to start?

Best, Thomas
