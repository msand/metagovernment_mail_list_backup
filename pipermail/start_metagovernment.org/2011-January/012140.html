 You are right, but Freenode expects you to fill in a personal contact
 for official channels (starting with #). Have a look here:
 <A HREF="http://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/">http://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/</A>
 Maybe you could register the official data and I can figure out how
 to be the op, if you are not really into this?

 I guess you mean a chatlog? There should be a bot which you can setup
 for this. Or do you mean a transcript for official meetings in there?
 I guess the possibilities are almost unlimited with irc, we should 
 therefore
 clearly define what is supposed to be discussed there to not get lost.
 For me it would be an easy entry point for outsiders who want to get
 in touch for the first time or for questions that are not worth mailing
 to the list.
 We want to have serious discussion happen on the list imo, as
 Mike has pointed out to me yesterday. A mailing list results in an
 archive which can easily be searched to find answers to problems, while
 a chatlog might be difficult here. It also forces people in clearly
 documenting their situation and setup.

 Cheers,
 conseo
