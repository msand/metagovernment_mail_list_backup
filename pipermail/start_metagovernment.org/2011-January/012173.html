<PRE>I recently posted a question to that effect as a Slashdot submission.  
It got modded down to purple (second to lowest priority) meaning it  
had little change of making it onto the main site.

Then I submitted it again (anonymously this time), and took out  
references to collaborative governance, making it just an IT question  
about the power of admins (though it does link to the DAN page I  
recently created). That question is modded up to red (highest  
priority). There is a pretty good chance it will show up on Slashdot  
sometime today or tomorrow. Maybe.

You can see that submission here:
<A HREF="http://slashdot.org/submission/1438118/Disempowering-the-singular-sysadmin">http://slashdot.org/submission/1438118/Disempowering-the-singular-sysadmin</A>
and clicking the + sign next to the title will help mod it higher.

As to whether or not it shows up on the main page is anyone's guess.  
But keep an eye on slashdot.org to see if it does. This particular  
question is one where Slashdot can be genuinely helpful.
