Maybe a general &quot;gab feed&quot; is needed?  I imagine it would work like
this:

 1. Aggregate all poll-related discussions
 2. Feed them into theatre app
 3. Project them onto map

It's similar to the diff feed in this regard, but it casts a wider net
and captures more posts.  For instance, here are the data for a single
post captured and formalized in a gab feed:

 a) Post URL:

    <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-December/003304.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-December/003304.html</A>

 b) Short tweet-like summary of the post:

    The seemingly-endless Vilfredo question about the name of this
    thing we're doing reached the 16th generation.

 c) Poll ID - in this case it's reverse-mapped from
    <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53</A> :

    G/p/osd

 d) User ID:

    Epastore-MetagovernmentOrg

The feed might then proceed to capture all sub-posts that do not
explicitly alter the issue by reference to another.  Or maybe only
those that embed an actual reference.  (Not sure which is better.)

This will work with Vifredo-based discussions without requiring any
modification to Vilfredo.  It will also work with Votorola-based
discussions.  Others too, if we wanted to cast the net more widely.

Is this what's needed (at least at the moment)?

</I>
Working on something like a &quot;gab feed&quot; would give us an immediately
practical reason to document the underlying wiring as a
proto-standard.  I agree with Conseo, it's better to have a reference
implementation on the go when documenting this kind of stuff.  Both
the proto-standard and the implementation ought to be backed by an
actual proto-federation.
