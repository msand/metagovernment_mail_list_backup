<PRE>Hi,

having said that about spigit in the other thread, we have a much more 
intesting use case and potential going on at the moment. With the serious 
struggle of political power and the revolutionary situation in Tunesia, we 
might try to find users there.

I have already read that many Tunesians asked for open government alternatives 
on Twitter and they are very happy with the help from groups like Anonymous to 
open up their communicative medium (the internet). The Tunesian goverment has 
already had to react and open up both the political landscape to forbidden 
parties and the web for freedom of speech and they still cannot surpress the 
revolution. Yet the Tunesians currently struggle to organize alternatives for 
their government. This is not a single shot, but an ongoing struggle in most 
arabic and islamic countries atm, so we don't even have to be ready to support 
them now, but can help them find solutions and build our infrastructure up on 
the way. In fact the reasons behind their action is the very high unemployment 
rate and the serious increase in poverty, which we might be able to tackle 
when we allow them to organize their own consensus-driven economical 
structures.

I would like to try to reach interested groups in Tunesia to pull them in our 
projects and forums to help them organize themselves. They give a very 
interesting playground for our ideas. What do you think?

conseo
