Maybe we should give them free-range drafting.  You know what I mean?
Then we'd have these facilities:

  (a) Free-range drafting - Enabling us to continue working from the
      Metagov wiki as is.  (new, 2 days work)

  (b) Difference bridge - Tying together our draft-work in the wiki
      and our discussions in the mailing list.

  (c) Vote-server - Structuring the discussion/drafting cells, keeping
      them to human scales.  Exposing the shape of the emerging
      consensus or dissensus.

That would be the state-of-the-art (so far as I know) in light touch
tool support.  Being light touch, it would help to clarify how the
vote-server (c) interconnects with the other essential facilities, and
what it might take to factor it out - as in Thomas's &quot;meta-tool&quot;, or
Ed's &quot;voting skin&quot; - as a user preference. [1]

So the dogfood we'd be eating (as Ed says) would be pretty much
cross-project right from the start.  All we'd need is to improve on
it.  Are you guys OK with this?  It shouldn't take longer than a day
or two to code what's needed.

Conseo?  It might seem a bit of a distraction from our work, but I
think it would help us both to get our hands on the tools, especially
at this stage.  (I should mention that Conseo has a lot on his plate.
He's been learning Java in order to help with the coding.)


[1] In that sense, it ties to social mapping in the theatre app.
