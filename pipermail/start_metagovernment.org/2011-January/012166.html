<PRE>Kris,
I was quoting ( <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic</A> ) Jackie's question:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=53</A>

</I>&gt;<i> -----Original Message-----
</I>&gt;<i> From: Pietro Speroni di Fenizio
</I>&gt;<i> Sent: &#160;08/01/2011 2.41.17 pm
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: &#160;[MG] The problem with &quot;The name of the beast&quot; question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think I found out what was wrong with Jackie's question: is there a
</I>&gt;<i> better phrase than 'open source democracy'?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I came to the conclusion that part of the reason why we have such
</I>&gt;<i> a difficulty in reaching a synthesis is for the way the question is
</I>&gt;<i> posed. Maybe in future we should have some guidelines on how to pose
</I>&gt;<i> questions that can be solved. What happens if not, and maybe even how
</I>&gt;<i> to flag a question that does not follow this standards. For example
</I>&gt;<i> closed questions usually end with the proposal: &quot;this is a closed
</I>&gt;<i> question, please rewrite and repost in a different format&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now Jackies question is actually two questions; read:
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Many phrases have been thrown around -- direct democracy, open source
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, online democracy, eGov, etc. Perhaps some of these are too
</I>&gt;<i> specific, others seem to refer to other goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> THIS IS A TWO-PART QUESTION:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What is the most best (most descriptive, most comprehensive, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> phrase to describe the goals of online community governance in a
</I>&gt;<i> democratic framework?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) And what are the criteria for the ideal phrase?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note: please propose answers to *both* questions, as separate
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. These are asked together so that the generations are
</I>&gt;<i> coupled, and so that the currently agreed-upon criteria are visible as
</I>&gt;<i> people propose new answers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> FIrst she says that it is a two part questions. And then she specifies
</I>&gt;<i> the two questions, and asks to answer them as separate proposals. Now
</I>&gt;<i> this is EXACTLY what people have been doing. After about 10
</I>&gt;<i> generations we ended up with two winning proposals. One that was an
</I>&gt;<i> answer to the first question:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question 1) What is the most best (most descriptive, most
</I>&gt;<i> comprehensive, etc) phrase to describe the goals of online community
</I>&gt;<i> governance in a democratic framework?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Answer 1) Open Democracy Here I copied a list of forms of government
</I>&gt;<i> (Source: Wikipedia). A properly defined name for &quot;open source
</I>&gt;<i> governance&quot; shall fit ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question 2) And what are the criteria for the ideal phrase?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Answer 2) Criteria For The Ideal Phrase The ideal phrase would find a
</I>&gt;<i> good balance between the following attributes: - accuracy - clarity -
</I>&gt;<i> brevity - descriptiveness - uniqueness of meaning...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, the only problem is that not every body voted for both proposals,
</I>&gt;<i> which meant that the system never claimed that we have reached a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In a normal vilfredo question, someone that does not vote, has no
</I>&gt;<i> weight. You either suggest something (in which case you can at least
</I>&gt;<i> vote your suggestion), or you vote what other suggested. And the
</I>&gt;<i> consensus is among people who voted. But being this two questions
</I>&gt;<i> connected together the system assumed you have voted for each, when
</I>&gt;<i> you just gave your preferences for one. To have a Vilfredo System
</I>&gt;<i> handle multiple connected question it would require that:
</I>&gt;<i> -to move from the proposal to the voting stage there are at least 2
</I>&gt;<i> proposal for each question (and at least 1 new)
</I>&gt;<i> -People vote on wach question separately. So you cannot avoid to vote
</I>&gt;<i> on something and stop the process for everybody.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this is really very complicated. And quite unnecessary.
</I>&gt;<i> So I think in future we should just not permit those questions.
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo handles open question, and 1 question at a time. If you want
</I>&gt;<i> to have multiple questions posed. You need to run them in parallel,
</I>&gt;<i> but in separate instances.
