I would think this would then have to be relative to the scope of the  
view. For example, if you combine this with your earlier idea of tying  
the visualization to a geographic map, then you wouldn't want to end  
up zoomed into a view of Berlin where nothing is blue because there is  
massive activity in Beijing at the moment. So each time you pan or  
zoom on the map, the relative blue circles (and perhaps other such  
variables) should re-calculate against the field of view.

This would apply with non-geographic views as well. I guess generally  
I would say that whatever view you are in, all relative values should  
be relative to the contents of that view. Or there should be an option  
to switch between relative and absolute.

Can you think of any way of reconciling this with Thomas' idea of a  
geographic zoom model? The geographic model is much more easily  
intuited by the novice, but it completely excludes non-geographic- 
centric issues.

Conversely, the n-dimensional space organized by organic evaluation of  
tags is the most robust and most likely the best long-term method. But  
it would be difficult for newcomers to orient to. And early on, when  
there isn't a lot of data, it may be sparse and chaotic. Until there  
is a lot of data in the system, the map would keep shifting and  
rearranging, wouldn't it?
