<PRE>Alex, since StratML is merely a data standard, it does not have interactive
&quot;features&quot; per se, at least not in the sense that software applications do.
However, as we incorporate more complexity into subsequent parts of the
standard, we do want to consider additional elements and attributes
supporting interactivity in software applications and services.

 

In Part 1, for example, the &lt;Identifier&gt; elements associated with other
elements can be used to enable persistent and, if GUIDs are used, globally
unique referencing.  Here are a couple examples: 

 

.        A Google query
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=_7d87fdb6-142e-1">http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=_7d87fdb6-142e-1</A>
1df-a454-3f207a64ea2a&amp;aq=&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=f&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=7b989c6c17f79c85&gt;
in which OMB is discoverable via its GUID in three different StratML files 

.        Objective 2.B
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OMBwStyle.xml#_04d1b421-e00d-436e-8869-06">http://www.xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OMBwStyle.xml#_04d1b421-e00d-436e-8869-06</A>
e8b22d3767&gt; , GPRA and GMRA, in OMB's strategic plan

 

Applications and services can leverage the &lt;Identifier&gt;s to enable explicit
referencing in providing input and feedback on goals and objectives, e.g.,
by presenting renditions that have mailto links embedded and automatically
inserting the goal/objective name in the subject line and a link in the text
of the message.  On the receiving end, applications can automatically route
input and feedback based upon the &lt;Identifier&gt;s of the goals/objectives to
which it pertains.

 

Applications and services can also:

 

.        Apply semantic analysis to the text of goal and objective
&lt;Description&gt;s to identify those that are similar and/or may be
complementary and, thus, candidates for joint pursuit by potential
performance partners.

.        Leverage the &lt;Stakeholder&gt; element to provide value-added services
to particular groups of stakeholders.

.        Support each of the other purposes of the standard:

 

o   Facilitate the sharing, referencing, indexing, discovery, linking,
reuse, and analyses of the elements of strategic plans, including goal and
objective statements as well as the names and descriptions of stakeholder
groups and any other content commonly included in strategic plans. 

o   Enable the concept of &quot;strategic alignment&quot; to be realized in literal
linkages among goal and objective statements (leveraging the &lt;Identifier&gt;
elements as well as the &lt;Relationship
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Relationship">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Relationship</A>&gt; &gt; element of
StratML Part 2) and all other records created by organizations in the
routine course of their business processes. 

o   Facilitate updating and maintenance of  discrete elements of strategic
plans without requiring review and approval of the entire plan through
bureaucratic channels, thereby helping to make the strategic planning
process more agile and responsive to stakeholder feedback and changing
circumstances, thus helping to overcome the tendency of strategic plans to
become outdated &quot;shelfware&quot;. 

o   Reduce the needless time, effort, inconsistencies, and delays associated
with maintaining data redundantly in myriad &quot;stovepipe&quot; systems rather than
referencing the authoritative sources.

o   Enable agencies to comply with the provisions of subsections 202(b)(4)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b</A>&gt; &amp; (5) and 207(d)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d</A>&gt;  of the eGov Act,
which respectively require agencies to: 

o   Work together to link their performance goals to key groups, including
citizens, businesses, and other governments, as well as internal Federal
Government operations; and 

o   Adopt open standards (e.g., StratML) enabling the organization and
categorization of Government information in a way that is searchable
electronically and interoperably across agencies. 

Since StratML Part 2 still needs to be finalized as an ANSI/AIIM standard,
we have not yet begun to consider Part 3.  However, whereas we have kept
Parts 1 &amp; 2 as simple as possible, in Part 3 we will be free to begin to
take on more complexity and, thus, more risk of failure as well as more
potential for gain.  Some preliminary candidates for inclusion in Part 3 are
outlined at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>    Now that Congress has
given final passage to the GPRA Modernization Act
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm</A>&gt; , the data requirements that
are implicit within it will also be high priorities for consideration in
Part 3, particularly since section 10
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm#SEC10">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm#SEC10</A>&gt;  of the Act requires
agencies to publish their plans and reports in machine-readable formats,
like StratML.

 

As AIIM's StratML Committee  begins to consider Part 3, I hope that you and
others will participate in helping to identify and specify additional
elements and attributes that can add the greatest value, including support
for the kind of interactivity that is required to make strategic and
performance plans more meaningful to and productive for stakeholders.

Subject: [MG] StratML Interaction

 

Hi Owen,

 

I was wondering if you could give us some detail about the interactive
features of StratML.

 

A lot of the Metagov projects are focused on the interaction between
stakeholders of various types.

 

I asked you a similar question about the newest and latest version of
StratML that was just being approved, v2?  and I didn't really understand
what you had planned for interaction.

 

I've been considering the next steps in documenting the options that
Votorola users have.  As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in
doing additional work to format the positions that are used in Votorola
which might be considered a strategic plan, in many cases.  I have explored
the MediaWiki semantic wiki options and seen some possibilities for
exporting the positions in XML, which is neat, too.  Over time I expect to
make more process, but in the mean time I wanted to ask you to inform us on
what you are looking to support for commenting and feedback in StratML.

 

There are several criteria that make Votorola special and near and dear to
my heart and of course the bulk of this is due to Michael's deep study into
the theory of communication and interaction, and how stuff gets done.

 

As I mull over how to write this down in some way I was wondering what
process you have in your mind for how Strategic Plans become a &quot;focus point&quot;
for community and stakeholder action.

 

Does one or more of the MetaGov projects come closer to what you have in
mind?

 

I imagine that you must be frustrated, sometimes, with the machine
readability of the software here :)  In working with Michael the last year I
have seen how much thought he is putting into his coding work, and I am sure
the same is true for everyone else as well.  I think it'll come sooner
rather than later, and we are still working on prototyping the basic
services before we implement a data standard for the positions.   

 

So, how will stakeholders interact around a StratML plan in this and later
versions?  Will they be commenting on particular objectives?  Contacting
particular stakeholders?  Are you planning on offering some form of
notification standard that delivers comments on a plan back to the public as
well, so that these comments can then be seen by others?  Will there be a
requirement for notifications, so that stakeholders can receive
notifications of comments on their or other objectives?

Thanks for the pointer, Alex.  The request is now in StratML format at

While they are not all 501(c)(3) organizations, perhaps a qualifying
cosponsor might be found among those listed at

Among the purposes of the StratML standard is to facilitate the discovery of
potential performance partners:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A>  However, tools,
applications, and services are needed to leverage StratML documents in
support of those purposes.

 

BTW, I have been encouraging IRS to enable tax-exempt charitable
organizations to document their missions, visions, values, goals,
objectives, and stakeholders on their own websites in StratML format.
Section 10 &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm#SEC10">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/HR2142.htm#SEC10</A>&gt;  of the new
GPRA Modernization Act (GMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their
strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable formats
(like StratML).  &quot;Tax-expeditures&quot; (such as deductions attributable to
donations to qualified charities) are referenced five times in the Act.  So
it will be necessary for agencies to estimate the amount of tax revenue not
collected due to donations to charities pursuing objectives that complement
those of the agencies themselves.  Rendering the plans of .gov agencies and
tax-exempt charities in StratML format will facilitate compliance with this
new provision of law.  The data requirements associated with the GMA will be
prime topics of consideration in StratML Part 3
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>&gt; .

Isn't voting in self-defining networks something that should defy
censorship?
