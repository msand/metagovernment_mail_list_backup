That's right, but even Stallman didn't knew what he started back in 1984. 
Having read the Emacs history while trying it out, I have read that in 1998 he 
was seriously concerned that some proprietary library like Qt, could break the 
FOSS concepts and introduce a lock-in. Boy was he wrong, not only has 
Trolltech quickly learned that they profit from a GPL version, but also is Qt 
nowadays a much broader foundation for collaborative work on all platforms 
than any other toolkit (Java is a special case) and its founders could sell it 
for over 100 million bucks to Nokia, which now tries to gain hardware market 
share from Qt's FOSS community (they even have LGPL'ed it). 
Have you tried to help some adware-spammed guy with a clean Ubuntu install 
lately? I have done a test and I was very successful, although this guy has no 
clue about technical stuff or computers and is not really open-minded either. 
GNU/Linux is ready finally, but it takes time for a community approach to grow 
and a switch in thinking, you can't advertise that like Apple does with the 
&quot;individualistic&quot; life-style adds.

The terming of RMS is very ethical. And while this fits the FSF's perpective 
very well, I don't think it is an ethical problem. Ethics are always imposed 
on a society from the outside and include wishful thinking. FOSS is rather a 
more effective and shared way of production/consumation (they melt here). The 
copyleft, also looking limiting and imperative at first, is the only term 
necessary to break the borders of bourgeois property in a digital medium. It 
is really a historical moment when a production system which is no ware 
production anymore starts to outrule the growth of capitalistic production in 
the same area. 
The current struggle is web services. The structure of the underlying web 
makes it really difficult to create distributed services, but this is not going 
to last forever. The main problem that kept us caught in the current form of 
the web was MS IE and is still today (so Google indirectly profits from MS with 
its web-services). You can easily introduce P2P technologies in the open-
source browsers, I have done it already for QtWebkit and the KDE browsers and 
its potential is overwhelming imo.
And the success of Apple is already at its top. It was always very likely that 
before a mass adoption of Linux, Apple would break the monopoly of MS. This is 
due to the fact that Apple is also already much more open than MS, but can 
deliver all the necessary funding to place its products and bring commercial 
stuff to the table. Not only could they only form their success by switching to 
a BSD operating system for Mac OS ten, which allows to easily run any UNIX 
FOSS software on their system and therefore backs them up against MS, but also 
their massive success with the iPhone was only possible by creating their own 
web browser engine WebKit, which is a fork of KDE's KHTML and is LGPL. 

But now you already see Google beating the iPhone back to a small market share 
with Android (+WebKit). (&gt;200.000 devices vs. 100.000 iphones a day) What have 
they done? They again have taken even larger amounts of FOSS code and combined 
that with a customized (somewhat proprietary because controlled by Google) 
Java environment. Still, although now even most of the system is open-source, 
this isn't taking advantage of FOSS's full potential, but is a quick step for 
Google to dominate the web even further and get money of FOSS by a lock-in the 
Google-way.
What happens next? Well, Meego (backed up by Nokia, Intel, AMD, BMW, ...) is 
already on the radar. Nokia, still the biggest phone seller, has to quickly 
react and has already open-sourced Symbian. This has not helped them much 
though, because they have no community around it. Meego will be a full fledged 
distribution (based on Fedora) with an almost complete FOSS desktop stack 
optimized and extended for the mobile. This will easily outrule the app-store 
fancy sh*tty package management of Apple and Google, because it is about 
proper code-sharing (via shared libraries and shared frameworks) and brings 
all FOSS software to the table.

But what was the alternative to this history? Talk people into not using 
Apple? Bring them up against Google? I have tried the latter and failed 
although my arguments where accepted. Even Alex Rollin has not reacted on my 
criticism of using GMail and leaking all discussions to Google that way, 
although Mail is a pretty cheap service to run on your own. 
FOSS is a long-term project to turn the communicational infrastructure into a 
hackable and sharable open space. It hasn't failed in the past and even now it 
is most likely that while moving around somewhere the next system to you is 
already a Linux system, even if you don't know it. I don't say you shouldn't 
lobby it, but best is to bring people to FOSS solutions they like, even if it 
is combined with commercial stuff in the first place. The GPL is tough on 
ensuring that FOSS stays open. Start with Firefox and LibreOffice and maybe half 
a year later the person is willing to run GNU/Linux.

What does that mean for us? I'd seriously like to have 10 million bucks to get 
professional developers in, but these projects try to model a ware out of the 
communicational medium which then means locking you in. This might work for 
Facebook, but it will not work for content which is in its meaning already 
open and meant to be shared (which is the opposite with Facebook btw.), which 
is what a consensus network is all about. So if they have any good concept, we 
can clone it, but they can't compete, because they are not FOSS and if they 
are we can bring them on top of our open-network approach (we might even do 
that hostilely when they expose their data for transparency). Additionally if 
you burn a lot of money quickly over even a FOSS project you still don't build 
a community around it. 
If you can find proper ways of funding I am of course very willing to help you 
to get it, don't get me wrong here!

</I>
Several projects have already tried that. Not to speak about commercial 
software, even only having a dedicated tool for e-dem hasn't worked yet. The 
problem we are solving is imo a drawback of the web, which is not really open 
and shared yet. We need to bridge communities and bring consensus building 
together, because if consensus building is split up between only two 
communities it is already almost meaningless and loses its representative 
value.

</I>&gt;<i> To be honest, I am still a little unclear on why the free content
</I>&gt;<i> people are so adamant that free must include commercial use. I am very
</I>&gt;<i> willing to listen to arguments for it, but this thread reminds me of
</I>&gt;<i> why I was leery of it in the first place.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I hope I have clearified my position above. FOSS works better. This doesn't 
mean you don't have to lobby for open systems, but it means you are already on 
the winner side when you do, so you don't have to flame, but can simply stick 
to reasoning imo. It is a tough fight still.
Michael and me have actually decided that we stick to MIT for Votorola, 
although I would have preferred the GPL or maybe even AGPL in the first place, 
but as the whole motivation of this project is already openness, we think we 
can improve both our experiences and the long-term perspective on e-dem if we 
can help to bring consensus building anywhere, even to big business. I don't 
think we will though, because they don't want to really open up, but only 
improve their efficiency and stay agile to trends.
