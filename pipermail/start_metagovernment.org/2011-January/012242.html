<PRE>I have to admit that I've been struggling to follow this thread. Long  
posts with lots of technical detail are practically the ultimate walls  
of text. :) Perhaps when the thread seems to be concluding, someone  
could post a high-level, non-technical summary of some of its findings?

This part blew me away. I have about seven minutes left for metagov- 
related stuff this morning, so can't delve into these, but they look  
spectacular.

However, am I right in understanding that this distributed hosting  
approach couldn't be applied to, say, MediaWiki? The software needs to  
be written to the hosting model from the ground-up, right? Or can it  
be adapted (I am of course, thinking of the metagovernment.org site  
atm.)

In any event, I do want to encourage anything along these lines for  
all democracy software... anything that can remove single points of  
failure (where one kind of failure is corruption) is always preferable.
