<PRE>My objective in applying is to address several of the things you bring  
up below.

It is very difficult for Metagovernment to seek any funding because we  
aren't an official organization. Apart from private donations, we are  
extremely unlikely to receive any other funding. Separately, I have  
had much, much less time to work on the project than I would like  
because of other demands on my time: much of them having to do with  
earning an income.

These particular fellowships are generally for one year. My personal  
aim in applying is to be financially free to work on the project full  
time. As part of my grant proposal, I am also proposing that I would  
spend a significant portion of my time working on finding the proper  
way to form an organization that is neither ruled by empowered  
individuals nor tied to any one nation. I believe from previous  
discussion on this list that Belgium would be the best place to effect  
that, so I am also proposing I spend some time there (there is an OSI  
office in Brussels) to potentially effect that.

If we could form an organization that would be officially organized  
*and* governed by our own &quot;dogfood,&quot; we would not only be better  
positioned to progress, but we would also have made the most  
significant step: a real-world instance of institutionalized  
collaborative governance.

That's my aim. I think it would be great for others to make their own  
proposals on whatever grounds work for them. Receiving fellowships  
like this is always a long shot, but I think this one is worth  
considering.

&gt;<i> Hi Ed,

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for bringing this up to our attention.
</I>&gt;<i> I missed it the first time Matias presented it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes we definitly should apply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reading better the FAQ seem that the fellowship is strictly on a per
</I>&gt;<i> individual basis. On this base, for example, neither I nor the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Vilfredo project&quot; per se can apply. In particular they say:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;In addition to supplying a fellowship stipend for living expenses,
</I>&gt;<i> OSI may cover additional limited expenses such as travel, conference
</I>&gt;<i> fees, and part-time research assistance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fellowship expenses should not include operational or programmatic
</I>&gt;<i> costs, such as employees and physical infrastructure. The purpose of
</I>&gt;<i> the fellowship is to support individual fellows; therefore OSI will
</I>&gt;<i> only cover individual expenses. Other ineligible expenses include per
</I>&gt;<i> diems for prolonged research trips, Internet and telephone bills.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So at the best I could get funding for a &quot;part time research
</I>&gt;<i> assistent&quot; (aka a programmer). Other than that I would not get any
</I>&gt;<i> money.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I think Vilfredo is not the right project to apply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about Votorola or the crossforum theatre, is everybody working
</I>&gt;<i> there already funded?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You could apply, Ed, but you are not a programmer. My understanding is
</I>&gt;<i> that they fund people (individuals) to do things. And then speak about
</I>&gt;<i> them. But you could design a system. And use the time to go and speak
</I>&gt;<i> with politicians and hear what they need (I remember politicians
</I>&gt;<i> saying, I receive 3000 emails a day, how the hell can I sort them
</I>&gt;<i> out). The biggest problem in eGov is not so much programming the thing
</I>&gt;<i> but designing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think would be good if one of our project (or more than one
</I>&gt;<i> independently), apply. I am not sure if Metagovernment, as an
</I>&gt;<i> organization is eligible, because it is more an umbrella organization.
</I>&gt;<i> Also they do not fund lobbying. Not that we ever did that, but in case
</I>&gt;<i> we wanted to start ;-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I could ask Derek (the volunteer programmer in Vilfredo) if he
</I>&gt;<i> wants to apply. He is not interested in doing a dissertation, but they
</I>&gt;<i> do not fund dissertations. What about Matias, Thomas, Michael, Alex,
</I>&gt;<i> Owen. Each of those people was directly involved into a project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a separate note, I wonder if Metagovernment could try to raise
</I>&gt;<i> money from individuals around the world and try to set up its own
</I>&gt;<i> funding scheme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But, yes, definitely, if you, Ed, have the time I think you should
</I>&gt;<i> apply. It would also clarify better your ideas about what you think
</I>&gt;<i> should be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just a reminder, if anyone is interested in applying for this, the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any one of us getting such a fellowship would probably be a
