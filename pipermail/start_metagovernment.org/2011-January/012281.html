I agree, but it also seems to have some good results. Alexander offered 
to work on a powerpoint presentation of our basic concepts. Thank you 
for that! And I would be glad to help with this.

And Conseo, besides his great work on the theatre app, imo correctly 
looks for ways to connect with potential users.

Well, this is ofc right for the whole of Tunesia. But how if we connect 
to a small Tunesian group, ideally active in democracy and programming 
and share our ideas with them. Maybe we can collaborate. Both in using 
the tools and in developing them further.

&gt;<i> If we are looking for groups to implement anything of ours now, I

Yes, exactly. Or &quot;informal interest groups&quot; as you write.
