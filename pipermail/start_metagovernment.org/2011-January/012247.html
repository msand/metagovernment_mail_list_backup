</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course it is. But I don't see where this is a problem. We can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easily use Drupal as a drafting medium (e.g. blogs) already as far
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as Mike has told me and maybe soon even as a discussion medium (I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have to write the scraper and fetcher for this then). We really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't want to compete here. In fact it would be lovely if you could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work it out with us, since personally I'd like to address drupal at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some near point in the future which would make our infrastructural
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; concept *very* flexible and attractive to all kind of web
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; communities already using drupal. It would also be an appropriate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scale of test installation. What do you think, Michael?  Ideally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they only have to install some pollserver stuff and a crossforum
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; installation somewhere and will be able to blend that in where it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; makes sense to use democratical processes. That way we can also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learn from Drupal and see where we can back our solutions up with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think you guys are on the right track, if I understand.  We want to
</I>&gt;<i> move the machine to where people are.  That seems to be the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity we're chasing.  In that sense we're politically driven.
</I>&gt;<i> So if Alex has a machine of his own, then we probably want to build a
</I>&gt;<i> bridge to it.  Because that's political too, and it'll attract people.
</I>&gt;<i> Right?
</I>
Right.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If there's a danger (just speaking generally), it might be in trying
</I>&gt;<i> to cover too great of a distance in a single trek, or in a single span
</I>&gt;<i> of the bridge.  We need to show meaningful progress at frequent
</I>&gt;<i> intervals or I think we'll lose people.  (Not that I see this as a
</I>&gt;<i> danger in what you suggest, in particular.)
</I>
You are absolutely right. That is why was proposing to at first allow drupal to 
fetch data from our JSON feeds. This should be a small effort and would already 
allow to use Drupal for things we can't and don't want to do in a voting 
network. I have proposed this, since Alex is very interested in Drupal and I 
think we can all profit that way. We don't have to do drafting and even voting 
that way yet and can stay focused, as we only share the general interfaces of 
Crossforum to drop the data to Drupal, too, at first. I think this would be a 
nice and step-by-step approach for Drupal as a drafting and voting medium and 
would also allow Alex and us to figure out the necessary details to become 
crossforum on the way. Just my 2pence.

Conseo.
