<PRE>Marcos, in StratML Part 2 stakeholders
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Stakeholder">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Stakeholder</A>&gt;  may have
roles &lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Role">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Role</A>&gt;  of either or
both of two types
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#RoleType">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#RoleType</A>&gt;  -- performer or
beneficiary.  

 

Stakeholders may be named (individually or generically) and described.
There may be an unlimited number of them and each may have an unlimited
number of roles.  There is no reason they could not and, indeed, they should
include the types of individuals you reference.

 

One of the express purposes of the StratML standard
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A>&gt;  is to enable more
efficient input and feedback from stakeholders, including anyone who cares
to take the time to provide it.

 

As far as U.S. federal agencies are concerned, subsections 202(b)(4)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b</A>&gt; &amp; (5) and 207(d)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d</A>&gt;  of the eGov Act
require agencies to: 

 

.        Work together to link their performance goals to key groups,
including citizens, businesses, and other governments, as well as internal
Federal Government operations; and 

.        Adopt open standards (e.g., StratML) enabling the organization and
categorization of Government information in a way that is searchable
electronically and interoperably across agencies. 

 

As far as I am aware, StratML is the only open, standard means by which
agencies can comply with those provisions of law.

 

The reason I subscribed to the Metagov listserv was to explore prospects for
using Metascore to enable input and feedback on goals and objectives
documented in StratML format on the Web.  

 

Section 10 of the new GEEPIA (H.R. 2142
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-2142">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-2142</A>&gt; ) requires
agencies to document their strategic and performance plans and reports in
machine-readable formats (like StratML), and OMB Circular A-119
&lt;<A HREF="http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm">http://standards.gov/standards_gov/a119.cfm</A>&gt;  directs them to participate
in the development and use of voluntary consensus standards (like StratML,
ANSI/AIIM 21:2009).

 

So the only question is what excuses they can come up with not to do as
directed by law and policy.

 

Owen

Owen, I like your efforts in getting to the &quot;meat&quot; of these subjects.

Although I can see you've distilled the subject to these main term, I

suggest that there is one piece missing that is the counterpart to

&quot;the stakeholder&quot; in order for a project to be a success.  It is, in

wikipedia terms, &quot;the wikignomes&quot;.  They aren't stakeholders, per se,

but essential &quot;many workers behind the scenes&quot; that ensure success

giving corrective feedback during the process to ensure that the

project doesn't exist in isolation.

 

Just some thoughts, there's more but time constrains me....
