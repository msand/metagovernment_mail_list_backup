This subject has become more and more interesting for me lately. Now, 
you point to Linux and Windows. But wasn't Firefox a while back in the 
same position towards Microsoft IE? And Wikipedia towards traditional 
encyclopedia? By now it actually appears to me almost certain, that open 
source will succeed in the end. It's just so much more powerful. And 
what does it actually matter then, if in the meanwhile some buisinesses 
make some money with it too.

Ok, the 10 Mill for Spigit look at first glance like a waste. We could 
have done much more and better things with it. I agree here. But in the 
end also Spigit will raise some awareness towards e-dem ... especially 
towards the tricky points ;-)

And what do we have to loose? They can take all our ideas and code ... 
but in the end we will make it even better and open anyway. Isn't it? 
(This is not a rethorical question, I'm just so impressed by what FOSS 
has already accomplished so far.)
