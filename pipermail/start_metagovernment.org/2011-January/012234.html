<PRE>Sorry for the delay; I've had a lot going on.

That associates you with a good Scotch. :)

You now have been added to the project, or you will soon (there is a  
lag, I think).

You are now a top-level admin of the project. You can create these  
directories or whatever... up to removing me as an admin and/or  
destroying the project.

(I haven't yet quite grasped how tux's ACLs work... I added you as top- 
level to the overall project and to the website I had created. If  
either of us creates a new resource, however, I am not sure the other  
will automatically acquire admin privileges. I don't have time to look  
into it now, but I think it would be good for both of us to have top- 
level privs for everything... until such a time as we can come up with  
a way for neither of us to have such power...).

To log into the website, you should be able to sftp or ssh using your  
tux credentials.

I have already set up the metagovernment directory (which maps to  
metagovernment.tuxfamily.org), so create your public directories in  
there. When we move the DNS pointer over to tux, then that directory  
will be the site root for metagovernment.org.

You can set up databases, etc from the tux control panel. It takes a  
little getting used to, but it's not too difficult to intuit. From  
your main tux panel, click on the Group icon (icon of two people) and  
you should see Metagov as a group which you now belong to.  
Alternately, you can directly admin the group from:
<A HREF="https://panel.tuxfamily.org/group/view.pl?group=metagov">https://panel.tuxfamily.org/group/view.pl?group=metagov</A>

&gt;<i> They could be placed anywhere.  If they're placed at the root, then  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> launch URL would be: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another facility that's needed (I should mention) is a pollwiki.  It's
</I>&gt;<i> a common database for cross-project applications.  I mention it
</I>&gt;<i> because the theatre app won't work without it.  Also because it's a
</I>&gt;<i> prominent end-user facility.  For these reasons, we might want to host
</I>&gt;<i> it here under Metagov.  I agree with Thomas (if he doesn't mind me
</I>&gt;<i> repeating) that Metagov is the best place for doing cross-project
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we decide to host it here, then it could also serve as the wiki for
</I>&gt;<i> ordinary Metagov content.  (In the meantime, we can continue to use my
</I>&gt;<i> own pollwiki as the database.)  About pollwikis:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#wiki</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If any other active list members would like to assist in  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the site at a full or limited level (i.e. admining one section such  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creating a blog or bulletin board), please say so on-list, and see if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone else objects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If someone with admin skills were to set up a vanilla install of
</I>&gt;<i> Semantic MediaWiki on the tuxfamily site (assuming the pollwiki's a go
</I>&gt;<i> with you guys) then that would be a great help.  Myself, I'd only need
</I>&gt;<i> to be made a Sysop of the wiki, and I could do the rest.
</I>
Can you do this, or do you need me to? My only issue (other than my  
ongoing time crunch) is where to put it. When we move the  
metagovernment.org domain, the current wiki will reside in /w/ and / 
wiki/. For this, are you looking for /pollwiki/? And if you need a  
second directory, perhaps /p/?
