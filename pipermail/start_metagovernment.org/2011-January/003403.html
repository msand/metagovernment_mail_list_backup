There have been several people agreeing with this and none  
disagreeing. I will give it another day or two before making Michael  
an admin of the tuxfamily site, where hopefully all resources of this  
project will soon move.

Does anyone object?

Also, Michael, do you actually want to be such an admin? (As opposed  
to not being an admin, or being an admin of only one section.) If so,  
all I need from you is for you to create an account on tux at:
<A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/subscribe">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/subscribe</A>

If any other active list members would like to assist in administering  
the site at a full or limited level (i.e. admining one section such as  
creating a blog or bulletin board), please say so on-list, and see if  
anyone else objects.
