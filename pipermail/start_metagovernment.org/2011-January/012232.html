I'm not sure where you guys are having your back room discussion about
crossforum, but I'm glad you are talking. &#160;I simply hoped to save you
some work, Mike, and you can of course proceed as you see fit, and
don't need my permission. &#160;If you want to tell me where you think my
understanding falls short I'll be grateful to understand. &#160;Obviously I
am not privvy to your discussion, and so I cannot say what I don't
understand.

&gt;<i> Just to add to my other post in the Drupal thread: Alex, I share your point of
</I>&gt;<i> view, but I think we are *not* reinventing the wheel here. In fact we do the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite. Michael has split up the concept not only on a library middleware
</I>&gt;<i> perspective, but on the level of whole entities of the network. That way what
</I>&gt;<i> we do is only focusing on the necessary glue in between abstract concepts of
</I>&gt;<i> these entities like pollservers, drafting media or discussion media. We do
</I>&gt;<i> *more* code sharing than that although we implement our infrastructure from
</I>&gt;<i> scratch. It is maybe not easy to see, but feeding services and likely even the
</I>&gt;<i> mapper are not too difficult to program, since they are basic concepts of
</I>&gt;<i> UI-/Web-programming and data handling anyway. But using some middleware we get
</I>&gt;<i> locked in their perspective of the web, which is in case of Atom already a
</I>&gt;<i> design problem for us. We can easily plug in middleware later to put our data
</I>&gt;<i> in any standard form you like. I'd like to do it for Atom with Abdera at least
</I>&gt;<i> for the feed service, but this is low priority atm, as Crossforum is the way
</I>&gt;<i> to go.
</I>
As I've understood it the point of the crossforum app, when I was
writing original use cases for it, was to demonstrate one use case. &#160;I
hear you say &quot;infrastructure&quot; and it sounds like moving beyond a use
case, and so I offer the same advice I did to Mike so many months ago,
that this work has, by and large, been done within Drupal, and
required much more time to do correctly than I think is available to
build it from scratch within this context. &#160;You can tear down Drupal
to my face and it won't hurt my feelings; it doesn't change the fact
that it does most of what I understand you want to do.
