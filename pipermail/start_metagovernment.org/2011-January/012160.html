<PRE>Kris, achieving objectives requires inputs

&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Process">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Process</A>&gt; , and outputs
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Output">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Output</A>&gt;  as well as

of the performer type.

 

Those are the additional elements of StratML Part 2 that transform strategic
plans into performance plans.

 

In short, achieving objectives (at least as a matter of routine) requires
good and complete performance plans.  

 

One of the enduring lessons of the Total Quality Management (TQM) movement
is that the product cannot be right (of high quality) unless the process is
. except by chance.

Hi Owen,

 

I am with you. But my wonder is how would we go about achieving the stated
objectives? I am for total transparency and accountability in all actions of
all individuals and organizations including government to create a level
playing field and true democratic values.

 

Any thoughts?

 

Best,

 

Kris Dev.

Rather than engaging in bureaucratic double-speak to offset the shortcomings

to try to achieve them, and b) do our best to hold not only ourselves but
also others accountable for living up to their avowed values, including the
values of democracy.

It seems to me that Metagov applications could be used to help Congress and
.gov agencies understand how they might more effectively uphold their avowed
values, including service to citizens, and potentially to improve their
performance.   At least I continue to hope that might be the case.

I continue to believe the concept of &quot;governance&quot; has been vastly oversold.

Subject: Re: [MG] Open Democracy

The debate in question was over the term used to describe the concept, not
the group. So for the moment, Metagovernment (or Metagov) is still the name
of this group. In fact, I think there was a separate Vilfredo proposal about
that.

This was a discussion of whether or not we could use a better term for the
overarching idea, which this project first called Open Source Governance and
then Collaborative Governance:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance</A>

If you disagree, then we haven't reached consensus. Same with Michael. And
so presumably we stick with the status quo. Collaborative Governance isn't a
bad term; it was just felt by some that it is not easily understood by
others and that it doesn't convey much sense of democracy.

The idea behind using the term Open Democracy is that it does pretty well
bring up an image of what we are talking about. And while all democracy is
supposedly &quot;open,&quot; the fact that we would describe this brand as &quot;open&quot;
hopefully makes the listener/reader question what makes it different from
all other brands of democracy.

Here in the U.S., I certainly don't feel that democracy is open when
Congress has secret sessions, the executive branch has entire secret
agencies and vast troves of secret information, and much of the legislative
process is done without any *chance* for me to have any meaningful input.
Much of our legislative process at every level of government is carried out
in &quot;informal&quot; meetings between lobbyists and politicians: not something that
is open or democratic in any way.

So given all of the above, can you get on board with the term, or would you
like to propose another (or stick with what we have)?
