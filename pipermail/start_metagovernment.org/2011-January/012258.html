<PRE>Hi Mark,

&gt;<i>  So, what does that mean for us?
</I>
Well, my understanding is that now is the time that they are dangerous.

They are still young, thus flexible, and they have a lot of money.
So any idea we come up here they have resources to implement it rapidly.

Older companies will not be flexible. If you have a new algorithm for
search is not like google will easily steal it. But if you had it at
the beginning, and you let it slip, it would be into &quot;do no evil&quot;
company. And then good luck into getting it back, or getting any
recognition for it.

I would rather see them start and fall.
Or start and reach some mediocre result,
than help them.

But don't worry, there was livejournal, orkut, myspace and friendster
before facebook.
There was altavista before google.
No one makes it right on the first time.

In the meantime I am thinking of introducing a feature in Vilfredo. It
is a combination of the point and uservoice. But a better uservoice.
Having everybody suggest improvements on vilfredo. And then ask a
programmer how much would it cost to have them implemented. Then start
a thepoint.com campaign for those features. So the people who voted
for them have the possibility to chip in to see them implemented. And
then the code is open source.
