&gt;<i> In Part 1, for example, the &lt;Identifier&gt; elements associated with other

&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A Google query in which OMB is discoverable via its GUID in three
</I>&gt;<i> different StratML files
</I>

I was considering this earlier, this exact issue of a unique ID for
each section of a document, when I wrote to you.  It's certainly an
important piece of the puzzle when looking for a comparison, say,
between mission and objectives between 2 separate organizations.


On the subject of Objectives, is how are versions for the plans
handled?  Is there one ID for the plan, and then another for the
version?  Are there also ways to list the previous versions?

[StratML Parts 1 &amp; 2 do not address version control per se.  However, yes,
applications and services implementing the StratML standard can and,
hopefully, will leverage the &lt;Identifier&gt; element for version control not
only at the plan level but also at the element level within each plan.
Hopefully, services will emerge that maintain a complete archival history of
all versions of all elements of all plans (or at least those of interest to
their own stakeholders).]

&gt;<i> Applications and services can leverage the &lt;Identifier&gt;s to enable
</I>explicit
&gt;<i> referencing in providing input and feedback on goals and objectives, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> by presenting renditions that have mailto links embedded and automatically
</I>&gt;<i> inserting the goal/objective name in the subject line and a link in the
</I>text
&gt;<i> of the message.&#160; On the receiving end, applications can automatically
</I>route
&gt;<i> input and feedback based upon the &lt;Identifier&gt;s of the goals/objectives to
</I>&gt;<i> which it pertains.
</I>
So, between a unique identifier for an objective and the
idintifier/contact information for the person/stakeholder responsible
for the objective you get a very specific Person to talk to.

[In Parts 1 &amp; 2 the only contact information is for the &quot;submitter&quot; (i.e.,
the person who submitted the plan/report in StratML format) who may or may
not be the appropriate POC for comments on any particular goal or objective.
However, in Part 3 it may be appropriate to reuse the &lt;FirstName&gt;,
&lt;LastName&gt;, &lt;EmailAddress&gt; and &lt;PhoneNumber&gt; elements as children of a
&lt;PointOfContact&gt; child of each goal and objective.  Other means of directing
comments to the appropriate person/place could also be considered, depending
upon the interest of those participating in specification of Part 3.]

Is there an expectation of a standard for a comment?  For example,
could a person that comments on the plan also be labelled with a
stakeholder role?  And is there going to be a GUID for the comment
itself?

[This is beyond anything the StratML Committee has contemplated thus far,
and it seems like a standard for &quot;comments&quot; might be a bit beyond the scope
of what we should try to take on.  Again, though, what the Committee decides
to take up will depend upon the interests of the participants and their
willingness to undertake the necessary effort.]


&gt;<i> Applications and services can also:
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Apply semantic analysis to the text of goal and objective
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;Description&gt;s to identify those that are similar and/or may be
</I>&gt;<i> complementary and, thus, candidates for joint pursuit by potential
</I>&gt;<i> performance partners.
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Leverage the &lt;Stakeholder&gt; element to provide value-added
</I>services
&gt;<i> to particular groups of stakeholders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Support each of the other purposes of the standard:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Facilitate the sharing, referencing, indexing, discovery, linking,
</I>&gt;<i> reuse, and analyses of the elements of strategic plans, including goal and
</I>&gt;<i> objective statements as well as the names and descriptions of stakeholder
</I>&gt;<i> groups and any other content commonly included in strategic plans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Enable the concept of &quot;strategic alignment&quot; to be realized in literal
</I>&gt;<i> linkages among goal and objective statements (leveraging the &lt;Identifier&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> elements as well as the &lt;Relationship&gt; element of StratML Part 2) and all
</I>&gt;<i> other records created by organizations in the routine course of their
</I>&gt;<i> business processes.
</I>
When I asked about tracking comments and the makers of the comments it
seems like it might fit in here then.

I was the tech support for a lobby group for awhile.  We pushed a lot
of letter writing campaigns and a few times we wrote back to...the
FDA, I think,...to get a list of all the people who had commented
during a public comment period along with the text of what they wrote.
 I think it was all scanned or dumped from email.  it was messy.
Nevertheless, such a thing was available.  One of them has something
like 50,000 pieces in it.  Huge, and a tremendous amount of work for
whoever collated it.

How can StratML help with this kind of thing?  Is there going to be
markup for structural relationships, like government representatives,
senators, particular offices and titular roles, or is it always going
to be an email address?

[In Parts 1 &amp; 2 the StratML Committee felt that organizational relationships
were less important than the core elements that have been included.
However, they are on our radar for potential consideration in Part 3:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>  If we do decide to address that
concept, the issue will be whether to reuse our general purpose
&lt;Relationship&gt; element or to try to hard code a more detailed structure for
organizations. <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Relationship">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Relationship</A>
My sense is that the former might be preferable and that specifying a formal
structure for organizations is beyond the scope of what the StratML
Committee should endeavor to do.]

I think part of why I'm asking is because part of the issue seems to
me to be supplying some form of interface for &quot;claiming&quot; which kind of
stakeholder you are when you write in to comment.  This helps the
information get to the right place/person, as well as insuring that
anyone who has real responsibility to a specific stakeholder can/does
fulfiill the obligation of their office and &quot;write back!&quot; to that
person.  Or, at least collect that feedback in some way so that the
reprinting of the 52,000 comments can be done more easily and more
regularly next time.  I can only imagine the huge cost of doing such a
thing currently.

[It seems to me that routing of comments depends more upon the focus of the
comment (e.g., the goal or objective it addresses) rather that the
attributes of the individuals submitting them.  In those cases, the
&lt;Identifier&gt;s associated with each goal and objective can be leveraged by
applications and services to route comments appropriately.  However, I
recognize there are special cases (e.g., comments to Members of Congress)
that may warrant special treatment.  In those cases, it seems to me that it
might be more appropriate to rely upon applications and services rather than
to try to build the necessary logic into the StratML schema itself.  Again,
though, that is just my thought at this point.  I can be persuaded
otherwise, and what the StratML Committee actual decides to do in Part 3
will depend upon: a) the interest and willingness of individuals to do the
work, and b) the consensus of the &quot;members&quot; (participants) of the Committee.
(Participation is open.)]

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Facilitate updating and maintenance of&#160; discrete elements of strategic
</I>&gt;<i> plans without requiring review and approval of the entire plan through
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucratic channels, thereby helping to make the strategic planning
</I>&gt;<i> process more agile and responsive to stakeholder feedback and changing
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances, thus helping to overcome the tendency of strategic plans to
</I>&gt;<i> become outdated &quot;shelfware&quot;.
</I>
Would this be something like breaking an objective and stakeholder
group &quot;out of the plan&quot; so that group could focus on that one
objective and then integrate it back into the over all plan?

[Exactly how this would occur will depend upon how each application and
service deals with the files but, yes, I understand what you are suggesting
is one of the features that Andre Cusson of 01 Communications, for example,
is building into their StratML portal.
<A HREF="http://stratml.hyperbase.com/stratml.html">http://stratml.hyperbase.com/stratml.html</A> In any event, the &lt;Identifier&gt;
element associated with each goal and objective statement is designed to
enable explicit referencing of discrete elements of each plan regardless of
where they may reside.]

So, is there, then, a way of doing &quot;versions&quot; and &quot;version dates&quot; for
each of the sections that receives a OMB/GUID?  What's the diff
between an OMB and a GUID, btw?

[Again, this would be up to applications and services but, yes, it would be
logical to associate a date/time stamp with a GUID to enable usage of the
&lt;Identifier&gt; element for version control.  Dealing with this issue in
greater detail might be a candidate for consideration in Part 3.]

&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Work together to link their performance goals to key groups, including
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, businesses, and other governments, as well as internal Federal
</I>&gt;<i> Government operations;
</I>
When we say &quot;link&quot; here, what do we mean?  Putting up a &quot;tweet&quot; that
says a new plan has been published that effect &quot;citizens&quot; or is there
more detail to be had?

[In the short run (i.e., as soon as a plan it posted on the Web in StratML
format with the &lt;Identifier&gt; elements populated), direct links become
possible, e.g., this
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OGDwStyle.xml#_7d88050e-142e-11df-a454-3f207a6">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OGDwStyle.xml#_7d88050e-142e-11df-a454-3f207a6</A>
4ea2a  In the future, hopefully, services will emerge that leverage the GUID
&lt;Identifier&gt;s to point (enable links) to individual elements wherever they
reside on the Web, i.e., without regard to the rest of the URL.  Presumably,
StratML applications and services will enable subscription to individual
goals and objectives as well as entire plans via such means as RSS, Atom,
Twitter, etc.]  

I think this goes back to feedback, again.  It's not just about
publishing the stuff, though that's a great start.  We need to get
feedback/new drafts into the process and adjust more quickly with more
input from broader groups.

When they say link what do they really mean?

[We mean literal linkages, e.g., hypertext links.  However, conceptual
linkage is also an important point.  A lot of lip service has been paid to
the concept of &quot;strategic alignment&quot; that doesn't really amount to much in
reality.  StratML enables literal &quot;alignment&quot; (linkage) of records to the
strategic goals and objectives they support, a vice versa.]

&gt;<i> o&#160;&#160; Adopt open standards (e.g., StratML) enabling the organization and
</I>&gt;<i> categorization of Government information in a way that is searchable
</I>&gt;<i> electronically and interoperably across agencies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since StratML Part 2 still needs to be finalized as an ANSI/AIIM standard,
</I>&gt;<i> we have not yet begun to consider Part 3.
</I>
Can you say more about ANSI/AIIM?  I'm not familiar with that.  What
should eDemocracy projects know about ANSI/AIIM?  How could that help
us to bring our tools to bear on these deliverables?

[See <A HREF="http://ansi.org/,">http://ansi.org/,</A> particularly

AIIM is an ANSI-accredited standards development organization (SDO).  AIIM
will be taking StratML Part 1 to ISO as a proposed international standard.

&gt;<i> Parts 1 &amp; 2 as simple as possible, in Part 3 we will be free to begin to
</I>&gt;<i> take on more complexity and, thus, more risk of failure as well as more
</I>&gt;<i> potential for gain.&#160; Some preliminary candidates for inclusion in Part 3

Geospatial referencing of organizations, goals, objectives, and stakeholders
Gannon Dick's thoughts on &quot;encoded resources&quot; (e.g., country codes),
February 7, 2010

Good stuff.  This is the kind of metadata we are working on for the
crossforum app now.

Citation of relevant legal or other authorities

I think I saw that citations are already included in some form, now,
yes?  This helps to further contextualize a strategy plan, then, and
also to publish &quot;what we think we know about what law governs this
plan&quot; kind of thing?

[StratML Parts 1 &amp; 2 do not include any element(s) explicitly referencing
&quot;authorities,&quot; e.g., laws, regulations, and policies.  That concept is on
our radar for consideration in Part 3:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A>  However, what actually makes its way
into Part 3 will depend upon the consensus of participants in AIIM's StratML
Committee.  Indeed, whether there will be a Part 3 depends upon whether Part
2, like Part 1, is approved as an ANSI/AIIM standard.  Part 2 is about to
enter the ANSI/AIIM review process.  Meanwhile, as indicated above, AIIM is
preparing to advance Part 1 for ISO approval.  Such approval will depend
upon the interest and support of a certain number of other countries besides
the U.S.]

Categorization of goals and objectives based upon various taxonomies,
This is interesting.  These are all linked on the page at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Part3</A> .  I recommend folks take a
look at these.  Structured taxonomies are important when we have
hugely generalized facilities like stratml.  All of our Metagov
projects are generalized.  We could have a process for introducing
these structured schemas and linking them to our projects.

[I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;they are all linked on the page ...&quot;  A link
is provided to a summary of the U.S. Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA)
Performance Reference Model (PRM), and the other FEA &quot;models&quot; are also
summarized on that page.  However, the PRM is just one of many taxonomies by
which goals and objectives might be categorized, and if we do enable
categorization in Part 3, I'd like to do so in a generic way that enables
users to identify the taxonomy they are using along with documenting the
category(ies) within that taxonomy under which each goal and objective is
being classified.] 

Note: StratML Part 2 includes the Relationship element as a child of
PerformanceIndicator to enable users to link inputs, processes,
outputs, and outcomes to each other in the ValueChain, if they wish
Point of contact elements as children of the Stakeholder element to
enable automated transmission of input and feedback to designated
points of contact for each Goal and Objective
Personal attributes of individuals and groups of Stakeholders
Version control at the element level, perhaps by applying a time/date
element or attribute

This is quite powerful.  This is one way that the product of
government funding can end up back in the hands of the people who paid
for the work in the first place.

[I agree the &lt;Relationship&gt; element is conceptually quite helpful.  However,
the gap between potential results and actual results is commonly quite
large.  Just because the capability is supported in the standard doesn't
necessarily mean that anyone will use it or that they will do so
sufficiently to achieve large-scale network effects.  Indeed, it remains to
be seen whether even the much simpler Part 1 will be used, much less Part 2
or even more complex additional parts.  For example, I have not yet seen any
evidence that subscribers to this listserv plan to use any part of it.] 

Referencing of &lt;Project&gt;s and &lt;Program&gt;s.
See, for example, Project Management XML Schema (PMXML)
Also interesting at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Program">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Program</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As AIIM&#146;s StratML Committee &#160;begins to consider Part 3, I hope that you
</I>and
&gt;<i> others will participate in helping to identify and specify additional
</I>&gt;<i> elements and attributes that can add the greatest value, including support
</I>&gt;<i> for the kind of interactivity that is required to make strategic and
</I>&gt;<i> performance plans more meaningful to and productive for stakeholders.
</I>
Well, I know for myself, at least, that StraML is more comprehensive
than I can fully encompass at the moment as far as structured data is
concerned.  My research into applying StratML at the local level
showed me that most organizations are still struggling with thee
basics of what must have been version 1 of the specification, and that
includes myself!

[Absolutely.  That's why it is important not to get ahead of ourselves and
overload others with too much complexity to soon.]

That said, I think that we have 2 sides of a coin here.  Most of the
metagov projects are concerned with methods for deliberation online,
and a strategy document is the product of such a deliberation.  I go a
step further and say also that the product needs go back and inform
the method to the extent to which that is possible, and hence the
progress in identifying ways in which StratML can be integrated into
the way we write positions and strategies and format, from the very
beginning, a proposal that is to be deliberated.

[I agree that the potential for synergy between the StratML standard and
Metgov applications is great.  The question is whether we can muster the
will and wisdom to capitalize on that potential in ways that will be
meaningful and manageable by others.]

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Owen,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was wondering if you could give us some detail about the interactive
</I>&gt;<i> features of StratML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of the Metagov projects are focused on the interaction between
</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders of various types.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I asked you a similar question about the newest and latest version of
</I>&gt;<i> StratML that was just being approved, v2? &#160;and I didn't really understand
</I>&gt;<i> what you had planned for interaction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've been considering the next steps in documenting the options that
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola users have. &#160;As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in
</I>&gt;<i> doing additional work to format the positions that are used in Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> which might be considered a strategic plan, in many cases. &#160;I have
</I>explored
&gt;<i> the MediaWiki semantic wiki options and seen some possibilities for
</I>&gt;<i> exporting the positions in XML, which is neat, too. &#160;Over time I expect to
</I>&gt;<i> make more process, but in the mean time I wanted to ask you to inform us
</I>on
&gt;<i> what you are looking to support for commenting and feedback in StratML.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are several criteria that make Votorola special and near and dear to
</I>&gt;<i> my heart and of course the bulk of this is due to Michael's deep study
</I>into
&gt;<i> the theory of communication and interaction, and how stuff gets done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I mull over how to write this down in some way I was wondering what
</I>&gt;<i> process you have in your mind for how Strategic Plans become a &quot;focus
</I>point&quot;
&gt;<i> for community and stakeholder action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does one or more of the MetaGov projects come closer to what you have in
</I>&gt;<i> mind?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine that you must be frustrated, sometimes, with the machine
</I>&gt;<i> readability of the software here :) &#160;In working with Michael the last year
</I>I
&gt;<i> have seen how much thought he is putting into his coding work, and I am
</I>sure
&gt;<i> the same is true for everyone else as well. &#160;I think it'll come sooner
</I>&gt;<i> rather than later, and we are still working on prototyping the basic
</I>&gt;<i> services before we implement a data standard for the positions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, how will stakeholders interact around a StratML plan in this and later
</I>&gt;<i> versions? &#160;Will they be commenting on particular objectives? &#160;Contacting
</I>&gt;<i> particular stakeholders? &#160;Are you planning on offering some form of
</I>&gt;<i> notification standard that delivers comments on a plan back to the public
</I>as
&gt;<i> well, so that these comments can then be seen by others? &#160;Will there be a
</I>&gt;<i> requirement for notifications, so that stakeholders can receive
</I>&gt;<i> notifications of comments on their or other objectives?

</I>&gt;<i> support of those purposes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW, I have been encouraging IRS to enable tax-exempt charitable
</I>&gt;<i> organizations to document their missions, visions, values, goals,
</I>&gt;<i> objectives, and stakeholders on their own websites in StratML format.
</I>&gt;<i> Section 10 of the new GPRA Modernization Act (GMA) requires U.S. federal
</I>&gt;<i> agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in
</I>&gt;<i> machine-readable formats (like StratML).&#160; &#147;Tax-expeditures&#148; (such as
</I>&gt;<i> deductions attributable to donations to qualified charities) are
</I>referenced
&gt;<i> five times in the Act.&#160; So it will be necessary for agencies to estimate
</I>the
&gt;<i> amount of tax revenue not collected due to donations to charities pursuing
</I>&gt;<i> objectives that complement those of the agencies themselves.&#160; Rendering
</I>the
&gt;<i> plans of .gov agencies and tax-exempt charities in StratML format will
</I>&gt;<i> facilitate compliance with this new provision of law.&#160; The data
</I>requirements
&gt;<i> associated with the GMA will be prime topics of consideration in StratML
</I>&gt;<i> Part 3.
