I thought about this issue too. And I agree, we need a mechanism to 
govern ourselves. Basically for every desicion, let it be the homepage, 
the licence, the admin-rules etc. Ofc we can use our own tools to vote 
on it. But we would first need to find out, what the conditions are to 
say, a poll is finished. What is consensus? Do we want the same 
consensus in every question? Imo destroying the project should be harder 
than changing the homepage ... So this is the meta-question we were 
talking about some time ago: When is a question decided? (To make it 
even more complicated: the meta-meta-question: When is the meta-question 
decided? :-)
