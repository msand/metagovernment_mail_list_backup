&gt;<i> It would be interesting to set up a system where an action (let's

</I>&gt;<i> actions) only when everybody inside a group, (or at least n people
</I>&gt;<i> out of a group, or at least ... but considering that this person
</I>&gt;<i> counts more...) agrees on it.

</I>
The action that follows on a vote is something that's been called
&quot;promulgation&quot; in some contexts, so I borrowed the term here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/prom.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/prom.xht</A>
A mechanism for it (one possible mechanism) is something Alex calls
&quot;vote processing&quot;:
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Alex.rollin-GmailCom/Vote_Processing">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Alex.rollin-GmailCom/Vote_Processing</A>

It's interesting because any number of promulgation mechanisms may
operate over the same vote-base, and they may compete with each other.
In addition to any administrative mechanisms we may design, there are
also social ones that we have no control over.  Those might be some
help in safeguarding against administrations that, despite our best
intentions, get out of control (topic of another thread).
