Just a reminder, if anyone is interested in applying for this, the  
next application deadline is January 17. I am considering submitting  
an application myself: such a fellowship would free me to work on this  
project full time and put extensive resources into providing better  
coordination and organization. Others may wish to apply for  
fellowships to work on Metagovernment or on more specific projects  
(i.e., the &quot;member projects&quot;).

Any one of us getting such a fellowship would probably be a tremendous  
boon, as the &quot;official&quot; approval of an organization like Soros would  
give us a lot of general credibility.

If you are considering applying, please reply here if you are  
comfortable doing so.

Also note there are other similar grants such as Ashoka.
