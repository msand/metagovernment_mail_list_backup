<PRE>Describing use cases is a nice thing to start with, but it also should be
illustrated using some pictures which visualize the described process.
I think the use case that is chosen
(<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>) is improvable ;)
It just doesn't make sense to the average person. You need examples that
might be relevant to the average person.

So instead of talking about poll Y or poll Z or whatever...
...it might be better to find examples that make sense to the average person
and that shows all the functionality of the solution that is being
exemplified. 

I believe  the average person is not good in deriving an interesting
particular case from the general one, but I believe the average person is
much more skilled in deriving an intuitive general concept from a particular
case of interest.

After this intuitive concept is acquired, it is much easier for the average
person to transfer this knowledge to other particular cases of interest.

Hi everybody,

(I haven't been active for a while, because I changed my pc from Windows 
XP to Linux/Ubuntu. What an adventure! Right now I feel, it was very 
much worth the effort. But in between I had some really doubtful 
moments! LOL ...)

Wow, so much happend on the list in the meantime.

Welcome Alex, good to see you here!

I agree, that would be really really helpful!
And additionally I believe it also would be very helpful to demonstrate 
the tools to new people, i.e. really use them together. Isn't it always 
best to do both: Explain *and* show how something works?

For a start for the explanatory part of the crossforum theatre I drafted 
a use case scenario in our wiki here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>

Since you have experiences with Power Point, ... would this be a good 
way to start?

Best, Thomas
