<PRE>Dear All,
sorry for not having participated lately.
I am very busy with the organizing of the event,
but I have some great news that I am dying to tell you.

What happened is that we could not find a space, so we kept on looking
around, and eventually we got in touch with some political parties.
Two of them (Radicali and Mov5stelle) were interested, and one
(Movimento 5 stelle) immediately offered the room
They are the group referring to Beppe Grillo, the italian comedian
that recently (last years) started interacting with Politics.

In brief Beppe was a very loved comedian, who was not allowed to go on
television because he would say things that politicians did not like.
So he started a blog, and eventually reached the size where every day
he would write a post and have between 700 and 3000 comments
_each_post_!
At some point he called for a manifestation, the V day, V for
Vaffanculo=fuck_off, and thousands of people went on the street. The
manifestation was not supported by the media, no one expected it. And
the media and the politicians were taken by surprise. Now he is one of
the few political leader (although you cannot call him  a politician),
that have ideas and proposals.

At some point, in his blog, he asked people to get in touch with each
other using meet_up. And suddenly the whole italy started organising.
Each town would have its own Beppe Grillo meet up, where people would
assemble, discuss, denounce, and suggest. Often the work of the
various meet up would be then sent to Beppe who would show it in the
blog. Let me clarify, the whole structure it is far from perfect. It
is a very hierarchical structure, where Beppe decides a lot of what
goes on. Local groups decide what to do locally, but there is no
&quot;democratic&quot; decision making at the national level.

Well, the meet up of Beppe Grillo from Milan got interested in the
event. So we started speaking.

Their problem was somehow the opposite of ours: what if we organise
the event and 200 people turn up?

(1) can your software handle them

(2) the room itself cannot handle them.

So we decided that 40 people was about the maximum size of the
experiment we wanted to do for now.
And they did organise it:
<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/Grilli-Milano/events/16350419/">http://www.meetup.com/Grilli-Milano/events/16350419/</A>

if the above link is broken you can use:
<A HREF="http://bit.ly/ee7oNj">http://bit.ly/ee7oNj</A>

I am very excited about this group, not only they really represent an
alternative way of doing politics, very much internet centered (you
remember I spoke to you about it before). Also the person who is
organizing it, Livio Lo Verso, is a person who has studied voting
theory and rational choice at the university and convinced the whole
group from Milan to use Condorcet voting to elect the people
representing the movement at the Milan elections. A great achievement,
by itself.

So when I contacted him, he already have read the papers I wrote about
Vilfredo, and I only needed to explain him few details.

This event represent a test in so many ways:
we are testing if Vilfredo can be used by a group of people who are
all at the same time in a room.
We would be testing if Vilfredo can be used for more than 15 people.

If the system works they might use it in their own internal
discussions. In this working with a new party where the roles are not
congealed is much better. In a more older party people just do not
accept to have an external system decide for them. Even if this
decision is the emergent result of many people.


Cross your fingers :-).

Cheers,
Pietro

</PRE>
