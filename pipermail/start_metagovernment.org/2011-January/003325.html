<PRE>Rather than engaging in bureaucratic double-speak to offset the shortcomings
of others, I'd rather: a) join together with those who share my objectives
to try to achieve them, and b) do our best to hold not only ourselves but
also others accountable for living up to their avowed values, including the
values of democracy.

 

It seems to me that Metagov applications could be used to help Congress and
.gov agencies understand how they might more effectively uphold their avowed
values, including service to citizens, and potentially to improve their
performance.   At least I continue to hope that might be the case.

 

I continue to believe the concept of &quot;governance&quot; has been vastly oversold.

The debate in question was over the term used to describe the concept, not
the group. So for the moment, Metagovernment (or Metagov) is still the name
of this group. In fact, I think there was a separate Vilfredo proposal about
that.

 

This was a discussion of whether or not we could use a better term for the
overarching idea, which this project first called Open Source Governance and
then Collaborative Governance:

<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance</A>

 

If you disagree, then we haven't reached consensus. Same with Michael. And
so presumably we stick with the status quo. Collaborative Governance isn't a
bad term; it was just felt by some that it is not easily understood by
others and that it doesn't convey much sense of democracy.

 

The idea behind using the term Open Democracy is that it does pretty well
bring up an image of what we are talking about. And while all democracy is
supposedly &quot;open,&quot; the fact that we would describe this brand as &quot;open&quot;
hopefully makes the listener/reader question what makes it different from
all other brands of democracy.

 

Here in the U.S., I certainly don't feel that democracy is open when
Congress has secret sessions, the executive branch has entire secret
agencies and vast troves of secret information, and much of the legislative
process is done without any *chance* for me to have any meaningful input.
Much of our legislative process at every level of government is carried out
in &quot;informal&quot; meetings between lobbyists and politicians: not something that
is open or democratic in any way.

 

So given all of the above, can you get on board with the term, or would you
like to propose another (or stick with what we have)?

Since I apparently have not used Vilfredo to vote on this issue, I won't
feel that I've been treated unjustly if others decide to use Vilfredo (or
Votorola or any other means) to agree to use the term &quot;Open Democracy&quot; --
even though it doesn't make a lot of sense to me and I may not choose to use
that term myself.  (I'll probably to continue to use the term &quot;Metagov&quot; in
one way or another, at least until I'm banished from the group.)

 

To me, democracy is not democracy unless it is open in the sense that
everyone has an equal opportunity to influence the outcome.  So, to that
degree, it seems to me calling democracy &quot;open&quot; is redundant.

 

It seems to me that the primary objective of the Metagov group is to apply
electronic means to enable individuals who choose to do so to participate
more efficiently and effectively in decision-making in which they have an
interest.

 

It also seems to me that it cannot accurately be called &quot;open&quot; unless
individuals are free to use any means *they* choose to participate.

 

Thus, while it doesn't make a lot of sense to me yet, I am encouraged by my
understanding of the intent of Michael's so-called &quot;cross-forum theatre&quot;. 

 

(It seems to me that what is required to support the concept efficiently and
effectively is an open data standard for posting the necessary information
on the Web.  To me, it seems that XML is the logical choice for the format
of the data and that the challenge is to agree upon the core elements and
structure of the data to be shared.)

 

&quot;Metagov: Open, Electronically Facilitated Group Decision-Making on the Web&quot;
may not be a concise or catchy phrase but it seems to me to be what we're
talking about, isn't it?

define+government&gt;  ~ the management or control of something

&quot;Gov&quot; (as in .gov) implies *electronic* government (eGov)

 

Metagov is about the use of electronic means to manage or control something.


 

Personally, I'd prefer that such means be &quot;open&quot; (in the sense of open
data). 

 

I am adamantly opposed to trying to use such means to impose management or
control over anyone who does not explicitly agree to the use of such means
for an explicitly identified objective.

 

I would prefer that such objectives focus on results that can be observed
and measured in the real world -- and achieved by those who are
participating -- rather than merely opinions about what somebody else might
be expected, much less forced to do against their will.

Dear all,

before deciding that we had enough, I would like to invite you all to

look at page:

<A HREF="http://bit.ly/icpaWg">http://bit.ly/icpaWg</A>

 

Please scroll through it, it is quite long.

Here we can see the automatic analysis of what has happened in the

last generation.

In particular we can see that we nearly all agree on &quot;open democracy&quot;,

but for Michael Maranda.

Michael is a key player and the only person who, by not voting would

have changed the result.

You can see this at the end of the page.

 

If now we all decide to accept Open Democracy without recognizing and

facing this situation we would be making an injustice respect to

Michael.

 

But please note that Michael hasn't been stable in his decision not to

support Open Democracy.

If we look at the page of the Open Democracy proposal:

<A HREF="http://bit.ly/etQfyV">http://bit.ly/etQfyV</A>

 

we can see that in generation 12 he HAS supported Open Democracy.

So something must have changed between generation 12 and generation 13.

 

So I would like to invite Michael to step up and tell us:

a) Can he give us a feedback and tell us what is wrong with the &quot;open

democracy&quot; proposal. And why was he willing to support it in

Generation 12 but not in any subsequent generation.

b) Can he write an alternative to it? ( BTW, actually Vilfredo.org

sent him an email automatically asking him to write an alternative;

Michael, did you receive it alright? I'd like to know it as a

developer)

c) If he is unable to give an alternative, is he willing to keep on

participating with Metagovernment.org even if we go forward and chose

the term open democracy?

 

And if Michael does not like that we go forward, but cannot point out

what is wrong with &quot;open Democracy&quot; in a way that some of us might,

and and he cannot offer an alternative then we should do something

else.

 

Vilfredo has helped us to see all the alternatives, we have voted,

analysed possible variations, until we have reached a stable solution.

But the stable situation is not one solution, but two alternatives.

 

So the suggestion that I will bring forward is that the question

 

has now been transformed from an open question to a closed question.

 

 

We put to vote the answer to this with the only two solutions the

community has found.

As suggested in other mails the voting should be using a Condorcet

voting system.

Which is a pairwise voting system. And mathematically I believe the

most sound system.

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</A>

 

But a pairwise system among two alternatives is essentially the same

than a simple poll.

So in this case we just can ask everybody to vote among the two
alternatives.

 

All this might seem unnecessarily formal, but I believe we are setting

up a procedure, and the procedure must be set up properly.

 

 

Thanks,

Pietro

 

What follow are the alternatives.

Abstract

 

Open Democracy

 

Here I copied a list of forms of government (Source: Wikipedia).

 

A properly defined name for &quot;open source governance&quot; shall fit nicely

into the list. This -I think- is the main criteria to take care of.

 

Most of us like &quot;open source governance&quot;, we just want to change it

for something less geek. So, I start a step-by-step transformation

from this point, adding, removing and changing words.

 

Open Source Governance -&gt; Open Source Democracy

 

Open Source Democracy -&gt; Open Democracy

 

That's it.

 

Authoritarian (The Rule of the few)

Dictatorship

Military dictatorship

Stratocracy

Dictatorship of the proletariat

Enlightened absolutism

Kleptocracy

Kritarchy

Monarchy

Absolute monarchy

Constitutional monarchy

Despotism

Duchy

Grand Duchy

Diarchy

Enlightened absolutism

Elective monarchy

Hereditary monarchy

Popular monarchy

Principality

New Monarchs

Self-proclaimed monarchy

Plutocracy

Timocracy

Police state

Oligarchy

Saeculum obscurum

Theocracy

Tyranny

Anarchism (Government of consent, not coercion)

Anarchist communism

Libertarian socialism

Libertarian municipalism

Anarcho-capitalism

Green anarchism

Isocracy

Local Government

Democracy (The Rule of the many)

Consociationalism

Crowd Governance

Deliberative democracy

Democratic socialism

Direct democracy

Futarchy

Participatory democracy

Representative democracy

Parliamentary system

Consensus government

Westminster system

Polyarchy

Presidential system

Semi-presidential system

Republicanism

Constitutional republic

Parliamentary republic

Totalitarian democracy

 

 

And

B) Criteria For The Ideal Phrase

 

The ideal phrase would find a good balance between the following attributes:

- accuracy

- clarity

- brevity

- descriptiveness

- uniqueness of meaning

 

It would also take into account the connotations of the words (common

usage and understood meanings), rather than their denotations (strict

definitions).

 

Timelessness, though desirable, is not a requirement:  the criteria

would recognize that meanings evolve, and so this phrase is not an

endpoint, but merely one stepping stone along the path.

 

It would be useful for the term to be appropriate to both online and

offline methods/activities.

 

Neologisms may or may not be useful.
