<PRE>Hello Jonas,

Welcome to our list!

It's always a good feeling, to meet likeminded people!

I read through the manifesto of your party and many things a very 
similiar to what we are doing with Votorola, especially the delegation. 
Now I'm particularily interested in what you call &quot;Document evolution&quot;. 
Please foregive me, if I inadvertently missed the explanation, but my 
question is:

How does this evolution happen?

Like this?:

A proposal cannot be changed once it is published. Lets say it gets 
rejected. So someone publishes another proposal, which he feels might 
reach consensus. But it also gets rejected. And so on, until a good 
enough proposal emerges.

Now in a large scale implementation with millions of voters we would 
expect thousends of proposals in parallel for one single question, 
right? Does the evolution of documents just happen by all the people (or 
delegates) looking through and voting for or against all those proposals?

The concept behind Votorola is, that a proposal can change all the time, 
whenever there is a good reason (a large majority wants a change, a 
typo, or a good argument, ...) This way we expect to reduce the 
overwhelming amount of proposals to the necessary minimum.

Do you understand what I mean? Did I miss the point in your manifesto?

Greetings,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sweden has a minimal requirement for parties in order to get parliament,
</I>&gt;<i> and that is to get 4% of the votes. That equals about 250.000 votes.
</I>&gt;<i> Aktiv Demokrati got about 85 votes in the last election.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I decided to dive into Aktiv Demokrati in 2010 and started to transform

</I>&gt;<i> impression and to communicate the idea in a clear way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aktiv Demokrati has existed since 2002. But none of the active members
</I>&gt;<i> had any programming skills. From that perspective you could say that we
</I>&gt;<i> haven't even started yet. But I'm now determined to make this happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's time to actually implement the online direct democracy system. The
</I>&gt;<i> manifest was written in about 2002. An english version of it is found
</I>&gt;<i> here: <A HREF="http://aktivdemokrati.se/manifesto/">http://aktivdemokrati.se/manifesto/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There actually was an implementation of the system, that's still in
</I>&gt;<i> development. But the programmer never helped to install the system and
</I>&gt;<i> the people in the paty at the time didn't know how to do it. That system
</I>&gt;<i> is DemoWave. <A HREF="http://home.gna.org/demowave/">http://home.gna.org/demowave/</A> Latest version is availible
</I>&gt;<i> here: <A HREF="https://github.com/redhog/DemoWave">https://github.com/redhog/DemoWave</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have programmed in Perl for many years and spent the last 10 years
</I>&gt;<i> building an application framework based on RDF. That has been a one-man
</I>&gt;<i> project for all this time, but it's a very useful and (in my taste)
</I>&gt;<i> impressive system. My brother has actually helped me in development and
</I>&gt;<i> he is also using the system for several websites. He (Fredrik) actually
</I>&gt;<i> did an implementation of our system with delegation and the system for
</I>&gt;<i> continuous voting, that you can se explained in the bottom half of the
</I>&gt;<i> manifesto. That implementation is working and has good potential. The
</I>&gt;<i> git archive is here: <A HREF="http://git.para.se/?p=active_democracy.git">http://git.para.se/?p=active_democracy.git</A> -- But
</I>&gt;<i> it uses the framework that I have developed.  It's good but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think that anybody has ever installed it without my explicit help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm currently evaluating the options for going forward. I looked around
</I>&gt;<i> and collected a few projects for further evaluation.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://aktivdemokrati.se/programvara/">http://aktivdemokrati.se/programvara/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aktiv Demokrati has 10 years of discussions about the implementation.
</I>&gt;<i> Let's take the next step.
