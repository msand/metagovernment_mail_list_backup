<PRE>Hello everyone,


This is my introductory post.


I am brazilian, 29 years old, software developer an social media enthusiast.
A part of my family is involved in traditional politics, but as

for myself, I've never been too much into it. What happens is that I came
across the concept of liquid democracy some time ago, and even had

a friend developing a voting and transparency web tool, which he abandoned.
But the idea stayed with me, and last weekend, at brazilian

version of Campus Party, I proposed during Ben Hammersley talk (from Wired
UK) that we create some new kind of party in Brazil, much like

DemoEx. His speech was an inspirational call for brazilians to go and
'change the world', as we emerge as a developed and young nation that

is part of the BRIC. Ben asked me go onto stage and talk to a broad audience
about the idea. Now I feel entitled to carry this to another

level, regardless the monstrous bureaucracy required to create a party in my
country.


Then I was researching for direct democracy initiatives in Brazil and abroad
and I came across metagovernment. I haven't had time to read

through the archives yet, but I don't wish to lose the timing here, because
the event had some press coverage and I want to attract public

attention to the matter, and later mature it. By the way, if the list has
brazilians participating, raise your hands! I arranged witha

reporter to get back to him by the end of this week and report my findings
and how much I could develop from the idea.

I have been reading about Demoex in Sweden, PDI in Spain, Senator Online in
Australia... Their reality is very different from ours, but I am

sure there are many valuable experiences that we can learn from.


Regards.,


Thiago Ganzarolli
