<PRE>Welcome, Thiago!

We haven't been ignoring you... this list just tends to focus on  
direct questions at the moment. Are you in the process of building a  
party now?

A lot of us are not particularly party-oriented. They way I se  
collaborative governance evolving is as a ground-up gradual  
replacement for current systems, not an internal replacement. But  
there is certainly a lot of value to at least trying the approaches of  
DemoEx, PDI, Activ Demokrati, and Senator Online. I would note as I  
did in my previous post that the reason DemoEx appears to have been  
successful is that they thought small. Trying to take over the  
government of Brazil is a gigantic task. Trying to get a foot into  
your town council is much more plausible in the current landscape.

Regardless, whatever approach you take, please post more here and let  
us know. We would be happy support you as we can.

&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my introductory post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am brazilian, 29 years old, software developer an social media  
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiast. A part of my family is involved in traditional politics,  
</I>&gt;<i> but as
</I>&gt;<i> for myself, I've never been too much into it. What happens is that I  
</I>&gt;<i> came across the concept of liquid democracy some time ago, and even  
</I>&gt;<i> had
</I>&gt;<i> a friend developing a voting and transparency web tool, which he  
</I>&gt;<i> abandoned. But the idea stayed with me, and last weekend, at brazilian
</I>&gt;<i> version of Campus Party, I proposed during Ben Hammersley talk (from  
</I>&gt;<i> Wired UK) that we create some new kind of party in Brazil, much like
</I>&gt;<i> DemoEx. His speech was an inspirational call for brazilians to go  
</I>&gt;<i> and 'change the world', as we emerge as a developed and young nation  
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> is part of the BRIC. Ben asked me go onto stage and talk to a broad  
</I>&gt;<i> audience about the idea. Now I feel entitled to carry this to another
</I>&gt;<i> level, regardless the monstrous bureaucracy required to create a  
</I>&gt;<i> party in my country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I was researching for direct democracy initiatives in Brazil  
</I>&gt;<i> and abroad and I came across metagovernment. I haven't had time to  
</I>&gt;<i> read
</I>&gt;<i> through the archives yet, but I don't wish to lose the timing here,  
</I>&gt;<i> because the event had some press coverage and I want to attract public
</I>&gt;<i> attention to the matter, and later mature it. By the way, if the  
</I>&gt;<i> list has brazilians participating, raise your hands! I arranged witha
</I>&gt;<i> reporter to get back to him by the end of this week and report my  
</I>&gt;<i> findings and how much I could develop from the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been reading about Demoex in Sweden, PDI in Spain, Senator  
</I>&gt;<i> Online in Australia... Their reality is very different from ours,  
</I>&gt;<i> but I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure there are many valuable experiences that we can learn from.
</I>&gt;<i>
