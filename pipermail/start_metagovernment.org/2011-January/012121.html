</I>
The tux site is currently at:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/</A>

I could make a CNAME to point crossforum.metagovernment.org there, but  
I was hoping to be more ambitious... to migrate the wiki there and  
thus have all of our resources in the hands of more than one admin. In  
that case, we would have, e.g.:
metagovernment.org/wiki
metagovernment.org/crossforum
metagovernment.org/discussion
metagovernment.org/blog
etc.... all on the shared tux site.

To do that, there are two issues to resolve:

1. Adding Michael Allen as an admin of the tuxfamily hosting site. In  
accordance with the admin policy we have used in the past, as a  
current active member of the list, he's eligible if nobody objects.

Does anyone object to my making Michael an admin?

If nobody objects, then there is also the question of what level. I  
can give him admin rights on the website or on the entire project. And  
there are three levels of admin rights, in progressively higher order:  
modify (standard admin stuff), manage acl (add/remove other admins,  
including me), destroy (delete the project). I have no objection to  
giving Michael complete (destroy) access to the entire project, as he  
is a long-term and obviously very committed member of the project. But  
I will only go as high as consensus decides.

2. Modify the wiki's copyright to remove the NC designation so that it  
is compliant with tux's principles. I think I should make a separate e- 
mail just about that.
