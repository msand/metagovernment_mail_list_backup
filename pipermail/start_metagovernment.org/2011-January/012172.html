Of course the questioner can propose. In fact we need to insert all
the other possibilities, like who can propose (vote): (those users/
only the registered users/ anybody). And there will also be the
possibility that if you have proposed you skip a turn in voting. But
this is useless if people identity is not verified.

In any case the next thing that will be done are:

page: &quot;user in a question&quot; ( a page to track what a single user has
done in a question, so to understand him better, and use this
information to make a proposal more palatable to him/her)

Note space (each proposal should have an extra space for notes from
the author. This will permit to divide between the proposal and any
other comment, and meta comment. Example, this is just the same
proposal as ..., but it integrates the idea from ... ).

Derivation Table (you might have noticed that now you can click on a
past proposal and immediately fill in the edit box to send a mutation
of that proposal. We need to track when this procedure is used, so we
can generate phylogenetic tree of the proposals presented.

And (at great request): the comments! (That is when you do not support
a proposal you can write why. This will be visible if the proposal
wins, and is in the Pareto Front. Then other people can read what was
wrong with that, and mutate it.)
Each time a proposal that has received some comments will be voted
again, the comments will be visible. Thus introducing some bias, as
people will see why they should NOT vote for that proposal. This will
also slightly push people toward writing new proposal hopefully
addressing the comments presented.
The idea is that comments should be allowed but should be integrated
with the system.

All this have been thought over and over for many months, and is
intellectually clear in me so much that I just need to find the time
to code it.
