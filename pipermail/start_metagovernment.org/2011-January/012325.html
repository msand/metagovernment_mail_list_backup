</I>&gt;<i> But if they agree, what do they all have in common? Please correct me!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - They all have proposals and votes for it.
</I>&gt;<i> - Some will have their votes structured in delegation trees, others  
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i> - Some of the delegetions will be from within this poll, some will  
</I>&gt;<i> be across several polls (e.g. all environmental polls).
</I>&gt;<i> - Some will have the proposals structured in parents and children,  
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. Aktiv Demokrati
</I>&gt;<i> - Some tools, e.g. Vilfredo, will have different phases like  
</I>&gt;<i> drafting, voting, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I feel all of that could be displayed in a forest of trees  
</I>&gt;<i> (delegation-tools) and bushes (non-delegation-tools).

Couldn't the visualization itself take the form of a plug-in  
architecture where people can add-in/swap-out new ways of viewing the  
theater to match their preferences? In other words, along the lines of  
a skin on a website. Look at the preferences dialog in Wikipedia as a  
model... two different people can have radically different experiences  
of the same underlying content; not just in terms of appearance, but  
also to some extent in terms of behavior.
