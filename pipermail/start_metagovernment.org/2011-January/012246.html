Cheers to that!

I guess we're in the same boat.  I have no idea how to sail it, so you
better stick around. :-)

I installed the theatre prototype here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumG">http://metagovernment.tuxfamily.org/crossforum/#c=DumG</A>

It lacks technical documentation.  At some point, we'll have to tell
potential developers how to build it from source and get it running
like that.  (Pretty easy to do.)  We might even want to link to the
dev docs from the app itself.  (I'm also mindful of Thomas's reminder
that we need in-app controls for dialing up different combinations of
feed and map components, since that's perhaps the main attraction.)

&gt;<i> &gt; If someone with admin skills were to set up a vanilla install of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Semantic MediaWiki on the tuxfamily site (assuming the pollwiki's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a go with you guys) then that would be a great help.  Myself, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; only need to be made a Sysop of the wiki, and I could do the rest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Can you do this, or do you need me to? My only issue (other than my
</I>&gt;<i> ongoing time crunch) is where to put it. When we move the
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org domain, the current wiki will reside in /w/ and /
</I>&gt;<i> wiki/. For this, are you looking for /pollwiki/? And if you need a
</I>&gt;<i> second directory, perhaps /p/?
</I>
That should work.

I can do the install.  But I've been thinking about Alex's objections
which seem justified.  I'm wondering if it might be better to wait
till we have the first bit of cross-project stuff on the drawing
board.  Then we could discuss it and install just the pieces of the
pollwiki that we agreed were necessary to make it work.  So we could
build up the pollwiki piece by piece, with rough consensus on its
structure.  Do you know what I mean?
