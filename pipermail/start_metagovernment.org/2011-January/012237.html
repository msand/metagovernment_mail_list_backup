I misunderstood you!  I thought you were saying that crossforum
theatre is unoriginal.  Others have produced it already, &quot;So why
re-invent the wheel?&quot;

Instead you're saying it could have been produced in Drupal/PHP, &quot;So
why produce it in GWT/Java?&quot;

I guess Conseo has answered in the other thread, so I won't cross his
thread.
