Just to add to my other post in the Drupal thread: Alex, I share your point of 
view, but I think we are *not* reinventing the wheel here. In fact we do the 
opposite. Michael has split up the concept not only on a library middleware 
perspective, but on the level of whole entities of the network. That way what 
we do is only focusing on the necessary glue in between abstract concepts of 
these entities like pollservers, drafting media or discussion media. We do 
*more* code sharing than that although we implement our infrastructure from 
scratch. It is maybe not easy to see, but feeding services and likely even the 
mapper are not too difficult to program, since they are basic concepts of 
UI-/Web-programming and data handling anyway. But using some middleware we get 
locked in their perspective of the web, which is in case of Atom already a 
design problem for us. We can easily plug in middleware later to put our data 
in any standard form you like. I'd like to do it for Atom with Abdera at least 
for the feed service, but this is low priority atm, as Crossforum is the way 
to go.

Btw.: Why do you (or any other critically educted mind) use GMail? I really 
don't like leaking all my mail traffic to G-datahell. The list is public anyway, 
but that way I can't even talk to the persons privately anymore :-/ Setting up 
a mailserver + some dyndns account is no magic anymore today and gives you a 
much better performance and flexibility than GMail ever will.
&lt;/rant&gt;
