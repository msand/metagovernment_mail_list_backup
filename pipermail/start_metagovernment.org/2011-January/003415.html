<PRE>Hi Owen,

I was wondering if you could give us some detail about the interactive
features of StratML.

A lot of the Metagov projects are focused on the interaction between
stakeholders of various types.

I asked you a similar question about the newest and latest version of
StratML that was just being approved, v2?  and I didn't really understand
what you had planned for interaction.

I've been considering the next steps in documenting the options that
Votorola users have.  As I may have mentioned to you, I am interested in
doing additional work to format the positions that are used in Votorola
which might be considered a strategic plan, in many cases.  I have explored
the MediaWiki semantic wiki options and seen some possibilities for
exporting the positions in XML, which is neat, too.  Over time I expect to
make more process, but in the mean time I wanted to ask you to inform us on
what you are looking to support for commenting and feedback in StratML.

There are several criteria that make Votorola special and near and dear to
my heart and of course the bulk of this is due to Michael's deep study into
the theory of communication and interaction, and how stuff gets done.

As I mull over how to write this down in some way I was wondering what
process you have in your mind for how Strategic Plans become a &quot;focus point&quot;
for community and stakeholder action.

Does one or more of the MetaGov projects come closer to what you have in
mind?

I imagine that you must be frustrated, sometimes, with the machine
readability of the software here :)  In working with Michael the last year I
have seen how much thought he is putting into his coding work, and I am sure
the same is true for everyone else as well.  I think it'll come sooner
rather than later, and we are still working on prototyping the basic
services before we implement a data standard for the positions.

So, how will stakeholders interact around a StratML plan in this and later
versions?  Will they be commenting on particular objectives?  Contacting
particular stakeholders?  Are you planning on offering some form of
notification standard that delivers comments on a plan back to the public as
well, so that these comments can then be seen by others?  Will there be a
requirement for notifications, so that stakeholders can receive
notifications of comments on their or other objectives?
