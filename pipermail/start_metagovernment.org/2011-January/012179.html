<PRE>The Open Society Foundations' &quot;about&quot; statement is now in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OSF">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#OSF</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OSFwStyle.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OSFwStyle.xml</A>

BTW, the tragic shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords has highlighted once
again the threat not only to public officials but also to open lines of
communication with them.  No doubt, it will lead to more caution and greater
restrictions on F2F access to public official.  However, F2F communication
has always and will always be constrained by time and space anyway ... and
such constraints are artificial to the essential aspects of communication.  

Through the enlightened use of technology, greater openness and not merely
more but, more importantly, more efficient and effective communication with
elected officials can be achieved, unfettered by the constraints of time,
space, and the need for personal security.  

Of course, too, information technology can help reduce the need to defer our
own responsibilities to others, thereby granting them disproportionate power
and recognition, which in turn makes them targets for attack, literally as
well as figuratively.

Just a reminder, if anyone is interested in applying for this, the  
next application deadline is January 17. I am considering submitting  
an application myself: such a fellowship would free me to work on this  
project full time and put extensive resources into providing better  
coordination and organization. Others may wish to apply for  
fellowships to work on Metagovernment or on more specific projects  
(i.e., the &quot;member projects&quot;).

Any one of us getting such a fellowship would probably be a tremendous  
boon, as the &quot;official&quot; approval of an organization like Soros would  
give us a lot of general credibility.

If you are considering applying, please reply here if you are  
comfortable doing so.

Also note there are other similar grants such as Ashoka.
