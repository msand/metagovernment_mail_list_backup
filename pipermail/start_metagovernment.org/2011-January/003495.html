<PRE>SUCCESS!

Dear All,
the question on the question to ask has reached a consensus. You can see in
the image the proposals and who voted for what:

Or by going here&lt;<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewgeneration.php?q=102&amp;g=1&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewgeneration.php?q=102&amp;g=1&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>&gt;
:<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewgeneration.php?q=102&amp;g=1&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewgeneration.php?q=102&amp;g=1&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>
</I>
I am really super happy, because we have been hitting a wall on this
question for such a long time,
often some of us having the intuition that the question was really not well
written, and we should have asked it in a different way.
Writing a question is in itself not a simple business.
It might need less time than answering the actual question, but the process
itself is important.

Now we know the question written has the support of:
Vilfredo, Thomas, dreamer, Michael and Ed.
Unfortunately Owen and Cynthia (Cin) did not vote, although they both
presented their own proposals.
They were invited to vote by email, so I am sure they either did not care of
the result or were happy with any result.
...and... this is what the result says:


Instead of asking a single question, ask multiple questions, all in the same
format.
The questions should be:
Please define: ...
where the dots stand for all the possible names that have been used so far
(at least the ones suggested in the question before). Each user can chose,
and add the request to formalise a question. This work could have an effect
that go beyond this community, as it could be used as a seed for wikipedia
page.
Examples:
Please define open government;
Please define open governance;
Please define peer to peer government;
Please define open democracy;
Please define peer to peer  democracy;
Please define democracy 2.0;
Please define democracy 3.0;
and so on.
Then once those definitions are set, we can discuss and find out if we all
want to develop the same form society, or a series of tools interrelated.


So, if you feel like trying to write a question, please take one, and give
it a try.
We just try to do them all in the Metagovernment
room&lt;<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>&gt;
I don't think we need to run them in series.
We could start them all with the usual 1 week of maximum time.
And starting each of them once a day.

So, how was your experience? Do you think from now on we should run those
meta-questions more often, before asking the real question?

Cheers,
Pietro
