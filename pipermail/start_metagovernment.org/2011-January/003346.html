<PRE>It seems we are getting closer to a &quot;standard&quot; for the information
needed for a &quot;poll&quot; or other consensus building process to continue
online.

Things in this email in &quot;marks&quot; are simple recommendations, as all of
it is, and not meant to be set in stone or to be taken as
argumentative or rude.  Please forgive me if my writing comes across
that way.  Email sucks.

So, for the last thread we were talking about cross-forum theater and
the kind of data/information that the display would eat/show to users.
 Mike's idea was that the &quot;action&quot; for cross-forum would be the
&quot;Difference,&quot; the comparison between two positions.  Mike and so many
of us are highly super-enthused by the idea that people will actively
change positions and move these changes around.  It makes sense that
we &quot;Should&quot; design an &quot;activity viewer&quot; that displays this information
to users as the &quot;contents&quot; of such activity is what we imagine to be
the heart of wide-spread consensus building activities.

In the last post, Thomas requested an Mike delivered a succinct
description of what an &quot;activity packet&quot; for a &quot;Diff&quot; might look like.
 The idea is that this activity would have a bunch of metadata
attached to it that would allow us to show the activity in several
contexts useful to the user.  Loaded into this is an assumption that
the user is in need of a way to act on this activity, also, in
addition to reading it, and I'll get to that in a minute.

Here's the basics Mike listed for the &quot;Diff&quot; activity packet.

This is the packet of information that the cross-forum app can use to
show information to the user.

 a) Post URL: full URI where the post of the Difference is located.
 b) &quot;140 char&quot; summary of diff by the author of the Difference
 c) Diff URL: full URI of the comparison/diff between 2 positions
 d) URLs of the two positions being compared/&quot;Diff'd&quot;
 e) Poll ID: Some unique string that is the same for both positions

In addition to this we are also assuming that there will be a whole
bunch of additional meta-data  that is useful to the task of
displaying this information contextually as a &quot;stream&quot; or map or in
any other way that will help the user to make sense of a lot of
conversation and allow them to focus on an area/section that is
important to them.  Some of this metadata might be:

1.  Friend status - is the author a &quot;friend&quot; through some social network
2.  Tree status - is the author up or down the &quot;tree&quot;, in-line, or in
another &quot;branch&quot;
3.  Tree changes - what changes have ensued in the tree that are
related to this change (more/less supporters)
4.  Location information - location of author, location of poll,
action/outcome location (poll in Germany about something in Indonesia)
5.  Resulting cross-forum action - how many people clicked on or
interacted with this post
6.  Status of poll - have conditions, if any, been met?  What are the
conditions?
7.  Poll rank - priority of the poll in your own ranking system, and
across your allies

I am sure that anyone who puts their mind to it can come up with some
interesting things related to to additional metadata based on what
they would want to get out of this app, and what information would be
needed for them to get that outcome.

Building on what Owen and others have said, I would highly recommend
that this description you just wrote, Mike, become a document to be
built upon over time.  I do my little bit here to write a more general
description, above, towards that effort.  My new &quot;position,&quot; if you
will.  This could eventually become an &quot;oVote Diff standard&quot; like the
oStatus standard: <A HREF="http://ostatus.org/specification">http://ostatus.org/specification</A>

If a standard, then, any system engaged in the most basic of consensus
building activities would want to implement this standard so that they
could participate in an ever widening circle of consensus building
discussion and simultaneously give their user/participants more
freedom in how they participate.  Win-win-win.

I'd like to take this a step further, and backwards, now.  Again,
please take what I offer as constructive contribution as opposed to
critique.  I am attempting to leave all critique out of this email,
and shoudl you feel you encounter any, please give me the benefit of
the doubt.

To give some prologue, I am in total agreement about the concept of
&quot;consensus-splitting&quot; and vote mirroring.  This is a hugely important
concept and underlies the importance and feeling of immediacy of
cross-forum and the evolution of standards for cross-talk between
consensus building systems.

I believe that as the actual &quot;content&quot; of the data layer for the
cross-forum &quot;eVote Diff Standard&quot; becomes clearer as a &quot;component&quot; in
the system that the entire open architecture that has become the real
product of the votorola work can take many strides forward.  With
Conseo's input, I am seeing that the cross-forum &quot;viewer&quot; is starting
to give other people from other projects a real taste of what we have
been working on with the advancement of Votorola.  This cross-talk and
these standards could become a rally point for other projects, and of
course many have individuals have shown an interest.

So, the step forward is to see that &quot;open consensus building&quot; and
&quot;cross-talk&quot; are entry points for the projects to work together
towards something.

The step backward (and forward again) is to start to open a larger
conversation around what a pollserver is, what a vote server is, and
what these things &quot;mean&quot; for individuals and groups who have consensus
building projects and also for those who simply want to participate in
the consensus building process within their own projects.

Implicit in the description of the &quot;eVote Comparison Standard&quot; is the
idea that a voting system provides the facility for users to:

1.  Create a unique poll
2.  Create  a position within that poll
3.  Allow users to vote for a position
4.  Allow another user to propose a competing position
5.  Allow a user to produce a &quot;Comparison/Diff&quot; between 2 position

I may be mistaken here, but, in short, this is the description of what
a &quot;pollserver&quot; does within the architecture of votorola.

Would this set of activities, and the accompanying data output (Unique
poll id, unique position id, Unique URI for (each, each version of a)
position) also be a good basis for a standard?

The standardization of such a thing would allow us to make the statement:

&quot;if you implement these things within your polling facility (or
application, or whatever you want to call it) and provide data access
(of this type and variety) then you can participate in these ways
within the open architecture.  Additionally your users will be able to
participate in the ever widening number of sites that are supported in
the &quot;cross-forum&quot; application that can be customized for your users,
giving them a new freedom to participate across the web.&quot;

I've gotten a bit mixed up over the last year that I've been working
with Thomas and Mike about where authentication takes place.
Authentication is a huge part of eliminating sock puppets and I don't
think anybody doubts the utility of it, and there seems to be a number
of places where authentication touches each of the systems within the
open architecture Mike has been working on.  Because of this I get a
little mixed up, and so I preface my next statements by saying that I
am really not sure how much currently attributed to the Voteserver or
something else.

Regardless of whether this is the Voteserver or something else, it
seems to me that we do need a standard for &quot;unique identity&quot; ON THE
WEB.  It seems to me that it is up to the administrators of each
polling facility to take into account that polls shared &quot;between
polling faclilities&quot; will invite voters to create duplicate
identities, and that their will/must be some form of standard for
rooting out such duplicates in order for polls that take place across
multiple servers (each with it's own identity system) to have
validity.

Based on this need, then, I would say that there is a clear need for
at least 1 standard that allows all polling facilities to implement
some form of identity check (that can be verified) to reach a certain
level of &quot;certainty&quot; that adequate steps, to a certain level of
certainty, are being taken to eliminate duplicates.

Put together then, we would have  an architecture where:

1.  Individuals and organizations could construct a polling facility
to meet their needs
2.  Implement specific standards within that polling facility for
Consensus-Building, Authentication, and &quot;eVote Comparisons/Cross-forum
participation)
3.  These polling facilities could then rely on the ability to
interact across any number of polling facilities across the web.

This would be a set of guidelines that would create a &quot;federation
standard&quot; that would allow for widespread participation in the &quot;basics
of consensus building&quot;.

I would need to register this personal app with the pollserver, then,
and &quot;claim&quot; it.

I do beg of you to be kind by slicing and dicing my recommendation
(and not me) as I do my best to be helpful and not hurtful.  I mean no
offense in anything I write.  I am simply pointing out something that
I hope we can continue to work on together.

I realize that there are deep discussion within each of the projects
about the necessity of this or that widget or rules about
authentication, but is it not possible that this is one of the
greatest goals that we could achieve together, and therefore worth
working towards if for no other reason than the sheer awesome-ness of
the possibility?
