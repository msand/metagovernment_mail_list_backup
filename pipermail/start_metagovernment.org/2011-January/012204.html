<PRE>Welcome, Andr&#233;.

The organization here is mostly adhocracy, though eventually hopefully  
we will be governed by collaborative governance software. (We have  
made some decisions that way, but not many to date... we're still  
experimenting on ourselves.:)

The idea of disempowering admins is closely related to the idea of  
collaborative governance... It is generally understood that  
politicians can betray the trust that is placed in them. The point of  
collaborative governance is to take away the need for that trust in  
politicians by putting the power back in the hands of the people  
through modern technologies.

But if the technologies themselves have to be in the power of certain  
individuals, then it seems reasonable to expect that those individuals  
would be just as likely to betray the trust placed in them.

I haven't had time to review the replies on the SlashDot thread  
carefully, but my impression is that most of them are along the lines  
of, &quot;trust but verify.&quot; I find that to be flawed because it is a  
defensive/reactive battle. If you are only dealing with problems as  
they are discovered, you are likely to miss some... and you  
incentivize the politicians/admins/whoever to find new ways to escape  
notice. Politicians do this now: they often come up with new ways to  
get around current protection systems, and it is only later on that we  
notice and hope to correct the problem. But often the harm has already  
been done, and the best we can do is try to mitigate future harms.

The best idea we've had so far is the Distributed Administration  
Network, but I am convinced there are broader and better solutions out  
there. If you have any ideas along these lines, they are extremely  
welcome. As would be building a DAN prototype or anything along those  
lines.
