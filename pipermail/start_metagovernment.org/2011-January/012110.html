<PRE>Pietro, I don't have any particular insight into this initiative.  However,
an &quot;official&quot; E-mail address at OSTP.gov is provided and a couple weeks ago
I did send them some comments, which I have copied below.

 

A week after I sent my comments, on December 21, the House of
Representatives gave final passage to H.R. 2142
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-2142">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-2142</A>&gt; , the
Government Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Performance Improvement Act of
2010 (GEEPIA). Section 10 of the Act requires agencies to publish their
strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable formats.

 

So U.S. federal agencies will now be under statutory direction to begin
using a format(s) like StratML.

 

They were previously directed pursuant to subsections 202(b)(4)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#202b</A>&gt; &amp; (5) and 207(d)
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d">http://xml.gov/documents/completed/eGovXML.htm#207d</A>&gt;  of the eGov Act to: 

 

*	Work together to link their performance goals to key groups,
including citizens, businesses, and other governments, as well as internal
Federal Government operations (e.g. by using the &lt;Stakeholder&gt; element of
StratML); and 
*	Adopt open standards (e.g., StratML) enabling the organization and
categorization of Government information in a way that is searchable
electronically and interoperably across agencies. 

 

However, they won't find it as easy to ignore section 10 of GEEPIA,
particularly with Congress looking for opportunities to eliminate programs
that may be redundant and whose costs have not been justified.

 

In any event, it would be good if Metagov applications and services could be
used to enable input and feedback on .gov agency strategic and performance
plans posted on the Web in machine-readable formats (like StratML).

 

BTW, StratML was previously mentioned in OSTP's wrap-up to the brainstorming
session on collaboration
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Wrap-Up-of-the-Open-Government-Brainstorming">http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Wrap-Up-of-the-Open-Government-Brainstorming</A>
-Collaboration/&gt; .  Erick Gonzalez
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ideascale.com/a/dtd/2734-4049">http://www.ideascale.com/a/dtd/2734-4049</A>&gt;  and I
&lt;<A HREF="http://opengov.ideascale.com/a/dtd/3551-4049">http://opengov.ideascale.com/a/dtd/3551-4049</A>&gt;  each raised it during the
brainstorming session.  It didn't get many votes but Beth Noveck thought
enough of it to mention it in her wrap-up report.  Thus, it is heartening to
see that Congress has now taken up the cause.

It looks like the white house, after the lukewarm experience with Mixed ink
is trying again, now with wiki.

Can someone please investigate this and find out if it is official?

<A HREF="http://expertnet.wikispaces.com/Getting+Started">http://expertnet.wikispaces.com/Getting+Started</A>

Also, can anyone participate or it is only for people in the US?

Cheers,
Pietro

Subject: Structure of the &quot;Dialog&quot; in ExpertNet

 

To optimize the productivity of the dialog, it would be good to structure
the topics/questions on ExpertNet
&lt;<A HREF="http://expertnet.wikispaces.com/Getting+Started">http://expertnet.wikispaces.com/Getting+Started</A>&gt;  as concise statements of
longer-term goals and shorter-term objectives: 

 

a)      that are linked to statutory authorities, which are in turn linked
to the responsible agencies and offices;

b)      expressed in plain language that is meaningful to citizens, rather
than merely to the bureaucracy; and 

c)      with potentially measurable results that can be reported to anyone
expressing interest in the goal/objective in question.

 

Consistent with the open formats objective
&lt;<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OGDwStyle.xml#_7d88050e-142e-11df-a454-3f207a">http://xml.gov/stratml/carmel/OGDwStyle.xml#_7d88050e-142e-11df-a454-3f207a</A>
64ea2a&gt;  of the Open Gov Directive, it would also be good to post the
goals/objectives on the Web in open Strategy Markup Language (StratML)
format and provide tools/services enabling citizens as well as .gov folks to
post them anywhere on the Web that *they* choose . rather than merely in yet
another in a seemingly unending line of &quot;stovepipe&quot; so-called &quot;portal&quot;
systems at a plethora of domains (URLs) that are anything but &quot;one-stops&quot;
from the perspective of citizens.

 

A good first step would be to render all of the strategic plans of all
agencies and offices in StratML format so that they can be used to
pre-populate ExpertNet.  Many of them, including the plans of all of the
Cabinet-level agencies, are already available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm</A>  What remains is for agencies:

 

First, to begin to maintain their own plans in StratML format on their own
websites; 

 

Second, to begin documenting their goals and objectives in citizen-centered
terms; and 

 

Third, to begin working more collaboratively together across
intergovernmental boundaries to more efficiently and effectively address the
objectives of their common stakeholders.

 

Perhaps the most valuable dialog/feedback that might be stimulated are
suggestions on how to obtain, if not actual offers of assistance to provide
inputs and/or processing required to achieve the desired objectives.
Anything else is likely to amount to little more than more &quot;talk&quot; . of which
we already have more than enough - particularly in light of current
budgetary realities.

 

As the plan for ExpertNet emerges, it too should be documented in StratML
format.  I will be more than happy to provide any assistance that may be
needed.
