Does our Metagov-wiki need to be a technically seperate wiki from the 
pollwiki? Because this is going to be there anyway I thought.

Plus, I think Alex concerns were based on a misunderstanding which has 
dissolved now (centralization vs. distibuted). (He is still in the 
stress of moving and will be back.)

Plus, Pietro expressed his interest in connecting Vilfredo to the 
theatre-app a couple of times too.

I dont see any reason to hesitate. Please correct me, if I'm wrong!
