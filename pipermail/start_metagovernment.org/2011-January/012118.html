I didn't think that far, but you are right, this becomes necessarry. 
What worries me a bit in this though: If you pan over to Berlin and 
Beijing comes out of sight, it will look as if suddenly the Berlin-polls 
become more active. Maybe a little message &quot;Re-calculating the views&quot; 
would help? But it doesn't seem ideal, does it? What else could we do?

When zooming in or out this problem wouldn't occur, because the whole 
picture changes anyway.

@ Mike: Concerning Zoom and Pan: For me personally the most fun way is 
to use the scroll-wheel to zoom in and out and to grab the map with the 
left or right mouse-button to pan.

@ Marcos: I must admit, how to project the tags onto a map will probably 
remain a mystery to me. But if you and Pietro know this ... ;-)
