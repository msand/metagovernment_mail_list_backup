<PRE>Thiago,

Happy republic Day from India.

May be the following direct action taking place to take democracy to the
true stakeholders in India:

India Against Corruption a movement of Activists and NGOs from around India
appeals to one and all to join the Human Chain Against Corruption hapenning
many cities and towns around India and the globe on Jan 30, Gandhi Jayanti
day. It's a citizen's initiative.

You are requested to kindly spread the message of awareness among your
contacts and request them to actively participate.

The focus is &quot;Stop Corruption; Save India; Save Democracy&quot;.

Look forward to your kind support and encouragement for this noble cause in
the service of the common citizen of India.

&gt;<i>  Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my introductory post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am brazilian, 29 years old, software developer an social media
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiast. A part of my family is involved in traditional politics, but
</I>&gt;<i> as for myself, I've never been too much into it. What happens is that I came
</I>&gt;<i> across the concept of liquid democracy some time ago, and even had a friend
</I>&gt;<i> developing a voting and transparency web tool, which he abandoned. But the
</I>&gt;<i> idea stayed with me, and last weekend, at brazilian version of Campus Party,
</I>&gt;<i> I proposed during Ben Hammersley talk (from Wired UK) that we create some
</I>&gt;<i> new kind of party in Brazil, much like DemoEx. His speech was an
</I>&gt;<i> inspirational call for brazilians to go and 'change the world', as we emerge
</I>&gt;<i> as a developed and young nation that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is part of the BRIC. Ben asked me go onto stage and talk to a broad
</I>&gt;<i> audience about the idea. Now I feel entitled to carry this to another level,
</I>&gt;<i> regardless the monstrous bureaucracy required to create a party in my
</I>&gt;<i> country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I was researching for direct democracy initiatives in Brazil and
</I>&gt;<i> abroad and I came across metagovernment. I haven't had time to read through
</I>&gt;<i> the archives yet, but I don't wish to lose the timing here, because the
</I>&gt;<i> event had some press coverage and I want to attract public attention to the
</I>&gt;<i> matter, and later mature it. By the way, if the list has brazilians
</I>&gt;<i> participating, raise your hands! I arranged with a reporter to get back to
</I>&gt;<i> him by the end of this week and report my findings and how much I could
</I>&gt;<i> develop from the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been reading about Demoex in Sweden, PDI in Spain, Senator Online in
</I>&gt;<i> Australia... Their reality is very different from ours, but I am sure there
</I>&gt;<i> are many valuable experiences that we can learn from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards.,
</I>&gt;<i>
