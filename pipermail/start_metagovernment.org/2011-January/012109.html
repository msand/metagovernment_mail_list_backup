<PRE>Michael, it occurs to me that if you were to try to implement all of  
the suggestions made so far on this thread, you would be coding for  
quite some considerable time. Is there any way you can readily draw  
others into the effort, once the parameters are better defined?

If it is useful, I now have control of the metagov hosting space on  
tuxfamily.org. I haven't had time to set up anything on it just yet,  
but the whole idea behind it is that it is to be a hosting space for  
more than just one of us. If you would like to be an admin of that  
account (and if nobody on the list objects to that), then you could  
set up a development and/or collaboration environment there.
