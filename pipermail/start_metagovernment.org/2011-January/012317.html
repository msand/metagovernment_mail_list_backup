<PRE>Thank you Ed. I am not party-oriented as well. The party innitiative
is more like a milestone and a aggregator. Many people spread around
the country have similar ideas, but they are not joining efforts. I
don't plan to take over Brazilian government hehe. If I can create a
little dent in the state of things and increase the awareness of
people towards how they can contribute with the democratic process, I
would consider it a success. It is just that it has to start somehow.
I was saddened to see, for example, Brazil not listed on the wiki for
known innitiatives.

Again, thank you for your support.

&gt;<i> Welcome, Thiago!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We haven't been ignoring you... this list just tends to focus on direct questions at the moment. Are you in the process of building a party now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of us are not particularly party-oriented. They way I se collaborative governance evolving is as a ground-up gradual replacement for current systems, not an internal replacement. But there is certainly a lot of value to at least trying the approaches of DemoEx, PDI, Activ Demokrati, and Senator Online. I would note as I did in my previous post that the reason DemoEx appears to have been successful is that they thought small. Trying to take over the government of Brazil is a gigantic task. Trying to get a foot into your town council is much more plausible in the current landscape.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regardless, whatever approach you take, please post more here and let us know. We would be happy support you as we can.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is my introductory post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am brazilian, 29 years old, software developer an social media enthusiast. A part of my family is involved in traditional politics, but as
</I>&gt;<i> for myself, I've never been too much into it. What happens is that I came across the concept of liquid democracy some time ago, and even had
</I>&gt;<i> a friend developing a voting and transparency web tool, which he abandoned. But the idea stayed with me, and last weekend, at brazilian
</I>&gt;<i> version of Campus Party, I proposed during Ben Hammersley talk (from Wired UK) that we create some new kind of party in Brazil, much like
</I>&gt;<i> DemoEx. His speech was an inspirational call for brazilians to go and 'change the world', as we emerge as a developed and young nation that
</I>&gt;<i> is part of the BRIC. Ben asked me go onto stage and talk to a broad audience about the idea. Now I feel entitled to carry this to another
</I>&gt;<i> level, regardless the monstrous bureaucracy required to create a party in my country.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then I was researching for direct democracy initiatives in Brazil and abroad and I came across metagovernment. I haven't had time to read
</I>&gt;<i> through the archives yet, but I don't wish to lose the timing here, because the event had some press coverage and I want to attract public
</I>&gt;<i> attention to the matter, and later mature it. By the way, if the list has brazilians participating, raise your hands! I arranged witha
</I>&gt;<i> reporter to get back to him by the end of this week and report my findings and how much I could develop from the idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been reading about Demoex in Sweden, PDI in Spain, Senator Online in Australia... Their reality is very different from ours, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> sure there are many valuable experiences that we can learn from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards.,
</I>&gt;<i>
