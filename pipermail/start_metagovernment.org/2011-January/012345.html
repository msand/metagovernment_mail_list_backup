<PRE>Hi Ed,
comments are coming.

Right now we are testing anonymous voting. On the one side it is
important for this event, but on the other, it really gives
possibilities in the future to use Vilfredo for sensitive questions.

Right now I am also thinking if we can use Vilfredo to define a speaker list.
That is define some people that should speak between one generation
and another, and say what is wrong with a particular proposal.

Maybe the keypeople.

For example we could go through all the keypeople (if there are any,
it looks like the more people participate in a question, the less
people are keypeople) and ask them if they prefer to (a) rewrite a
proposal in a way that they like or (b) get up and address the
audience and explain what is so fundamentally wrong with that proposal
and why can't they support that or any mutation of it.

People should be invited not do both, although there is no way to prevent it.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Great news, Pietro. This sounds like a really promising experiment.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This event represent a test in so many ways:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We would be testing if Vilfredo can be used for more than 15 people.

</I>&gt;<i> THis sounds amazing. One of the shortcomings of Vilfredo as it is now built

</I>&gt;<i> it in an environment where people can hold those discussions audibly, in
</I>&gt;<i> person, in real time. I can imagine very fast evolutions of proposals. They
