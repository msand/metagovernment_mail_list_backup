<PRE>In reply to Pietro and Thomas,

I'm keen on Pietro's idea of a question-state/vote-state feed, and
hopeful we can move on it.

&gt;<i> We should have a system on Vilfredo where who asks a question can

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And who answers (or votes) a [geo]position for them.  Every time a
</I>&gt;<i> person votes or writes a proposal the question [geo]position should
</I>&gt;<i> light up. (remember that at this time proposals or votes are
</I>&gt;<i> anonymous, we cannot give away the [geo]position of the voter).  And
</I>&gt;<i> then when a question is moved on, all the [geo]position for the
</I>&gt;<i> people who have voted should be available and the geomap should
</I>&gt;<i> decide what to do with this information. Like you click on the
</I>&gt;<i> question and the other positions appear, maybe linked. Or when the
</I>&gt;<i> question is moved on the proposals all light up briefly. And so on.
</I>
Vilfredo already has a newsfeed I think you said?  Maybe we can put
its news items on the crossforum stage and project them on the map.
We'd need question IDs embeddable in each item and (when permitted)
user IDs.  Can you provide those?

The geospatial meta-data (location and so forth) needn't be added
directly to Vilfredo.  It can be added externally using the common
pollwiki.  The pollwiki has semantic capabilities, so it can easily
tag a Vilfredo question with meta-data.  That way, if the same
question happened to pop up on another vote-server (or another
instance of Vilfredo), then the two could share the same meta-data.

I think we could code this pretty quickly, if others agree it's a
positive direction.

&gt;<i> Also it would be good if the system makes some sort of automatic
</I>&gt;<i> video (or just renders it somehow) for a certain time. For example.
</I>&gt;<i> What happened in the last 24 hours? And I see the video and find
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>
Thomas had the related idea of a replay facility where you could
re-position the feed at any point in time, and run it forward or
backward at varying speeds.  His idea of an &quot;after-glow&quot; effect for
map spotlighting was tied to that.

Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
&gt;<i> Would it be difficult to have a button at the bottom of the map,
</I>&gt;<i> which links to the ohter map (the 3-dimensional one) and back?  It
</I>&gt;<i> would make its future functionality even more clear.
</I>
I guess you're right, we need a map-switching control ASAP.  Where to
put it raises the bigger question of control layout in general, which
is something of a problem.  Maybe the &quot;control mask&quot; is part of the
solution, but I'm not sure:

Or maybe we shouldn't think about it too much.  Just float a
transparent control panel somewhere on the screen as a temporary
stop-gap?  (I agree it's a priority.)

Meantime, here are some demo links and bookmarklet controls that might
be helpful: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/#demo">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/crossforum/#demo</A>

BTW - Conseo and I have merged code, so I'm looking at getting his
live diff feed projected on the map, too.
