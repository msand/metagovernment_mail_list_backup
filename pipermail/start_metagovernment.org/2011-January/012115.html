<PRE> Hi,

 sorry for the late posting, I have been busy with my other project and 
 am now back to development on Votorola.
 I have written a diff feed service for Votorola so far and am sorting 
 that out so Mike can pull it from my repo.

 I am definetly against using the term open. Open is even weaker than 
 &quot;free&quot; for people knowing the FOSS discussions and is a buzz word since 
 the web 2.0 and social networking. If we really want to stick with open, 
 we could use &quot;libre&quot; instead to give it at least a more international 
 and distinct meaning.
 But &quot;open&quot; is almost pointless and as it has been explained before it 
 is actually redundant. Democracy implies some degree of 
 openness/transparency. We should definitely brand the term democracy in 
 a concrete way where we want to go. Having a look at the Metagov wiki I 
 think we seem to have a consensus that consensus (synthesis) building is 
 the way. So instead of simply using some technical term we should put 
 this focus on socially reflected synthesis (as in hegelian) in it. We 
 don't want to write simply another management tool, but what we want to 
 do is to map social reflection and consensus building inside society as 
 closely as possible, to get the most efficient (read reflected) decision 
 and work processes.
 My proposal therefore is to put that in front. &quot;Consensual democracy&quot; 
 for example. Democracy as implemented today is a very weak and crippled 
 form of it actually and does not imply the principle of consensus 
 building, although this is in reality the core strength of democracy (as 
 it is also being pointed out on the Wiki) and not its weakness (as often 
 wrongly argued). Still even the current form has always been advertised 
 with its openness, so this would be nothing new then.

 Another possibility would be to use the term &quot;universal&quot; to imply that 
 we hack a system that is not bound to the principle of states any more, 
 but rather recognizes each subject as a member of a universal democratic 
 process. I don't know if this is really a consensus here, though. One 
 could of course always combine several attributes.

 Cheers,
 conseo
