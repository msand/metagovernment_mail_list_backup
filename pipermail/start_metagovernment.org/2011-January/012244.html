<PRE>We spoke since, and I think we agreed (just for starters) to go with a
single summary per message regardless of the number of diff URLs
embedded in it.  The logical composition of a bite is then:

  * bite

      * message

          * url

          * summary
              * text
              * isTruncated

      * diff

          * url

The summary text we agreed might simply be the leading text of the
message stripped of any quoted material.  A better parsing algorithm
for this (simpler than what we spoke of) might be:

    loop
    {
        read next word of message;

        if( word.length + summary.length &gt; 150 ) end loop;
        else summary += word;
    }

    isTrucated = not( summary.lastWord has proper sentence ending );

So forget about trying to parse for whole sentences.  Just properly
set the isTruncated flag - or maybe even scratch that, and leave it
for the client to figure out.  The simpler the better.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  a) Post URL, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-Septembe">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-Septembe</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; r/003091.html
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  b) Short tweet-like summary of the post
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     Hey Thomas, (sorry for the delay) | I made the terminology changes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     (&quot;namegiver&quot;, &quot;donation&quot;) that we agreed to previously.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to have some feedback about how this should be done, because it is 
</I>&gt;<i> not easy to parse a summary out of an E-Mail. Atm. I search the position of 
</I>&gt;<i> any diffUrl and grep a text string of ~300 characters around of it. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> approached it that way, because it is likely to get some relevant information 
</I>&gt;<i> around the oocurance of the diff url. On the other hand it might be very 
</I>&gt;<i> specific text in the middle of an argument, which cannot be understood easily. 
</I>&gt;<i> I could also parse let's say ~3 sentences one before, the one with the url and 
</I>&gt;<i> one after.
</I>&gt;<i> Using the approach proposed by Michael would mean that we simply grep the first 
</I>&gt;<i> not-quoted paragraph. It is difficult to see if there is relevant data in it. If 
</I>&gt;<i> we do language and term checks, we have to do it for every language. 
</I>&gt;<i> It might also be specific to the way the involved parties communicate, e.g. if 
</I>&gt;<i> they usually try to advertise them and their party first. They might even try 
</I>&gt;<i> to get better coverage in Crossforum (which is not such a big problem atm. 
</I>&gt;<i> though).
</I>&gt;<i> Another problem is that the first paragraph might be specific to one of diff- 
</I>&gt;<i> urls, while you can and likely will discuss several differences in one Mail to 
</I>&gt;<i> give a picture of your point of view. If we use some generic summary it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be the same for every diff url occuring, even if they cover different parts of 
</I>&gt;<i> the argument and the summary only covers the first diff url.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We could leave it to the writer to tag it with &lt;summary url=&quot;...&quot;&gt;Some 
</I>&gt;<i> summary, ....&lt;/summary&gt;, but any formatting is likely to be discarded by 
</I>&gt;<i> users.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What should I do? 
</I>
