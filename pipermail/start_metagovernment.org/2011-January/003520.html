I agree, it is defintetly a high priority.

I really like your synthesis-approach #8, and would vote for it, but 
still had a few improvements to suggest.

&gt;<i> Owen pointed out, off list, that it would be laborious and confusing

Yes, and even with synthesis #8 the problem remains. If I make my own 
clone of it, and the others too ... soon we will have 9 versions again.

Now, I don't want to push the idea at you, but I think it would make 
things easier, if we would use good old Votorola for drafting a document 
like this (a bit long and complex).

Should we give it a try?

Thomas
