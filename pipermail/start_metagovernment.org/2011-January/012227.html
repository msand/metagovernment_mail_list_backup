I didn't received your post until now Conseo, it was caught in my spam
filter.  Or I would have spoken to you since about these changes.
They weren't quite as advertised.  (Sorry about that.)

&gt;<i> Btw. even if somebody has ideas for Bite-types which could be
</I>&gt;<i> relevant for crossforum (independant of Votorola) this could be

</I>
I second this.  We don't want to be trapped in Votorola, neither as
developers nor as users.  There's no future in that approach.

This is maybe one point on which we differ from the Drupal applet that
Alex mentioned.  It may be possible to capture users in the world of
content management, and that may even be the name of the game.  But
the world of democracy (or whatever we call it) is quite different.
The difference might not be obvious to most people, and we might have
to demonstrate it.  I think Conseo is asking, &quot;How do you want us to
demonstrate it?&quot;
