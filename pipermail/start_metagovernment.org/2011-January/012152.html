 If it works, we could test it, but I am not sure it does. Personally I 
 am still
 pretty new here and have am still not clear how I would name it, so I 
 would
 be interested in others' opinions still.

 I just wish to add that I am ok with &quot;open democracy&quot; in general. It is 
 more
 general and understandable than metagov likely. I have already told 
 Thomas that
 it mostly depends on what audience we target imo. If most people we 
 want to attract
 are simply fed up by the current state of participation, then open 
 democracy
 is ok imo. But if they are already interested in e-dom concepts, then 
 it is
 difficult to see a difference to other platforms, because openness is
 automatically claimed by any democracy platform as Owen has already 
 pointed out.

 Ok, my English definitely does not qualify for branding or official 
 texts ;-)
 I hope to improve it during communication. It is the most appealing way 
 to learn
 a language to me.
 Maybe we could even leave the term democracy out or move it into an 
 attribute
 since I think the concept of &quot;decision-making by consensus&quot; is *very* 
 general.
 I would like to use the tools and concepts for things starting from 
 discussing
 youtube-videos, poems, theoretical texts (also in academics if you like 
 to) up to
 decisions also involving material changes and power on the same 
 platform.
 For me this is pretty obvious and even more attractive than directly 
 trying to
 target a politically minded audience. As long as we can solve political 
 consensus
 building with our tools, we can also target anything simpler than that.

 Putting both on the same platform has the big advantage that people can 
 solve
 the problems or discuss the issues they currently are mostly interested 
 in and
 they won't get distracted from the platform when their political agenda 
 fails.
 And in the other direction: All current cultural media include 
 propaganda and
 build a form of ideology, so discussing them automatically creates 
 political
 needs.

 Facebook and the current form of expose-quick-forget-quick social media 
 can't
 satisfy the long term concept of a serous social network where you want 
 to
 create serious positions over many years instead of pushing an &quot;i 
 like&quot;-button.
