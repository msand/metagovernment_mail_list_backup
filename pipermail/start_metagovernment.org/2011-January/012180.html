<PRE>Hi Ed,

Thanks for bringing this up to our attention.
I missed it the first time Matias presented it.

Yes we definitly should apply.

Reading better the FAQ seem that the fellowship is strictly on a per
individual basis. On this base, for example, neither I nor the
&quot;Vilfredo project&quot; per se can apply. In particular they say:

&quot;In addition to supplying a fellowship stipend for living expenses,
OSI may cover additional limited expenses such as travel, conference
fees, and part-time research assistance.

Fellowship expenses should not include operational or programmatic
costs, such as employees and physical infrastructure. The purpose of
the fellowship is to support individual fellows; therefore OSI will
only cover individual expenses. Other ineligible expenses include per
diems for prolonged research trips, Internet and telephone bills.&quot;

So at the best I could get funding for a &quot;part time research
assistent&quot; (aka a programmer). Other than that I would not get any
money.

So I think Vilfredo is not the right project to apply.

What about Votorola or the crossforum theatre, is everybody working
there already funded?

You could apply, Ed, but you are not a programmer. My understanding is
that they fund people (individuals) to do things. And then speak about
them. But you could design a system. And use the time to go and speak
with politicians and hear what they need (I remember politicians
saying, I receive 3000 emails a day, how the hell can I sort them
out). The biggest problem in eGov is not so much programming the thing
but designing it.

I think would be good if one of our project (or more than one
independently), apply. I am not sure if Metagovernment, as an
organization is eligible, because it is more an umbrella organization.
Also they do not fund lobbying. Not that we ever did that, but in case
we wanted to start ;-).

Maybe I could ask Derek (the volunteer programmer in Vilfredo) if he
wants to apply. He is not interested in doing a dissertation, but they
do not fund dissertations. What about Matias, Thomas, Michael, Alex,
Owen. Each of those people was directly involved into a project.

On a separate note, I wonder if Metagovernment could try to raise
money from individuals around the world and try to set up its own
funding scheme.

But, yes, definitely, if you, Ed, have the time I think you should
apply. It would also clarify better your ideas about what you think
should be done.


Cheers,
Pietro
