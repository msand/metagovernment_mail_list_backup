<PRE>Welcome, Jonas! It is very nice to have you on board. I hope you will  
consider adding Aktiv Demokrati to our list of &quot;member&quot; projects  
(there is no real obligation or consequence of doing so):

This seems very well thought out. My biggest question is: what defines  
a &quot;large enough majority?&quot;

Most of us have been operating under the principle of consensus, but I  
admit that we have not come up with a rigid definition of consensus.  
In smaller communities, consensus can mean 100% or very close to it,  
in large communities like countries, that seems impractical.

For that reason I, and many others, have been concentrating on small  
communities first. Is Aktiv Demokrati able to do that? It is worth  
noting that DemoEx is the only group anything like what any of us are  
doing that has been able to get into &quot;power,&quot; and that they appear to  
have done it at a very local level...
