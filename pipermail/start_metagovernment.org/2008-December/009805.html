<PRE>As noted earlier, I had written to the Software Freedom Law Center &lt;<A HREF="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">http://www.softwarefreedom.org/</A> 
 &gt; to inquire about the possibility of their acting as a steward for  
funds collected by the project. See below for their response. Shortly,  
I will also forward the response I sent in reply to the below. I was  
going to ask for everyone's input into the reply, but it seemed pretty  
straight-forward, so I figured I'd act in the spirit of adhocracy and  
just get the job done.

Begin forwarded message:

&gt;<i> From: &quot;Bradley M. Kuhn&quot; &lt;redacted for list&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Date: November 25, 2008 11:26:14 AM EST
</I>&gt;<i> To: Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: Fwd: Inquiry about joining
</I>&gt;<i> Reply-To: &lt;redacted for list&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To apply to the Conservancy, we ask project leader(s) send us the
</I>&gt;<i> following (links to online documents where the information is already
</I>&gt;<i> published is fine):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Detailed description of the project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Roadmap for future development.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * link to the website.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Link to the code repository.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual
</I>&gt;<i>     on behalf of the projects?  How and for what did you spend those
</I>&gt;<i>     funds?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Brief history of the project, including past governance decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Existing for-profit or non-profit affiliations, funding
</I>&gt;<i>     relationships, or other agreements that the project or its leaders
</I>&gt;<i>     have with other organizations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Names, email addresses, and affiliations of key developers, past  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i>     present.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Information about any past for-profit or non-profit organizational
</I>&gt;<i>     affiliations the project has had.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please be advised that we currently have a backlog of applications,  
</I>&gt;<i> and it
</I>&gt;<i> is currently taking about three months for projects to be considered  
</I>&gt;<i> by
</I>&gt;<i> our evaluation committee.  Usually, our evaluation committee comes  
</I>&gt;<i> back
</I>&gt;<i> with a list of questions, and then if you answer quickly, it is one  
</I>&gt;<i> month
</I>&gt;<i> later that the project is given a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There has been overwhelming interest in the Conservancy, and we are
</I>&gt;<i> evaluating projects on a first-come, first-evaluated basis.  We are  
</I>&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;<i> prioritizing our work to make sure the needs of already accepted  
</I>&gt;<i> projects
</I>&gt;<i> are met before we proceed on the evaluation and acceptance of new
</I>&gt;<i> projects.  Please understand that our delay is primarily to make sure
</I>&gt;<i> projects already in the Conservancy get what they need, and should  
</I>&gt;<i> your
</I>&gt;<i> project ultimately join the Conservancy, your project will be a
</I>&gt;<i> beneficiary of that.  Like most non-profits, we are struggling to  
</I>&gt;<i> match
</I>&gt;<i> very scarce resources with a growing demand from the community that we
</I>&gt;<i> serve.  We have only two part-time staffers, whose time is graciously
</I>&gt;<i> donated by the SFLC.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to submit the information I described, and anything else  
</I>&gt;<i> you'd
</I>&gt;<i> like us to review in considering an application, and we will add you  
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> the queue.  We appreciate your understanding regarding the delay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, we ask that applying projects consider donating a  
</I>&gt;<i> percentage of
</I>&gt;<i> their funding to the general operating costs of the Conservancy.   
</I>&gt;<i> This is
</I>&gt;<i> a way to assure we can continue providing a high level of service to  
</I>&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;<i> Conservancy projects.  This is, however, voluntary and negotiable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -- 
</I>&gt;<i> Bradley M. Kuhn
</I>&gt;<i> President, Software Freedom Conservancy
