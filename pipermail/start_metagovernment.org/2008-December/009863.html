They wouldn't have the knowledge, at least not yet.  They wouldn't
know what criteria to compare.  But now that we've given them
something to start with, they can easily verify the accuracy of it.
And maybe they can improve on it.  (It's always easier to improve on
something, than to originate it from scratch.)

Maybe that's where the proprietary systems (I count 4 of them) could
pull ahead of us.  Anything we learn, they learn too.  I wonder what's
under those question marks?
