<PRE>I recently discovered that the Change.gov site for the US Presidential Elect
Barack Obama is going &quot;Open&quot; in a big way. There are &quot;Open Government&quot;
headlines throughout the website, with the ability for anyone to make
recommendations that are rated by the community. The site is supposedly
changing over to a Creative Commons license as well. Plus, anyone can
register for the site using an OpenID.

When I tried registering I was taken to another website, IntenseDebate.com,
which Change.gov uses empower their discussions system. My thoughts are that
we should focus MetaScore on the Policy Making process, and that we might
use something like IntenseDebate.com to handle the discussions that are
attached to every Issue, Proposal, and Policy in MetaScore.

IMHO, developing core technologies that interconnect with the web is a
philosopy at the heart of Web 2.0 that we should consider for MetaScore. If
people don't like the Web 2.0 services we connect to, they can always
replace it for their own use. This might also put us ahead in the
development process as we're able to focus on our &quot;core technologies&quot; and
leave the rest to the &quot;experts.&quot;

Also, if we're in the process of focusing MetaScore on its primary function,
we might want to consider using &quot;profiles&quot; from other sites such as
Facebook. They've recently released a Facebook Connect that my friend at
GovIt.com is using on his website. Other big names such as Hulu and Digg are
supposedly getting on the bandwagon as well. Here's an article from Wired:
