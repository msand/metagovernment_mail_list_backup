<PRE>Hello,
want to bring everybody's attention to what has been going on in the last
year from a political point of view.

Let's look at some elements:
A) Obama is using the net to comunicate weekly what he is doing.

This is not only important as a one way informatin, but as a two way
information.
People are allowed to comment, and more important than this are allowed to
vote on other people's comment. This by itself is revolutionary.

B) In Italy the minister goes no youtube and asks for feedback. Similar
situation.
C) another minister does the same on facebook.

And today something which is subtly the next step has also happened:
a politican (Antonio DI Pietro), (a strong opposer to Berlusconi) with a
Blog, facebook account, and so on, has joined a facebook group called:&quot;fatti
processare buffone&quot;.
(Litterally, &quot;let yourself be processed, clown&quot;, a group inspired on what a
man shouted to Berlusconi years ago).

Details here, although the english version is not yet avaiable:
<A HREF="http://www.antoniodipietro.com/2008/12/lillusionista.html">http://www.antoniodipietro.com/2008/12/lillusionista.html</A>

This is very another small revolution. Here you have a key player of the
modern italian political sceene, who not only writes in his blog (1 way),
reads comments (2 way), read comments that have votes (1 to many), but...
follows and joins &quot;somone&quot; unknown in his initiative. Who started the group?
I don't know, it does not matter.

But the group, and the initiative has now been followed by many people,
among them a major italian politician.

In a sense part of what we were envisioning for metagovernment, the fact
that ideas became more important than single politicians, is starting to
come true.

What do you expect the next steps will be in this direction?

Pietro
