<PRE>I believe that user ratings accomplishes this without always focusing on
that one guy.

The best comments, regardless of who makes them, generally rise to the top,
unless there is some bias built into the system. That one guy in my team who
has little interest in the user experience is our project manager -- an
obvious bias, as he decides which tasks have a higher priority for the team.
The result? Whatever that one guy ignores generally goes unnoticed by the
rest of the group.

</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;Team Work&quot; environment. In my case, I've always found a guy who is just

</I>&gt;<i> say before jumping to action. I bet the same thing will happen in the
</I>&gt;<i> context of a &quot;metagovernment&quot;. These are natural leaders, and they need to
</I>&gt;<i> exist and to be recognized by the society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably his vote doesn't need to weight more than other's. But what he has
</I>&gt;<i> to say needs to have some priority. Needs to be heard.

</I>&gt;<i> Your thoughts?
