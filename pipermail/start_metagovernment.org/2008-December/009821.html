<PRE>Personally I'm most interested in the formal organisation that the
Telematics Freedom Foundation which may offer us financial means to
dedicate more resources to the project, provided we can find common
ground on what the software should look like.

Concerning the software; below I have tried to compile the differences
and commonalities I can see. This is of coarse biased and I only have
your websites to go by. Metascore tries to cover the areas you have
separated into the following components.


- Draft2Gether:

Both have the Goal of collaboratively drafting, editing proposals and
amendments. Both enable groups to focus on editing proposals before
they are shown to the entire community.
Though the interfaces don't seem to be fleshed out on either side, it
seems there is some overlap, for example tracking of drafts via rss,
scoreing and comments for proposals and edits.

The main inspiration of metascore is taken from open source software
development. Version Control Systems have enabled software developers
to collaborate on developing complex and extensive documents for over
2 decades. Wikis have brought some of that experience to the masses,
but there is still some ground left to be covered.

Draft2Gether proposes the capability for offline editing, for people
without access to a computer or the internet. I don't see how this
could be implemented, without significant manual labour, possibly even
beyond the cost of supporting communities facing this problem, by
building up the needed infrastructure.

There doesn't seem to be an equivalent to this suggestion in
metascore, although we have discussed that there should be an
interface for mobile devices (the only kind of computer for a large
portion of the world). In metscore offline editing would be enabled
through DVCS, so that all legislation and drafts are on your local
computer. The requirement for an Internet connection is limited to
when you want to push your edits to your online repository in the
community.


- Rule2Gether:

Both suggest the broader applicability of an Internet based governance
model to communities of various nature, not &quot;just&quot; nations.

From what I can gather, the focus of Rule2Gether seems to be on the
organisation and preparation of agendas for council meetings. This is
something you could use metascore for, but it's not exactly our
target.

Generally I see Rule2Gether addressing the problem of moderating the
discourse in a community. In metascore this will be done by the
participants themselves through a slashdot like scoring mechanism. To
a certain extent this is already done on the internet today, but
hopefully we can make this easier to navigate and more efficient.


- Do2Gether:

Seems to have no equivalent in metagovernment. Groupware may be
something the community would need, but hasn't been a focus of
metagovernment so far.


- Decide2Gether:

Both have the goal of supporting communities in coming to decisions.

Decide2Gether has a focus is on different voting schemes. We are open
to implementing voting schemes if a community wishes to use them but
we don't encourage voting to make decisions.

Metascore emphasises making decisions by coming to consensus and
synthesising proposals rather than deciding through a majority vote.
This may be impractical and idealistic if put to the extreme. It has
been shown practical in small scale open source projects. Even if it
isn't possible to reach consensus for every decision, the fact you are
forced to decide on something with a vote raises a flag that something
is wrong and that there is the possibility of discrimination against a
minority.

In any voting scheme there are some criteria to be considered. I've
taken the voting principles used in Germany as a basis (Grundgesetz
Artikel 38 &#167; 1).

Voting must be open, direct, free, equal and secret.

Open means anybody must be allowed to vote.
Direct means that the decision isn't made through intermediaries.
Free means that no pressure may be exerted on the voter to vote
against there will.
Equal means that every vote has equal weight.
Secret means that nobody should be able to determine how a vote was casted.

For each of these there are some considerations for online voting.

Open: Using computers to vote may be discriminatory against those who
aren't comfortable with them. On the other hand it may increase
participation, by making voting easier for those that are comfortable
and for people with disabilities.
An exception to this principle is made for people under 18. The intent
is for the electorate to have a certain degree of experience. The
system would be much more open though, if anybody could participate
based solely on merit.

Direct: Representative democracies are by definition indirect, so you
could argue, that in spirit Artikel 38 is being violated with the
current system. I think it was mainly introduced as a reaction to the
electoral collage in the US. Online governance has great potential to
do this principle justice.

Free: I can't think of any system that can guarantee this other than a
voting booth in a public venue. By voting on the Internet from any
computer the risk is introduced of a third party having control over
that resource and forcing the voter to vote a certain way.

I think this problem is inherent an haven't been able to come up with
a solution in the few years I've been thinking about these systems. I
can only find a partial justification that in a civilised society this
should be a statistically insignificant problem.

Equal: No difference as far as I can see.

Secret: I could talk for hours about this but the best solution I've
seen so far tries to limit the number of parties you have to trust to
as few as possible. And even in that system, which relies on
Public-key cryptography, which may not be trusted by every voter, even
if they trust the one party they are sending their votes to.


Considering all the problems with online voting, my conclusion is that
we should reconsider voting not as a binding for decisions, but as an
indicator for the direction the community wants to take, so that
gradually consensus can be reached.
