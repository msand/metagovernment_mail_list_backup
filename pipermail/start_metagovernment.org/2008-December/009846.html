Even though I absolutely agree with most of what you've said here (and what
you've said since I joined the group) I strongly believe that it is
important to make some difference with people who consistently proposes
synthetic conclusions to complex problems. I bet most of you have worked in
a &quot;Team Work&quot; environment. In my case, I've always found a guy who is just
worth hearing. Even if he doesn't come up with the best solution, he is
generally close to it. And naturally, the team waits to see what he has to
say before jumping to action. I bet the same thing will happen in the
context of a &quot;metagovernment&quot;. These are natural leaders, and they need to
exist and to be recognized by the society.

Probably his vote doesn't need to weight more than other's. But what he has
to say needs to have some priority. Needs to be heard.

Your thoughts?

Juan
