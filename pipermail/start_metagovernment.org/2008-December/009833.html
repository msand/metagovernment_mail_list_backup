</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>great... a few words below... :-)

&gt;<i> - Draft2Gether:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both have the Goal of collaboratively drafting, editing proposals and
</I>&gt;<i> amendments. Both enable groups to focus on editing proposals before
</I>&gt;<i> they are shown to the entire community.
</I>&gt;<i> Though the interfaces don't seem to be fleshed out on either side, it
</I>&gt;<i> seems there is some overlap, for example tracking of drafts via rss,
</I>&gt;<i> scoreing and comments for proposals and edits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main inspiration of metascore is taken from open source software
</I>&gt;<i> development. Version Control Systems have enabled software developers
</I>&gt;<i> to collaborate on developing complex and extensive documents for over
</I>&gt;<i> 2 decades. Wikis have brought some of that experience to the masses,
</I>&gt;<i> but there is still some ground left to be covered.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Do you have any user interface mockup for metascore's solution to this?
In draft2gether, we tried to use as much as possible the right column to
sort/filter/input/output comments, amends and differences between
original and edited text, as well as commands for voting amends.

&gt;<i> Draft2Gether proposes the capability for offline editing, for people
</I>&gt;<i> without access to a computer or the internet. I don't see how this
</I>&gt;<i> could be implemented, without significant manual labour, possibly even
</I>&gt;<i> beyond the cost of supporting communities facing this problem, by
</I>&gt;<i> building up the needed infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There doesn't seem to be an equivalent to this suggestion in
</I>&gt;<i> metascore, although we have discussed that there should be an
</I>&gt;<i> interface for mobile devices (the only kind of computer for a large
</I>&gt;<i> portion of the world). In metscore offline editing would be enabled
</I>&gt;<i> through DVCS, so that all legislation and drafts are on your local
</I>&gt;<i> computer. The requirement for an Internet connection is limited to
</I>&gt;<i> when you want to push your edits to your online repository in the
</I>&gt;<i> community.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Sure, usine draft2gether offline will require a lot of work (even if
there are some tools available like google gears) but having
(mobile)phone/fax integration is already  a great step towards digital
inclusion.


&gt;<i> - Rule2Gether:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both suggest the broader applicability of an Internet based governance
</I>&gt;<i> model to communities of various nature, not &quot;just&quot; nations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From what I can gather, the focus of Rule2Gether seems to be on the
</I>&gt;<i> organisation and preparation of agendas for council meetings. This is
</I>&gt;<i> something you could use metascore for, but it's not exactly our
</I>&gt;<i> target.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>this was the *initial* target of rule2gether. if you read the feature
list carefully, you'll see we want r2g to be a generic
consensus-building and decision-making platform, where users can create
group spaces and start &quot;decision items&quot;. Each item will then enable
users to define create and customize multiple &quot;phases&quot; (i.e.:  phase1
users x,y,z will videoconference / phase2 users x,w,z can discuss in a
closed forum and create items / phase3 all can comment and rate / phase5
actions suspended for 15days / phase6 all users will vote for their
preferred 3 options...)...
the current implementation is a simple user-feedback workflow to
demonstrate one practical use of the system, and is there also because
it was sponsored by the roman chapter of one direct democracy
association group we contacted in the past.

&gt;<i> Generally I see Rule2Gether addressing the problem of moderating the
</I>&gt;<i> discourse in a community. In metascore this will be done by the
</I>&gt;<i> participants themselves through a slashdot like scoring mechanism. To
</I>&gt;<i> a certain extent this is already done on the internet today, but
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully we can make this easier to navigate and more efficient.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Do2Gether:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Seems to have no equivalent in metagovernment. Groupware may be
</I>&gt;<i> something the community would need, but hasn't been a focus of
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment so far.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>do2gether is not thought to be a &quot;simple&quot; groupware, it would embed
social networking features specific to  political  or democratic
organized groups, like a whole set of privacy and anonymity options and
&quot;sub-networks&quot; management, to  handle their need of parallel
communication, secrecy and anonymity when discussing/chatting/proposing
issues in group.
&gt;<i> - Decide2Gether:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both have the goal of supporting communities in coming to decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Decide2Gether has a focus is on different voting schemes. We are open
</I>&gt;<i> to implementing voting schemes if a community wishes to use them but
</I>&gt;<i> we don't encourage voting to make decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore emphasises making decisions by coming to consensus and
</I>&gt;<i> synthesising proposals rather than deciding through a majority vote.
</I>&gt;<i> This may be impractical and idealistic if put to the extreme. It has
</I>&gt;<i> been shown practical in small scale open source projects. Even if it
</I>&gt;<i> isn't possible to reach consensus for every decision, the fact you are
</I>&gt;<i> forced to decide on something with a vote raises a flag that something
</I>&gt;<i> is wrong and that there is the possibility of discrimination against a
</I>&gt;<i> minority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any voting scheme there are some criteria to be considered. I've
</I>&gt;<i> taken the voting principles used in Germany as a basis (Grundgesetz
</I>&gt;<i> Artikel 38 &#167; 1).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Voting must be open, direct, free, equal and secret.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well... it depends on what you are voting on... sometimes voting should
not be open and secret, for example. If somehow a committee is
designated to deliberate on specific issue (let's say expert lawyers to
decide changes of winning a case in court) they are representing a
broader group of people and this election is better not to be secret, so
users can see transparency of each other user they have chosen to
represent them and perhaps change their delegation next time...
decide2gether will enable a whole set of configurable settings and rules
to set up an election. Of course the task to pick the best settings is
still delegated to the group of users who will actually vote.

&gt;<i> Open means anybody must be allowed to vote.
</I>&gt;<i> Direct means that the decision isn't made through intermediaries.
</I>&gt;<i> Free means that no pressure may be exerted on the voter to vote
</I>&gt;<i> against there will.
</I>&gt;<i> Equal means that every vote has equal weight.
</I>&gt;<i> Secret means that nobody should be able to determine how a vote was casted.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I think this could be a &quot;default setting&quot; to be considered... but we
think that there are many cases where everyone can't (and won't) be able
to vote on everything without delegating or being represented somehow.
Usually a few % of registered users are really active and interested in
all issues going on, most part is interested in part or specific issues
or themes... that should be considered in design phase, too.

&gt;<i> For each of these there are some considerations for online voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open: Using computers to vote may be discriminatory against those who
</I>&gt;<i> aren't comfortable with them. On the other hand it may increase
</I>&gt;<i> participation, by making voting easier for those that are comfortable
</I>&gt;<i> and for people with disabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> An exception to this principle is made for people under 18. The intent
</I>&gt;<i> is for the electorate to have a certain degree of experience. The
</I>&gt;<i> system would be much more open though, if anybody could participate
</I>&gt;<i> based solely on merit.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>agree.
&gt;<i> Direct: Representative democracies are by definition indirect, so you
</I>&gt;<i> could argue, that in spirit Artikel 38 is being violated with the
</I>&gt;<i> current system. I think it was mainly introduced as a reaction to the
</I>&gt;<i> electoral collage in the US. Online governance has great potential to
</I>&gt;<i> do this principle justice.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>In most part,yes, as long as we consider how to include people who do
not want (or do not have time) to vote to be forced to participate in
all issues or otherwise they will loose their vote. I may trust a friend
to vote for me for issue x, and should be able to verify what that vote
was later, so maybe next time I will trust another friend.
&gt;<i> Free: I can't think of any system that can guarantee this other than a
</I>&gt;<i> voting booth in a public venue. By voting on the Internet from any
</I>&gt;<i> computer the risk is introduced of a third party having control over
</I>&gt;<i> that resource and forcing the voter to vote a certain way.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>:<i>-) 101% agreed. if you have a particular interest for this field check
</I>our &quot;User Verifiable Telematics&quot; project
(<A HREF="http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en/projects/user-verifiable-telematics">http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en/projects/user-verifiable-telematics</A>)
&gt;<i> I think this problem is inherent an haven't been able to come up with
</I>&gt;<i> a solution in the few years I've been thinking about these systems. I
</I>&gt;<i> can only find a partial justification that in a civilised society this
</I>&gt;<i> should be a statistically insignificant problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equal: No difference as far as I can see.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Secret: I could talk for hours about this but the best solution I've
</I>&gt;<i> seen so far tries to limit the number of parties you have to trust to
</I>&gt;<i> as few as possible. And even in that system, which relies on
</I>&gt;<i> Public-key cryptography, which may not be trusted by every voter, even
</I>&gt;<i> if they trust the one party they are sending their votes to.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Cool... again, please check what we are trying to achieve with user
verifiable telematics project. I had a meeting with a computer science
professor at the university of rome today interested in joining our EU
bid for this project and we are willing to start a research group...
&gt;<i> Considering all the problems with online voting, my conclusion is that
</I>&gt;<i> we should reconsider voting not as a binding for decisions, but as an
</I>&gt;<i> indicator for the direction the community wants to take, so that
</I>&gt;<i> gradually consensus can be reached.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>well.. somehow decisions need to be taken. it is hard to tell an
organization to use a software to discuss and deliberate but that in the
end the decision is not taken, so everything can happen... I mean... the
situation differs from org to org... but I think I got the essence of
what you're saying here... &quot;do not trust too much on online voting&quot;, and
I agree on that :-)
cheers and thanks for the great brainstorming!
