  As noted earlier, I had written to the Software Freedom Law Center &lt;<A HREF="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">http://www.softwarefreedom.org/</A> 
   &gt; to inquire about the possibility of their acting as a steward for  
  funds collected by the project. See below for their response. Shortly,  
  I will also forward the response I sent in reply to the below. I was  
  going to ask for everyone's input into the reply, but it seemed pretty  
  straight-forward, so I figured I'd act in the spirit of adhocracy and  
  just get the job done.

  &gt; Reply-To: &lt;redacted for list&gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; To apply to the Conservancy, we ask project leader(s) send us the
  &gt; following (links to online documents where the information is already
  &gt; published is fine):
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Detailed description of the project.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Roadmap for future development.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * link to the website.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Link to the code repository.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual
  &gt;     on behalf of the projects?  How and for what did you spend those
  &gt;     funds?
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Brief history of the project, including past governance decisions.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Existing for-profit or non-profit affiliations, funding
  &gt;     relationships, or other agreements that the project or its leaders
  &gt;     have with other organizations.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Names, email addresses, and affiliations of key developers, past  
  &gt; and
  &gt;     present.
  &gt;
  &gt;   * Information about any past for-profit or non-profit organizational
  &gt;     affiliations the project has had.
  &gt;
  &gt; Please be advised that we currently have a backlog of applications,  
  &gt; and it
  &gt; is currently taking about three months for projects to be considered  
  &gt; by
  &gt; our evaluation committee.  Usually, our evaluation committee comes  
  &gt; back
  &gt; with a list of questions, and then if you answer quickly, it is one  
  &gt; month
  &gt; later that the project is given a decision.
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; There has been overwhelming interest in the Conservancy, and we are
  &gt; evaluating projects on a first-come, first-evaluated basis.  We are  
  &gt; also
  &gt; prioritizing our work to make sure the needs of already accepted  
  &gt; projects
  &gt; are met before we proceed on the evaluation and acceptance of new
  &gt; projects.  Please understand that our delay is primarily to make sure
  &gt; projects already in the Conservancy get what they need, and should  
  &gt; your
  &gt; project ultimately join the Conservancy, your project will be a
  &gt; beneficiary of that.  Like most non-profits, we are struggling to  
  &gt; match
  &gt; very scarce resources with a growing demand from the community that we
  &gt; serve.  We have only two part-time staffers, whose time is graciously
  &gt; donated by the SFLC.
  &gt;
  &gt; Feel free to submit the information I described, and anything else  
  &gt; you'd
  &gt; like us to review in considering an application, and we will add you  
  &gt; to
  &gt; the queue.  We appreciate your understanding regarding the delay.
  &gt;
  &gt; Finally, we ask that applying projects consider donating a  
  &gt; percentage of
  &gt; their funding to the general operating costs of the Conservancy.   
  &gt; This is
  &gt; a way to assure we can continue providing a high level of service to  
  &gt; all
  &gt; Conservancy projects.  This is, however, voluntary and negotiable.
  &gt;
  &gt; -- 
  &gt; Bradley M. Kuhn
  &gt; President, Software Freedom Conservancy

  Following is the reply I sent to the SFLC. I only listed a few people  
  under &quot;key players&quot; with the clear notification that that was somewhat  
  arbitrary. I tried to make it clear the we are explicitly focused  
  around not having formal leaders.

  (I also forgot to proof-read my preface below so have a bit of  
  repetition and a misspelling in it. Oops. I'm leaving it as is in the  
  spirit of transparency.)

  &gt;&gt;  * Detailed description of the project.
  &gt;
  &gt; The latest description of the project is maintained on the project  
  &gt; home page: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org">http://www.metagovernment.org</A>
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Roadmap for future development.
  &gt;
  &gt; The roadmap for the primary software branch is available at: <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/PrototypeA_Roadmap">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/PrototypeA_Roadmap</A>
  &gt; and
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/PrototypeA">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/PrototypeA</A>

  &gt;&gt;  * Link to the code repository.
  &gt;
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Repositories">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Repositories</A>
  &gt;
  &gt; Most notable repository is
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.bitbucket.org/mbarkhau/metascore/overview/">http://www.bitbucket.org/mbarkhau/metascore/overview/</A>
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Have you ever had funds held by the project, or by any individual
  &gt;&gt;    on behalf of the projects?  How and for what did you spend those
  &gt;&gt;    funds?
  &gt;
  &gt; No. Only funding has been individual expenditures for hosting.
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Brief history of the project, including past governance decisions.
  &gt;
  &gt; Project was initiated in March 2007 as a static website. In April  
  &gt; 2008 a list server was initiated with eleven members. That list was  
  &gt; quickly opened to the public for subscription, and now has over 50  
  &gt; members. That list is the sole governance mechanism of the project,  
  &gt; until such time as we use our own software, Metascore, as our  
  &gt; governance mechanism. See:
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup</A>
  &gt;
  &gt; Because this project is centered around developing a new form of  
  &gt; governance, we deliberately have no single leader and no formal  
  &gt; structure. Until our software is mature, we act an adhocracy. When  
  &gt; our software is at a better level of development, it will be the  
  &gt; formal and exclusive governance mechanism of the project.
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Existing for-profit or non-profit affiliations, funding
  &gt;&gt;    relationships, or other agreements that the project or its leaders
  &gt;&gt;    have with other organizations.
  &gt;
  &gt; No formal agreements with other organizations. Members of numerous  
  &gt; direct democracy groups and policy-oriented software-development  
  &gt; projects are members of our list server, but mostly as collegial  
  &gt; affiliates or as lurkers. These people's memberships are indicated  
  &gt; on this page in italics or as links to User pages:
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Names, email addresses, and affiliations of key developers, past  
  &gt;&gt; and
  &gt;&gt;    present.

  &gt;
  &gt; Note: roles are informal. As noted above, we have no official  
  &gt; leaders and exist as an adhocracy. Numerous other people make  
  &gt; significant contributions to the project, as is evident from our  
  &gt; archives:
  &gt; <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Archive">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Archive</A>
  &gt;
  &gt;&gt;  * Information about any past for-profit or non-profit organizational
  &gt;&gt;    affiliations the project has had.
  &gt;
  &gt; No official affiliations. Only informal relationships with other  
  &gt; groups as noted above.
