<PRE>&gt;<i> When I tried registering I was taken to another website, IntenseDebate.com,
</I>&gt;<i> which Change.gov uses empower their discussions system. My thoughts are that
</I>&gt;<i> we should focus MetaScore on the Policy Making process, and that we might
</I>&gt;<i> use something like IntenseDebate.com to handle the discussions that are
</I>&gt;<i> attached to every Issue, Proposal, and Policy in MetaScore.

There is probably some worth to having the discussions within the
system, otherwise it will be more difficult to navigate from a
proposal to its related discussions. Focusing on one area first is

</I>&gt;<i> we might want to consider using &quot;profiles&quot; from other sites such as
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook. They've recently released a Facebook Connect that my friend at
</I>&gt;<i> GovIt.com is using on his website. Other big names such as Hulu and Digg are
</I>&gt;<i> supposedly getting on the bandwagon as well. Here's an article from Wired:

I'm not so sure about facebook, but I hope we can use the OpenId
stack, which serves the same function.
