<PRE>Mark Weiler has developed a website/software called Open Government Records
(OGR). It's designed to support groups of people to share the text of
freedom of information requests and responsive records.

OGR is a plugin for the Open Journal System (OJS; <A HREF="http://pkp.sfu.ca/">http://pkp.sfu.ca/</A>) which
is an open source academic journal publishing software. For OGR, the central
metaphor is a FOI Journal and the idea is groups of people can make their
own journal and publish FOI requests in them. A FOI Journal can associated
to an organization (akin to WhatDoTheyKnow.com) or a theme that spans
multiple public bodies (e.g., renewable energy).

It's designed as a research technology and intended for academic
researchers, however, I'm sure it could be used by a range of groups and
people. It's designed within the Canadian legal context and so there's
things that OGR can't do that WhatDoTheyKnow.com can do (e.g., in Canada
almost all correspondence between the applicant and public body is via mail
-- although we can ask for the responsive records to be mailed in electronic
format).

It's still in development, but if you did wanted to take a look, it's here:
