<PRE>&gt;<i> I am quite interested in all aspects of this initiative for open-source
</I>&gt;<i> government/governance, but I do not have exhorbitant amounts of time to
</I>&gt;<i> devout to reading scores of emails (start-list).
</I>
&gt;<i> Or are we so caught up in the philosophical ideals
</I>&gt;<i> that we are not working towards any 'functional' goals??
</I>
Time seems to be the main limitation rather than disorganisation,
though maybe the outward appearance isn't such that we can gather
productive participants. Between university, paying the bills and
private life, there's only so much I can devote to the project. An
recent email from Christopher gave a similar sentiment and I'm sure
many others may not be able to devote the time to the project that it
deserves.

&gt;<i> I was think perhaps if we could set out a basic outline of what's going on
</I>&gt;<i> with metagovernment and then posting either bullets of relevant items under
</I>&gt;<i> each item under discussion or putting together some sort of chart that shows
</I>&gt;<i> prioritizing or how we're allocating responsibilities under different aspects of this ideal.
</I>
Linked from the first section on the main page, is the participate
article, which might be a good place to put that overview.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A>

&gt;<i> Please advise so I can best assist on the user-interface aspect, etc.
</I>
What is your experience in that area? We're certainly looking for
somebody to help Christopher with the front-end (xhtml, css,
javascript).
