I have to say, I'm so happy to see this issue raised. I have been in
agreement with Michael for some time, and have attempted to express those
opinions on questions of whether to support or not support unweighted,
direct voting (one person, one vote) above or beyond a consensus score, and
on questions of whether to support or not support political parties and
other groups/organizations in the interface. Probably the best summary of
the debate would be the snippet of a conversation from May, 2008 I have
included below.

I would say, this is a question we should address as a group regarding our
approach to developing software that may be used to mediate
politically-charged discussions, if not implement legislation: Do we want to
encourage citizens to engage in a constitutional convention, developing the
structure of their own government?? Or, are we attempting to promote a view
(ie, no voting) that people can choose to use or not use at their will??

My guess is that the 'meta-' in metagovernment implies that the government
governs itself -- ie, that it can evolve. And I would argue strongly for
developing software that anticipates this evolution through extension and
modification (perhaps with a modular design). Particularly for projects such
as metascore where the application may not be solely confined to governance.

   I don't disagree with simple -- as long as the system is customizable
   (whether internally or externally), then users can do whatever they want
   with it -- provided they have the skills.

   I would just suggest that we keep the participants' needs and wants in
   mind (and allow their needs/wants to be decided by consensus) rather
   than impose our vision of government on them.

We cannot impose our vision - whatever tools we give, they will bend them to
implement the kind of government they want. But we shouldn't implement
features to help this or that kind of government &quot;just to give them an easy
option&quot;.
