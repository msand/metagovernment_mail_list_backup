<PRE>I'm beginning to get the sense that the various implementation questions --
regarding the existence of an executive, direct voting vs consensus score,
the notion that legislation is in effect when consensus is reached and only
so long as consensus is maintained, etc -- is a very specific, new and
interesting political theory that the combination of these metrics would
maintain a consensus-building environment. The fact that they are *in
combination* is no doubt important -- take away one piece, and I can see the
fear that the implementation might break down, and chaos would result. It
reminds me of the many essays I have been reading about the current economic
crisis in its similarity to free market capitalism governed by intelligently
designed regulation.

But, as much as this may be interesting to pursue, and indeed I am intrigued
by it, I am also attracted by the promise of a concept like metascore that
does not depend on any particular political structure or ideology. Indeed,
metascore could be implemented in a dictatorship where the dictator simply
wanted to solicit citizen's collective opinions. I would urge us to separate
the technical development of metascore from the development and elaboration
on the consensus-building theories and regulations identified above. They
are both useful, and each can support the other, but they are not
necessarily entangled.

At the same time, I can see some specific problems with the
consensus-building apparatus as currently discussed, and I mean this to be
constructive criticism:

1) the notion that legislation will be implemented when and only when
consensus is reached, and only for so long as consensus is reached.
My concern here is that businesses base their business plan and economic
strategy on the current state of the law. An uncertain legislative forecast
brings uncertainty into the market, which translates as increased costs.

2) the reliance on consensus as opposed to voting, and/or relying on votes
weighted by user approval scores as opposed to direct proportions of people,
and/or the lack of distinct between communities/populations (however
defined)
Here, i think, the process is lacking the fundamental justifying principle
of democracy -- namely, popular support by those the legislation would
affect most. I don't quite see how the government is legitimatized in the
absence of a tally of yes/no opinions.

3) the absence of groups/organizations, so that every individual voice
speaks alone
I recently read a political science research article of local government
structures that correlated how direct the legislative democracy with the
extent to which voter opinions translated into legislative outcomes. The
degree to which democracy was considered 'direct' depended on whether there
was a popular vote on all legislation, a representative-style government, or
an unelected official and on whether political parties were or were not
actors in the system.

Surprisingly, the study found that many more voter opinions translated into
active legislation when the democracy was *least* direct -- this was
attributed to the fact that minority groups gained more power in concert
(when represented by a district official or legislator and when represented
by a minority political party) than they would have in a more direct
democratic system. It found that a consensus among the groups, irrespective
of their size, was more often found when each disparate opinion had a
representative.

I don't have the link here, but I am happy to look for it and post to the
list in the future.

</I>&gt;<i> direct voting (one person, one vote) above or beyond a consensus score, and
</I>&gt;<i> on questions of whether to support or not support political parties and

</I>&gt;<i> I would say, this is a question we should address as a group regarding our
</I>&gt;<i> approach to developing software that may be used to mediate
</I>&gt;<i> politically-charged discussions, if not implement legislation: Do we want to
</I>&gt;<i> encourage citizens to engage in a constitutional convention, developing the
</I>&gt;<i> structure of their own government?? Or, are we attempting to promote a view
</I>&gt;<i> (ie, no voting) that people can choose to use or not use at their will??
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My guess is that the 'meta-' in metagovernment implies that the government
</I>&gt;<i> governs itself -- ie, that it can evolve. And I would argue strongly for
</I>&gt;<i> developing software that anticipates this evolution through extension and
</I>&gt;<i> modification (perhaps with a modular design). Particularly for projects such
</I>&gt;<i> as metascore where the application may not be solely confined to governance.
