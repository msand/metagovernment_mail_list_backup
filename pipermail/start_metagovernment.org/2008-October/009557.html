&gt;<i> As far as government is concerned, it's clear you intend to replace

</I>
We currently lack the levels of transparency and accountability which
are the foundations to such a theory - playing with unproven premises
leads towards junk science. I could point to ecosystems, man-made and
otherwise which follow an objective over time without any centralised
power or coordinating force other than that of emergence itself - but
all analogies are shadow.

For my part, and I certainly am not aware of speaking for anyone else
in this regard, I see Metagovernment - in this moment of time - as
more idealists than pragmatists (e.g. FSF vs. OSI). Because in my
mind, the ideal form of government would not be vulnerable to
individual or collective weakness. It may not be an achievable goal,
and there are many historical examples which would suggest as such -
and maybe I read too much pulp sci-fi in my younger years - but I can
imagine such a system working. If it doesn't work out then at least we
can be some use to the community by documenting our progress!


&gt;<i> Power is force and threat of force.  The power of a modern state
</I>&gt;<i> extends to life and death over its citizens.  Is this what you would
</I>&gt;<i> hold in your collective hands?  (Too many of you will be repelled by
</I>&gt;<i> the very thought of it.)
</I>
I think we recognise that at some point we would have to deal with
issues like abortion and euthanasia. Once those are cleared up, it
should for the most part get easier on that life/death front.


&gt;<i> Is it even possible?  How does a collective wield power?
</I>
A collective determines mandates, and empowers individuals or groups
to perform their assigned duties.


&gt;<i> Maybe there are answers to these questions.  I only argue in favour of
</I>&gt;<i> testing the premise in thought experiments, research etc., before you
</I>&gt;<i> go too far in the real world.
</I>
I like Ed's idea of starting with chess clubs and condo boards :-)


&gt;<i> (Maybe revolution is a distant
</I>&gt;<i> prospect, but if it's also impossible, then it's better to consider
</I>&gt;<i> the alternatives sooner rather than later.)
</I>
I don't recall revolution coming up. Many politicians use
Blackberries. Undoubtedly this has changed working patterns and the
way the job is performed in some respects. The Blackberry 'revolution'
is simply a ubiquitous useful technology which enables people to
collaborate better than the previous technology (desktop email/
landline telephone), to meet their personal agendas.

Likewise, if politicians (or other governmental departments) start
using Metascore of their own accord, then it will be because it offers
them a tangible incentive to do so - now it just so happens that if it
is designed correctly then the populace gains more, over time. But
that's a long way away from talking about revolution.
