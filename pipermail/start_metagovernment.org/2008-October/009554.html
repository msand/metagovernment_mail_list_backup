My game theory is weak (I cannot answer).  I'm learning just a little
game theory by coincidence.  I'm reading Poundstone's &quot;Gaming the
Vote&quot;.  Recommended :) an entertaining introduction to voting methods
and down-and-dirty politics!
 
&gt;<i> &gt; If I have a question about issues, it may be with the action aspect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (not the mechanics of voting).  What will come of the voting?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's a 'fairly condensed' discussion here with relation to
</I>&gt;<i> emergency planning:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I think Metagovernment attempts a harder goal - moving away from a
</I>&gt;<i> leadership society altogether, and harnessing collective will - and is
</I>&gt;<i> more idealistic in the sense that without the ability to fully
</I>&gt;<i> envisage such a society, it is literally impossible to state whether
</I>&gt;<i> it is possible or not.
</I>
&gt;<i> This is markedly different from the approach in the diagram here:
</I>&gt;<i>   <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-power">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-power</A>
</I>
So you'd take over the executive.  I thought so, and I was surprised.

But I'm trying to recall what I first thought, when I realized that
cascade voting could be applied to executive elections.  Did I think
the voters would gain power?  Probably.  I had no idea what &quot;power&quot;
means.

(I will answer to Ed Pastore's post, in the other thread.  Please join
me there.)

Best,
