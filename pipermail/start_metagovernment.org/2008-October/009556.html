<PRE>Hey Mark,
The design document looks great! I thought I had a clear idea of where you
guys were headed with the original concepts, but the design firm has really
laid the plans out nicely. What I like most is the focus on Topics and
Issues, which not only lies at the heart of Democracy, but also forms the
basis on which our &quot;brick and mortars&quot; are built. However, I wonder if
starting off with Topics and Issues oversteps an even bigger part of
Democracy:  the Communities in which they exist?

When I first reviewed the design document my first inclination was to
compare it to the work at FreeGovernment.org. I noticed their site was
squarely focused on American politics, similar to GovIt.com, where citizens
are free to vote on the issues before Congress, and contact their
Representatives with their personal opinions on the Bills. The end result
being that I felt as though I was able to connect more deeply with my
Political Community.

In contrast to these two projects, I felt as though the democracyLab was
lacking any particular Community. This felt akin to visiting Drupal.org --
an open source content management system -- and simply seeing a blank CMS
for users to add content to at will. What would be the point? Are we here to
develop democracyLab? Are we here to recreate the Government in our image?
Or are we simply here to communicate with our Representatives?

Personally, I'm stoked to imagine one day logging into my local portal and
seeing the issues that affect my community. It might be a bit premature to
put the Oregon District on your release schedule, but I think that
democracyLab would do well to put their own community online first. This
means feeding your activities on the front page, along with a breakdown of
what democracyLab is -- as if you were talking to a five year old.

The REAL test of democracyLab is to see whether it can manage the
democracyLab community. If you find any gaps, it's probably a good indicator
that the democracyLab isn't fully realized -- possibly, stopping at the
definition of a Wiki or Craig's List. Once we start throwing around words
like Democracy, I feel that puts us in an entirely different camp from the
&quot;information gatherers,&quot; back into our &quot;brick and mortar&quot; communities.
