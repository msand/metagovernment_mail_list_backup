<PRE>I will answer to Ed.  Richard is passionate, but I am trying to appeal
to reason.  I hope we can work together.  I hope that ideology is not
the only attraction of this project.  It seems to be strong in:

  a) people
  b) leadership

Our strengths are complimentary.  Votorola is strong in:

  c) theory
  d) design
  e) code

I am (I) attacking your ideology (with reason), and (II) holding out
an alternative that is non-ideological.

(I)

Ed Pastore wrote:
&gt;<i> As long as nation-states see a utility to waging war, they will have

</I>&gt;<i> as well as (and arguably better than) a single, fallible individual.
</I>
Can it?  What if the Chief of the General Staff no longer wishes to
take his orders from the collective?  First of all, he may feel
uncomfortable in obeying a Commander in Chief who has no body and no
head.  His personal sense of discipline and honour (on which even a
&quot;fallible&quot; President could formerly depend) may balk at this
un-military arrangement.

When he accepted his commission as a junior officer, he swore to
uphold the constitution and to protect the citizens.  But the
constitution has been radically altered.

Now it is a time of war.  The military command is in disagreement with
the civil collective in a crisis of war policy.  The commander fears
that, if he follows the orders of the collective and reigns in his own
staff, he will lose their loyalty and possibly lose the war.  He must
therefore choose between, on the one hand, his loyalty to the
Commander in Chief and his duty to uphold the constitution (both
weakened), and, on the other, his duty to safeguard the nation (still
strong).

He confers with his staff.  They agree with his plan to (politely but
firmly) ignore the civil collective.  The military will now implement
its own war policy.  In matters of war, the Chief of the General Staff
is henceforth the Commander in Chief.

How will the civil collective stop him?

It's too late.  By removing the executive from government, you made a
military commander the most powerful man in the state.  At the same
time, you severed the ties of personal loyalty that had formerly bound
him to civil society.  So you set the perfect stage for a coup,
dictatorship, and the end of democracy.

(II)

&gt;&gt;<i> After all, Metagovernment is nothing but a norm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see it that way. Metagovernment is the collective of people wishing 
</I>&gt;<i> to participate in governance of Metascore and more generally in governance 
</I>&gt;<i> of a universally-inclusive internet-based community. Things don't get voted 
</I>&gt;<i> down, they get synthesized. So if Metascore isn't working out well, it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be transformed. This is why we are building it to be as flexible and 
</I>&gt;<i> malleable as possible... because we know it will have to transform 
</I>&gt;<i> substantially as more people participate.
</I>
It cannot happen that way.  A norm (in this case a constitution, or
form of governance) can never be flexible and malleable enough to
please everyone.  The membership will inevitably split into competing
camps, backing competing variants of the norm.  You have no power to
force a consensus by suppressing dissent, because dissent will burst
the bounds of your project.  It will happen like this:

Someone has a &quot;better&quot; norm, but only a minority (10%) agree to it.
So that 10% will depart from the project, and pursue their own norm
(form of governance) in a separate &quot;project&quot;.  And so on.  Soon there
will be a bazaar of competing projects, with the membership shifting
among them.  Effectively the members will be voting with their feet.

That's fine, but it's rather inefficient.  The only thing they
agree/disagree about is a norm, a document!  Why should they have to
decamp to separate organizations in order to express their
consensus/dissensus?  Would it not be better to allow all variants to
be simultaneously exposed to voting in a single, ideologically
neutral, electoral medium?  Then there can be a single organization
(whatever it is), and dissenters will have no reason to decamp (or
worse).  Their dissent will be openly expressed in variant norms, and
not hidden or suppressed.

Norms will then have not a single path of transformation (revision
history), but multiple variant paths.  People will shift their votes
from variant to variant, instead of shifting their bodies from
organization to organization.  They will vote using a common medium
(Metascore or whatever) that is idealogically neutral, and separate
from the issues they vote on.  If they disagree, they need not
escalate the disagreement by decamping (or worse) - instead they
simply express their disagreement in the medium.  Then everyone can
see, &quot;Ah, we disagree on this.  Let's talk.  Maybe we misunderstood
something&quot;

(Richard Franks and Clay Shirkey may approve, as this approach
synthesizes both radial/path and Cartesian/leap optimization
strategies.  Decision paths of the majority cannot get stuck in local
maxima, nor can leaps of the minority erase past gains.)

(Nature follows a similar approach.  Her creatures share a common
genetic code - a &quot;voting&quot; medium, you might say.  But she does not
force them into a single lineage.  Rather she lets them branch out and
seek their own optima.)

&gt;<i> ... Anyone may join now, and that principle will continue: it is the
</I>&gt;<i> first and most fundamental principle of the project. The project as
</I>&gt;<i> originally stated was radically different from what it is now.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Archive">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Archive</A> Each new participant has
</I>&gt;<i> helped transform it into something stronger and more flexible. I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot imagine how it will end up... I am only making guesses based
</I>&gt;<i> on what I have seen so far.
</I>
It will end up splitting into an open field of alternatives - that
much is certain.  The singular will become plural, the &quot;it&quot; will
become &quot;they&quot;.  Votorola is already designed to build consensus
(unforced) in such an open population.  It's way ahead of you, on that
particular front.

Why start with hot dog stands, and work up to chess clubs?  Why &quot;play
government&quot;?  Votorola's beta release will be sufficient to start
voting on the officers (executive, legislature, judiciary,
bureaucracy) and norms (laws, plans, policies) of real government -
not a virtual stand-in.
