I think you very well articulated a 'better' reputation system (i.e. one 
based upon community consensus).  As I said, I do think that the 
Internet enables alternative (and better) reputation systems...and 
enabling those seems to me to be a better approach then trying to 
eliminate reputation systems completely.

RE: sacrificing the ideals of democracy...I don't really think that in 
general reputation systems sacrifice the ideals of democracy...just bad 
ones :).
