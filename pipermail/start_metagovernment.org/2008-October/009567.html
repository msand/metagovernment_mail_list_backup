Your question was about command of the armed forces, not an overall  
executive. As I noted: first, I agree that replacement of nations  
would be relatively far-off, and second, nations do not need to be  
replaced wholesale.

As long as nation-states see a utility to waging war, they will have  
militaries and those will have their traditional power structures. A  
well-developed collective can be the boss of a military executive  
commander as well as (and arguably better than) a single, fallible  
individual.

Even if nations do eventually dissolve, police organizations will  
likely remain, and their bureaucracy will still likely be  
hierarchical. I do not see a conflict there, as long as the collective  
has overall power over the body of police.

</I>
We have been very clear that these are two projects, and it is our  
intention to use Metascore as the governance mechanism of  
Metagovernment as soon as possible. Even before that, in testing mode.

&gt;<i> After all,
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment is nothing but a norm - a proposed constitution - one
</I>&gt;<i> of an unlimited number of constitutions that people may eventually
</I>&gt;<i> rate with the help of Metascore.  It is possible (even likely, given
</I>&gt;<i> its flaw) that Metagovernment will be voted down and itself replaced
</I>&gt;<i> at the very outset.  The two projects are therefore logically
</I>&gt;<i> separate.
</I>
I don't see it that way. Metagovernment is the collective of people  
wishing to participate in governance of Metascore and more generally  
in governance of a universally-inclusive internet-based community.  
Things don't get voted down, they get synthesized. So if Metascore  
isn't working out well, it will be transformed. This is why we are  
building it to be as flexible and malleable as possible... because we  
know it will have to transform substantially as more people participate.

&gt;<i> They are *rightfully* separate, too.  It would be impertinent to
</I>&gt;<i> presuppose any particular form of government as *the* goal.  If a
</I>&gt;<i> project is &quot;open&quot; and claims the mantra of democracy (what John Dunn
</I>&gt;<i> called the &quot;unfinished journey&quot;), then it ought to let ordinary people
</I>&gt;<i> decide on the destination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you not agree?
</I>
Absolutely. Anyone may join now, and that principle will continue: it  
is the first and most fundamental principle of the project. The  
project as originally stated was radically different from what it is  
now.

Each new participant has helped transform it into something stronger  
and more flexible. I cannot imagine how it will end up... I am only  
making guesses based on what I have seen so far.
