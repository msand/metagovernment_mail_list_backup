<PRE>&gt;<i> I thought we had discussed this before and found that there was nothing
</I>&gt;<i> stopping groups from forming. The real opposition was to formalizing the
</I>&gt;<i> groups in the software or in the Metagovernment. It seems like they can
</I>&gt;<i> still have the same level of efficacy without having to be written into law.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if they are formalized, then individuals who do not wish to join
</I>&gt;<i> groups are immediately diminished in their ability to participate. In the
</I>&gt;<i> United States, for example, if one does not agree with Democrats or
</I>&gt;<i> Republicans, one has no realistic recourse and no effective say in
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>
My current thinking is still not to encourage groups, to avoid people forming
parties and thereby building partisanship. But I am thinking of the concept of a
community, with a common repository to merge into. The difference is of course
semantic and there is the possibility, that it will be used for the
former as well
as the latter.
