I hope to learn how DemocracyLab and Votorola will interact, whether
in competition or in cooperation.  My questions fall into four areas:

  A. Understanding DemocracyLab as a project.
  B. Understanding DemocracyLab as a technology.
  C. Competition with Votorola.
  D. Cooperation with Votorola.

A. Understanding DemocracyLab as a project.
-------------------------------------------

&gt;<i> DemocracyLab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>&gt; is a nonprofit
</I>&gt;<i> organization based in the United States whose mission is to &quot;Create
</I>&gt;<i> a non-partisan, non-profit website dedicated to improving the
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process by enabling the exploration, organization,
</I>&gt;<i> communication, and synthesis of the values, positions, and policies
</I>&gt;<i> affecting humanity.&quot;
</I>
Who is funding your project?

Under what licence is your software and documentation released?

Are you holding any proprietary information or technology?  Any
non-open copyrights?  Any patents?

Are you witholding any trade secrets?  Any undisclosed business plans
or technical designs?  Any patent applications?

B. Understanding DemocracyLab as a technology.
----------------------------------------------

&gt;<i> &gt;Are there still no docs on the conceptual and technical details of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;basic method - UI aside?
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> ... Are there resources you can point to that provide examples of
</I>&gt;<i> the types of documents you're hoping to see?
</I>
I can find no examples on your site.  I am interested in two types of
document:

  i) A concept or theory paper, with information that a social
     scientist would need to evaluate your method.  For example,
     Votorola has this: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht</A>

 ii) A system design, with information that an engineer would need to
     understand the technical architecture.  For example, Votorola has
     this: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/design.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/design.xht</A>

C. Competition.
---------------

Based on your answers to my previous post, I have a rough sense of how
we align on (C) and (D).  For the most part, our projects are not
competitive.  Votorola is *purely* a voting system.  It enables people
to express assent (and dissent) with regard to candidates for public
office and proposed norms (laws, plans and policies).  But it's not
directly concerned with the other communications that are required,
such as discussions among voters, or collaboration on the construction
of norms, and so forth.  Votorola leaves these and other important
functions entirely to external media.

Where DemocracyLab and Votorola compete is in the direct expression of
assent for proposed norms (policies as you call them).  And it appears
that you are weak on this point.  (No surprise, I have yet to discover
a project that can approach Votorola's design for open voting on
norms.)

Richard Franks is pointing out one area of weakness, namely voter
authentication.  He is proposing to solve it with a trust network that
enables voters to cross-authenticate themselves.  I had the same idea
a year ago, and I vetted it among social scientists in the APSA_ITP
list.  I've since coded it, and it is now a part of Votorola.

Darwin O'Connor is pointing out another common weakness, namely the
suppression of minority views.  Votorola is the only system I know of
that precludes all forms of suppression, allowing for open expression
of dissent and competing views.  The solution is partly the unique
voting mechanism (delegate cascade), and partly the openess of
collaborative drafting media.  The drafting media and their documents
are not part of Votorola per se, but are spread out across the Web and
the larger Internet.  This is where we could be cooperating, instead
of competing.

D. Cooperation.
---------------

DemocracyLab's specialty seems to be in cognitive mapping and
classification of documents, etc.  I cannot evaluate your method until
I see design and theory docs.  But I do know that voters are going to
need a classification scheme for newly proposed norms - legislative
bills, plans and policies.

You see, there will be a great many new proposals.  Most of them will
prove to be worthless, but they must all be responded to in a fair
manner - ideally by every participant.

Here is what I am thinking: If a typical voter could quickly
understand the rough category of a new proposal (ideally in 2 seconds)
- whether it concerns &quot;municipal property taxes&quot;, or &quot;improvements to
the park down the street&quot;, or &quot;foreign policy with regard to Africa&quot; -
then she will be able to use Votorola to immediately cast a vote (in
as little as 3 seconds).  Magically, not only will her vote be
rational, but it will also take into consideration all
counter-proposals (past and future) for that particular norm.  (The
magic is in delegation, of course.)

If DemocracyLab were sufficiently open with regard to the location of
its policy documents (I care only about those, and not about the
concepts etc. that map to them), then we might be able to cooperate.
So, instead of storing the policy docs on a central site, you would
link to them by standard Web URI (like Votorola does).  Could you do
that?

A technical consideration: Each policy document (at a given URI) is
potentially mutable.  You cannot assume static content, as perhaps you
do now.

(My offer to cooperate also extends to the Metagovernment project.
They have similar weaknesses, but different strengths.  And to other
projects, as well...)
