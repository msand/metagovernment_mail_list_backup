<PRE>Hi Dmitri,

Sorry for the slow reply, it was Thanksgiving weekend here.

&gt;<i> &gt; (The Russian news media are owned/controlled by the government.)

&gt;<i> This is true for many countries. For the remaining ones,
</I>&gt;<i> governments and media are controlled by businesses. While some
</I>&gt;<i> governments/corporations are more clever than others and use

</I>&gt;<i> we (participants of this mailing list ?) are trying to solve/
</I>
Yes (speaking for myself).  The problem space that interests me is the
public sphere.  I agree, it's not only the government that penetrates
and manipulates the public sphere, it's also the economic system.  So
the overall problem is the same, east or west.

&gt;<i> &gt; I do not think you can develop such a thing in Russia (very sad to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say), because the government would oppose it.  They would find the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means to thwart it, through various harrassments.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are you aware of governments that would welcome reduction of
</I>&gt;<i> their powers? I do not think we should concern ourselves with the
</I>&gt;<i> reaction of governments - all government would resist, just in
</I>&gt;<i> different ways. Instead, we should work on the public, get people to
</I>&gt;<i> at least think of better (more efficient and more democratic)
</I>&gt;<i> political systems.
</I>
Again, I agree.

&gt;<i> &gt; Whether they would dare to formally ban it (after it is developed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; externally) is another question.  It might hurt them to do so.  So
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there is still hope for Russians.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not see how it would hurt any government as long as a clever
</I>&gt;<i> reason is found (like declare everyone a terrorist :)
</I>
(Hopefully, that's as clever as they get.)

&gt;<i> So, can you offer us any help? Does your &quot;open electoral system&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> work in languages other than English?
</I>
Yes.  Votorola's user interface is localizeable to any language.  You
would have to do the translations:

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/locale/">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/locale/</A>

To make it easier for Russian, we'd have to add support for UTF
encoded property files.  No problem, we can do that.

(PS.  Please if possible switch your mail client to send plain text or
plain text + HTML.  My reader cannot handle HTML alone.)

Best,
