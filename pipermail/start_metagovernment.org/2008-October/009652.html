That depends on your views on meritocracy and/or reputocracy, and  
their place in democracy.

(And in comparison to the status quo... currently in the U.S., for  
example, all ideas which do not have credibility with the staff of a  
representative are dismissed out of hand, before even being brought to  
the attention of that representative.)

&gt;<i> One of the main benefits of direct democracy is that ideas can stand

The issue, however, is one of overload. If all ideas are given equal  
credence and there are millions or billions of people participating,  
how would one ever make sense of it all?

The solutions proposed in the Metagovernment project are:

1. Scoring: Where no ideas are suppressed, but ideas which caught the  
interest of some people (and/or possibly which are made by people with  
a high user score) are given more prominence, somewhat as is done on  
SlashDot.

2. Tagging: Where everyone (including comment authors) apply tags to  
comments, then users can make their own tag-based filters to view  
things which interest them.
