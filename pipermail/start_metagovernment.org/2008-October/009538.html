Thanks for your input, Olaf.

This idea isn't new to us, and we believe we have a workable solution.  
First, we haven't fixed our definition of consensus. In small groups,  
that may mean 100% support, but it is likely that in larger groups the  
standard will be dropped somewhat. After all, all social progress  
shouldn't necessarily be held hostage to, for example, the criminally  
insane.

But more to the point, our principle of &quot;consensus through synthesis&quot;  
is our primary answer. This is one of those cases where we cannot be  
compared to the status quo. In current systems, there are two (or a  
few) competing sides to an issue, each fighting for absolute victory  
over the other. At best, they come up with a compromise, though  
frequently (as in the U.S. where even a plurality can lead to extreme  
power) it is winner-take-all.

By contrast, our system rewards synthesis and &quot;punishes&quot; conflict. A  
proposal which synthesizes two conflicting proposals is rewarded by  
&quot;stealing&quot; support from those proposals. In this way, we hope to  
actively build consensuses that work for the overwhelming majority of  
people.

In cases where even heroic efforts at building consensus fail... then  
there probably shouldn't be a law on that issue.

that article.)
