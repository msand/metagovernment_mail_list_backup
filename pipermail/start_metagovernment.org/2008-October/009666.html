<PRE>Hi Scott,

It may be better, but it is not a reputation system.  Consider the two
reasons I offered, by way of distinction:

&gt;&gt;<i>  i) The votes apply only in the context of a single norm - the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     particular law, plan or policy on which we are all voting.  In
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     other votes (for other issues) I'm still Joe average voter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ii) Although some people may be voting confidence in me (personally),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     most of them are probably only voting for my ideas.  They're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hoping I'll use their votes as leverage, and push the ideas
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     closer to action.
</I>
Here's a third:

  iii) I gain no formal privleges as a consequence of the votes I
       received.  They are merely expressions.

&gt;<i> ... As I said, I do think that the Internet enables alternative (and
</I>&gt;<i> better) reputation systems...and enabling those seems to me to be a
</I>&gt;<i> better approach then trying to eliminate reputation systems
</I>&gt;<i> completely.
</I>
Why?  It's easy enough to eliminate a reputation system.  Maybe you
have already coded one into your software?  Even still, you can remove
it.

What's more difficult to accept is systematic discrimination and
suppression in our voting methods.  Nature and society impose no
restrictions on face-to-face communication.  Nobody is naturally
raised on a pedestal and handed a megaphone, while all the others are
bound and gagged!  So we ought to design our voting methods to respect
natural freedoms and equalities, and not - for reasons of technical
convenience, scalability, etc. - to discard them, and walk all over
them.

&gt;<i> RE: sacrificing the ideals of democracy...I don't really think that in 
</I>&gt;<i> general reputation systems sacrifice the ideals of democracy...just bad 
</I>&gt;<i> ones :).
</I>
If reputation is *merely* an expression for people to interpret, that
is OK.  We don't call that a &quot;system&quot;.  It's just people interacting
in a natural way.

If there's a mechanism that automatically acts on measures of
reputation, discriminating against people and suppressing their
freedoms of expression, that's bad.  It's a machine that rolls over
people.  We've had enough of that already.
