I don't have empirical studies on this either, to be fair - we're
still somewhat in the middle of this all - so I'm just extrapolating
the trendlines as I see them. Greater minds than mine seem to be in
concurrence: <A HREF="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-internet-and-the-deat_b_136400.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-internet-and-the-deat_b_136400.html</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  c) Reinforcement by opening the elections to public offices.  Any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     official who opposes a consensus without reason is likely to find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     that his/her re-election prospects are immediately and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     graphically diminished by a loss of votes to political rivals.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     People are agreeing not only on norms, but on public offices too.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think this is a natural extension of a + b?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite, because arguments (a) and (b) refer to construction and
</I>&gt;<i> assent for norms (laws, plans and policies) and (c) refers to assent
</I>&gt;<i> for officers: those whom we expect to act on the assented norms
</I>&gt;<i> (promulgate the laws, execute the plans, adhere to the policies).
</I>
I understand the distinction, again, I was extrapolating - I should
perhaps be more clear when I do that?
