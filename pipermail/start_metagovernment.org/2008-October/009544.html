<PRE>Thanks for the link - I _love_ that so many people are seeking the
same goal :-)  Interesting - although I confess I've not read it in
detail. The bibliography in the theory document seems worth a look
too.

To attempt a summary, it seems to be somewhat similar to voting
cascades through synthesis voting. Except instead of voting on
individual issues/policies/resolutions, in votorola, you place your
vote on an individual who best seems to represent your views upon an
issue or discussion. That individual then does the dirty work of
negotiation and compromise, and eventually places their vote upon
another individual -- repeating the process until you have something
resembling consensus. Assuming you now have 1 or more empowered
individuals, they liaise with existing power structures to perform
your bidding.

Complicating the fact is that you can change your vote at any time if
you think someone else now better represents your view, but the
mechanics seem to have been worked out to take account of loops and
other anomalies.

I don't like the fact that it relies upon humans too much - existing
power structures, the people-chains of trust and layered
interpretation, and it doesn't seem to encourage the populace to
understand the issues more - it's easier to vote for someone you feel
trust for than to study a subject area.

What intrigues me, with regards Metagovernment, is that it seems like
the cascading vote system could be votes placed for issues rather than
actual people.. with a few modifications.. and those mechanisms are
more advanced than any I've seen proposed for Metascore.
