Yes.  The public sphere has other deflators, but the mass news media
are certainly up there.

We could think of them as artificial *inflators* - same difference, as
they displace the real &quot;airs&quot;.  This is maybe a fruitful analogy, as
it points to a solution: use real, grassroots (often peer-to-peer)
media to displace the artificial, mass ones.  I think that's already
starting to happen (examples you cite, and others).  It's happening
generally (more in some cases than others) in:

  a) mass media (general communication, like news)

  b) mass assent (voting)

  c) mass production

  d) mass consumption

     et al?, and maybe we can hope:

  *) mass weaponry and warfare

&gt;<i> A concrete example of this would be in the current US Election where

</I>
OK.  I'm weak on empirical studies.  But these results are not
surprising.
 
&gt;<i> &gt;  c) Reinforcement by opening the elections to public offices.  Any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     official who opposes a consensus without reason is likely to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     that his/her re-election prospects are immediately and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     graphically diminished by a loss of votes to political rivals.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     People are agreeing not only on norms, but on public offices too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is a natural extension of a + b?
</I>
Not quite, because arguments (a) and (b) refer to construction and
assent for norms (laws, plans and policies) and (c) refers to assent
for officers: those whom we expect to act on the assented norms
(promulgate the laws, execute the plans, adhere to the policies).

  a) &quot;Let's do X.&quot;

  b) 6 months later we're still saying, &quot;Let's do X.&quot;

  c) &quot;Let's elect so-and-so, because she supports X.&quot;
 
There are two simultaneous &quot;elections&quot; here: one for norm X (a and b),
and one (or more) for the official(s) responsible to act on X (c).

  a) You in the UK agree on a foreign policy directive: &quot;There are no
     grounds for an invasion of Iraq, nor a continuation of war
     against Iraq.&quot;

  b) Government ignores you.  Armed forces invade Iraq.

  c) You immediately withdraw your votes from the Prime Minister and
     Foreign Secretary (you have a vote for these cabinet positions),
     and you transfer them to other members who have *your* confidence
     on this issue.

     If your own MP is supporting the government position, you
     immediately retract your vote from her, and give it to a rival
     candidate (not yet sitting) who promises to act otherwise, once
     elected.

     If enough people do this (if Britons etc. really *do* dissent
     from the war) then MPs will lose confidence in the government
     (fearing for their seats) and the government will either back
     down, or it will fall.

     (The legality of this might be challenged in the UK.  You have a
      law that forbids against pressuring MPs.  Unsure how it would
      apply, in this case.)
