<PRE>Hi all, I'm happy to be back :)

I still want to emphasize that we separate our principles into two sets --
one, promoting the concept of online governance mechanisms (such as
transparency, extendability/customizability, participation) from the
consensus-building apparatus (consensus-based implementation, weighted
scoring, absence of groups, etc)

I think this will give the project a larger scope, and focus discussions
better.

I have responded to Ed's comments more specifically, below

</I>

I would suggest that the bar be raised quite a bit. Also, that legislation
that is active cannot be modified until a consensus is reached on a proposed
modification.

secondly, many laws currently in place take time to implement -- they say,
not now, but within the next five years such and such should happen.

maybe the threshold for amendment should be a component of every law, which
dictates the criteria by which modification is open for discussion?
Critiques can be posted, but the debate on a new version of the legislation
occurs once enough critiques are amassed to warrant an attempt to reach a
new consensus? Limiting the number of bills open for debate will keep the
focus on current (and potentially urgent) issues.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2) the reliance on consensus as opposed to voting, and/or relying on votes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weighted by user approval scores as opposed to direct proportions of people,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and/or the lack of distinct between communities/populations (however
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defined)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here, i think, the process is lacking the fundamental justifying principle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of democracy -- namely, popular support by those the legislation would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affect most. I don't quite see how the government is legitimatized in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> absence of a tally of yes/no opinions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that's where I think the sixth (admittedly disputed) principle comes
</I>&gt;<i> in. When you refer to the people who legislation would affect most, I see
</I>&gt;<i> that as a very amorphous group. On the global scale, everyone has an
</I>&gt;<i> interest in what a Brazilian farmer does with the Amazon rainforest, and
</I>&gt;<i> everyone has an interest in seeing an American commuter emit less
</I>&gt;<i> car-produced carbon. On a smaller scale, for example, a city wishing to
</I>&gt;<i> build a dam or even a farmer wishing to use a pesticide can be a very
</I>&gt;<i> important issue for people hundreds of kilometers downstream a shared river.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
perhaps every bill can have an impact statement, like the ecological impact
statements that are required in the US for new development / logging /
research activities etc? I agree that many legislative endeavors can have
far-reaching affects, but not all. and, the potential impact of the
legislation and the populations it might affect can be defined. At first,
this will be hard to characterize, but over time the participants can learn
how to predict affects. And, at least, the impact statement is open for
debate -- ie, someone can post and attempt to convince others that a given
community *does* have a stake in some proposed legislation, and thus elevate
the importance of their vote.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3) the absence of groups/organizations, so that every individual voice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> speaks alone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I recently read a political science research article of local government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structures that correlated how direct the legislative democracy with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> extent to which voter opinions translated into legislative outcomes. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> degree to which democracy was considered 'direct' depended on whether there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was a popular vote on all legislation, a representative-style government, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an unelected official and on whether political parties were or were not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actors in the system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Surprisingly, the study found that many more voter opinions translated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into active legislation when the democracy was *least* direct -- this was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attributed to the fact that minority groups gained more power in concert
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (when represented by a district official or legislator and when represented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by a minority political party) than they would have in a more direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic system. It found that a consensus among the groups, irrespective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of their size, was more often found when each disparate opinion had a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representative.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought we had discussed this before and found that there was nothing
</I>&gt;<i> stopping groups from forming. The real opposition was to formalizing the
</I>&gt;<i> groups in the software or in the Metagovernment. It seems like they can
</I>&gt;<i> still have the same level of efficacy without having to be written into law.
</I>&gt;<i> However, if they are formalized, then individuals who do not wish to join
</I>&gt;<i> groups are immediately diminished in their ability to participate. In the
</I>&gt;<i> United States, for example, if one does not agree with Democrats or
</I>&gt;<i> Republicans, one has no realistic recourse and no effective say in
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>

I don't think groups have to diminish the ability of individuals to
participate -- groups shouldn't necessarily have voting powers, or
representatives. but they can and should be able to develop and voice
opinions and statements internally -- using something similar to a metascore
implementation within a metagovernment system. One they have an opinion
formed, the opinions are considered the voice of the group. Also, if we
encourage groups, and make it easy to form them, there will likely be many
groups (as there are in facebook) of various sizes as opposed to a few
larger ones. The groups would encourage the participation of NGOs and
advocacy groups explicitly and internally, as opposed to subtley and
indirectly. In the interest of open and transparent politics, i think
explicit participation is preferred.

Here, I'm contributing some data so suggest that groups may enhance the
democratic, consensus building mechanisms rather than diminish them.
