I think an important point is that the filtering algorithm need not be
static/global/corruptible, but may allow for different perspectives
potentially unique and dynamic to each user. For example, a home page
may display multiple &quot;Top 5 proposals which...&quot; boxes fulfilling the
following:

* Are from people who vote in similar ways as you do (issues you might
want to support)
* Are from people who vote in entirely opposite ways as you do (issues
you might want to fight)
* Are from people who vote in the most bipartisan fashion - highest
similarity with global voting patterns
* Are showing rapid spread through the voter network (hot issues)
* Have parameters limited to the last X hours/days/months
* Are being voted upon by your favourite
celebrities/scientists/friends/religious leaders
* Etc
* Any combination of above.

Allowing the user to ultimately choose which perspectives they are
interested in, I hope, does away with the majority of Darwins
concerns. If a user wishes to participate in a limited interest-group
fashion then the software should not deny this usage, but neither
should it limit a user who wants to use it in a multitude of other
interesting ways.
