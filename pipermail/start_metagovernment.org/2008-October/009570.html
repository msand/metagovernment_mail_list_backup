<PRE>&gt;<i> Can it?  What if the Chief of the General Staff no longer wishes to
</I>&gt;<i> take his orders from the collective?  First of all, he may feel
</I>
The Chief of the general staff is answerable to the public and will be
court-martialed, if he goes against their will. The key is not to put
him in a position where he will not have to fear opposition from his
subordinates.

&gt;<i> uncomfortable in obeying a Commander in Chief who has no body and no
</I>&gt;<i> head.  His personal sense of discipline and honour (on which even a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fallible&quot; President could formerly depend) may balk at this
</I>&gt;<i> un-military arrangement.
</I>
This argument is rather weak I think. People don't just fight for
leaders, they fight to protect their country and loved ones. A
military commander even if he disagrees with the decisions of the
collective, will ultimately have the goal of protection in mind and he
may go against the public, if he believes they are wrong, but he will
have to justify himself. This doesn't automatically mean, that he can
stage a coup though. Especially since the government will now be
spread across the nation, rather than concentrated in a few buildings.

As long as the community continues to function, you will have in the
worst case a short civil war, rather than a military dictatorship. The
military will hardly be able to fight its own people for too long,
soldiers will refuse and the commander ultimately left powerless.

&gt;<i> Now it is a time of war.  The military command is in disagreement with
</I>&gt;<i> the civil collective in a crisis of war policy.  The commander fears
</I>&gt;<i> that, if he follows the orders of the collective and reigns in his own
</I>&gt;<i> staff, he will lose their loyalty and possibly lose the war.  He must
</I>&gt;<i> therefore choose between, on the one hand, his loyalty to the
</I>&gt;<i> Commander in Chief and his duty to uphold the constitution (both
</I>&gt;<i> weakened), and, on the other, his duty to safeguard the nation (still
</I>&gt;<i> strong).
</I>
You assume, that the commander is blindly following the orders of the
community. The commander is part of the community and helps to shape
the decisions that are made. Some will be left to his own discretion,
just as it is done today, but major decisions are made collectively,
with the military.

Again if he or the entire military executive go against the community,
the extent of their power is limited and certainly there is no way
they can overthrow the legitimate government. The community will be
able to form resistance and supplies to the military will be shut off.
This will be a bloody and terrible battle, but what the commanders
should realize, is that they will ultimately lose and thus won't start
the opposition in the first place.

&gt;<i> He confers with his staff.  They agree with his plan to (politely but
</I>&gt;<i> firmly) ignore the civil collective.  The military will now implement
</I>&gt;<i> its own war policy.  In matters of war, the Chief of the General Staff
</I>&gt;<i> is henceforth the Commander in Chief.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How will the civil collective stop him?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's too late.  By removing the executive from government, you made a
</I>&gt;<i> military commander the most powerful man in the state.  At the same
</I>
This argument equally applies to the current state of affairs. You
assume that just because the executive isn't one person, that it
doesn't exist. Ask yourself, what would happen now, if the Chief of
the General Staff were to go against the Commander in Chief and why it
should be any different, if the executive is a community.

&gt;<i> consensus/dissensus?  Would it not be better to allow all variants to
</I>&gt;<i> be simultaneously exposed to voting in a single, ideologically
</I>&gt;<i> neutral, electoral medium?  Then there can be a single organization
</I>&gt;<i> (whatever it is), and dissenters will have no reason to decamp (or
</I>&gt;<i> worse).  Their dissent will be openly expressed in variant norms, and
</I>&gt;<i> not hidden or suppressed.
</I>
Apart from the voting, this is essentially what we have planned for
metascore. Each member can have her own version of a resolution, which
is visible as an alternative to the others. This is implemented
through branches in the repository. If you oppose some part of a
resolution, you can modify it, and people will see it alongside the
other alternatives.

It should be noted, that if you oppose a resolution, your opposition
is only valid as long as you have well-grounded argument. You should
also offer a solution that synthesizes the resolution you are
opposing. The key is, that you should always find it more productive,
to work in the framework of the community, rather than forming a new
one.

Whether or not it will work, this way, is something we will find out,
as we grow to larger and more diverse communities.

&gt;<i> Norms will then have not a single path of transformation (revision
</I>&gt;<i> history), but multiple variant paths.  People will shift their votes
</I>&gt;<i> from variant to variant, instead of shifting their bodies from
</I>&gt;<i> organization to organization.  They will vote using a common medium
</I>&gt;<i> (Metascore or whatever) that is idealogically neutral, and separate
</I>&gt;<i> from the issues they vote on.  If they disagree, they need not
</I>&gt;<i> escalate the disagreement by decamping (or worse) - instead they
</I>&gt;<i> simply express their disagreement in the medium.  Then everyone can
</I>&gt;<i> see, &quot;Ah, we disagree on this.  Let's talk.  Maybe we misunderstood
</I>&gt;<i> something&quot;
</I>
I see you aren't too far off from our ideas, maybe just not familiar
with all of them.

&gt;<i> It will end up splitting into an open field of alternatives - that
</I>&gt;<i> much is certain.  The singular will become plural, the &quot;it&quot; will
</I>&gt;<i> become &quot;they&quot;.  Votorola is already designed to build consensus
</I>&gt;<i> (unforced) in such an open population.  It's way ahead of you, on that
</I>&gt;<i> particular front.
</I>
The front where I think Votarola is behind, is in allowing people to
collaborate. Votarola is still caught up in the idea, that we should
have delegates that ultimately make the decisions on behalf of others.
It's an alternative to the current electoral system, not a fundamental
change that the internet and (I hate to say the buzzword) web 2.0 is
offering.

Why should you be limited to electing, if you have the ability to
participate? Why should you have to take up an office, just to
participate?

&gt;<i> Why start with hot dog stands, and work up to chess clubs?  Why &quot;play
</I>&gt;<i> government&quot;?  Votorola's beta release will be sufficient to start
</I>&gt;<i> voting on the officers (executive, legislature, judiciary,
</I>&gt;<i> bureaucracy) and norms (laws, plans, policies) of real government -
</I>&gt;<i> not a virtual stand-in.
</I>
We take this approach, because we don't believe we have the perfect
solution just yet, and will be working out a system, before it can be
adopted on a larger scale. Also I think you are underestimating the
inertia of our political systems. I think it will take a few years,
before a majority of the people will see any of our systems as an
alternative.
