<PRE>Congrats on getting the word out! I don't think I see a video there
either, but it'd be nice to have for posterity.

</I>&gt;<i> I spoke yesterday to a group of about 100 people. There are about 500
</I>&gt;<i> attendees at the conference, but considering that only one other speech was
</I>&gt;<i> in English (and unlike mine, that was interpreted into Czech), I'd say
</I>&gt;<i> attendance was quite good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Language was somewhat of a barrier, but they seemed to get the drift.
</I>&gt;<i> Questions after the speech were the same ones we've encountered on the list
</I>&gt;<i> and wiki... e.g., what to do in an emergency, how can we solve for corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> system admins, what about cabals trying to game the system. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> they were listening and thinking about it. Sounds like a success to me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After my speech and later that evening, I talked to a few attendees in
</I>&gt;<i> depth. They seemed to think the project was a great idea. Some were more
</I>&gt;<i> inclined to favor the sort of &quot;mixdemocracy&quot; projects listed on our related
</I>&gt;<i> projects, and I encouraged them to go forward with that. It's a logical
</I>&gt;<i> intermediate step between representative democracy and true open source
</I>&gt;<i> governance. Others seemed enthusiastic, and I think a few may have joined
</I>&gt;<i> the list already (if so, please feel free to introduce yourselves).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Video of my speech may be available later; I'm not quite sure. In any event,
</I>&gt;<i> it mostly followed the Presentation page on the wiki. I'll post an update to
</I>&gt;<i> that when I get back to the 'States. I had some technical difficulties (my
</I>&gt;<i> speech notes weren't showing up on my computer, so I forgot some stuff and
</I>&gt;<i> overly repeated other stuff), but overall I think it went well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should be active on the list again by the end of this week.
