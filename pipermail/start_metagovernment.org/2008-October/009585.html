In that sense, I was not making a point.  I did not accuse you of
being unfaithful to your principles.

You state that you find it &quot;entirely possible to conceive of the
nearest-to-ideal form of Governance&quot;.  You have an ideal of governance
that you express in principles (the end), and you apply those
principles to the development of your technology (the means).  Since
the principles are themselves politically coloured (power to the
people, dissolution of executives, suppression of dissensus in favour
of a forced consensus) they amount to an ideology.  You are therefore
pursuing the ends and means of your own personal ideals and
organizational ideology.

The alternative is to develop the means that will allow people in
general to express *their* ideals.  Leaving aside the drafting of
political principles, leaving aside the plans of governance, we can
focus instead on the means by which people can reach unforced
agreement and consensus.  Then we'll know what they actually want.
And so will the government.

&gt;<i> &gt; ... With the best of intentions, your actions are self serving.
</I>
&gt;<i> I don't think that is entirely fair. You come on a Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list, posit that Metagovernment cannot possibly handle
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances X,Y and Z - then accuse said list of being self-serving
</I>&gt;<i> when they provide a counter argument.
</I>
True, it is not entirely fair.  If you are working under false
assumptions, if most of you are weak in social theory and do not know
the definition of &quot;political power&quot;, nor of &quot;community&quot;, nor how they
may or may not intermix, and if you are unaware of alternative
approaches, then it may be only in contingency, and in light of the
alternatives, that your actions are judged as self-serving.  I doubt
your *intentions* are anything but well meaning.

You see, it is simpler than you imagine.  We need only develop the
means by which people can reach agreements, and there will be no need
to worry about governance.  Once people agree to something, then the
existing government will act on it.  Guaranteed.

Government is not broken.  It need not be fixed.  There is no need to
organize yourselves into a &quot;better&quot; government.  It is the public
sphere that is broken.  We must fix the public sphere.

&gt;<i> It's quite simple - if you want more agreement, then you'll need to
</I>&gt;<i> come up with some better arguments. I think you would find the list
</I>&gt;<i> quite fair in the event that you do.
</I>
No, no, the discussion is fair.  It is not the role of us advocates to
blandly agree with each other, but to critique and defend as best we
can.  Let the reader judge who has the &quot;better arguments&quot;.

In addition to my critique of your approach, I hold out an
alternative.  For your part, you are welcome to critique the
alternative.  (Defense does not preclude offense.)

For more on the alternative, please see my reply to Manuel in this
thread.

Best,
