<PRE>Manuel is pushing against the limits of our current hosting provider.  
For example, he would like to do his own installation of Mercurial,  
and doing that would require deeper access than is allowed by a  
standard &quot;shared&quot; hosting account. (We're also using up most of our  
hard drive space now.)

So at least for the purposes of the PrototypeA demo installation, he  
would like to use a &quot;virtual private server&quot; or dedicated machine...  
something that provides root access. These get somewhat pricey. If  
there's no other solution, I may simply buy such an account, but...  
I'm looking for other options from this list. Anyone?

We contacted Fused Network, who sometimes provides free hosting for  
open source projects, but for a full virtual server they would like  
some money. Does anyone have a server they could dedicate to this  
purpose or know of a host who would be willing to do so?

Alternately, if we need to ask for monetary donations (which I suppose  
we'll have to do eventually anyway), I propose we use a service such  
as <A HREF="http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/">http://conservancy.softwarefreedom.org/</A> to manage the money so that  
we do not need to create a formal organization as per:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization#Reasons_not_to_form_an_organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization#Reasons_not_to_form_an_organization</A>

I have written to the Software Freedom Conservancy but have not yet  
heard back from them. Any other solutions/recommendations are welcome.
