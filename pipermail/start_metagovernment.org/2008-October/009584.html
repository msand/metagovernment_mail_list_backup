Sorry, what is your name in Latin script?

&gt;<i> All legislative initiatives are approved by a referendum before

</I>
Referenda are problematic.  Unless there is a mechanism to enable open
proposals, the government will control the legislative agenda.  They
will not put legislation to the vote unless:

  a) it suits their own (government) needs

  b) a popular majority is assured (or can be engineered) in a future
     referendum - they will be sure of this, ahead of time

To overcome this, you must allow people to propose their own
legislation.  And, in addition to voting, you must give them an
alternative to mass news media as a source of information, discussion
etc.  (The Russian news media are owned/controlled by the government.)

I do not think you can develop such a thing in Russia (very sad to
say), because the government would oppose it.  They would find the
means to thwart it, through various harrassments.

Whether they would dare to formally ban it (after it is developed
externally) is another question.  It might hurt them to do so.  So
there is still hope for Russians.

&gt;<i> Production is largely planned on the basis of direct consumer orders.
</I>
My 2 kopeks: Do not link a re-engineering of the economic system with
the re-engineering of the public sphere.  Wait till you have a
functioning public.  Then let the public propose and reach consensus
on economic reforms, as they see fit.  (Do not tell them what *you*
want, wait to here what *they* want.  Cf. parallel discussion thread.)
