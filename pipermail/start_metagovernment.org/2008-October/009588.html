<PRE>Let me tell you a quick story about an American Presidential Candidate named
Ralph Nader:
In 1958, Ralph Nader graduated with a degree in Law from both Harvard and
Princeton University. Since then, he has been one of the leading social
activists in our country, responsible for the creation of the National
Traffic Safety Administration, the Center for Women's Policy Studies, the
Telecommunications Research Center, the Center for Insurance Research, and
the Congressional Accountability Project, amongst many others.

Regardless of his accomplishments, most Americans think of Ralph Nader as a
&quot;spoiler&quot;, as he has ran in every election since 1992. In 1999, Time
Magazine listed Ralph Nader as one of the Top 100 influential Americans of
the 20th century, and in 2006, they listed him as one of the Top 100
influence Americans in our nation's history. And yet, despite his
accomplishments and influence, Ralph Nader has yet to be invited to the
debates, or make even the slightest impact on mainstream media's coverage of
the Presidential Elections.

In stark contrast to this amazing man, Presidential nominees Barack Obama
and John McCain told the world that the American Economy would collapse
without the $700B bailout -- a threat that not only reflected the policies
of the Bush Administration, but mirrored the tactics used in the Invasion of
Iraq -- a tactic Naomi Klein refers to as the &quot;Shock Doctrine.&quot; Meanwhile,
both men stand ready to attack Afghanistan, and to deploy our armies defend
both Georgia and Israel at all costs.

If you believe for a moment that the &quot;scary Communist regime&quot; would not
allow such as thing as Open Government, remember that the &quot;scary Capitalist
regimes&quot; (ie. Corporations) would also not allow the people to hold power
over their profit margins. The last American President to stand up to the
private industries who sought to control our nation's economy was Andrew
Jackson in 1832, and he succeeded for an entire generation. But in 1913,
Congress handed over their Constitutional right to issue money to the
Federal Reserve -- a quasi-governmental organization that is primarily
composed of private institutions.

And here we are, in 2008, nearly 100 years after the creation of the Federal
Reserve, standing at the brink of a Global Economic Collapse, where these
same private institutions are poised to create something much, much larger
than the Federal Reserve -- a World Bank composed of 1/10 of 1% of the most
economically powerful Corporations on the planet. At the risk of sounding
alarmist, we're just about to lose control over our world -- and both the
Commies and Terrorists are not the ones to blame.
