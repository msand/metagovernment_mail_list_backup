<PRE>Hello everyone,
I'd prefer to stay pseudonymous unless that's a problem, but I go by
Zarquon.  I was born and raised in the outskirts of Los Angeles,
California.  I'm an undergraduate student in the same place, though I
may be transferring elsewhere soon.  I'm young enough that I grew up
with the Internet, in one form or another, so its use for a project
like Metagovernment doesn't just seem logical to me, it seems like a
no-brainer - why hasn't it been done before?
I'm very politically active and aware - I spend more time reading and
writing news, analysis, and discussion as your average teenager does
watching television, playing video games, et cetera.  I'd also
probably be termed a &quot;radical&quot; by a lot of people, as I have no doubt
many of you would.  That seems to be the price you pay for considering
the current political state of affairs unacceptable.
I found Metagovernment through a link in a Slashdot article, and I was
instantly attracted to the project.  I've been working on my own along
similar lines, but mainly at a less fundamental level than
Metagovernment is currently at - not that I'm ahead, but simply that I
skipped over the most important part.
It's great to be here, and I'll do what I can to help.
-Zarquon
