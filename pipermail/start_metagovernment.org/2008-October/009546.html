<PRE>Hello to the list,

I'm replying to Richard Franks's post concerning Votorola.  (I'm the
developer.)

Richard Franks wrote:

</I>
True, it's easier.  I guess there's upsides and downsides.  The
delegate hierarchy is a deeply layered structure of representation.
Upsides include scalability and specialization (delegates can be
political and technical experts).  Downsides include distance,
alienation, and so forth (as you say).

Downsides are mitigated (I hope) by transparency, inclusiveness of
membership, ease of &quot;promotion&quot; in the hierarchy, and (especially) by
shiftable votes.

&gt;<i> What intrigues me, with regards Metagovernment, is that it seems like
</I>&gt;<i> the cascading vote system could be votes placed for issues rather than
</I>&gt;<i> actual people.. with a few modifications.. and those mechanisms are

</I>
Metagovernment issues might already be supported (in a sense).
General categories of candidate actions, for which one might vote are:

   i) election to an office, as in executive or assembly member (only
      this one is supported in the current alpha implementation)

  ii) action on a norm (law, plan or policy), as in:
      - promulgation of a draft legislative bill
      - implementation of a plan
      - adherance to a policy position

 iii) other kinds of action (not yet considered in detail)

Issues might fit into (ii) or (iii).  It should not matter.  All
action categories are supported by the design, because Votorola makes
no distinction between the active and personal aspects of a candidate.

  A candidate always has two aspects: an active aspect, and a personal
  aspect.  The active aspect is the proposed act.  The personal aspect
  is the person who proposes, or represents, or embodies the act.
  Thus the building of the larger sandbox (act) and Monika (person)
  are one and the same candidate.  We can speak of voting for a larger
  sandbox, or of voting for Monika, but the two have the same meaning.

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#medium">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#medium</A>

The mechanics of normative drafting and action (external to Votorola)
and their connection to voting (internal) are not well documented yet.
I'm working on it now.

If I have a question about issues, it may be with the action aspect
(not the mechanics of voting).  What will come of the voting?

Maybe the answer is in your archive.  You have some interesting
discussions here.  I'm looking forward to reading them.

Best,
