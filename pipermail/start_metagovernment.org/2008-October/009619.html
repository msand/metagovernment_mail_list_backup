<PRE>Just an informational post about my presentation...
<A HREF="http://www.webexpo.cz/prednaska/web-20-for-governance/">http://www.webexpo.cz/prednaska/web-20-for-governance/</A>

I spoke yesterday to a group of about 100 people. There are about 500  
attendees at the conference, but considering that only one other  
speech was in English (and unlike mine, that was interpreted into  
Czech), I'd say attendance was quite good.

Language was somewhat of a barrier, but they seemed to get the drift.  
Questions after the speech were the same ones we've encountered on the  
list and wiki... e.g., what to do in an emergency, how can we solve  
for corrupt system admins, what about cabals trying to game the  
system. In other words, they were listening and thinking about it.  
Sounds like a success to me.

After my speech and later that evening, I talked to a few attendees in  
depth. They seemed to think the project was a great idea. Some were  
more inclined to favor the sort of &quot;mixdemocracy&quot; projects listed on  
our related projects, and I encouraged them to go forward with that.  
It's a logical intermediate step between representative democracy and  
true open source governance. Others seemed enthusiastic, and I think a  
few may have joined the list already (if so, please feel free to  
introduce yourselves).

Video of my speech may be available later; I'm not quite sure. In any  
event, it mostly followed the Presentation page on the wiki. I'll post  
an update to that when I get back to the 'States. I had some technical  
difficulties (my speech notes weren't showing up on my computer, so I  
forgot some stuff and overly repeated other stuff), but overall I  
think it went well.

I should be active on the list again by the end of this week.
