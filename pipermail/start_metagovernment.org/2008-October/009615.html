Seemingly different than this gentleman, who was thrice Foreign
Secretary?

    It is certainly right and prudent to consult the public opinion...
    If the public opinion did not happen to square with mine; if,
    after pointing out to them the danger, they did not see it in the
    same light with me, or if they conceived that another remedy was
    preferable to mine, I should consider it as my due to my king, due
    to my Country, due to my honour to retire, that they might persue
    the plan which they thought better, by a fit instrument, that is
    by a man who thought with them...  but one thing is most clear,
    that I ought to give the public the means of forming an opinion.
    - Charles Fox, House of Commons, 1792

    <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/outline.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/outline.xht</A>

Fox's understanding of &quot;public opinion&quot; was different than our own.
Today, we no longer consider public opinion (as in opinion polls) to
be a reliable, independent authority.  We consider it a derivative
thing, shaped and manipulated via the mass media, often by the
politicians themselves.  Consequently, we are not surprised if they
fail to &quot;consult&quot; that opinion.

Opinion polls are no help.  Referenda are no help.  We need:

  a) Deliberate formation of agreements.  Not in response to a
     polster, nor in reaction to a referendum, but people drafting
     proposals on their own initiative.

  b) Continuous expression.  Rather than being expressed once (poll or
     referendum results) the agreement is sustained and expressed
     continuously.  If officials try to ignore a 60% formal consensus,
     it won't just fade away; it'll get stronger, week by week, month
     by month.

  c) Reinforcement by opening the elections to public offices.  Any
     official who opposes a consensus without reason is likely to find
     that his/her re-election prospects are immediately and
     graphically diminished by a loss of votes to political rivals.
     People are agreeing not only on norms, but on public offices too.

&gt;<i> &gt; You have looked into its history?  You have discovered that the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; public sphere was never functional, even in its original form?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Please share your sources and reasoning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll readily confess that I glanced not even at the Wikipedia page
</I>&gt;<i> before writing my response - however please disabuse me of the
</I>&gt;<i> contextual deductions I incorrectly made before dismissing it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was making a general point, and one which I did not present to be
</I>&gt;<i> disagreeable, that any forum to collect and distill public opinion and
</I>&gt;<i> group wisdom could be better able to serve that public through the
</I>&gt;<i> democratisation that technology provides - as opposed to physical
</I>&gt;<i> meetups which would seem to be inclined to produce leaders and
</I>&gt;<i> discriminate against those unable (through disability, locality, etc)
</I>&gt;<i> to attend.
</I>
(OK.  Except people 200 years ago were not so barbaric as we often
assume.  They had new media, too.  They were idealistic and fired up,
just like us.  We owe them a lot.)

&gt;<i> So perhaps you would have found the point less disagreeable if I had
</I>&gt;<i> framed it as &quot;making the public sphere better than it originally was&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than the contrast I was going for by suggesting that the
</I>&gt;<i> improvements that the correct application of technology can
</I>&gt;<i> potentially bring to the process are significant enough to cast any
</I>&gt;<i> and all previous implementations as &quot;broken&quot;?
</I>
They correctly applied their own technologies.  That was not the
problem.  They could not have forseen the rise of mass media, mass
production, huge state bureaucracies, party machines, etc. - all the
things that eventually deflated the public sphere.

We are no better than they.  We can only hope to emulate them, and
move democracy forward one step.  They pulled us out of the Middle
Ages.  The next step is ours to make.  It's a journey.

&gt;<i> However, I get the impression that your appreciation of the public
</I>&gt;<i> sphere lies in its ability to inform a governance, rather than its
</I>&gt;<i> ability to stimulate and solicit as much of the public will as
</I>&gt;<i> possible?
</I>
I see the public sphere as the ideal decision maker.  I see the
government as the ideal executor.  The public sphere will decide, and
the government will act.  We will say, &quot;Do this!&quot;

Government will respond:

  a) &quot;OK, done!&quot;, or

  b) &quot;Yes, but I just need to finish this other task first...&quot;, or

  c) &quot;Sorry, I do not understand!  Please explain this part here...&quot;,
      or

  d) &quot;No, that's not possible.  Here's why...&quot;

There will be dialogue between the two.  Consensus may shift in
response to new information.  But the role of the public is *not* to
&quot;inform&quot; government decision making.  No matter how well the
government is informed, it will never be competent to decide the high
level issues (direction, ends) but only the low level issues (means).
The government understands and obeys nothing but power, it's a master
of power.

I see government as an ideal machine, and the public as an ideal
driver, incorruptible in its communicative rationality.

For my part, as an engineer, what I appreciate most is that we can
actually do this - we can make the ideal a reality.  It's a technical
challenge.  The public sphere already &quot;knows how to drive&quot;, and
government is already connected to the democratic control wires
(thanks to our friends of two centuries ago).  All we need is to
engineer the public side of the control interface - giving people a
&quot;steering wheel&quot; and so forth, to express the desired direction.
