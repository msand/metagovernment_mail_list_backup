I agree with your points.  Just parenthetically...I believe there are 
many *very* subtle aspects to a reputation system (one of them being how 
reputation information can/is analyzed by users).  I would say that 
reputation is a complicated social dynamic, with many individual 
differences in how reputation information is created and used...making 
it very hard to predict how people will use communication technologies. 

For example, in my own experience in the open source software world 
(Eclipse), reputation plays a very important/critical role in the 
developer community, but it's still sort of a mystery to me how 
reputation among the technical community is/should actually be 
supported.  The technology for EF doesn't explicitly support reputation, 
but it's still used for reputation (of course).   Actually I think 
people would use almost anything for reputation...because it's such a 
meaningful thing to many people.
