<PRE>Hi Michael,
 
Thanks for taking a look at the wireframes.  I'll try to address your
questions below.
 
&gt;<i>Are there still no docs on the conceptual and technical details of the
</I>&gt;<i>basic method - UI aside?  I have some questions:
</I> 
Perhaps if you tell me what you're hoping to learn, I can point you to the
right place or answer your questions directly.  Are there resources you can
point to that provide examples of the types of documents you're hoping to
see?
 
&gt;&gt;<i> DemocracyLab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>&gt;  is a nonprofit organization
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based in the United States whose mission is to &quot;Create a non-partisan,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-profit website dedicated to improving the democratic process by
</I>enabling
&gt;&gt;<i> the exploration, organization, communication, and synthesis of the
</I>values,
&gt;&gt;<i> positions, and policies affecting humanity.&quot; Our website will use the
</I>posts
&gt;&gt;<i> and votes of its users to build a dynamic map of political thought.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Participants will evaluate issues, connecting statements of their values
</I>to
&gt;&gt;<i> the positions they support and the policies they advocate. The website
</I>will
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I am interested in how it scales in complexity to handle large numbers
</I>&gt;<i>of policies.  How many policies will a typical participant vote for?
</I>&gt;<i>At what cost in time?
</I> 
We anticipate that if we develop a large user community (challenge #1) that
there will be an abundance of information on the site.  The challenge will
then become limiting the information represented at any point in time.
Several mechanisms are being developed for this purpose.  One is the ability
for users to sort policies and other concepts by their rating, recency,
activity level, etc.  
 
Another is the ability to sort policies and other concepts based on the
nature of their connections across the issue hierarchy
(values=&gt;positions=&gt;policies).  This is possible because in addition to
asking users to rate concepts, we ask them to rate the links connecting
them.  As an example, if I hold the values of equality, transparency, and
sustainability, I could see what positions on health care (or any other
issue), were linked by other users to those values.  I could then see what
policies had been developed designed to implement those positions.
 
Participants will be encouraged to rate as many concepts as they choose to.
The cost in time should be manageable - the time it takes to read, make a
judgment, and click the rating widget.
 
&gt;&gt;<i> identify consensus where it exists, and where it doesn't, productively
</I>focus
&gt;&gt;<i> discussion at the point of disagreement. Just as competition in a fair
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>You focus on dissensus in the hopes of resolving it, and of forming a
</I>&gt;<i>consensus policy.  How does that happen exactly?  Who composes the
</I>&gt;<i>consensus policy?  How do the other participants become aware of it,
</I>&gt;<i>and shift their votes to it?
</I> 
We're treating policies and other concepts as static documents.  A user
creating a synthesized policy document would need to pull pieces from
policies they find on the site, and post it as a new document.  They can
then link it to the position(s) it implements, and users would be able to
find it by following that path. 
 
Your last question above, how do participants shift their votes, identifies
a significant difference between our two approaches.  DemocracyLab doesn't
ask participants to assign a vote to a policy or person, but rather to rate
content.  A user is encouraged to rate as many pieces of content as they
choose to, so there's no need to shift votes.  We recognize pros and cons to
this approach, and may implement a system whereby users assign points to
concepts of each type if it becomes apparent that we need to force users to
make trade offs between competing concepts.
 
&gt;&gt;<i> market and evolution in nature select for success, informed debate will
</I>lead
&gt;&gt;<i> to the best possible solutions to contentious political problems. The end
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> result will be an engaging public forum where the best thinking rises to
</I>the
&gt;&gt;<i> top, creating a community-driven alternative to traditional politics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I am interested in how a policy, once it acquires a consensus, is
</I>&gt;<i>translated into action.  How may a public official (who acts on
</I>&gt;<i>policy) gauge the level of assent for a DemocracyLab policy?  What is
</I>&gt;<i>the formal measure of agreement vs. disagreement?
</I> 
Action on policies requires the buy-in of policy makers, which we hope to
achieve by creating a large community of users.  If we can create the belief
that DemocracyLab is an honest representation of public opinion, it will
benefit policy makers to pay attention and act on the best thinking that the
community produces.  Most of the policy makers we've talked to have been
excited about the potential of this tool as a means of facilitating two-way
communication with their constituents.
 
In the short term agreement will be a simple average of the votes of users,
with the ability to display a histogram showing distribution of results.  In
the longer term we anticipate developing richer analysis tools.
 
&gt;<i>Different officials serve the electorates of different cities,
</I>&gt;<i>regions, provinces, states, etc.  How may they gauge the level of
</I>&gt;<i>support for a given policy in their own localities, filtering out the
</I>&gt;<i>votes of foreigners etc.?
</I> 
We will gather demographic information from users, allowing officials to
filter information based on geography, age, and sex (initially), and many
other factors (eventually).  I believe this will be one of the most
important aspects of the site, both for policy makers and participants.  I
can imagine political parties using this tool to develop policy platforms,
counting only ratings from members of their group in the drafting process.
 
&gt;<i>How might the officials authenticate the results?  How can they be
</I>&gt;<i>confident that a given consensus is bona-fide, as opposed to a
</I>&gt;<i>fabrication of sock puppets, and so forth?
</I> 
Identity authentication will be a significant challenge, though one we're
postponing for now.  The gold standard would be cross referencing website
registrations with voter registrations, but that's a long way off.  In the
shorter term we are likely to implement a credibility system that attaches
greater weight to users who provide more demographic data, and demonstrate
through their participation patterns that they are human.
 
I'm sure I've created as many questions as I've answered.  I'll look forward
to a continuing conversation.
 
Mark
