I always had in mind that a vouching system (e.g. &quot;I know this person
to be real&quot;) would make it very difficult to create, or at least
perpetuate, fraud - as entire networks of people would be bridged to
the majority via a small number of conspirators in a statistically
anomalous fashion.

That said, I haven't done any real research upon it yet.. so it
propably has some holes - but if it could be made to work I think I
would find it personally preferable to something linked to votor
registrations. Especially as the latter can be easily (and has been
for at least the last three US elections) manipulated for political
gain.
