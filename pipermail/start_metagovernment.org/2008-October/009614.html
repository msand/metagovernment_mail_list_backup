At least in Britain, where I witnessed it, the people had pretty much
agreed that it was a bad bad idea.. and the existing government did
not act upon this.

This does leave me with some skepticism with regards the weight a
government will give an issue when they believe they 'know better'
than the public at large.


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Government is not broken.  It need not be fixed.  There is no need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; organize yourselves into a &quot;better&quot; government.  It is the public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; sphere that is broken.  We must fix the public sphere.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any system which allows for the abuse of power, or for the hidden rule

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The abuse of power by elites might not be a systemic fault of
</I>&gt;<i> governmental institutions.
</I>
This is a major philosophical schism between us.


&gt;<i> Those institutions were designed at a time
</I>&gt;<i> when the public sphere was strong and growing stronger.  Today the
</I>&gt;<i> public sphere is broken.  Let's fix it and see what happens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed that the public sphere is broken - although I would disagree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technically by questioning if ever it were 'fixed' to begin with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have looked into its history?  You have discovered that the public
</I>&gt;<i> sphere was never functional, even in its original form?  Please share
</I>&gt;<i> your sources and reasoning.
</I>
I'll readily confess that I glanced not even at the Wikipedia page
before writing my response - however please disabuse me of the
contextual deductions I incorrectly made before dismissing it.

I was making a general point, and one which I did not present to be
disagreeable, that any forum to collect and distill public opinion and
group wisdom could be better able to serve that public through the
democratisation that technology provides - as opposed to physical
meetups which would seem to be inclined to produce leaders and
discriminate against those unable (through disability, locality, etc)
to attend.

So perhaps you would have found the point less disagreeable if I had
framed it as &quot;making the public sphere better than it originally was&quot;,
rather than the contrast I was going for by suggesting that the
improvements that the correct application of technology can
potentially bring to the process are significant enough to cast any
and all previous implementations as &quot;broken&quot;?

However, I get the impression that your appreciation of the public
sphere lies in its ability to inform a governance, rather than its
ability to stimulate and solicit as much of the public will as
possible?
