<PRE>Hi Michael,

&gt;<i>I hope to learn how DemocracyLab and Votorola will interact, whether
</I>&gt;<i>in competition or in cooperation.  My questions fall into four areas:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  A. Understanding DemocracyLab as a project.
</I>&gt;<i>  B. Understanding DemocracyLab as a technology.
</I>&gt;<i>  C. Competition with Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i>  D. Cooperation with Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>A. Understanding DemocracyLab as a project.
</I>&gt;<i>-------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DemocracyLab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>&gt; is a nonprofit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organization based in the United States whose mission is to &quot;Create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a non-partisan, non-profit website dedicated to improving the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic process by enabling the exploration, organization,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> communication, and synthesis of the values, positions, and policies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affecting humanity.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Who is funding your project?
</I>
For a while, what funding there was for the project came out of my pocket,
and was used to incorporate as a nonprofit, gain 501(c)(3) approval
(classification from the US government as a philanthropic organization,
allowing individuals to make tax-deductible contributions and opening the
door for funding from most foundations).

More recently, we've been able to create partnerships with other nonprofit
organizations and have received funding from them.  The notable examples are
the Chalkboard Project, a Portland based nonprofit dedicated to improving
the quality of K-12 public education in Oregon, and with Oregon 150, a
nonprofit convened by the governor of Oregon to celebrate 150 years of
statehood.  Our grant from Chalkboard is to build our website with the
specific issue and community focus of public education in Oregon.  Our
contract with Oregon 150 is to customize our website for the purpose of
helping high school aged youth in the state create a collaborative vision of
what Oregon should be like at the time of our bicentennial, in 2059.

We have submitted a number of additional grant applications, and are
continuing to do so as frequently as possible.  You could view information
about the grants we have applied for here:
<A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/community/fundraising/foundation.">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/community/fundraising/foundation.</A> 

&gt;<i>Under what licence is your software and documentation released?
</I>
We have not yet chosen a license for our software and documentation.  One of
our board members is going to present license recommendations at our next
meeting on November 20th.  

&gt;<i>Are you holding any proprietary information or technology?  Any
</I>&gt;<i>non-open copyrights?  Any patents?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i>Are you witholding any trade secrets?  Any undisclosed business plans
</I>&gt;<i>or technical designs?  Any patent applications?
</I>
No.  Not yet disclosed here (but in our board minutes which you could read
here: <A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/community/board/minutes?view=all">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/community/board/minutes?view=all</A>)
is the fact that we've been approached by a polling/market research company
interested in using the tools we're developing with their clients.  We would
charge for this service and use those funds to create a sustainable funding
model for the organization.  We're currently operating without staff (as I'm
sure everyone else is).  I believe it's critical that we are able to hire an
Executive Director and operate the organization more professionally.  I know
that this point is likely to meet with resistance from some members of this
list, who have expressed a belief that a decentralized adhocracy is the best
model for projects like ours.  I respectfully disagree.  Forming a nonprofit
organization has been essential to us in facilitating partnerships with
other organizations in our community, and the fact that we've received
501(c)(3) approval from the US government creates trust in the minds of
those we approach, knowing that any deviation from the altruistic motives of
the organization would have severe consequences.

&gt;<i>B. Understanding DemocracyLab as a technology.
</I>&gt;<i>----------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;Are there still no docs on the conceptual and technical details of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;basic method - UI aside?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Are there resources you can point to that provide examples of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the types of documents you're hoping to see?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I can find no examples on your site.  I am interested in two types of
</I>&gt;<i>document:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  i) A concept or theory paper, with information that a social
</I>&gt;<i>     scientist would need to evaluate your method.  For example,
</I>&gt;<i>     Votorola has this: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ii) A system design, with information that an engineer would need to
</I>&gt;<i>     understand the technical architecture.  For example, Votorola has
</I>&gt;<i>     this: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/design.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/a/design.xht</A>
</I>
I'm afraid we're lacking in this department, particularly compared to the
excellent pieces you link to in your comments above.  The closest thing we
have (which I image you've already seen), is i)
<A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1118.">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1118.</A>  

We don't have any information similar to the system design document you've
presented.  Our application is being developed on Google's App Engine,
relying upon the infrastructure they make available.  We recognize that
there may be reasons to move away from this in the future, but believe that
in the short term it offers excellent resources at zero cost.

&gt;<i>C. Competition.
</I>&gt;<i>---------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Based on your answers to my previous post, I have a rough sense of how
</I>&gt;<i>we align on (C) and (D).  For the most part, our projects are not
</I>&gt;<i>competitive.  Votorola is *purely* a voting system.  It enables people
</I>&gt;<i>to express assent (and dissent) with regard to candidates for public
</I>&gt;<i>office and proposed norms (laws, plans and policies).  But it's not
</I>&gt;<i>directly concerned with the other communications that are required,
</I>&gt;<i>such as discussions among voters, or collaboration on the construction
</I>&gt;<i>of norms, and so forth.  Votorola leaves these and other important
</I>&gt;<i>functions entirely to external media.
</I>
This really is the essential difference between Votorola and DemocracyLab,
Metascore, Mexnap, etc.  Votorola is a more sophisticated and responsive
form of representative democracy, while the other projects are experiments
in online direct democracy.  
I'm curious if you've had the opportunity to use Votorola in any pilot
projects, and if so, how did communication flow up and down the cascades?
It seems to me that this could be one of the most challenging aspects of the
system you describe, in terms of usability and keeping users engaged in the
process.

&gt;<i>Where DemocracyLab and Votorola compete is in the direct expression of
</I>&gt;<i>assent for proposed norms (policies as you call them).  And it appears
</I>&gt;<i>that you are weak on this point.  (No surprise, I have yet to discover
</I>&gt;<i>a project that can approach Votorola's design for open voting on
</I>&gt;<i>norms.)
</I>
I see your point here, though I see it as a significant difference in
approaches rather than a weakness on our part.  By utilizing representative
democracy and voting, you make the selection of a &quot;winner&quot; possible.  In
some ways the system you have created is similar to instant runoff voting,
in that the cascades leading to different choices must eventually decide if
they are to stick with their policy, or align with another that has a chance
of being adopted.  Presumably if a minor policy saw it wasn't going to be
adopted, it would look to assign its votes to the policy it was most similar
to, eventually leading to two choices, one of which would have 50% + 1 of
the votes.  
Do you find this analogy to be accurate?

Our process uses rating rather than voting, and does not attempt to reach a
binding decision.  Instead we seek to inform existing power structures of
the thinking of their constituents, and to provide a means for the best
thinking of the community to gain prominence and a platform for
communication to those who make policy. 

&gt;<i>Richard Franks is pointing out one area of weakness, namely voter
</I>&gt;<i>authentication.  He is proposing to solve it with a trust network that
</I>&gt;<i>enables voters to cross-authenticate themselves.  I had the same idea
</I>&gt;<i>a year ago, and I vetted it among social scientists in the APSA_ITP
</I>&gt;<i>list.  I've since coded it, and it is now a part of Votorola.
</I>
Congratulations.  That's a significant challenge that we've yet to begin to
address.  When we're ready to implement something similar we'd like to build
upon the work you've done here.

&gt;<i>Darwin O'Connor is pointing out another common weakness, namely the
</I>&gt;<i>suppression of minority views.  Votorola is the only system I know of
</I>&gt;<i>that precludes all forms of suppression, allowing for open expression
</I>&gt;<i>of dissent and competing views.  The solution is partly the unique
</I>&gt;<i>voting mechanism (delegate cascade), and partly the openess of
</I>&gt;<i>collaborative drafting media.  The drafting media and their documents
</I>&gt;<i>are not part of Votorola per se, but are spread out across the Web and
</I>&gt;<i>the larger Internet.  This is where we could be cooperating, instead
</I>&gt;<i>of competing.
</I>
The suppression of minority views is an important consideration that we've
arrived at a very different solution to.  Our intent is to allow users to
filter whose ratings they count at any point in time, so a minority
community capable of identifying itself could create a data subset where
only their ratings are included when evaluating content. This would allow
the minority to reach consensus on the policies they advocate, then
introduce them to the larger user community. 

&gt;<i>D. Cooperation.
</I>&gt;<i>---------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>DemocracyLab's specialty seems to be in cognitive mapping and
</I>&gt;<i>classification of documents, etc.  I cannot evaluate your method until
</I>&gt;<i>I see design and theory docs.  But I do know that voters are going to
</I>&gt;<i>need a classification scheme for newly proposed norms - legislative
</I>&gt;<i>bills, plans and policies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You see, there will be a great many new proposals.  Most of them will
</I>&gt;<i>prove to be worthless, but they must all be responded to in a fair
</I>&gt;<i>manner - ideally by every participant.
</I>
Evaluation by every participant seems entirely impractical.  I see the
purpose of DemocracyLab to be creating a system that identifies the best
thinking out of the cacophony of participation, and communicates it to
policy makers.  I can't even keep up with all the email in my inbox, much
less every idea every proposal that might appear online.
 
&gt;<i>Here is what I am thinking: If a typical voter could quickly
</I>&gt;<i>understand the rough category of a new proposal (ideally in 2 seconds)
</I>&gt;<i>- whether it concerns &quot;municipal property taxes&quot;, or &quot;improvements to
</I>&gt;<i>the park down the street&quot;, or &quot;foreign policy with regard to Africa&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i>then she will be able to use Votorola to immediately cast a vote (in
</I>&gt;<i>as little as 3 seconds).  Magically, not only will her vote be
</I>&gt;<i>rational, but it will also take into consideration all
</I>&gt;<i>counter-proposals (past and future) for that particular norm.  (The
</I>&gt;<i>magic is in delegation, of course.)
</I>
I don't understand what you mean here, and I'm running late.  I'd like to
hit send and pick this up later.  My quick thought is that in Votorola a
participant is voting for a representative.  How do they pick a
representative who's going to best represent their views in 2 seconds?  Or
is there something I'm missing about how the system will work?

&gt;<i>If DemocracyLab were sufficiently open with regard to the location of
</I>&gt;<i>its policy documents (I care only about those, and not about the
</I>&gt;<i>concepts etc. that map to them), then we might be able to cooperate.
</I>&gt;<i>So, instead of storing the policy docs on a central site, you would
</I>&gt;<i>link to them by standard Web URI (like Votorola does).  Could you do
</I>&gt;<i>that?
</I>
We're open to anything.  I can definitely see an advantage to being able to
take the policies that come out of DemocracyLab and integrating them into a
voting mechanism that could potentially have binding authority on policy
makers.

&gt;<i>A technical consideration: Each policy document (at a given URI) is
</I>&gt;<i>potentially mutable.  You cannot assume static content, as perhaps you
</I>&gt;<i>do now.
</I>
I think we have to assume static content once someone rates it.  Otherwise,
what did all previous ratings mean?  The trick will be finding the best
tools to synthesize discrete, static documents.  I think Metagovernment is
doing excellent thinking along these lines.  Also see <A HREF="http://mixedink.com/.">http://mixedink.com/.</A>
I invited the founder to join this list, but I don't know that he has at
this point.  Their application is not open source.

Thanks for the interest, criticism and feedback-

Mark
