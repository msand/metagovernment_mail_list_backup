<PRE>Sounds like we're in agreement on both issues.  I've been quite
interested recently in the relative views of my generation and others
on several pieces of modern technology, including the Internet.  And
believe me, the violent sort of &quot;radicalism&quot; (which in my opinion
needs a new word entirely to describe it, or perhaps we can just use
&quot;lunacy) is as repugnant to me as it is to anyone else.  Trying to
have a polite, pleasant discussion on the Internet of all places is
more than crazy enough for me! ;)

Hey Zarquon, and welcome! I don't think that'...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By that definition, everyone who enters politics is a &quot;radical&quot;, and

</I>&gt;<i> limitless medium of communication?
