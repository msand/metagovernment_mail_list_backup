<PRE>I'm too busy to reply right now, but wanted to point out a couple of  
things. You (Michael) may be mistaking my personal dreams for ideology  
of the project.

The project's only ideologies are those detailed in the Basic  
Principles.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>
Especially the first two. They can be summed up as: we support  
democracy and inclusion over authoritarianism and privilege, and we  
support transparency over secrecy and corruption. The third and fourth  
principles (and the two disputed ones) are mostly technical: intended  
to make consensus government possible and scalable.

I think the principles of democracy and openness will not have trouble  
getting wide acceptance. All other issues and ideologies will be  
subject to consensus-through-synthesis, and will only be supported by  
the Metagovernment for as long as they achieve and maintain consensus.

My hope that Metagovernment can deprecate nation-states is my own and  
not necessarily shared by all members of the group. It's just  
something I personally see as a likely inevitable result of Web 2.0  
technologies.

Also, be clear that I am not the leader or head of the project. From  
the outset, we have been a consensus group, and my personal  
involvement should continue to diminish as more people get involved.
