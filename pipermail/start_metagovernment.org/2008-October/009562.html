The first Zeitgeist movie was entertaining but not intellectually
satisfying - I don't believe in monsters under the bed, and I don't
believe in a sinister evil mega global power elite.

Well certainly - planting &quot;9/11 Truth&quot; stickers all over the place
must get dull after a while :-)  I think though, that without a solid
foundation, it's likely to degenerate within a few months into a
flamewar between whether the FBI or CIA are sabotaging their efforts.

Maybe I'm being overly cynical, so let me proclaim my bias that I
really don't think much good (and plenty bad) could come from
collaboration with this movement.


&gt;<i> As I stated earlier in a

It makes sense to me.
