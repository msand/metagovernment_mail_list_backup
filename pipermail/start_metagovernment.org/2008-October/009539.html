<PRE>Hi Ed,

Below, I pick up where we left off, looking at similarities and differences
between Metagovernment and DemocracyLab.

&gt;<i>If I understand correctly, this points out another difference. We're
</I>&gt;<i>not trying to inform existing governance structures, but rather to
</I>&gt;<i>completely replace them.
</I>
You're right, this is another difference.  While DemocracyLab has imagined
the possibility of this outcome, we don't have it as a stated objective.
Our goal is to create a way for citizens to collaboratively form policy,
which would be used to inform existing power structures.

&gt;&gt;<i> One difference is DemocracyLab segments content ratings into two
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pieces - Agreement and Importance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Could you explain the importance aspect more? I think it might be
</I>&gt;<i>simply unnecessary in the Metagovernment model because if something
</I>&gt;<i>isn't important enough to a community, it may just get kicked down to
</I>&gt;<i>a lower community. Our concept of a &quot;mesh of communities&quot; allows for
</I>&gt;<i>different groups to focus on what they think is important.
</I>
I think the easiest way to illustrate this is with a few examples.  I'll
imagine I'm voting on several statements on a 10 point scale, along with a
brief explanation:

Statement: The United States should adopt year round Daylight Savings Time.
Agreement: 9
Importance: 2
Explanation: I'd much rather enjoy daylight in the winter when I get done
with work.  However, I don't think this issue is very important, as there
would be few tangible benefits to society from making this change.

Statement: The United States should eliminate taxes on Capital Gains.
Agreement: 1
Importance: 6
Explanation: I think that the playing field between capital and labor should
be level.  Eliminating the tax on capital gains would skew it further in
favor of those with wealth.  I think the argument is important, and that it
is valuable to understand the role capital gains taxes have on investment
and economic growth.

Statement: A global scheme for controlling carbon emissions should be
instituted.
Agreement: 9
Importance: 10
Explanation: I think action on this issue is critical to ensuring the long
term health of our planet and humanity.

On any of the above statements, imagine plotting the votes of a number of
people on an XY axis.  The statements with high Agreement and Importance
ratings are low hanging fruit.  A politician consuming the information could
see that this is an idea to champion.  Statements with high Agreement but
low Importance could be implemented, since everyone thinks they're good
ideas, but you wouldn't expect dramatic benefits.  Statements with high
Importance, but mixed Agreement are the tough issues that will require
ongoing debate and dialogue to resolve.

I think the Importance ratings could be especially helpful when rating
Policies with price tags associated with them.  Allocating scarce resources
is generally where the rubber meets the road in politics.  

&gt;&gt;<i> Another is that the synthesis mechanism in DemocracyLab is a Link
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rating.  Two Concepts can link to each other, and users rate the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Link, deciding if they support/oppose each other, their degree of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Relevance, or if they are Redundant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Is that a point of difference? It sounds very much like our concept of
</I>&gt;<i>a synthesis score.
</I>
I would like to better understand how the Metagovernment synthesis score is
envisioned.  I think the Link Ratings are critical in DemocracyLab, allowing
users to understand which Values lead to Positions and Policies.  Hopefully
we'll have a working interface soon that everyone can try out to see how
this could work.

Mark
