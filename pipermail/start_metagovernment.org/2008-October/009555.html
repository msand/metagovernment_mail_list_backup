Thank you.  (^ Looks like a free distro hub for Hg
repos... interesting.)

I take it the DVCS (distributed version control system) is the
distribution backbone of the overall system.  For example, it allows
London to keep in sync with NY, when a world issue is discussed/voted
up?

The DVCS is an admistrative device.  It has no significance or
visibility to the user?

Like in prototype A (and like in a Wiki), content is logically
centralized, and the same users who can read it can generally write it
too?  (It is not exclusively owned by the contributor, and writeable
only by her.)

&gt;<i> As noted above (and in the Transition section of the home page), we intend 
</I>&gt;<i> to replace any/all governance systems. The strategy is to start with 
</I>&gt;<i> extremely small communities, such as ourselves or other small projects, and 
</I>&gt;<i> experiment until we find it is usable on a larger scale. The premise is 
</I>&gt;<i> that we will demonstrate in increasingly larger communities that governance 
</I>&gt;<i> can be done better (in every sense of the word) through Web 2.0 than 
</I>&gt;<i> through representation.
</I>
Experiment and demonstation is a sound approach.  I question the goal.

As far as government is concerned, it's clear you intend to replace
the executive.  You must be aware that it is held together by a medium
of power, and that it cannot function otherwise.  (Or can you point to
a theory that supports the concept of a powerless executive?  It's not
possible.)

Power is force and threat of force.  The power of a modern state
extends to life and death over its citizens.  Is this what you would
hold in your collective hands?  (Too many of you will be repelled by
the very thought of it.)

Is it even possible?  How does a collective wield power?

Maybe there are answers to these questions.  I only argue in favour of
testing the premise in thought experiments, research etc., before you
go too far in the real world.  (Maybe revolution is a distant
prospect, but if it's also impossible, then it's better to consider
the alternatives sooner rather than later.)

&gt;<i> All (or at least most) other e-democracy projects go directly for the 
</I>&gt;<i> existing government. Our strategy of starting in small communities makes it 
</I>&gt;<i> very different.
</I>
I like the &quot;small communities&quot; approach too.  I feel that if it works
in the microcosm, it will work in the macrocosm too.  The difference
is I believe the relation to be more *causal* than logical.  If it is
working in the small (two neighbours engaged in talking over the
backyard fence), then, for that reason, it will also be working in the
large.  Good government will follow more-or-less automatically.

&gt;<i> ... Granted, we will have trouble replacing, for example, a 
</I>&gt;<i> high-traffic discussion board in a strong community. But there will be 
</I>&gt;<i> plenty of other communities, and plenty of newly formed ones, that may wish 
</I>&gt;<i> to try using Metascore.
</I>
OK.  That's one way to reach out (rather than attempt to pull in).

&gt;<i> We generally hold that discussion of governance and the act of governance 
</I>&gt;<i> should not be separated, and so intend to allow them to directly work with 
</I>&gt;<i> each other as efficiently as possible.
</I>
Yes, efficiency may suffer if they are separated.  Much depends on how
(and to what granularity) they are entwined.

Votorola has a coarse granularity.  It sees only at the level of whole
documents (draft legislative bills, etc.).  Every voter can have her
own variant of a document (like on her Web site), and can seek votes
for it.  It makes separation easier.  The discussion can be anywhere
(over the backyard fence), and the votes can be cast from any device,
ideally even from a mobile phone (&quot;I like your idea.  I'm voting for
you right now&quot;).
