<PRE>Hey Zarquon, and welcome!


&gt;<i> I'd prefer to stay pseudonymous unless that's a problem,
</I>
I don't think that's a problem.


&gt;<i> I'm young enough that I grew up
</I>&gt;<i> with the Internet, in one form or another,
</I>
I'm a little jealous - your (and presumably future) generation will
see the internet much differently - perhaps even naturally - compared
with those of us who have strong memories of growing up without it.


&gt;<i> so its use for a project
</I>&gt;<i> like Metagovernment doesn't just seem logical to me, it seems like a
</I>&gt;<i> no-brainer - why hasn't it been done before?
</I>
I think I might have answered it above - a broader answer would be
that we seem just to be starting to discover what can be achieved with
this new medium.


&gt;<i> I'd also
</I>&gt;<i> probably be termed a &quot;radical&quot; by a lot of people, as I have no doubt
</I>&gt;<i> many of you would.  That seems to be the price you pay for considering
</I>&gt;<i> the current political state of affairs unacceptable.
</I>
By that definition, everyone who enters politics is a &quot;radical&quot;, and
voters are &quot;radical sympathisers&quot; ;-)  But there's no talk of
violence, overthrowing anyone or seizure of power here - more like -
what can we achieve through an active synthesis of ideas and an almost
limitless medium of communication?

Richard
