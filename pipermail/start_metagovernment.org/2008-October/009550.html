<PRE>Hi - welcome to the list, and thanks for the extra details on Votorola.

I tend to agree.

I have a hesitation with regards game theory - where a group of
individuals can vastly increase their levels of positive cooperation
with only a minimal incentive - e.g when the identity of uncooperative
individuals are made public. However, this has only (to my knowledge)
been studied for simplistic games where you can algorithmically
determine behaviour patterns to fall in to categories of cooperation
vs. selfish interests.

That is - over a certain level of human-generated complexity it
becomes almost impossible for a society to distinguish happy
coincidence from self motivated action, which is possibly one source
of the cult of partisanship.

You can bolt-on accountability to a system - e.g. factcheck.org - but
how long realistically before a partisan bias is found to have seeped
through such organisations?

That said, you can't exactly remove humans from the decision making
process, and I think the measures of mitigation you describe are the
best tools currently available.


&gt;<i> If I have a question about issues, it may be with the action aspect
</I>&gt;<i> (not the mechanics of voting).  What will come of the voting?
</I>
There's a 'fairly condensed' discussion here with relation to
emergency planning:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:FAQ</A>

But I think Metagovernment attempts a harder goal - moving away from a
leadership society altogether, and harnessing collective will - and is
more idealistic in the sense that without the ability to fully
envisage such a society, it is literally impossible to state whether
it is possible or not.

This is markedly different from the approach in the diagram here:
  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-power">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#action-power</A>

Which I certainly think is a valid approach - you'll see it echoed in
the emergency planning discussion above - but in terms of
Metagovernment it would I think be considered an intermediate - if not
pivotal - step.
