<PRE>I'll await Manuel's answers to my technical questions (II).  I'll try
to support my main argument in those terms.

We can maybe leave aside the sub-argument over the policy of replacing
the executive.  We've all had our say.  I started the debate, but I am
not actually interested in particular constitutions, political
movements, and so forth.  I'm designing a politically charged
technology, so I try to remain neutral and disinterested.  I had
thought to reveal to you the benefits of that stance by using
arguments such as:

&gt;<i> &gt; ... I believe this policy is blinding you to certain technical
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibilities.  You do not consider that power - tempered as it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; under existing constitutional arrangements - can actually be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bridge to acheiving your aims (principles and so forth).  You
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; announce your intention of burning those bridges even before you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have crossed them.
</I>

</I>
OK, but your ideals are *your* ideals.  I wanted to convince you that
your responsibility extends beyond the expression and evolution of
your own ideology.  It extends to enabling other people to express and
evolve *their* ideals.  You cannot fulfill that responsibility except
by being ideolically and politically neutral with regard to ends and
means.  (Some of the technical ramifications of this are couched in my
questions to Manuel.)

Metagovernment would start small by governing a chess club, and then
growing till it is in a position to take over the government of a
city, a region or a state.  I would rather it start small by enabling
people to improve their local neighbourhoods: fixing up a park,
securing clean drinking water, or making the streets a little safer.

We ought to help ordinary people without asking anything in return.
They've heard it all before: &quot;Join our cause, and we'll set you free!&quot;
It is wrong to prey on them with such promises.  It is wrong to ask of
them to join a movement, adopt an ideology, debate the principles of
governnance, draft constitutions, and worry over the wording of high
flown (and all too often hypocritical) preambles.

The expression of a principle is not a substitute for action.  I have
read your mailing list.  I have participated in a debate with you.  I
judge you by your collective actions.  Your immediate, overwhelming
concern is to enlarge, defend and strengthen your own organization.
With the best of intentions, your actions are self serving.
