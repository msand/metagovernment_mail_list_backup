This is a false assessment. As much as it is possible to disagree
without being disagreeable, it is entirely possible to conceive of the
nearest-to-ideal form of Governance whilst supporting other forms
which may be bridges, as you say.

For example, I see Metagovernment as paving a long-term vision, and a
project such as DemocracyLab as short-medium-term. Now I mean this
with absolutely no disrespect to Mark or everyone else involved in
that project. V1.0 of DemocracyLab should be able to interface
directly with an executive body -- and that would be a major milestone
for Open Governance - entirely worthy of the effort put in.

V?.0 of MetaScore should be able to replace an executive body -
there's likely a few more major milestones that we haven't identified
on the way to get there - the first in that list I see is V1.0 of
MetaScore, which should be able to replace this mailing list -- and at
each iteration we'll use the best tools we have available to determine
the next milestones.

Maybe DemocracyLab V2.0 will be able to replace an executive body, or
maybe the approach of starting with the executive functions of Chess
Clubs and mailing lists will scale (socially and technically) faster
and achieve that milestone first. Either way - there is no conflict
between these approaches while we share the same objective of
empowering as many people as we can in the way most representative of
that collective will.

</I>&gt;<i> are weakened, if not severed.
</I>
I find your military examples to be so full of hypothetics as to
defeat the ability to answer to them squarely. So I'll answer in
general principle:

1) Any military force disregarding the civil society would instantly
be criminal - a rogue force - no longer military.

2) Everything a rogue force gained would have to be by force -
food/shelter/money/transport - they would have to travel as a group as
the individuals would be known to the civil society, and would have
all assets and other transaction abilities frozen.

3) The only way the civil society would cease to function is if it
ceased to communicate.

4) Such a rogue force would have to gain control of _all_ the mediums
of communication for MetaScore - all networks, including the millions
of usb flash thumb drives out there.

5) A civil society able to communicate is capable of forming a new
Military, or at least a coordinated Militia, in order to defeat the
rogue force.

6) The distribution of the executive is the best defense against a
singular force attempting control.
