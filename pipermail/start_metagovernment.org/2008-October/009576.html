<PRE>Still on the road, but I'd like to reply to one section of this  
debate...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This argument equally applies to the current state of affairs. You

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be any different, if the executive is a community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see 6 critical differences:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Recent constitutional changes (eliminating executives, among
</I>&gt;<i>     other things) have left you with a system of governance that has
</I>&gt;<i>     not yet proven itself, and is eyed with some suspicion.
</I>
By the time Metascore starts replacing elements of national  
governments, it will be highly tested. That is the whole point of  
starting small and scaling. And also, of course, there are hundreds of  
nations out there. It may be adopted in elements of Costa Rica (which  
currently has zero military) long before it starts making inroads into  
militarily active nations. That will allow people to test it on  
national scales.

&gt;<i>  2. The chief executive has been removed.  He was a politician
</I>&gt;<i>     elected by assent of the people, a master whom a typical military
</I>&gt;<i>     commander could not hope to out-perform on the political stage.
</I>
There are many instances in history where the chief is less respected  
than a top general. For recent examples, look at the United States'  
George W Bush and General Petraeus, or George H W Bush and Generals  
Powell and Schwarzkopf.

&gt;<i>  3. A military commander is left as the most powerful man in the
</I>&gt;<i>     state, and he knows it.
</I>
While this is the scenario you are exploring, I still don't think it  
is going to happen. Again, we just don't know how Metascore or  
Metagovernment will scale.

&gt;<i>  4. His personal loyalty no longer has an object.  The former object
</I>&gt;<i>     was a civil Commander in Chief who had the familiar form of a
</I>&gt;<i>     human being.  Now it is an amorphous collective that lacks
</I>&gt;<i>     *personal* integrity.  He has difficulty relating to it.
</I>
By this point, this general will have extensive experience with  
Metascore. Long before it got involved in national government, the  
general was using it in his condominium, in his childrens' schools, in  
his city government, etc. By that point, he likely will have a great  
deal of respect for the superior decision-making process of the  
collective.

&gt;<i>  5. The collective also lacks *logical* integrity.  Last month it
</I>&gt;<i>     instructed the military to pursue strategic objective A, and this
</I>&gt;<i>     month it is denying the means of doing so.  The commander needs
</I>&gt;<i>     an explanation, but the collective is unable to answer.  It has
</I>&gt;<i>     no ability to reason on its own past behaviour, nor to moderate
</I>&gt;<i>     its future behaviour along a consistent, logical path.
</I>
By its very nature, consensus government is not fickle. The consensus- 
building process is deliberative, and unlikely to undergo quick  
transitions. It even less likely to flap between competing positions.

And the commander certainly will have an explanation and reason...  
everything the collective does is a public conversation.

&gt;<i>  6. The military has intelligence that it cannot share with the
</I>&gt;<i>     collective.  It knows the collective to be infiltrated with
</I>&gt;<i>     spies.  The collective is therfore half blind, and consequently
</I>&gt;<i>     incompetent to make executive decisions of war policy.
</I>
The collective cannot be infiltrated with spies... it uses radical  
transparency. Everyone in the world is already welcome to spy on every  
single thing they do. They can actively participate too.

This is one reason it will take a while for national governments to  
get around to adopting this form of governance and why it may happen  
*after* dissolution of militaries... in any event, it will probably be  
a while. Again, all we can do is start small and see what happens as  
it starts scaling up. We aren't forcing it on anyone; governments will  
adopt it when it is feasible and sensible to do so. They very well  
may, as Richard notes, use a consensus-informed executive long before  
they go all they way to executiveless states.
