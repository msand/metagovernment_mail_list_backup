Thanks for the idea Richard, and Manuel for the link to the video.  The idea
of community vouching would dovetail nicely with another idea we've
considered, that of requiring a high total credibility score to be able to
post new concepts (thinking about the future problem of an abundance of
content).  The idea is to promote cosponsors for policies, allowing
cosponsors to sum their credibility ratings to reach the high threshold (and
for someone with very high credibility to post without cosponsors).  This
would promote collaboration, reduce frivolous content, and make a social
network on the site useful.

I think this will be an intriguing problem to address once the need becomes
real. 
Hopefully soon!
