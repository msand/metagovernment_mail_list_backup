&gt;<i> You state that you find it &quot;entirely possible to conceive of the

Not quite - I have an ideal of governance which I continually tinker
with and adjust, then there are the four Metagovernment basic
principles (the end) which I think could be one way to get there, but
they could also (and probably would) ultimately create an entirely
different form of governance than any I have in mind.


&gt;<i> and you apply those
</I>&gt;<i> principles to the development of your technology (the means).  Since
</I>&gt;<i> the principles are themselves politically coloured (power to the
</I>&gt;<i> people, dissolution of executives, suppression of dissensus in favour
</I>&gt;<i> of a forced consensus) they amount to an ideology.
</I>
No - the four basic principles speak nothing about the dissolution of
any executive - they speak to how a collective may reach a decision
which best reflects that collective.

I happen to personally think that it's a no-brainer - if an collective
consistently makes better decisions than an executive then perhaps the
age of the executive is nearing its end - but that same collective
might instead decide that it would be better placed to inform an
existing executive than replace it. I challenge you to find anything
in the basic principles which would favour the outcome of either
scenario.

By saying that I see Metagovernment as &quot;ideologically neutral&quot; and
&quot;politically neutral&quot; as possible, I mean that the basic principles -
by ensuring openness and favouring consensus - create an environment
which nullifies the worst excesses of ideological or political power
by default -- the strong taking advantage over the weak, the group
taking away rights from an individual.

Now, a consensus-based collective could very well decide to opt for a
voting mechanism or a benevolent dictator - or otherwise completely
rewrite the basic principles -- but like at the North Pole, every
direction is south from there - any such change would be less
ideologically and politically neutral.


&gt;<i> You are therefore
</I>&gt;<i> pursuing the ends and means of your own personal ideals and
</I>&gt;<i> organizational ideology.
</I>
Yes, but not by my involvement in this project.


&gt;<i> The alternative is to develop the means that will allow people in
</I>&gt;<i> general to express *their* ideals.  Leaving aside the drafting of
</I>&gt;<i> political principles, leaving aside the plans of governance, we can
</I>&gt;<i> focus instead on the means by which people can reach unforced
</I>&gt;<i> agreement and consensus.  Then we'll know what they actually want.
</I>&gt;<i> And so will the government.
</I>
I'm fairly sure we agree on this point - the basic principles can and
will be modified as necessary.


&gt;<i> You see, it is simpler than you imagine.  We need only develop the
</I>&gt;<i> means by which people can reach agreements, and there will be no need
</I>&gt;<i> to worry about governance.  Once people agree to something, then the
</I>&gt;<i> existing government will act on it.  Guaranteed.
</I>
Like going to war with Iraq?


&gt;<i> Government is not broken.  It need not be fixed.  There is no need to
</I>&gt;<i> organize yourselves into a &quot;better&quot; government.  It is the public
</I>&gt;<i> sphere that is broken.  We must fix the public sphere.
</I>
Any system which allows for the abuse of power, or for the hidden rule
of a self-selecting minority over a majority, is broken in the eyes of
the majority.

Agreed that the public sphere is broken - although I would disagree
technically by questioning if ever it were 'fixed' to begin with.
