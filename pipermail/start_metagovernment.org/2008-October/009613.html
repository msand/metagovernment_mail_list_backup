<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; You see, it is simpler than you imagine.  We need only develop the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means by which people can reach agreements, and there will be no need
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to worry about governance.  Once people agree to something, then the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing government will act on it.  Guaranteed.

No, that's not an example.  The invasion of Iraq was not motivated by
general, prior agreement.

&gt;<i> &gt; Government is not broken.  It need not be fixed.  There is no need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; organize yourselves into a &quot;better&quot; government.  It is the public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sphere that is broken.  We must fix the public sphere.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any system which allows for the abuse of power, or for the hidden rule

</I>&gt;<i> the majority.
</I>
The abuse of power by elites might not be a systemic fault of
governmental institutions.  Those institutions were designed at a time
when the public sphere was strong and growing stronger.  Today the
public sphere is broken.  Let's fix it and see what happens.

&gt;<i> Agreed that the public sphere is broken - although I would disagree
</I>&gt;<i> technically by questioning if ever it were 'fixed' to begin with.
</I>
You have looked into its history?  You have discovered that the public
sphere was never functional, even in its original form?  Please share
your sources and reasoning.
