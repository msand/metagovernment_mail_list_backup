<PRE>I will reply to Manuel.  I hear what Richard and Ed are saying, and I
do not disagree.  My arguments are technical in motive, and I will try
to steer that course.

Your replacement of the executive may be an unwritten policy, but it's
one that many of you repeat in your discussions, and that all of you
defend to varying degrees.  I believe this policy is blinding you to
certain technical possibilities.  You do not consider that power -
tempered as it is under existing constitutional arrangements - can
actually be a bridge to acheiving your aims (principles and so forth).
You announce your intention of burning those bridges even before you
have crossed them.

So I will continue (I) to critique the notion of replacing the
executive with a future collective (your membership), and (II) hold
out the alternative of strengthening a collective that already exists
today, and is under some threat.

(I)

We left off in a worst case scenario that follows from your policy,
and we are at a point of crisis.  I concede (in agreement with you)
that you may someday discover a means of avoiding this crisis.
Nevertheless you cannot use a future discovery, uncertain as it is, to
support a policy that you hold and defend today.  So we must assume
that the crisis will unfold in a world like today's:

&gt;<i> &gt; He confers with his staff.  They agree with his plan to (politely but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; firmly) ignore the civil collective.  The military will now implement
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; its own war policy.  In matters of war, the Chief of the General Staff
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is henceforth the Commander in Chief.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How will the civil collective stop him?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's too late.  By removing the executive from government, you made a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; military commander the most powerful man in the state.  At the same
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; time, you severed the ties of personal loyalty that had formerly bound
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; him to civil society.  So you set the perfect stage for a coup,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dictatorship, and the end of democracy.
</I>
Manuel Barkhau wrote:
&gt;<i> This argument equally applies to the current state of affairs. You
</I>&gt;<i> assume that just because the executive isn't one person, that it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't exist. Ask yourself, what would happen now, if the Chief of
</I>&gt;<i> the General Staff were to go against the Commander in Chief and why it
</I>&gt;<i> should be any different, if the executive is a community.
</I>
I see 6 critical differences:

  1. Recent constitutional changes (eliminating executives, among
     other things) have left you with a system of governance that has
     not yet proven itself, and is eyed with some suspicion.

  2. The chief executive has been removed.  He was a politician
     elected by assent of the people, a master whom a typical military
     commander could not hope to out-perform on the political stage.

  3. A military commander is left as the most powerful man in the
     state, and he knows it.

  4. His personal loyalty no longer has an object.  The former object
     was a civil Commander in Chief who had the familiar form of a
     human being.  Now it is an amorphous collective that lacks
     *personal* integrity.  He has difficulty relating to it.

  5. The collective also lacks *logical* integrity.  Last month it
     instructed the military to pursue strategic objective A, and this
     month it is denying the means of doing so.  The commander needs
     an explanation, but the collective is unable to answer.  It has
     no ability to reason on its own past behaviour, nor to moderate
     its future behaviour along a consistent, logical path.

  6. The military has intelligence that it cannot share with the
     collective.  It knows the collective to be infiltrated with
     spies.  The collective is therfore half blind, and consequently
     incompetent to make executive decisions of war policy.

I sum, the ties that formerly bound the military to the civil society
are weakened, if not severed.

&gt;<i> As long as the community continues to function, you will have in the
</I>&gt;<i> worst case a short civil war, rather than a military dictatorship. The
</I>&gt;<i> military will hardly be able to fight its own people for too long,
</I>&gt;<i> soldiers will refuse and the commander ultimately left powerless.
</I>&gt;<i> ... 
</I>&gt;<i> Again if he or the entire military executive go against the community,
</I>&gt;<i> the extent of their power is limited and certainly there is no way
</I>&gt;<i> they can overthrow the legitimate government. The community will be
</I>&gt;<i> able to form resistance and supplies to the military will be shut off.
</I>&gt;<i> This will be a bloody and terrible battle, but what the commanders
</I>&gt;<i> should realize, is that they will ultimately lose and thus won't start
</I>&gt;<i> the opposition in the first place.
</I>
You are already at war.  A civil war on top of it is not an option to
consider.  If your armies are so exhausted and their discipline is so
undermined as to place them at the brink of mutiny, they will dissolve
on the battlefield under enemy fire.  They will have no stomach to
fight amongst themselves, while they are running in blind terror.

You assume that the consensus of your collective is stronger than that
of military discipline.  You assume your collective is undivided.  It
cannot be.  If you had anything approaching the mechanisms that
military commanders use to enforce &quot;consensus&quot; among their men, then
you couldn't call it a democracy.

So the military command will ignore the divided and inept collective,
and will pursue its own war policy.  There will be no civil war.  The
outcome of the real war will be either:

  i) victory (credit to the military, discredit to the civil
     collective); or

 ii) defeat

Your political arrangements will then be dictated by the winner.

(II)

&gt;<i> Apart from the voting, this is essentially what we have planned for
</I>&gt;<i> metascore. Each member can have her own version of a resolution, which
</I>&gt;<i> is visible as an alternative to the others. This is implemented
</I>&gt;<i> through branches in the repository. If you oppose some part of a
</I>&gt;<i> resolution, you can modify it, and people will see it alongside the
</I>&gt;<i> other alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should be noted, that if you oppose a resolution, your opposition
</I>&gt;<i> is only valid as long as you have well-grounded argument. You should
</I>&gt;<i> also offer a solution that synthesizes the resolution you are
</I>&gt;<i> opposing. The key is, that you should always find it more productive,
</I>&gt;<i> to work in the framework of the community, rather than forming a new
</I>&gt;<i> one.
</I>
OK, I roughly understand.  I skimmed through the doc/ section of your
codebase, but it's sketchy.  Is there something more descriptive of
the overall process?  Questions that interest me:

What is the measure of assent for the trunk?  (I am assuming that
branches are eventually approved and merged into this common trunk
line.)  In other words, how do you know the level of consensus (like
65%) that maintains for the trunk, at any given point in time?

Is the member's variant branch a bonafide trunk in its own right?  In
what ways does it differ (no branches of branches, or no assent
measured)?  I am aiming, of course, at the incentives to keep a
dissenting minority (say 30%) happily working in their own branch and
collaborating on its development in *parallel*.  They have chosen not
to contribute further to the trunk, which they intensely dislike
because it is developing on a path divergent from their aims.
 
&gt;<i> The front where I think [Votorola] is behind, is in allowing people
</I>&gt;<i> to collaborate. [Votorola] is still caught up in the idea, that we
</I>&gt;<i> should have delegates that ultimately make the decisions on behalf
</I>&gt;<i> of others. ...
</I>
Decision making is not actually delegated (except in extreme cases of
voluntary dereliction).  People remain free to shift their votes, and
it's *their* votes that decide the issues, not the votes of the
delegates.  The role of delegates is to serve as foci for discussion,
path breakers for the discovery of new candidates and new consensus
possibilites, communication backbones, expert advisors, ... it's a
long list.  I don't know all of the items yet.

None of that disenfranchises the peripheral participants from the
decision process.  It is not possible for a decision to be reached
except by the direct, formal consensus of the participants.  The level
of that consensus (or dissensus) is always known to the voter, and her
own contribution to it is known and revokable.

&gt;<i> Why should you be limited to electing, if you have the ability to
</I>&gt;<i> participate? Why should you have to take up an office, just to
</I>&gt;<i> participate?
</I>
There are actually no such barriers.  In a norm election, anyone can
propose a variant draft of the norm, and then seek votes for it.  In
an election to office, anyone can seek votes for herself (or even
receive them without seeking) and thus be a candidate or delegate at
some level.  Of course, the level depends on ability (as measured by
assent among peers), but it floats continuously in real time.  There
are no formal barriers to participation.
 
&gt;<i> We take this approach, because we don't believe we have the perfect
</I>&gt;<i> solution just yet, and will be working out a system, before it can be
</I>&gt;<i> adopted on a larger scale. Also I think you are underestimating the
</I>&gt;<i> inertia of our political systems. I think it will take a few years,
</I>&gt;<i> before a majority of the people will see any of our systems as an
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>
It does not take a majority.  Imagine just 1000 people.  They are
voting for the next Mayor - but it's mid-term, and City Hall has not
called an election.  It's a continuous poll that anyone can join...
Ditto for City bylaws, plans and policies.  That's news.  That's an
alternative in the here and now.

Your approach is to strengthen your collective by inviting new members
and further elaborating your plans for new forms of government based
on the communication medium you are developing.  Votorola's approach
is to reach out to the collective that already exists (public sphere),
and strengthen it, as is.  Only a pure communication medium can do
that (shorn of all political dressing), and that's all that Votorola
offers.
