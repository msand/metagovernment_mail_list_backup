</I>
Well yes, because that is what I witnessed.

The quote above is a fine sentiment, eloquently spoken. I've heard
echos of that sentiment, but no echoes of the promised action.


&gt;<i> Fox's understanding of &quot;public opinion&quot; was different than our own.
</I>&gt;<i> Today, we no longer consider public opinion (as in opinion polls) to
</I>&gt;<i> be a reliable, independent authority.  We consider it a derivative
</I>&gt;<i> thing, shaped and manipulated via the mass media, often by the
</I>&gt;<i> politicians themselves.
</I>
I think that is because ostensibily it is.

The public sphere pretty much contracted to be almost entirely
composed of the mass media. For all its newfangledness and hyperbole,
web 2.0 technologies have reignighted that expansion with an
increasingly symbiotic relationship between mass media and
blogs-cum-news sources.

A concrete example of this would be in the current US Election where
if it was not for the deft ability of a distributed and informed
populace, the amount of mud-slinging, distortions and lies we've seen
would have bogged down any campaigns ability to defend itself. I think
this is something vastly different from just four years ago with Bush
Vs. Kerry and the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth [1] - bearing in mind
that YouTube only came into existence in February 2005.


&gt;<i> Opinion polls are no help.  Referenda are no help.  We need:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a) Deliberate formation of agreements.  Not in response to a
</I>&gt;<i>     polster, nor in reaction to a referendum, but people drafting
</I>&gt;<i>     proposals on their own initiative.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i>  b) Continuous expression.  Rather than being expressed once (poll or
</I>&gt;<i>     referendum results) the agreement is sustained and expressed
</I>&gt;<i>     continuously.  If officials try to ignore a 60% formal consensus,
</I>&gt;<i>     it won't just fade away; it'll get stronger, week by week, month
</I>&gt;<i>     by month.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i>  c) Reinforcement by opening the elections to public offices.  Any
</I>&gt;<i>     official who opposes a consensus without reason is likely to find
</I>&gt;<i>     that his/her re-election prospects are immediately and
</I>&gt;<i>     graphically diminished by a loss of votes to political rivals.
</I>&gt;<i>     People are agreeing not only on norms, but on public offices too.
</I>
I think this is a natural extension of a + b?


&gt;&gt;<i> So perhaps you would have found the point less disagreeable if I had
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> framed it as &quot;making the public sphere better than it originally was&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather than the contrast I was going for by suggesting that the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> improvements that the correct application of technology can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> potentially bring to the process are significant enough to cast any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and all previous implementations as &quot;broken&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They correctly applied their own technologies.  That was not the
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  They could not have forseen the rise of mass media, mass
</I>&gt;<i> production, huge state bureaucracies, party machines, etc. - all the
</I>&gt;<i> things that eventually deflated the public sphere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are no better than they.  We can only hope to emulate them, and
</I>&gt;<i> move democracy forward one step.  They pulled us out of the Middle
</I>&gt;<i> Ages.  The next step is ours to make.  It's a journey.
</I>
Agreed.


&gt;<i> There will be dialogue between the two.  Consensus may shift in
</I>&gt;<i> response to new information.  But the role of the public is *not* to
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inform&quot; government decision making.  No matter how well the
</I>&gt;<i> government is informed, it will never be competent to decide the high
</I>&gt;<i> level issues (direction, ends) but only the low level issues (means).
</I>&gt;<i> The government understands and obeys nothing but power, it's a master
</I>&gt;<i> of power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see government as an ideal machine, and the public as an ideal
</I>&gt;<i> driver, incorruptible in its communicative rationality.
</I>
It's a compelling argument and certainly one vision which I think
would come to pass before we could have any expectation of replacing
the executive.. if indeed it was deemed desirable from that
perspective, which is not in any way guaranteed.
