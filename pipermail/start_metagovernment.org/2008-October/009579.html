<PRE>Concerning your previous mail, I don't think I will be able to
convince you, that metascore will be capable of organizing an
executive government. You may of course be right, but I think that
largely depends on the community that develops and uses metascore
rather than any inherent flaw in the system. The question isn't about
the software, which is as you rightly note, just an impartial
technology to enable the community to make decisions.

&gt;<i> OK, I roughly understand.  I skimmed through the doc/ section of your
</I>&gt;<i> codebase, but it's sketchy.  Is there something more descriptive of
</I>&gt;<i> the overall process?  Questions that interest me:
</I>
Not at the moment, but we will be working on that, as time allows.

&gt;<i> What is the measure of assent for the trunk?  (I am assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> branches are eventually approved and merged into this common trunk
</I>&gt;<i> line.)  In other words, how do you know the level of consensus (like
</I>&gt;<i> 65%) that maintains for the trunk, at any given point in time?
</I>
The measure, is whether there is consensus or not. Of course that
isn't something the software can measure directly. My initial idea is
to merge anything that has been read by a certain number of members in
the community and has received no veto. Anything that is being merged,
will also be announced. We will be looking at a more scalable version
of this, as we continue development.

&gt;<i> collaborating on its development in *parallel*.  They have chosen not
</I>&gt;<i> to contribute further to the trunk, which they intensely dislike
</I>&gt;<i> because it is developing on a path divergent from their aims.
</I>
Forking is of course also an problem in open source development, but
in practice, doesn't seem to be much of an issue. Most developers find
it more productive to work in mainline. Those that do fork, either die
out or are eventually merged back into mainline. Eventually people
come around and see that it's better to work together and that
possibly the dissenting developers had a point. Examples of this, are
the GCC Compiler, the Beryl Project and to a certain extent, I would
also say the upcoming HTML5 standard.

Whether or not this can be used as an analogue for development of
legislature is of course debatable, but I see many analogs.

&gt;<i> Your approach is to strengthen your collective by inviting new members
</I>&gt;<i> and further elaborating your plans for new forms of government based
</I>&gt;<i> on the communication medium you are developing.  Votorola's approach
</I>&gt;<i> is to reach out to the collective that already exists (public sphere),
</I>&gt;<i> and strengthen it, as is.  Only a pure communication medium can do
</I>
So maybe the too projects are complimentary too each other. If your
system works, we may eventually need aspects of it to complement
metascore. Though I'm not in favor of voting of course, but the
structure of the community that is represented in your system through
elections, can probably be derived from peoples interactions with
metascore.

&gt;<i> judge you by your collective actions.  Your immediate, overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> concern is to enlarge, defend and strengthen your own organization.
</I>&gt;<i> With the best of intentions, your actions are self serving.
</I>
Of course, but how else do you expect us to ever achieve our goals,
which you apparently aren't entirely against? We don't advocate any
particular ideology, we only advocate a particular process of
governance. We don't advocate capitalism, communism or any religion,
so I think we are impartial enough for the communities that might want
to use metascore. Now I won't deny that each of us has our own hopes
for the kind of transformative effect we may have on communities, but
it could probably be just as well used for coordination of a guerrilla
army.
