I agree that this is a nice ideal (reputations don't matter), but I 
don't think it scales in practice. 

I would say that one of the reasons for representative forms of 
government is that having millions or billions of people all 
participating in democratic processes (like law creation and policy 
develpment) is very hard to coordinate.  I think the Internet can help 
with such scaling problems...and make it much easier for more people to 
effectively participate in democracy, but I don't think this completely 
eliminates the practical need for reputation systems.

I think the Internet does enable a fundamentally better way of acquiring 
and maintaining reputation, however...one that is much closer to 
actually having reputation based upon quality of ideas (rather than 
other things that I consider irrelevant...like wealth, reputation within 
closed organizations, etc).  This presents a great opportunity IMHO...to 
introduce reputation systems that are in fact based upon a better notion 
of reputation...one based upon open community discussion and feedback.

Scott
