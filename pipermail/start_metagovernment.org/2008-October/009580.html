To recap:
1) Anyone may contribute to any open source governance structure.
Significant efforts will be made to enfranchise those who are unable
to contribute to an administration.

2) All aspects of governance will be as open as possible, under the
principle of radical transparency. All software and systems used to
run administrations will be free, open source software and systems.

3) Unless consensus can be reached on how a policy could address an
issue, then there will be no policy on that issue.

4) When opposing views are presented, preference is always given to
synthesis rather than either conflict or compromise.

I agree that technological implementation can obscure an ideology
behind it. But I don't see how the Basic Principles above could be
more ideologically or politically neutral.

When we do, we'll fix them.

As Manuel states - you may find some of us expressing our thoughts or
hopes for how this process plays out, but what you won't find - at all
- is an instance where we put those personal ideologies ahead of the
principles above.

In that sense, I really don't understand the point you are trying to make.


&gt;<i> The expression of a principle is not a substitute for action.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> read your mailing list.  I have participated in a debate with you.  I
</I>&gt;<i> judge you by your collective actions.  Your immediate, overwhelming
</I>&gt;<i> concern is to enlarge, defend and strengthen your own organization.
</I>&gt;<i> With the best of intentions, your actions are self serving.
</I>
I don't think that is entirely fair. You come on a Metagovernment
mailing list, posit that Metagovernment cannot possibly handle
circumstances X,Y and Z - then accuse said list of being self-serving
when they provide a counter argument.

It's quite simple - if you want more agreement, then you'll need to
come up with some better arguments. I think you would find the list
quite fair in the event that you do.
