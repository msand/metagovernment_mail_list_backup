<PRE>&gt;<i> ...I'm curious if you've had the opportunity to use Votorola in any
</I>&gt;<i> pilot projects, and if so, how did communication flow up and down
</I>&gt;<i> the cascades?
</I>
No pilots yet.  There's an alpha running in Toronto, but I haven't
been advertising it generally.  It's mostly for upcoming usability
tests.  It only supports voting for offices (Mayor, Councillor, MP,
etc).

The beta will add support for voting on norms (legislation, plans and
policies).

&gt;<i> ...It seems to me that [communication flow] could be one of the most
</I>&gt;<i> challenging aspects of the system you describe, in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> usability and keeping users engaged in the process.
</I>
At this stage, I can only meet the challenge on paper.  Communication
flows come in three main types (with the third applicable only to norm
voting):

  1. assent

  2. discussion

  3. text

Votorola implements only the first.  It is purely a medium of assent.
Parallel media will handle the others, and participants will be free
to choose their own media for each.

Roughly speaking: (1) assent flows cascade-like in the form of a
shifting hierarchy, (2) discussion occurs among near nodes, and (3)
text flows along the same lines as assent. (You will need a fixed
width font to see the following figure.)


                        (I)  (K)  (L)
                          \ 1 | 1 /
                           \  |  / 1    (A)   (B)
                  (P)  (O)  \ | /        | 1  /
         (R)        \ 1 |    \|/         |   / 1
           \ 1       \  | 1  (M)         |  /
            \         \ |     |          | /  (E)  (F)
             \         \|     | 4        |/    | 1 /
          1   \        (Q)    |         (C)    |  / 1
      (S)-----(T)        \ 3  |          |     | /
                \ 3       \   |          | 3   |/
                 \         \  |          |    (H)-----(G)
                  \         \ |    (D)   |    /     1
       1       2   \         \|      \ 1 |   /
   (U)-----(V)-----(W)       (N)      \  |  / 4
                     \ 6     /         \ | /
                      \     / 8         \|/
                       \   /            (J)
                        \ /
                        (X)

   FIGURE 1.  Votes cascading downward in a medium of assent.  The
   measure of assent for each participant (circled letter) is the
   volume of inflow (sum of numbers).  In this seedling election,
   consensus is currently split between X (14 votes) and J (8 votes).


(1). Assent-wise, M is casting her vote for N, and the ultimate
recipient is X.

(2). Discussion-wise, M is talking with two groups: i) her delegate N
and co-voter Q; and ii) her own voters I, K and L.

(3). Text-wise (supposing this is a norm election), N has chosen to
draft her variation of the norm (a proposed legislative bill) in a
Wiki.  She has granted write access to her voters (Q and M).
Likewise, M has also chosen to draft her variation in a Wiki, with
write access granted to her voters (I, K and L).

Altogether, the text will flow in three directions:

    i) cascade flow (downward)

   ii) back flow (upward)

  iii) cross flow (sideways)

(i). Cascade flow is mostly pushed.  So L has a new idea.  L discusses
it with I, K and M, and then expresses it by drafting it into M's
version of the bill.  M and K edit it further, so it fits smoothly
with the other content.

M introduces the idea to Q and N.  They think it's OK, so M drafts it
into N's copy of the text.  Looking on, L is hoping that her idea will
utimately cascade as far as X.  (If it does not, L may begin to think
of taking her ideas elsewhere, along with her vote.)

(ii). Back flow is mostly pulled.  So, some time after the idea has
cascaded, Q will synchronize with N's text.  She will use a diff/merge
utility for this purpose.  In this fashion, L's idea will tend to
spread backward, down other branches, and throughout the cascade tree.

(iii). Cross flow is also pulled.  'A' likes L's idea, and is talking
of shifting her vote to the other cascade.  So C agrees to copy the
idea into her own text, in order to keep A's vote.  So now the idea
has spread from cascade to cascade.

&gt;<i> &gt;Where DemocracyLab and Votorola compete is in the direct expression of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;assent for proposed norms (policies as you call them).  And it appears
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;that you are weak on this point.  (No surprise, I have yet to discover
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;a project that can approach Votorola's design for open voting on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;norms.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I see your point here, though I see it as a significant difference in
</I>&gt;<i> approaches rather than a weakness on our part.  By utilizing representative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy and voting, you make the selection of a &quot;winner&quot; possible.  In
</I>&gt;<i> some ways the system you have created is similar to instant runoff voting,
</I>&gt;<i> in that the cascades leading to different choices must eventually decide if
</I>&gt;<i> they are to stick with their policy, or align with another that has a chance
</I>&gt;<i> of being adopted.  Presumably if a minor policy saw it wasn't going to be
</I>&gt;<i> adopted, it would look to assign its votes to the policy it was most similar
</I>&gt;<i> to, eventually leading to two choices, one of which would have 50% + 1 of
</I>&gt;<i> the votes.
</I>&gt;<i> Do you find this analogy to be accurate?
</I>
I guess the similarity with instant runoff voting (IRV) is in the
facility of vote transfers.  But there are too many differences, even
here.  Votorala is a continuous medium.  Votes are endlessly
shiftable.  With IRV, you cannot shift your vote after you cast it.
(Hence the complicated algorithm that takes your secondary rankings
into consideration.)

Also, Votorola is not concerned with choosing a &quot;winner&quot;.  The voting
continues non-stop.  Formal measures of assent (votes) track actual
assent (public opinion) as it shifts.  So Votorola is suited to the
communicative purposes of communities (continuous expression), wheras
IRV is suited to the administrative purposes of governments
(occaisional elections).

As you suggest, a minority may compromise and contribute to a
majority.  With IRV, they do so by holding their noses and ranking
their bottom preferences.  If their top preferences are eliminated in
early &quot;rounds&quot;, their vote will be applied to choosing the lesser of
two evils.

That is unlikely to occur in Votorola.  People will only shift their
votes if they agree to something, or if they at least hold the
difference to be slight.  In that sense, it will not really be a
compromise.  They are never placed in a situation where, because their
own preference was eliminated in an earlier &quot;round&quot;, they must now
choose between two unappealing outcomes.  Votorola does not allow for
such a forced, artificial consensus.

Also the number of candidates with Votorola is unlimited.  You can
vote for anyone.

&gt;<i> Our process uses rating rather than voting...
</I>
(Your ratings are probably considered a voting method, in the usual
sense of the term.  For instance, IRV is based on *rankings*, while
range voting is based on *ratings*.  But both are considered voting
methods.)

&gt;<i> ...and does not attempt to reach a binding decision...
</I>
Likewise with Votorola.  Naturally so, because communities have no
means of forcing their decisions upon anyone.  They are entirely
without political power.  Yet they are forced to live with the
consequences of policy making.  (For both of these reasons,
communities make the ideal decision makers.)

&gt;<i> ... Instead we seek to inform existing power structures of the
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of their constituents, and to provide a means for the best
</I>&gt;<i> thinking of the community to gain prominence and a platform for
</I>&gt;<i> communication to those who make policy.
</I>
Suppose a policy is the product of good thinking, but most people do
not agree with the policy.  Ought the policy to be followed?  (I say
no.)

Suppose a policy is the product of bad thinking (by whatever
standards), but most people agree with it.  Ought the policy to be
followed?  (I say yes.)

The key currency that is missing today is not *thinking*, but rather
*assent*.  Ordinary people have no means to express their agreement or
disagreement with regard to proposed norms.  They are effectively
gagged.  We should first of all remove the gags.

When we do, I believe we'll discover that normative assent cannot be
divorced from normative construction.  That is to say, the assenters
will be so closely entwined with the policy makers, legislators, and
so forth, they'll be indistinguishable.  (Was L just an ordinary
person?  Or was she a legislator?)

&gt;<i> &gt;... a trust network that enables voters to cross-authenticate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;themselves...  I've since coded it, and it is now a part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Congratulations.  That's a significant challenge that we've yet to begin to
</I>&gt;<i> address.  When we're ready to implement something similar we'd like to build
</I>&gt;<i> upon the work you've done here.
</I>
(It'll be an open register, so everyone will have access to the
authenticated voter list.  Ideally, people will only have to register
once, and can then vote wherever they please.)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;Here is what I am thinking: If a typical voter could quickly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;understand the rough category of a new proposal (ideally in 2 seconds)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;- whether it concerns &quot;municipal property taxes&quot;, or &quot;improvements to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;the park down the street&quot;, or &quot;foreign policy with regard to Africa&quot; -
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;then she will be able to use Votorola to immediately cast a vote (in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;as little as 3 seconds).  Magically, not only will her vote be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;rational, but it will also take into consideration all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;counter-proposals (past and future) for that particular norm.  (The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;magic is in delegation, of course.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ...  My quick thought is that in Votorola a participant is voting
</I>&gt;<i> for a representative.  How do they pick a representative who's going
</I>&gt;<i> to best represent their views in 2 seconds?  Or is there something
</I>&gt;<i> I'm missing about how the system will work?
</I>
If the proposal concerns &quot;municipal property taxes&quot; she votes for her
friend the accountant.  If it concerns &quot;improvements to the park down
the street&quot;, she votes for her neighbour the &quot;guerrilla gardener&quot;.  So
she defers the *initial* decisions to people she trusts, who have more
expertise than her.  By voting for them, she formally asks for their
help.

She can revisit her vote later, of course.  If she hears the park
planning proposal is gaining ground, she may take a closer look at it,
discuss it with her neighbour, and maybe shift her vote to an
alternative plan.

It could be *less* than 2 seconds.  Her initial vote might be
automated.  DemocracyLab is into mapping, so maybe you can give her a
&quot;triage&quot; tool.  It will automatically map new proposals to one of her
delegates, selecting the particular delegate that she'd usually vote
for on issues of that type.  (Call it a &quot;triage&quot; tool, because it
quickly shunts new proposals to the people who can best help them to
grow, if they have any chance at all.)
 
&gt;<i> &gt;If DemocracyLab were sufficiently open with regard to the location of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;its policy documents... then we might be able to cooperate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;So, instead of storing the policy docs on a central site, you would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;link to them by standard Web URI (like Votorola does)...
</I>
&gt;<i> &gt;A technical consideration: Each policy document (at a given URI) is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;potentially mutable.  You cannot assume static content, as perhaps you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;do now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we have to assume static content once someone rates it.  Otherwise,
</I>&gt;<i> what did all previous ratings mean?  The trick will be finding the best
</I>&gt;<i> tools to synthesize discrete, static documents....
</I>
That's a heavy and unnatural imposition, just to protect a rating.  A
policy document under construction might run to thousands of pages.
Rather than freezing it to protect the integrity of a rating, I would
unfreeze the rating and let it shift.  (That's what Votorola does,
anyway.)

Also, if you synthesize two documents into a third, then I suppose you
will synthesize a new rating?  Can a synthentic rating be interpreted
as *real* assent for the combination?

In Votorola, one always assents to an action.  By parking your vote
with a particular drafter and her ongoing construction of the text,
you are assenting to that construction - a dynamic thing.  You agree
with the direction it is taking.

An exception is that texts must be frozen just prior to official
action, such as the promulgation of a legislative bill.  The text is
frozen, but votes continue to shift.  If the bill retains consensus at
the end of the &quot;cooling off&quot; period, then action will automatically
follow.  (This is a procedural convention of a bureaucracy, outside of
Votorola.)

&gt;<i> ...I think Metagovernment is doing excellent thinking along these
</I>&gt;<i> lines... Also see <A HREF="http://mixedink.com/.">http://mixedink.com/.</A>  I invited the founder to
</I>&gt;<i> join this list, but I don't know that he has at this point.  Their
</I>&gt;<i> application is not open source.
</I>
Unfortunately, there's no details on MixedInk.  From the blurb, it
reminds me of my earlier work on recombinant text and textbender, from
which Votorola emerged.

Another in the same ballpark (but again, not open source) is
