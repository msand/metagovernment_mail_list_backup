My schedule is still very tight, but yes, I do see the executive as  
useless, and no I don't think we need to dispense with police (or  
courts). At least not yet anyway... not until all people become  
mature, responsible citizens (if ever).

Executives are nothing but a proxy. Representative democracy has its  
roots in feudalism, where the lord is responsible for the vassals.  
Both of these systems were necessary because there was no practical  
way for people to engage directly in governance. New technologies  
change this radically.

It is very difficult to imagine a huge society grappling with complex  
issues like capital punishment, but I do think that scaling is going  
to make it happen. As Manuel points out, our system changes the actual  
nature of citizenship. Government becomes not something that happens  
to you, but an integral part of your being. As people get more used to  
thinking this way, they will take it more seriously, participate more  
fully, and see new possibilities.

Yes, this is theoretical, but I think the theory (or hypothesis) is  
strong. Almost everyone, on first encounter with the concept of  
Wikipedia, thought it was ridiculous and doomed to fail. In practice  
we have found that the more people contribute, the better it becomes.  
An article with one or a few contributors is of variable quality, but  
the articles where many editors contribute become very, very good,  
easily surpassing what can be accomplished by a handful of  
professional editors.

Executives seem like a good thing, but they often (probably more than  
50% of the time) are a bad thing. They don't see the best answer, they  
get corrupt, they are subject to individual foibles, and so on.  
Collective synthesis seems like a better model, if it is developed  
slowly and carefully.
