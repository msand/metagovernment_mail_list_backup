<PRE>Michael,
  if you haven't already, I'd highly recommend this short article - as
I think it goes some way towards providing an explanation of the
different types of thinking highlighted by this debate:

<A HREF="http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php">http://many.corante.com/archives/2005/03/09/one_world_two_maps_thoughts_on_the_wikipedia_debate.php</A>


&gt;<i>   i) replaced by a collective in a world where warfare is possible;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  ii) replaced by a collective in a world where warfare has been
</I>&gt;<i>      eradicated; or
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  iii) not replaced by a collective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You know that the presupposition of (ii) is absurd.  Anything that
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the *prior* acheivement of world peace is necessarily a far
</I>&gt;<i> fetched notion.  We cannot speak of it as a &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;policy&quot;.
</I>
If you fail to plan, then you plan to fail. But seriously - within
living memory it was still possible to &quot;take over&quot; a country or
government quite effectively by marching a few guns into the executive
buildings, and declaring yourself the new boss.

Within living memory it was possible to stamp out an ideology by force.

I look at Iraq and Afghanistan, and I think that if that time has not
already passed, then it will within my lifetime.

I think it has everything to do with communication - the ability for a
group to exist is defined absolutely by its ability to communicate.

What motivation is there to wage war if you can enjoy none of the spoils?

And so what if it doesn't happen within our lifetimes - look at the
trends of history - the era of empires-of-the-fist is soon going to
fade from living memory. Of course, we've gone straight into an era of
competing ideologies - software such as Metascore can help us with
that - then who knows what the next era of conflict will be?


&gt;<i> Metagovernment could
</I>&gt;<i> not survive that confrontation, no matter how it responded.
</I>
You cannot crush an ideology by force.


&gt;<i> That leaves only (iii) as a feasible plan of action.  Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> must drop the notion of replacing the executive.
</I>
Nice try ;-)


&gt;<i> Metagovernment is nothing but a norm - a proposed constitution - one
</I>&gt;<i> of an unlimited number of constitutions that people may eventually
</I>&gt;<i> rate with the help of Metascore.  It is possible (even likely, given
</I>&gt;<i> its flaw) that Metagovernment will be voted down and itself replaced
</I>&gt;<i> at the very outset.
</I>
Perfect! So you're saying that if we develop software with the very
best ideology and principles of democracy in mind, then it's &quot;likely&quot;
that that software will quickly improve upon the original principles
to help us form improved ideology? That sounds like a ringing
endorsement!

No one has any obligation to use or adhere to any particular
implementation of Metascore. If half this group replaced the basic
principles of Metagovernment with abhorrent principles, through the
voting mechanism of Metascore - then they'd be free to do so and fail.
The other half would be free to continue in the spirit of the original
basic principles until they devise something better and stronger.

The level at which ideologies compete is in the meme environment - if
a fascist group used Metascore to ratify their principles, then
ultimately any short-term advantage gained by the mutual empowerment
of a group would be diminished by the fact that their ideas are
incompatible with the wider global society. I predict that such
formation would itself act to distill poisonous ideology from society
more quickly than todays meme environment where such predilections may
fester untested and unproven in many minds. But that's perhaps a bit
too meta.


&gt;<i> They are *rightfully* separate, too.  It would be impertinent to
</I>&gt;<i> presuppose any particular form of government as *the* goal.  If a
</I>&gt;<i> project is &quot;open&quot; and claims the mantra of democracy (what John Dunn
</I>&gt;<i> called the &quot;unfinished journey&quot;), then it ought to let ordinary people
</I>&gt;<i> decide on the destination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you not agree?
</I>
Absolutely. That's why in our attempt we seek the purest basic
principles which we can devise and, unlike the stinking american
constitution, we will not allow for the possibility that its
construction be more revered than the spirit in which it was written.

Richard
