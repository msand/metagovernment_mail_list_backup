<PRE>Note to list:

I am traveling now and will have very limited availability for the  
next 2+ weeks (and what responses I do make may be somewhat terse).

Metagovernment is characterized as a proto-governmental institution,  
but Metascore (the software) is a governance mechanism. It is intended  
to replace the existing governance mechanism of any community, not  
just geo-political entities. For example, it could just as well be  
used for governance of a condominium or a chess club.

&gt;<i> [3] M appears to be a general medium of decision making that combines
</I>&gt;<i>    several media (assent, discussion, drafting, publication) in one.

</I>
B is not well-described on the wiki. It mostly exists as a Mercurial  
repository:
<A HREF="http://freehg.org/u/SonOfLilit/metascore/">http://freehg.org/u/SonOfLilit/metascore/</A>

&gt;<i> I see [2] as a weakness in theory.  Are you sure you want to replace
</I>&gt;<i> government?  If so, you ought to explain how exactly.  What are the
</I>&gt;<i> steps in the transition?  What are the structures and functions of the
</I>&gt;<i> end result?
</I>
As noted above (and in the Transition section of the home page), we  
intend to replace any/all governance systems. The strategy is to start  
with extremely small communities, such as ourselves or other small  
projects, and experiment until we find it is usable on a larger scale.  
The premise is that we will demonstrate in increasingly larger  
communities that governance can be done better (in every sense of the  
word) through Web 2.0 than through representation.

&gt;<i> I see [3] as a weakness in design.  All other e-democracy projects
</I>&gt;<i> (far as I know) have this weakness except V (it has other failings).
</I>&gt;<i> The world already has an abundance and variety of media for discussion
</I>&gt;<i> and so forth.  Users have their own preferences.  Better to reach out
</I>&gt;<i> to their natural habitats than to recreate them in captivity.
</I>
All (or at least most) other e-democracy projects go directly for the  
existing government. Our strategy of starting in small communities  
makes it very different. Granted, we will have trouble replacing, for  
example, a high-traffic discussion board in a strong community. But  
there will be plenty of other communities, and plenty of newly formed  
ones, that may wish to try using Metascore.

We generally hold that discussion of governance and the act of  
governance should not be separated, and so intend to allow them to  
directly work with each other as efficiently as possible.
