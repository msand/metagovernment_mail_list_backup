That's the key.

I respect all of you for working on this.  You *chose* to tackle these
problems without having a ready solution up your sleeves.  Me, I just
happened to stumble on a solution while working on an unrelated
project.

&gt;<i> &gt; What is the measure of assent for the trunk?  (I am assuming that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; branches are eventually approved and merged into this common trunk
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; line.)  In other words, how do you know the level of consensus (like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 65%) that maintains for the trunk, at any given point in time?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The measure, is whether there is consensus or not. Of course that
</I>&gt;<i> isn't something the software can measure directly. My initial idea is
</I>&gt;<i> to merge anything that has been read by a certain number of members in
</I>&gt;<i> the community and has received no veto. Anything that is being merged,
</I>&gt;<i> will also be announced. We will be looking at a more scalable version
</I>&gt;<i> of this, as we continue development.
</I>
I was looking at it the wrong way.  I see that maybe the trunk
resolution is equivalent to law that has already passed, and is on the
statute books?  So it is not a proposal (like a legislative bill) that
is yet to be passed.  There is no need to measure its assent.  It is
law until it is struck down, replaced, or repealed.

So I am interested in the merge criterion that allows a *new*
resolution or *amendment* to enter the trunk and become promulgated as
law (or whatever).  If the criterion is &quot;read by 51% without veto&quot;,
that is exactly the same as saying &quot;voted by 51%&quot;.  We can then say
that the act of promulgation has a consensus of 51%.  Good.

But the appropriate level will be tough to set.  If you were to opt
for my own approach instead (below), you would not need to worry about
it.  Politicians are good judges of consensus.  They have finely tuned
antennae.  They will know what's appropriate for different types of
norms.  They will be keen to shepherd candidate norms through the
promulgation process (vote in legislature, etc.) just as soon as the
level and stability of consensus allows.  The political machine (as
is) would work to your advantage.  (You cannot count on that with your
approach, because you plan to replace the political machine in toto.)

&gt;<i> &gt; collaborating on its development in *parallel*.  They have chosen not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to contribute further to the trunk, which they intensely dislike
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because it is developing on a path divergent from their aims.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Forking is of course also an problem in open source development, but
</I>&gt;<i> in practice, doesn't seem to be much of an issue. Most developers find
</I>&gt;<i> it more productive to work in mainline. Those that do fork, either die
</I>&gt;<i> out or are eventually merged back into mainline. Eventually people
</I>&gt;<i> come around and see that it's better to work together and that
</I>&gt;<i> possibly the dissenting developers had a point. Examples of this, are
</I>&gt;<i> the GCC Compiler, the Beryl Project and to a certain extent, I would
</I>&gt;<i> also say the upcoming HTML5 standard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/forks.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/forks.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whether or not this can be used as an analogue for development of
</I>&gt;<i> legislature is of course debatable, but I see many analogs.
</I>
I agree.  I think it is a good analogue.  The point is that normative
forks (long lived branches) are a natural thing, and ought to be
modelled by the medium.  Good.

The social reality (as opposed to an analogue) is also a good guide.
Some people have opinion A (30%).  Other people have opinion B (30%),
and still others have other opinions.  Maybe they have different
cultural backgrounds, so they don't always see eye to eye.  But the
public sphere is a free place that easily accomodates the parallel
expressions of any number of simultaneous opinions.  Nothing can stop
one group from saying &quot;A!&quot;, and the other from saying &quot;No thank you,
B!&quot;.  No opinion is ever rejected.  So we must be true to that reality
in our medium of consensus.  We must be open to dissensus.  (Maybe we
can even say that &quot;open source&quot; is already the age old ideal of the
public sphere.)

The hope is that somebody comes up with idea C, to which both groups
can agree to (60% consensus).  Our medium actually increases that
possiblity if it allows both A and B to remain present to each other
as dissenting alternatives.  Even if consensus fails (no C is
possible), a clear dissensus increases society's self awareness, self
understanding, and the likelihood of future consensus on other
unrelated issues.

&gt;<i> So maybe the too projects are complimentary too each other. If your
</I>&gt;<i> system works, we may eventually need aspects of it to complement
</I>&gt;<i> metascore. Though I'm not in favor of voting of course, but the
</I>&gt;<i> structure of the community that is represented in your system through
</I>&gt;<i> elections, can probably be derived from peoples interactions with
</I>&gt;<i> metascore.
</I>
Votorola is intended for use in the public sphere.  If metascore aims
at governance, then it is intended for use inside a government.  In
that sense, the two would certainly be complimentary.  The public
sphere and government are necessarily interlocked in a complimentary
relation (see figure below).
 
&gt;<i> &gt; ... Your immediate, overwhelming concern is to enlarge, defend and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; strengthen your own organization.  With the best of intentions,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; your actions are self serving.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, but how else do you expect us to ever achieve our goals,
</I>&gt;<i> which you apparently aren't entirely against? We don't advocate any
</I>&gt;<i> particular ideology, we only advocate a particular process of
</I>&gt;<i> governance. We don't advocate capitalism, communism or any religion,
</I>&gt;<i> so I think we are impartial enough for the communities that might want
</I>&gt;<i> to use metascore. Now I won't deny that each of us has our own hopes
</I>&gt;<i> for the kind of transformative effect we may have on communities, but
</I>&gt;<i> it could probably be just as well used for coordination of a guerrilla
</I>&gt;<i> army.
</I>
I understand.  The metagovernment solution is essentially an
organizational one - an alternative or parallel government.  You
cannot help being focused so intensely (esp. the non-technical people)
on concerns of organizational integrity and scale.  You cannot help
being &quot;self serving&quot;.  The organization is a necessary vehicle to
carry you to the destination, and the software is its engine.

Call that a &quot;systems&quot; approach.  An organization is a system.  In
social theoretical terms, Metagovernment is attempting to engineer
what this figure labels as the &quot;administrative system&quot; (government) of
society:

  Figure 5.  Relations between lifeworld and system from the
  perspective of the system.
  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#structural-change">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#structural-change</A>

There is an alternative approach.  Look across to the other &quot;side&quot; of
society.  You see a thing called the &quot;public sphere&quot;, which is *not* a
system, and *not* an organization.  It is my answer to your Q:

  Q. &quot;Of course, but how else do you expect us to ever achieve our
      goals, which you apparently aren't entirely against?&quot;

The thing about the public sphere is that it already exists, and it
includes all of us in this list, and nearly everyone else in society.
Suppose you were to turn your attention to the integrity of *it*,
instead of the integrity of your own organization?  Suppose you were
to fit Metascore as an engine, not of government, but of the public
sphere?  Follow me...

Your engine is the means by which people can reach large-scale
consensus (meaning general agreement) on matters of concern to them.
The public sphere does not currently have such a capability.  Once
upon time it did (in its infancy in the 1700's and early 1880's) but
it has since lost that capability.  Imagine if it were to regain that
capability.

  Q. What if the people of a small town - on their own initiative, and
     by their own efforts - reach a consensus on who ought to be the
     Mayor?

  A. That person becomes Mayor.

Again:

  Q. What if the people reach a consensus on a bylaw, plan, or policy?

  A. The bylaw is passed in Council, the plan is acted upon, or the
     policy is followed.

We need ask no more of government.  We ask of ourselves.
