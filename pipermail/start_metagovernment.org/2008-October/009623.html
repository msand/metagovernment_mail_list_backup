<PRE>Hello to all.
My name is Juan Alvarez. I'm from Cordoba, Argentina but living in Buenos
Aires now (English is not my native language so please excuse my mistakes
and I always appreciate corrections). I am a telecommunications engineer and
always been a fan of internet and specially web technology.

Some time ago I started thinking how internet could be used to improve the
current democracy process. The current representative model is very prone to
corruption and large holdings always end up taking advantage of this
situation.

I think all over the world, and specially in countries like Argentina, where
corruption appears to be so obvious as inevitable, people is starting to
think that democracy as we know it is kind of a fraud. And people who
participate in projects like metagovernment have noticed that internet is a
great revolution and its many-to-many communication nature can help everyone
get more involved in a more open, more transparent government mechanism.

When I started thinking about this, I built the attached mind map. And just
this weekend I bumped into this amazing project and as I read through it I
kept surprising more and more about the similarities of the metascore ideas
and my own thinking.

One of the strong points I've considered is that the system should be able
to manage community projects, including bid specifications, bid responses
analysis, budgeting, execution control and results evaluation. I think this
is necessary because here is where most of the corruption lies in the
current system and having lots of people looking at how projects are managed
from start to end would add enormous transparency to the system.

I'll let you take a look at my simple diagram, that can tell a lot about
what I've been thinking about. You can always ask for clarification if you
are particularly interested in any of the items there.

I hope I can help make this a reality in any way possible.

Thank you for your time.

Kind regards,

Juan Alvarez
