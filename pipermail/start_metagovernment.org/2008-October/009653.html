Democracy is about ideas, not people's reputations.

&gt;<i> (And in comparison to the status quo... currently in the U.S., for
</I>&gt;<i> example, all ideas which do not have credibility with the staff of a
</I>&gt;<i> representative are dismissed out of hand, before even being brought to
</I>&gt;<i> the attention of that representative.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the main benefits of direct democracy is that ideas can stand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on their own, and cannot be promoted or dismissed based on who came
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should deal with an abundance of content with an abundance of

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The issue, however, is one of overload. If all ideas are given equal
</I>&gt;<i> credence and there are millions or billions of people participating,
</I>&gt;<i> how would one ever make sense of it all?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The solutions proposed in the Metagovernment project are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Scoring: Where no ideas are suppressed, but ideas which caught the
</I>&gt;<i> interest of some people (and/or possibly which are made by people with
</I>&gt;<i> a high user score) are given more prominence, somewhat as is done on
</I>&gt;<i> SlashDot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Tagging: Where everyone (including comment authors) apply tags to
</I>&gt;<i> comments, then users can make their own tag-based filters to view
</I>&gt;<i> things which interest them.
</I>
I was thinking, at first, you would have to solicit people to vote on 
your idea. If it gained popularity a fraction of the people would be 
invited vote on it, perhaps selected at random. If it continued to be 
popular, more and more people would be asked.

One of my ideas to handle the large number of things to be voted on 
would be automatic or suggested votes based the vote of people with 
similar voting patterns to you.
