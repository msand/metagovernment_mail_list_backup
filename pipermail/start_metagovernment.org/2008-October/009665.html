Slashdot's reputation system is not necessarily a good one...so using it 
as an example of the 'badness' of reputation systems in general doesn't 
really make sense.

But as for the general point about the undesired aspects of a reputation 
system...For argument I would probably go so far as to assert that if 
you put together a set of people that regularly interact (via network 
and/or other means) that you would eventually get some form of a 
reputation system...whether you intended to or not, or whether it's 
explicitly supported by technology or not.  So I can't really see the 
harm in encouraging reputation based upon something valuable (like 
community consensus and open review) rather than by some other, more 
traditional means.
