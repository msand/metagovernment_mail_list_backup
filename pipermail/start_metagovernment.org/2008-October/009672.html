<PRE>Anyone have any ideas?

Again, Manuel is looking for a server where he has the ability to  
install Mercurial (and perhaps other software)... preferably a  
&quot;virtual private server&quot; if not a dedicated computer. I've asked two  
hosts if they'd like to contribute one, but they declined.

If nobody has suggestions, then I and/or Manuel will try to find one  
that is less expensive than what is offered by our current host and  
then invite people (i.e., you) to make payments directly to the host  
for the hosting fees.
