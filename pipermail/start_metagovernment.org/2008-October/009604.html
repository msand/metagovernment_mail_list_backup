<PRE>At the ripe old age of 34, I've been steeped in Ant-Communism for as long as
I can remember. It has barely been a decade since we started using the word
Terrorist in place of Commies to describe the greatest threat the world has
ever known. Nevertheless, Anti-Communism is visible throughout American
Mainstream Media, in a vast array of contradictory news stories -- such as
the horror of Communists selecting their successors, or the Communists
Nationalizing their private interests, or any little thing we can find that
slanders the name of Fidel Castro. CONSTANTLY.
That said, I believe that all of us should take a brave step and place
Communism and Socialism and Democracy on the chopping block as failed
attempts by our ancestors to rule a great number of people before the Age of
Technology, and adopt the word Open to describe our political ideology. I
feel that Communism and Socialism and Democracy were great ideas constructed
by great men, but greater men learned how to game the system by controlling
its bottlenecks, leading to the constant failures we see all around us in
the conflicts and wars and economic crises that we are all forced to fund
and endure.

Open Government is a completely different beast without any control points
for the Elite to exploit. We can apply the word Open to any form of
Government (ie. Open Democracy, Socialism, Open Communism) to build the
technology on a framework that everyone is accustomed to. However it begins,
ultimately the People will decide what framework is best with the Open
technology. As new ideas emerge and are quickly disseminated throughout the
Open system, I predict that we'll end up with something that we never
predicted -- which equally excites me and terrifies me to no end.

</I>&gt;<i> However, since the discussion has started, let me express my views:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The mixture of capitalism and representative democracy results in
</I>&gt;<i> corruption of lawmakers and government. Schemes differ (two-party systems,
</I>&gt;<i> where there is no real choice; manipulation of public opinion by so-called
</I>&gt;<i> free media, which is free from any moral norms and free for sale; blunt
</I>&gt;<i> bribery of &quot;public servants&quot;), but the result is the same - people are
</I>&gt;<i> deprived of power to self-organize and actually run their society.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Communism - rule of a community. Capitalism - rule of capitalists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) US and, I suppose, Canada are behind other countries in establishing
</I>&gt;<i> internet voting systems:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - to my knowledge, US only allows sending in scans of absentee ballots from
</I>&gt;<i> abroad. True?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Estonia has used internet voting in actual elections
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.vvk.ee/engindex.html">http://www.vvk.ee/engindex.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - a couple of days ago Russia has conducted an experiment to allow for
</I>&gt;<i> non-legally-binding internet voting by those who voted using paper (just to
</I>&gt;<i> test the system) <A HREF="http://newsru.com/russia/13oct2008/churov.html">http://newsru.com/russia/13oct2008/churov.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - similar work is being conducted in Switzerland, Finland and Kazakhstan
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) Striking parallels exist between Iraq and Vietnam (see recently
