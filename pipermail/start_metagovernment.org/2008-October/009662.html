Well slashdot has its own problems.

For example - if I want to do something simple like view the posts of
people I've given mod points to - there's no way to do it. Slashdot
has the data available, but presumably it'd create a large server load
to allow unoptimised random access like that, and presumably they have
a business reason for not allowing that sort of data to be exported.

With Metascore being free software, and with the data being placed
under a free license, there's no reason at all why I couldn't run my
own Metascore plugin or application and use my own CPU to perform more
advanced matching on a copy of the database locally. With javascript
becoming a more viable platform by the day - e.g.
GWT/Tracemonkey/Gears - I think we'll be seeing more of that sort of
thing.

Because it is precisely when you try to create a single artificial
reputation system that you run afoul of gaming. The human mind has
evolved to be the most advanced mechanism to record and simultaneously
act upon multiple layers of reputation that we have available (Shirky)
- a flexible system that allows people to trawl the data in the way
they wish, in the perspective which makes sense to them, augments this
rather than providing an inferior replacement.
