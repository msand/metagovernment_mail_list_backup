<PRE>It's great to see you active on the list again, Jacki!

I think that by the time we have scaled up to the level where  
businesses care, they will be accustomed to the form of government.  
But more importantly, I think that laws won't be flapping on and  
off... businesses (and people) will be able to see consensus building,  
to see where the debate is leaning, and to participate in it. After  
the arduous process of building a consensus, I don't think it's going  
to be broken rapidly. Additionally, at least in my conception of the  
scoring system, once a consensus is reached, the bar is raised a  
little so that it cannot be broken by a new tiny minority entering the  
fray after the fact. They can still break the consensus, but only  
after talking some more people into it.

Compare that model to say a city council, where there are only a  
handful of people defining the law. If one of them changes their mind  
for whatever reason, a law can be reversed very unexpectedly.

&gt;<i> 2) the reliance on consensus as opposed to voting, and/or relying on  
</I>&gt;<i> votes weighted by user approval scores as opposed to direct  
</I>&gt;<i> proportions of people, and/or the lack of distinct between  
</I>&gt;<i> communities/populations (however defined)
</I>&gt;<i> Here, i think, the process is lacking the fundamental justifying  
</I>&gt;<i> principle of democracy -- namely, popular support by those the  
</I>&gt;<i> legislation would affect most. I don't quite see how the government  
</I>&gt;<i> is legitimatized in the absence of a tally of yes/no opinions.
</I>
Well, that's where I think the sixth (admittedly disputed) principle  
comes in. When you refer to the people who legislation would affect  
most, I see that as a very amorphous group. On the global scale,  
everyone has an interest in what a Brazilian farmer does with the  
Amazon rainforest, and everyone has an interest in seeing an American  
commuter emit less car-produced carbon. On a smaller scale, for  
example, a city wishing to build a dam or even a farmer wishing to use  
a pesticide can be a very important issue for people hundreds of  
kilometers downstream a shared river.

&gt;<i> 3) the absence of groups/organizations, so that every individual  
</I>&gt;<i> voice speaks alone
</I>&gt;<i> I recently read a political science research article of local  
</I>&gt;<i> government structures that correlated how direct the legislative  
</I>&gt;<i> democracy with the extent to which voter opinions translated into  
</I>&gt;<i> legislative outcomes. The degree to which democracy was considered  
</I>&gt;<i> 'direct' depended on whether there was a popular vote on all  
</I>&gt;<i> legislation, a representative-style government, or an unelected  
</I>&gt;<i> official and on whether political parties were or were not actors in  
</I>&gt;<i> the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Surprisingly, the study found that many more voter opinions  
</I>&gt;<i> translated into active legislation when the democracy was *least*  
</I>&gt;<i> direct -- this was attributed to the fact that minority groups  
</I>&gt;<i> gained more power in concert (when represented by a district  
</I>&gt;<i> official or legislator and when represented by a minority political  
</I>&gt;<i> party) than they would have in a more direct democratic system. It  
</I>&gt;<i> found that a consensus among the groups, irrespective of their size,  
</I>&gt;<i> was more often found when each disparate opinion had a representative.
</I>
I thought we had discussed this before and found that there was  
nothing stopping groups from forming. The real opposition was to  
formalizing the groups in the software or in the Metagovernment. It  
seems like they can still have the same level of efficacy without  
having to be written into law. However, if they are formalized, then  
individuals who do not wish to join groups are immediately diminished  
in their ability to participate. In the United States, for example, if  
one does not agree with Democrats or Republicans, one has no realistic  
recourse and no effective say in government.
