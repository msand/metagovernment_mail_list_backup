<PRE>Hello. I am Darwin O'Connor. I was glad to find your website. I have 
been thinking about this for quite some time. I have even set up a web 
page with my own ideas. Unfortunately it hasn't gone much beyond that.

If your plan is similar to mine, I'd be interested in helping develop it 
instead.

Here is my idea from

DDD - Digital Discussion and Decisions

Updated: Aug 10th, 2005

Philosophy

In 1450 Johannes Gutenberg developed the printing press, and without it, 
and the communication technology that followed, the democracy we have 
today would not be possible. It allows everyone to get enough 
information to make an informed decision during elections.

While they where big advances, the printing press, movies and television 
still only allowed relatively few to present their ideas to a wide 
audience. Most people's ability to influence government is limited to 
one ballot every few years to select among representatives which 
prepackaged sets of ideas.

The Internet is a fundamentally different communications technology. It 
gives everyone an equal chance to present their ideas. My website is 
just as accessible as the world largest company's website. I believe 
this makes the invention of the Internet more important then the 
printing press. Just as the printing press made representative democracy 
possible, the Internet makes direct democracy possible.

Most direct democracy proposals until now have involved complex systems 
of meetings and delegates bringing the ideas from local groups to 
national organizations. Internet technology allows everyone to 
contribute and allows those contributions to be organized and presented 
in an understandable and configurable way.

There have been many implementations of Internet based discussion, from 
Usenet to blogs, but they haven't included feature to allow decisions to 
be made.

Specification

DDD is a system for Internet based direct democracy. Users create 
proposals to modify or add to a &quot;master document&quot; and voted on them. The 
master document is updated dynamically based on the current vote results.

The voting on proposals would never end. If a proposal gets voted into a 
master document and is popular it could remain unchanged for years or a 
new, better, proposal could replace it or it may not work out as hoped, 
lose popularity and be removed. Certain things, such as budgeted money 
that has been spent cannot be taken back.

A delay could be including so that the a change doesn't take effect 
immediately so that the master document doesn't change frequently when 
votes are close.

This system will need to scale from governing an organization or 
political party with thousands of members, to a country with millions of 
citizens and one day, perhaps, make decisions involving the whole planet 
with billions participating. I expect it will take decades, during which 
this system will evolve, before that will happen.

Document Structure

The document would normally be a set of policies or bi-laws for an 
organization or laws for a government.

The document would be a hierarchical structure of paragraphs. The 
paragraphs are not numbered, as paragraphs can be inserted and removed 
by proposals.

Proposal Structure

Some proposals would add to the document, but most will amend existing 
proposals. Proposals would add, remove or replace paragraphs.

A proposal should address any contradictions that it may create with 
other existing popular proposals, even if to clarify why it is not 
really a contradiction. Only popular proposals that existed when the 
proposal was created need to be clarified. Unpopular proposal also don't 
need to be considered.

Voting Structure

Users can vote for or against proposals. They also have to option to 
make their vote subject to approval of other proposals.

As there could be may proposals to consider, the system would 
automatically suggest votes to users by finding voters who have voted in 
the same way as the user in the past and calculate how the majority of 
them voted and recommend that vote to the user. This is similar to how 
amazon.com website suggests books.

Discussion structure

Each proposal would have an attached discussion. The discussion would be 
hierarchical and support Slashdot like comment rating.

Discussion need not be limited to within DDD, but could occour 
elsewhere, with urls pointing back to the proposals being discussed.

Protocol structure

DDD uses a client-server stature, much like the World Wide Web.

There would be multiple implementations of both the DDD server and 
client, all supporting a common protocol. Having different clients 
allows users to choose the interface they prefer. Clients would include 
both stand alone applications and web or email based interfaces.

Next Steps

    1. Develop examples
    2. Start protocol design
    3. Implement server
    4. Implement text-based client
    5. Establish an organization run by this software
