Answer whomever you please, but I would appreciate it if you do not
slur me by suggesting I am too passionate to be reasoned with -
without even trying. My use of language is designed to communicate to
the fullest extent I see possible and although I may occasionally
(ab)use humour, it is - for the most part - a dispassionate analysis.


&gt;<i> I hope we can work together.  I hope that ideology is not

</I>
I would suggest that the strength to which you perceive an ideology is
proportional to your own - a toe only gets stubbed when it makes
sudden contact with an immovable obstacle.

I mentioned ideology because we have transitioned into an age where a
functioning ideology will, almost always, be able to defeat physical
force - due to our ability to communicate. This isn't
Rock/Paper/Scissors - it's the evolution of new competitive
environment for the grand meme experiment which is humanity. A system
which doesn't take this into account will fail, because the
individuals will game the system to the benefit of their own set of
agendas derived from their personal ideology complex.

My reasons for being involved with Metagovernment are very practical -
the ideology set forth by the basic principles (
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A> ) are, in my
judgement, those most vital to a successful movement of this nature.
While not as simple as counting votes, I believe the software created
with those principles in mind will be best placed to circumvent the
dangers the wind of our ideologies blows us toward when left unchecked
- mainly due to opacity on many layers.

Richard
