<PRE>The line between illusion and reality is fairly clear.  I'll draw it
as I see it by (I) continuing my argument that replacement of the
executive is infeasible; then (II) arguing that Metagovernment is
anyway impertinent, because it is just one possible &quot;constitution&quot; in
a myriad of constitutions that Metascore must eventually rate.  (In
other words, your cart is broken and you have placed it in front of
the horse.)

&gt;&gt;<i> (1)... Will there be a Chief of the General Staff, with overall
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> command of the armed forces?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (2). Or, will you replace individual staff commanders by a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collective of some sort?  If so, will you also replace the general
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> field officers, and other battle commanders?

I share the hope of ending warfare and I hope the horse pulls in that
direction.  But I think you will agree that, if it is even possible to
eradicate warfare, it is nevertheless a distant goal (maybe light
years away).  If the vehicle to carry us there is Metagovernment, then
we have exactly three choices when it comes to replacing the executive
branch of government.  The executive is either:

   i) replaced by a collective in a world where warfare is possible;

  ii) replaced by a collective in a world where warfare has been
      eradicated; or

 iii) not replaced by a collective.

You know that the presupposition of (ii) is absurd.  Anything that
depends on the *prior* acheivement of world peace is necessarily a far
fetched notion.  We cannot speak of it as a &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;policy&quot;.

You know that (i) will bring you face to face with the power that is
threatened in the leading questions (1 and 2).  Metagovernment could
not survive that confrontation, no matter how it responded.

That leaves only (iii) as a feasible plan of action.  Metagovernment
must drop the notion of replacing the executive.

II.
===

Another illusion/confusion is the marriage of the two projects as one.
Metascore is developing a medium that will enable people to express
agreement and disagreement on norms (laws and so forth).  However, if
it proves effective, then nothing will stop it from being turned
inward and directed at Metagovernment itself.  After all,
Metagovernment is nothing but a norm - a proposed constitution - one
of an unlimited number of constitutions that people may eventually
rate with the help of Metascore.  It is possible (even likely, given
its flaw) that Metagovernment will be voted down and itself replaced
at the very outset.  The two projects are therefore logically
separate.

They are *rightfully* separate, too.  It would be impertinent to
presuppose any particular form of government as *the* goal.  If a
project is &quot;open&quot; and claims the mantra of democracy (what John Dunn
called the &quot;unfinished journey&quot;), then it ought to let ordinary people
decide on the destination.

Do you not agree?
