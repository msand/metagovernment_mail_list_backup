I would say it's still a reputation system.  I guess I'm using the words 
'reputation system' to refer to anything that people use to establish 
reputation...which can be quite a lot (and not necessarily involve 
technology at all).


&gt;<i> Consider the two
</I>&gt;<i> reasons I offered, by way of distinction:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  i) The votes apply only in the context of a single norm - the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     particular law, plan or policy on which we are all voting.  In
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     other votes (for other issues) I'm still Joe average voter.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ii) Although some people may be voting confidence in me (personally),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     most of them are probably only voting for my ideas.  They're
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     hoping I'll use their votes as leverage, and push the ideas
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     closer to action.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a third:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   iii) I gain no formal privleges as a consequence of the votes I
</I>&gt;<i>        received.  They are merely expressions.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Although I accept that formal privileges as consequence of votes is part 
of many reputation systems, I don't think that they are a defining 
feature.  That is, I think you can still have reputation and a 
'reputation system' even if there are no external consequences 
whatsoever.  I think that even a plain 'ol bulletin board system can be 
a reputation system (e.g.).


&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... As I said, I do think that the Internet enables alternative (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better) reputation systems...and enabling those seems to me to be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better approach then trying to eliminate reputation systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why?  It's easy enough to eliminate a reputation system.  Maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> have already coded one into your software?  Even still, you can remove
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
I think we're interpreting differently what is a 'reputation system'.  
Yes you can remove the technology specifically added for user 
'reputation', but even if you don't have this I would say that with a 
consistent community of users you end up with some notion of reputation 
(and therefor have a reputation system).  I guess this is a pretty broad 
meaning of 'reputation system', which maybe wasn't clear.

&gt;<i> What's more difficult to accept is systematic discrimination and
</I>&gt;<i> suppression in our voting methods.  
</I>
Yes, of course I agree.  Using reputation for discrimination and 
suppression is both overly common and particularly egregious IMHO.

&gt;<i> Nature and society impose no
</I>&gt;<i> restrictions on face-to-face communication.  Nobody is naturally
</I>&gt;<i> raised on a pedestal and handed a megaphone, while all the others are
</I>&gt;<i> bound and gagged!  
</I>
Agreed.  But in practical and psychological terms reputation does 
matter...at least partially because history matters.  I'm not suggesting 
that anyone is/should be bound and gagged (with the possible exception 
of Karl Rove...due to his reputation...that's a joke ;-), but just 
pointing out that getting rid of something like reputation in political 
discourse and polity making is akin (IMHO) to trying to get rid of the 
nitrogen in the air.

&gt;<i> So we ought to design our voting methods to respect
</I>&gt;<i> natural freedoms and equalities, and not - for reasons of technical
</I>&gt;<i> convenience, scalability, etc. - to discard them, and walk all over
</I>&gt;<i> them.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Two things:

1) I'm not generally talking about voting methods, but rather 
discussions around policy...that is, I'm also a strong believer of 'one 
person, one vote' and agree that voting processes should not be in any 
way sensitive to reputation.
2) I actually don't think that the problems with eliminating reputation 
are mainly issues of scaling or technical convenience.  Rather I would 
say that it's mostly psychological and social...i.e. we *use* history as 
well as lots of other information to help us allocate attention, 
evaluate arguments, etc...and that defines a reputation system (at least 
for me)...irrespective of whether we are using networking/communication 
technology at all.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RE: sacrificing the ideals of democracy...I don't really think that in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general reputation systems sacrifice the ideals of democracy...just bad

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If reputation is *merely* an expression for people to interpret, that

</I>&gt;<i> If there's a mechanism that automatically acts on measures of
