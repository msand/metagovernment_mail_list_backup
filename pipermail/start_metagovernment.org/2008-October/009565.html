Well, to be clear, I think there's a big difference between military  
and police, the difference being which direction the force is being  
directed.

I'll answer your question at the end, but... the long answer is that  
in the case of military force, I think (OK hope) it is a non-issue.  
Military force is the purview of nation-states, and those are likely  
be the last possible targets for transformation. Before that, in  
addition to all kinds of smaller communities, I can also see distinct  
parts of national governments moving to open source governance long  
before they go all the way. In the same way that a city may not move  
all in one go but first open up its park system or transportation  
system, a country might also first open things like its park system to  
open source governance.

By the time this form of governance is ready for control of entire  
nations, we just might realize that nations have become obsolete.  
Communities (such as this one for example) are forming without any  
regard to or need for national borders. This project is hardly  
alone... the internet has solidified the fact that communities  
increasingly have more to do with ideas than with geography.

Once distributed communities become decidedly more important in  
peoples' lives than geographic ones, then how would physical military  
campaigns be waged? Internet communities can't lob bombs at each  
other. And why try internet-based attacks when instead you can just  
join the community and try to move the consensus?

Of course I understand that geography will always have some exclusive  
significance. People generally reside in one place, and that can  
result in resource conflicts between neighboring places. But if there  
is eventually a general dissolution of large nations, then those  
geographic communities will become small and the conflicts very local.  
I am hopeful that by that time, people will have become practiced at  
the art of consensus governance and will be able to find suitable  
syntheses to their conflicts.

In other words, I think/hope that open source governance will enable  
and encourage people to grow up and act responsibly. Use of force is,  
in the end, a very primitive act.

It will take time, but in a sense I see this as almost inevitable. Can  
we really keep expanding onto the internet and yet stay stuck in a  
vestige of feudal governance? The solution may not be Metagovernment,  
but one way or another, collaborative governance seems to me to be  
unstoppable.

Until that time, I doubt that militaries (or for-profit corporations)  
will opt for open source governance. They are decidedly not democratic  
institutions, and OSG is probably only suitable in governance  
structures where representative democracy already has a hold.
