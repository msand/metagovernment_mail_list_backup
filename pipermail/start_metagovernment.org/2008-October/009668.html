I don't necessarily agree with this. It seems democratic, but consider  
some practicalities.

In current democracies, we usually exclude many people. Most  
consistently: children, convicted criminals, non-citizens, and those  
deemed to be insane.

The general description of Metagovernment allows all of these people  
to participate: in other words, it puts absolutely no restriction on  
who may be involved in any decision in perhaps any community. That  
sounds *more* democratic, right? And it obviates the need for any sort  
of identity verification, residency requirement, etc., and generally  
fits nicely with the reality of a global, chaotic internet. However,  
it then might make sense to use some sort of user scoring to mitigate  
some participation.

That would result in, for example, allowing a 5-year old child to have  
a say, and to contribute the occasional ingenious idea they might  
have... but simultaneously to not have every conversation be  
overwhelmed by the general babbling of children.

It might also allow someone new and foreign to a community to  
contribute their ideas and to have somewhat of a say, but not to have  
equal say to someone who has been deeply involved in the maintenance  
of that community for decades.

And more generally concerning &quot;one person, one vote,&quot; we also don't  
really support voting per say, but rather tagging and nuanced scoring.  
One person might have multiple personalities and give many scores to  
various resolutions. With a user scoring system, that's acceptable,  
since each of their identities would have to build a reputation in  
order to have significant weight.
