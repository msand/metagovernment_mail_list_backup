Hi Mark,

It looks like a mock-up of the user interface.  It looks (at a glance)
to be pretty good.  But I am not so much interested in the UI...

Are there still no docs on the conceptual and technical details of the
basic method - UI aside?  I have some questions:

&gt;<i> DemocracyLab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>&gt;  is a nonprofit organization
</I>&gt;<i> based in the United States whose mission is to &quot;Create a non-partisan,
</I>&gt;<i> non-profit website dedicated to improving the democratic process by enabling
</I>&gt;<i> the exploration, organization, communication, and synthesis of the values,
</I>&gt;<i> positions, and policies affecting humanity.&quot; Our website will use the posts
</I>&gt;<i> and votes of its users to build a dynamic map of political thought.
</I>&gt;<i> Participants will evaluate issues, connecting statements of their values to

I am interested in how it scales in complexity to handle large numbers
of policies.  How many policies will a typical participant vote for?
At what cost in time?

&gt;<i> identify consensus where it exists, and where it doesn't, productively focus
</I>&gt;<i> discussion at the point of disagreement. Just as competition in a fair
</I>
You focus on dissensus in the hopes of resolving it, and of forming a
consensus policy.  How does that happen exactly?  Who composes the
consensus policy?  How do the other participants become aware of it,
and shift their votes to it?

&gt;<i> market and evolution in nature select for success, informed debate will lead
</I>&gt;<i> to the best possible solutions to contentious political problems. The end
</I>&gt;<i> result will be an engaging public forum where the best thinking rises to the
</I>&gt;<i> top, creating a community-driven alternative to traditional politics.
</I>
I am interested in how a policy, once it acquires a consensus, is
translated into action.  How may a public official (who acts on
policy) gauge the level of assent for a DemocracyLab policy?  What is
the formal measure of agreement vs. disagreement?

Different officials serve the electorates of different cities,
regions, provinces, states, etc.  How may they gauge the level of
support for a given policy in their own localities, filtering out the
votes of foreigners etc.?

How might the officials authenticate the results?  How can they be
confident that a given consensus is bona-fide, as opposed to a
fabrication of sock puppets, and so forth?
