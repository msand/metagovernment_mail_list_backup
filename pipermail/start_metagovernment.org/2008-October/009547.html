<PRE>May I post my impressions?  Looking at your archive (last month's
posts), here's how I distinguish the projects:

                        Metagovernment (M)  Votorola (V)
                        ------------------  ------------

  1   Inspiration       social/political    technical

  2   Location in       government          public sphere
      social space

  3   Focus as          general             specialized
      a medium          decision making     assent (voting)

  4   Project state     pre-alpha,          alpha, weak
                        strong community    community
 -------------------------------------------------------------

[1] M appears to be motivated by examples of social change in other
    domains (software development, collaborative authoring), and maybe
    by a desire for political reform.

    V began as a technical invention (recombinant text and cascade
    voting).

[2] M is positioned as an institution of government, thus a part of
    the &quot;system&quot;.  It is intended to replace existing governments.

    V is positioned as an institution of the public sphere, thus a
    part of the &quot;lifeworld&quot;.  It is not a replacement, but something
    novel (facility to express assent, consensus and dissensus).

    The distinction is illustrated in Figure 5, &quot;Relations between
    lifeworld (where V is) and system (M)&quot;.

[3] M appears to be a general medium of decision making that combines
    several media (assent, discussion, drafting, publication) in one.
    I only glanced at the Wiki docs for prototype A.  (Is there a link
    to B, please?)

    V is purely a medium of assent (voting), intended to be used
    side-by-side with other specialized media (user's choice).

[4] M does not have running code yet, but has a strong community of
    contributors (judging from the mailing list).

    V has running code, but is still a one man project.

I see [2] as a weakness in theory.  Are you sure you want to replace
government?  If so, you ought to explain how exactly.  What are the
steps in the transition?  What are the structures and functions of the
end result?

I see [3] as a weakness in design.  All other e-democracy projects
(far as I know) have this weakness except V (it has other failings).
The world already has an abundance and variety of media for discussion
and so forth.  Users have their own preferences.  Better to reach out
to their natural habitats than to recreate them in captivity.

I see your contributor community [4] as a strength.  The quality of
discussion is above average.  (A suggestion for your home page - add a
hyperlink to the list archive, and put flashing lights around it!)

These are just my impressions.  Please correct me if I misrepresent
anything,
