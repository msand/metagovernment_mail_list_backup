<PRE>That's what I was just beginning to realize as I read your previous  
post. Instead of having massive political parties which have broad- 
based platforms, we would instead have diverse communities about  
particular interests.

So there might be one community which consists of the people who  
advocate that New York City should ban cars in the downtown Manhattan  
area. A large part of their functional purpose would be to figure out  
how to present their position such that the larger community of New  
York would be willing to agree with their position.
