<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Does this answer your larger question?&quot; Unfortunately, not at all. What
</I>&gt;<i> I see (and I have seen a lot) is that there a lot of smart people that
</I>&gt;<i> spend a lot of time and energy on working brilliant concepts. At the
</I>&gt;<i> same time there a lot of people anticipating a change to happen in our
</I>&gt;<i> political world.
</I>
I do agree and I am developping on Votorola. Votorola cannot change the world, 
no tool can. Only a tool which fits social needs can flourish once its time 
has come in an organic development with people. So you formulate the obvious 
problem that we are facing no matter whether we think it will be overcome soon 
or it is an unpredictably hard nut to crack.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But progress is painstakingly slow, if there is any at all. It seems to
</I>&gt;<i> me, that we think our concepts are so brilliant that the world is just
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for us to deliver so they can use it, but that is, at least
</I>&gt;<i> according to my experience, not the case.
</I>
Well, trying to judge the situation of the world society is in itself already 
really difficult. If we are really trying to understand what the problems of 
society are and how we fit in there, we have to do a lot of critical social 
studies and especially need to look at the desastrous state of the world 
economy. It is not just the current crisis, but mass-unemployment since 
decades and besides the Chinese boom which will come to an end very soon, more 
rationalisation than expansion. (Each of these problems is either solvable by 
our ways of &quot;Democracy&quot; or they are not even worth it, because people will 
then still be forced to act differently through the economy.)

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Just as Per Norb&#228;ck has described in his Blog
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/">http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> things are not so easy. For Per things are so bad that he titles his
</I>&gt;<i> blog &quot;A failure or success?&quot;.
</I>
The problem is easy to name: The idea of Democracy. People don't know how to 
ground their democratic claims and most often it is just used to get their 
&quot;fair&quot; share. For example I am not so sure if it is a democratic problem 
inside the EU if banks get bailouts. The biggest harm is done to outside 
developping countries which would have no say in most democratic proposals I 
have heard so far. How do you decide who decides and so on? What determines if 
you can vote? People speek about democracy in a liberal sense and that is in 
part hiding the problems behind the liberal concept of democracy (which it 
still is). Democracy always preassumes private property, because you only 
enjoy your democractic right to vote to optimize your personal individual 
life, no matter what other people think or do. Democracy with a vote for each 
person is developped on this Lockian liberal idea that you own the fruits of 
your labour and that there needs to be some liberal social mechanism based on 
this equality to allow you to maximize this behaviour. Even the German 
Grundgesetz is founded on these liberal ideas of Locke, although this idea of 
taking property through labour (like infection) was contradictory from the 
beginning (the who comes first?-problem again). That is why the idea also 
earned a lot of mockery from the founding fathers of the US when being applied 
to &quot;intellectual property&quot; e.g. [incl. the very patents of Mr. lonely inventor 
Watt].

In that sense I would propose to say that there is no real democracy as a 
system for society, which is still viable today. Even Habermas, who is not a 
die-hard liberal, has serious problems to judge situations critically and his  
discourse logic only applies to speech (the same as free software), but cannot 
be directly applied to (economical) things. Although he has come a long way to 
even model reason on a networked communicational discourse idea. Occupy also 
had great difficulties in leveraging democracy besides its initial 
breakthrough.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> James Watt, the inventor of the steam machine and his partner spent more
</I>&gt;<i> than ten years being on the knocker until his invention was finally
</I>&gt;<i> accepted and turned into a success. Finally, his invention kick off on
</I>&gt;<i> of the greatest revolutions in history: the industrial revolution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>James Watt was not the inventor of the steam machine, yet he holded patents 
which for over a decade staled developping of steam machines due to his 
patents (they were applied mostly in mining back then), because he wanted to 
make a lonely profit. It's the same Steve Jobs like liberal prototype people 
like to reference to (both Obama and Romney did in their speeches during their 
conventions) without seeing that they silently propose a liberal entrepreneur, 
who acts in the name of his capital. Capital only needs democracy to realize 
its interests against social barriers to its accumulation at times. Democracy 
in the broad global perspective everybody assumes here is even as an idea a 
product of Capital accumulation and the world market (and equal consumer's 
choice). In that sense also the &quot;democratic&quot; opening of the GDR has proven to 
have been mobb rule in the end again, opening western Capital the best 
recovery options through primitive accumulation after the 80s recession and 
the Japan crisis with little gains for eastern Germans, although they tried to 
brake free from economical decline.

&gt;<i> If we leave our inventions to themselves without promoting and lobbying
</I>&gt;<i> I am afraid they will go down without ever being known to the world.
</I>
I would argue that you cannot lobby them in the liberal way I tried to outline 
above. If you do, people will understand these concepts in terms of profits 
and as a hidden business model (after all we are the organizers). It has to 
really work for them in most personal and group interrelations in the first 
place (and has to be open by design), you cannot lobby that away or to the 
solution afterwards. I do agree that we need a strategy though and you are 
right demanding one.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That is why I am concerned about how all these concepts fit into big
</I>&gt;<i> picture, because, if they don't, I do not see a chance for them to ever
</I>&gt;<i> come to life.
</I>
I would turn around my last point here and say that democracy was always 
thought as a liberal complement to free entreprise. If we want to radicalize 
(to try to improve) it, we need to take the strength of business into the 
equation, because business just works. All this thinking about humanity, 
people, global or national scale are totally off of our scalability and scope 
at the moment. Solutions need to work no matter how small they are to the 
benefit of participants, If they do, scaling up will be in the interest of 
anybody and this is what I think we should try to do. (Facebook has grown with 
a very sophisticated strategy of elite campusses e.g., and not by opening to 
all the population, development strategies form the product).
But Democracy as well as liberal politics is a real pain as everybody knows 
who tried to engage in a party once. This is not an accident and it is also 
not coming from the outside corrupting the process, but it is coming through 
the very relation to Capital and its social reproduction (huh, what a 
surprise). It's death of progressive politics by a thousand cuts of 
realpolitik (see the German Greens as the most radical pro-democracy party 
having failed).

I would say that Capital is still a semi-planned activity dominating the 
economy. If we want to tackle people's problems, we have to do so through 
economical solutions which include all their individual needs (so are a real 
planned economy in the democratic sense, you cannot have free entreprise and 
total democracy in the same place). That is the only real progress that can be 
gained over the current situation and it is the only way to make Democracy 
more than profitable, but rather more than profitable in the capitalistic 
sense, because profit is not the same as material wealth/output. For Capital 
it's only the rate of its accumulation. This is why I am here. (2)

Votorola already allows to avoid this very wall of text which keeps me from 
doing some productive work and repeating old and newer arguments all the time 
(1). So maybe we should each formulate our understanding of the problem of 
bringing democracy to the people in such a way that we can focus discussing 
single points or some general theory and arguments? Individual positions are 
somewhat ridiculous today, where each one individually can barely grasp the 
classics of any single field of theory (which is not necessary if we work 
together as we do in the capitalistic economy). We can easily do so now in the 
Metagov-Wiki and then use Votorola's difference bridge to discuss single 
arguments or parts thereof and come to more insights together.
