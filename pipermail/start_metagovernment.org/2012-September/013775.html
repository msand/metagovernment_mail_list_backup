<PRE>Hi all,

I am not at all familiar with the details of Liquid feedback. And as far as I know, the developers are overwhelmed with questions. But on the other hand there are, in the pirate parties worldwide, a lot of developers active with the development of &#8220;front ends&#8221; (in several programming languages)  in order to meet their own demands about user friendliness, eID log in and so on. It will take a lot of work in the pirate party to come to some coordination. All I can advise for the moment is to study the available documentation. 
This as far as programming goes.
some of the other questions I answer in between of the questions.

Kind Regards
Beste groeten

Paul

  Hello Paul,

  I have a couple of questions concerning Liquid Feedback. Would you be willing to answer them?


I think you should ask the developers
<A HREF="http://liquidfeedback.org/">http://liquidfeedback.org/</A>
or maybe join the &quot;AG Liquid Democracy&quot; of the german pirate party
<A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Liquid_Democracy">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Liquid_Democracy</A>
maybe also try the &quot;AG Liquid Feedback&quot;
<A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Liquid_Feedback">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Liquid_Feedback</A>

 
  My questions: 

  Can any member post an issue?
  Who sets the life-time limit for an issues?
  What&#8217;s the difference between an issue and a proposition?
  Can a user create a new unit by itself?
  Does voting in Liquid Feedback lead to results that are binding for the Pirates, or is it just a precursor to the actual voting?

  I can only tell something about the situation here in Belgium. The pirates can decides for themselves locally how they will work. All citizens can vote, only members can vote, results are binding for the party and so on. Here in Brasschaat, a suburb of Antwerp,  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antwerp</A> we are planning to launch local &#8220;democratic experiments&#8221; whereby the citizens can decide about some issues (demoex system). This can be on street level, neighbourhood level or communal level. Not informative but decisive. That way we will give the citizens the opportunity to get acquaintance with direct democracy and the fact that they have decisive power if they want to have it. Of course the vote can only bind the pirate party at this moment but this is a first step and the only one we have at our disposal for now.    

  Can I add links and pictures to an issue in Liquid Feedback?
  Supporters and Delegations are not anonymous. Why is this so?

  I think this is because we need to know how the delegate intend to vote. That way you are always able to vote yourself or appoint another delegate.

  What is the difference between Liquid Feedback and Adhocracy?

  Thanks &amp; best regards

    Hi Ronald,

    I can&#8217;t be more in agreement. That is why I joined the Pirate Party. We have to work on both fronts, the software on one hand and the political evolution on the other hand. We agreed (in the PP) to launch &#8220;democratic experiments&#8221; when it is possible within the representative system (like Per with Demoex). That way people can get used to the idea that if they want they can decide themselves. But even in Switzerland we have great differences between the different cultures. The French cantons are using far less the direct democracy possibilities then the German speaking cantons even if they have the same possibilities. <A HREF="http://www.tfd.org.tw/docs/dj0201/Christophe%20Premat.pdf">http://www.tfd.org.tw/docs/dj0201/Christophe%20Premat.pdf</A>

    Hello Michael,

    &quot;Does this answer your larger question?&quot; Unfortunately, not at all. What I see (and I have seen a lot) is that there a lot of smart people that spend a lot of time and energy on working brilliant concepts. At the same time there a lot of people anticipating a change to happen in our political world. 

    But progress is painstakingly slow, if there is any at all. It seems to me, that we think our concepts are so brilliant that the world is just waiting for us to deliver so they can use it, but that is, at least according to my experience, not the case. 

    Just as Per Norb&#228;ck has described in his Blog <A HREF="http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/">http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/</A> things are not so easy. For Per things are so bad that he titles his blog &quot;A failure or success?&quot;.

    James Watt, the inventor of the steam machine and his partner spent more than ten years being on the knocker until his invention was finally accepted and turned into a success. Finally, his invention kick off on of the greatest revolutions in history: the industrial revolution.

    If we leave our inventions to themselves without promoting and lobbying I am afraid they will go down without ever being known to the world.

    That is why I am concerned about how all these concepts fit into big picture, because, if they don't, I do not see a chance for them to ever come to life.

    Best regards

I do not claim do understand Votorola good enough to able to
criticize the concept as such. My thoughts are more on the
environment, in which Votorola is to take place.
And:
These question all circle around the question &quot;how do we get
Votorola out of the ivory tower onto the street&quot;. ...
The environment we anticipate is one in which individuals are free to
choose the toolset and practices that best meet their personal needs
and abilities, or, failing that, to develop new toolsets of their own.
A new toolset with a single user is equally viable vs. one with a
million users in this roll-your-own environment, and individuals
cannot be herded into a one-size-fits-all, canned solution except
where they choose to be.

We learned here in Metagov that no other environment is possible,
neither in principle nor in practice.  So we're working to build it.
We know that Votorola will always be just one technical choice among
many.  We aren't competing on a winner-take-all field.  Does this
answer your larger question?
