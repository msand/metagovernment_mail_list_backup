<PRE>Hello Michael,

&quot;Does this answer your larger question?&quot; Unfortunately, not at all. What 
I see (and I have seen a lot) is that there a lot of smart people that 
spend a lot of time and energy on working brilliant concepts. At the 
same time there a lot of people anticipating a change to happen in our 
political world.

But progress is painstakingly slow, if there is any at all. It seems to 
me, that we think our concepts are so brilliant that the world is just 
waiting for us to deliver so they can use it, but that is, at least 
according to my experience, not the case.

Just as Per Norb&#228;ck has described in his Blog 
<A HREF="http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/">http://pernor.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/the-fight-for-new-democratic-forms/</A> 
things are not so easy. For Per things are so bad that he titles his 
blog &quot;A failure or success?&quot;.

James Watt, the inventor of the steam machine and his partner spent more 
than ten years being on the knocker until his invention was finally 
accepted and turned into a success. Finally, his invention kick off on 
of the greatest revolutions in history: the industrial revolution.

If we leave our inventions to themselves without promoting and lobbying 
I am afraid they will go down without ever being known to the world.

That is why I am concerned about how all these concepts fit into big 
picture, because, if they don't, I do not see a chance for them to ever 
come to life.

Best regards

Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en

Ronald D. Grindle
