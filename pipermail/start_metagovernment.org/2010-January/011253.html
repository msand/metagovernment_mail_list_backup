Now that's a different thing, and a more interesting one. One thing is
to try to mirror everything from one to the other. I think that's
doomed to fail because each project is different.
(But note, I will not stop you from doing it, as long as you do not
force me to add things to Vilfredo, you are free to take the data that
is public, and even to have them in the xml format you are willing to
code)
Another is to go and look for the specific point of strength of each
project, and link those.
So you would get Vilfredo to run a few generations, and then the
result get polled on another system, and stored in a third one.

But that require careful working out of the specifications.
