Their primary concern appears to be about our own content. The wiki's  
CC:by-nc-sa could be problematic in the nc (non-commercial) aspect.  
This was objected to before, and the conversation simply didn't  
progress.

Their FAQ page talks about why NC is not free at the bottom of this  
section:
<A HREF="http://faq.tuxfamily.org/License/En#Why_a_free_license.3F">http://faq.tuxfamily.org/License/En#Why_a_free_license.3F</A>

However, I'm not sure what commercial benefit could be derived from  
the content of our wiki... perhaps if someone wanted to re-publish it  
as a book for sale? I'd certainly like to hear others' views on this.

Great work so far, Jacki. Thanks for all this.
