<PRE>Philippe's views seem to be considerably &quot;left&quot; of my own on the costs and
benefits of competition, particularly in the early stages of development of
any technology.  

However, I do strongly share his apparent belief that it would be good to
spend more time and effort focusing on goals that we *share* and could
productively *pursue together*.

In that regard, I'm pleased to see the opening sentences of Wikipedia's
article on competition:  &quot;Competition is a contest between individuals,
groups, nations, animals, etc. for territory, a niche, or a location of
resources. It arises whenever two or more parties strive for a *goal which
cannot be shared*.&quot;  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition</A>

Many goals fall into that category, and tremendous waste of resources can
occur when consensus is reached prematurely.

Jim Hines and Judy House cite &quot;... two potential failure modes in policy
creation: (1) &#145;&#145;learning drift&#146;&#146;, a process in which people learn
unselectively and, hence, learn without improving; and/or (2) &#145;&#145;premature
consensus&#146;&#146;, a process in which managers agree on a policy before the &#148;best&#148;
one has emerged.&quot;

<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Criticisms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Criticisms</A> 

However, without attempting to *enforce* any degree of consensus, the
purpose of the StratML standard is to enable those who do happen to have
common goals to more easily discover each other and, hopefully, work more
productively together.  At least StratML can help to reduce the degree to
which goals literally &quot;cannot be shared&quot; (because they have not been
documented in readily shareable format).

In my view, .gov agencies have a particular obligation to publish their
goals and objectives on the Web in StratML format because taxpayers are
forced (have no choice but) to pay for them.  Likewise, nonprofit, public
service organizations also have an obligation to do so because it is a
violation of public trust for them to waste donated resources in competing
efforts.  By definition, the motivation of venture capitalists much
different, and the world would be much poorer without an appropriate degree
of competition and risk-taking.

Subject: Re: [Start] Internet, a democracy tool

Hello Thomas,

thanks a lot for your kind welcome.
I'm a bit disapointed about the apparent consensus on the introduction 
of competitiveness in democracy tools, althought effort is made to try 
to make some projects to collaborate.

Let me develop why I don't see competitiveness in democracy tools 
development as a good option.

Competition in is essence needs winners and loosers.  In the field of 
true democracy, we have to distinguish against who and why we must 
really compete. Surely, The competeters are &quot;citizens&quot; (wanted true, 
transparent and participative democracy) against &quot;actual governance&quot; 
(promoting false democracy,  bad representation, opacity, 
corruptive...etc). This is, for me, the lonely and true competition that 
we should consider because actual governance doesn't give us the 
possibility to collaborate and change the things. In this case we 
haven't got the choice, we are obliged to compete.
In oposition, competition amongst us will surely cause dispute 
(different to debate), slowness, dispatching of force and energy, lies, 
dissimulation and all the bad moods that follows the aim to win and not 
to loose.
We should'nt confused dispute and debate. Dispute is naturally 
surrounded of negative thought while debate is essential to make a rich 
consensus emerging.
I deeply believe that the actual countries governance are going the bad 
way because it follows the main &quot;ideology&quot; of the capitalism : the 
competitiveness.
How can we make emerging a new system if we fall into the same trap ? 
Why do our minds so highly colonised by such a lie that competitiveness 
is the key to progress for humanity ? How can we believed that humanity 
was able to reach the moon thanks to the soviet and american competition 
? How faster would we have succeed by pooling our cleverness and energy 
instead of dissimulate, spying each others ? Sorry, but history has 
never given me the proof that competition is better than true and 
complete collaboration to achieve a goal.

We have a unique chance here to give the proof of concept off 
e-democracy by succeeding in developing a common tool that the 
development process would precisely followed the concept that we want to 
reveal. I salute Mikes proposal, but unfortunately, I feel that it is a 
consensual proposal that will surely be compromised by the negatives 
effects of competitiveness.

Nevertheless we now faces a cornelian situation : several projects 
exist, some show a will to claborate but the emerging tendencies for 
collaboration is something between cold and hot, others like GoogleVotes 
or Sunlight Foundation are staying away of our discussions, what should 
we do ?
Staying in this tinted competitiveness process ? Or delibarate to 
impose, not by force but by true democracy, a common project where we 
could all  release unrestrained our cleverness and energy to reach our 
common goal : open democracy ?

I repeat that reading here that competitiveness is a good choice, has 
broken something in my mind. Sorry for not be able to endorse this choice.
My contribution will exclusively go to common democracy tool (Mike 
proposal as a first step ?).
Sorry to be so radical, but it is clear that 50 years (and more) of 
accomodation to the capitalism all over the world drives us now at high 
speed in front of an iron wall. We have new concepts to invent ! Hurry up !

Kind regards

Philippe

PS: to be clear on my political position, I'm anti-capitalist but i'm 
not communist. I know that thoose models are obsolete and have made the 
proof that they are more destructive than constructive for humanity.
