<PRE>&quot;Open government&quot; has been operationally defined in the attachment to OMB
M-10-06.  I have rendered those requirements as a &quot;model&quot; plan in StratML
format at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#OpenGovDirective">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#OpenGovDirective</A>  While the
President's open gov directive applies only to U.S. federal Executive Branch
agencies, it is a good place for State and local .gov agencies to start as
well.

 

The reason I subscribed to the Metagov listserv was to explore prospects for
facilitating feedback on the goals and objectives set forth in strategic
plans.  If this week's election in Massachusetts demonstrates anything, it
shows that elected officials (as well as candidates for election) should pay
more heed to the views of voters with respect to what they aim to try to do
if elected.  

 

Toward that end, it would be good if all candidates for elective office (as
well as political parties) were expected by the voters to render their plans
in StratML format on the Web, so that Metagov-type services can be used to
enable citizens and taxpayers to provide feedback more easily and
effectively -- on each and every issue of interest to them, at anytime they
choose (rather than merely the candidates themselves on election day).

 

Moreover, to the degree that we have it within our power to work directly
together to accomplish common objectives, deferring our responsibilities to
elected officials is part of the problem -- not part of the solution.

I'll just shoehorn in here that I think there need to be some real attempts
at definition. There are now many words such as open government, government
2.0, and eDemocracy to name some popular ones, with very little consensus on
what any of them mean.

 

I'll reiterate what I said on the originating thread, which is that there
appear to be (at least) four distinct areas of focus:

1. Government data, transparency &amp; accessibility of services

2. Participation in government processes (bureaucratic)

3. Political processes, campaigns &amp; elections

4. Participation in government decision-making (legislative &amp; executive)

 

The term &quot;government 2.0&quot; usually seems to apply to only 1 &amp; 2 (though for
some people only 1).

 

&quot;eDemocracy&quot; tends to refer most to 3, with 4 (sometimes) and 2
(occasionally) included.

 

And fwiw, Metagovernment (our latest favored term is &quot;collaborative
governance&quot;) is focused almost exclusively on 4, which tends to get
overlooked most... particularly by politicians, who have a vested interest
in shifting focus away from it.

 

And on a separate note, I'd like to emphasize that a US focus, while
inevitable for US-based meetings, should be at least somewhat de-emphasized
for two reasons. First, the most desperate need for openness is not in the
federal government, where we see quite a lot already; but in local
government, which is often completely opaque, inaccessible, and corrupt.
Second, because the internet knows no boundaries. Instead of fighting the
inevitable by trying to force web-based processes to obey geographic limits,
we should be embracing the connectedness allowed by a global internet.

 

Note that these two points mesh nicely: instead of focusing on a single
national government, if focus is placed on localities, the ideas are much
more readily ported around the world.

yup, one of the purposes of that email was to lay the groundwork for open

Nice job Matt!... an fyi to all of you out there... the next ecosystem we
will commence our mapping activity in is the OpenGov space...

Hello All,

I woke up this morning to three different threads regarding this year's open
gov unconferences.  I'm actually in Melbourne from now until the end of May,
working with Collabforge &lt;<A HREF="http://collabforge.com">http://collabforge.com</A>&gt;  and diving into the
Australian Open Gov scene (which is quite ripe! check out the Aus Fed's Gov
2.0 task force &lt;<A HREF="http://gov2.net.au/">http://gov2.net.au/</A>&gt;  blog).  I'll be back just in time for
PdF and the accompanying unconference.

(Apologies to those of you on multiple lists who will receive duplicates of
this... And thanks Steven and Wayne for asking for my opinion :-) You got
it.)

Participation Camp did indeed piggyback on PdF, and this worked out quite
well, even though I started things far too late to really integrate with
PdF's plans.  One great moment was having Steven, Craig Newmark, and a bunch
of other open gov heavies who were in town for PdF in on an excellent
session by local open gov leader City Councilmember Gale Brewer and attended
by many of NYC's most active on-the-ground open gov organizers.

I think piggybacking on Politics Online is a smart move, and the difference
in focus should be seen as a strength rather than a weakness.  Those of us
who organize the OpenNY forum &lt;<A HREF="http://opennyforum.org">http://opennyforum.org</A>&gt;  (the OpenGovNYC
meetup re-branded) were planning to repeat our PdF-piggybacking this year as
well.  We recently heard from Micah and Andrew that PdF was already planning
its own unconference, and from what I understand from a distance, we're
figuring out right now how it all fits together.

I'm laying this all out because I think the overall lesson is that we ought
to coordinate our efforts across all of these groups to provide an ongoing
open gov narrative.  Think of it as a giant open space grid with the all of
the the cities in the U.S. on the X axis, and the entire 2010 calendar on
the Y axis (I've been pushing a similar vision for NY
&lt;<A HREF="http://opennyforum.org/open-space/">http://opennyforum.org/open-space/</A>&gt; ).

This was, in part, the rationale behind Participation Camp.  It was meant to
build on Transparency Camp, and a Collaboration Camp was discussed for
December but never happened.

To wrap, from what I can see in the threads, the highly-motivated band of
open gov organizers on these lists is particularly focused on how to make
*authentic citizen participation* a reality.  Politics Online and
Transparency Camp are focused, as they should be, on specific domains, but
there's a need to focus on participation specifically.  Participation, I'd
argue, is the &quot;hard problem&quot; of open government, and needs the most TLC to
help it grow to maturity.

We need to find some way to build momentum through these camps and
coordinate existing (fragmented) efforts.

That's my ten cents.  I have some ideas on what this might look like, but
I've written enough :)

G'day!
Matt
