<PRE>Welcome, Friedrich!

I look forward to learning more about your project. And clearly I need  
to learn more about the Pirate Party. While this project doesn't take  
a stand on specific issues, and while we are working toward a  
transcendence of political parties, clearly there is a great deal of  
room for cooperation and coordination.

Also several individual members of this project had expressed an  
interest in forming a party and might wish to look further into the PP.

Here in the U.S. I often get the impression that citizens are so  
completely jaded (especially because of our winner-take-all system),  
that Americans will never believe in collaborative governance until  
more enlightened societies such as in Sweden and Germany show us the  
way.

Anyway... Again, welcome, and please do feel free to explain further  
anything you introduced below. I am sure many here would be very  
interested.

&gt;<i> Hi all,

</I>&gt;<i> earlier today I received a very nice message from Ed inviting the

</I>&gt;<i> I've been a great fan of the Metagoverment wiki and its projects -  
</I>&gt;<i> particularly NationBuilder, Candiwi and Votorola - for a while, so I

</I>&gt;<i> Let me quickly introduce my project, Adhocracy, and myself. The goal

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for myself, I am one of the german Pirate Party guys Thomas  
</I>&gt;<i> mentioned in the ongoing thread on Rapid prototyping. Yet my  
</I>&gt;<i> interest is not only in providing the PP with usable software but  
</I>&gt;<i> also in offering a democratic management tool to other communities,  
</I>&gt;<i> like net groups (hence the name), NGOs etc. This interest is shared  
</I>&gt;<i> by the Liquid Democracy e.V. group that Thomas and I are members of  
</I>&gt;<i> and that I think follows many of the same goals that MG has.  
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of English info on the group  
</I>&gt;<i> available at the moment.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking forward to learning more about your projects and goals!
