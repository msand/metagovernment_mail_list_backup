<PRE>Philippe, no doubt, we could debate our differences endlessly.  However, I
believe it would be more productive and consistent with views that we both
have expressed to focus on our points of agreement:

1) With respect to the conclusions of the paper you cite, I agree it is good
practice to make employees owners of stock in the companies for which they
&quot;labor&quot;.

2) I look forward to seeing any evidence that may result from your study of
the need to document goals in readily shareable format (like StratML) if in
fact goals are to be jointly pursued by those who share them.

Owen

Hello Owen,

let me quote and reply...

&gt;<i> Philippe's views seem to be considerably &quot;left&quot; of my own on the costs and
</I>&gt;<i> benefits of competition, particularly in the early stages of development
</I>of
&gt;<i> any technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
no proof really that it is due to the competition itself, perhaps 
another factor who knows ?

&gt;<i> However, I do strongly share his apparent belief that it would be good to
</I>&gt;<i> spend more time and effort focusing on goals that we *share* and could
</I>&gt;<i> productively *pursue together*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
thanks :)

&gt;<i> In that regard, I'm pleased to see the opening sentences of Wikipedia's
</I>&gt;<i> article on competition:  &quot;Competition is a contest between individuals,
</I>&gt;<i> groups, nations, animals, etc. for territory, a niche, or a location of
</I>&gt;<i> resources. It arises whenever two or more parties strive for a *goal which
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be shared*.&quot;  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
the neodarwinism obsolete ideology is precisely an ideology recovered by 
the capitalism to colonised our mind and legitimate its in-huamnity. 
Unfortunatly it is really really hard to think differently nowdays.

&gt;<i> Many goals fall into that category, and tremendous waste of resources can
</I>&gt;<i> occur when consensus is reached prematurely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
My thought was not to get a premature consensus and it is not in my 
opinion to oppose it to the competition, of course true debate, ideas 
confrontation are the keys for not premature consensus. The link you 
make between the lack of competition that would strictly drives to a 
premature consensus is not obvious to me, sorry.

&gt;<i> Jim Hines and Judy House cite &quot;... two potential failure modes in policy
</I>&gt;<i> creation: (1) &#145;&#145;learning drift&#146;&#146;, a process in which people learn
</I>&gt;<i> unselectively and, hence, learn without improving; and/or (2) &#145;&#145;premature
</I>&gt;<i> consensus&#146;&#146;, a process in which managers agree on a policy before the
</I>&#148;best&#148;
&gt;<i> one has emerged.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
you reverse the debate by something that I was not argue, but of course 
this is something to consider of course

&gt;<i> However, without attempting to *enforce* any degree of consensus, the
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of the StratML standard is to enable those who do happen to have
</I>&gt;<i> common goals to more easily discover each other and, hopefully, work more
</I>&gt;<i> productively together.  At least StratML can help to reduce the degree to
</I>&gt;<i> which goals literally &quot;cannot be shared&quot; (because they have not been
</I>&gt;<i> documented in readily shareable format).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
That is a very interesting concept that I will surely study

&gt;<i> In my view, .gov agencies have a particular obligation to publish their
</I>&gt;<i> goals and objectives on the Web in StratML format because taxpayers are
</I>&gt;<i> forced (have no choice but) to pay for them.  Likewise, nonprofit, public
</I>&gt;<i> service organizations also have an obligation to do so because it is a
</I>&gt;<i> violation of public trust for them to waste donated resources in competing
</I>&gt;<i> efforts.  By definition, the motivation of venture capitalists much
</I>&gt;<i> different, and the world would be much poorer without an appropriate
</I>degree
&gt;<i> of competition and risk-taking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
this is not a truth but it is of course massively diffused by the 
propaganda of our capitalist society, let me suggest you a reading that 
will show you that some people are demonstrate scientificaly that 
competition is not always the key for performance : 
<A HREF="http://www.cirano.qc.ca/pdf/publication/2003s-66.pdf">http://www.cirano.qc.ca/pdf/publication/2003s-66.pdf</A> . and if you keep 
interested you can explore the work of Joseph Schumpeter.

Kind regards

Philippe
