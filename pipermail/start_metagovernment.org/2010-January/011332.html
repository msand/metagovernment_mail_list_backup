<PRE>I would like to add a few other things to the ones that were reported by Ed.

1) The Video
Some time ago Ed asked if anyone was interested in participating in a
challenge in preparing a 3min video on the topic Democracy is.
Details can be found here:
<A HREF="http://www.videochallenge.america.gov/about.html">http://www.videochallenge.america.gov/about.html</A>

The deadline is the end of January.
So I asked if anyone was interested, and so far it seemed that it was only
me and Ed.

SO I shared a dropbox ( <A HREF="https://www.dropbox.com">https://www.dropbox.com</A> ) folder with Ed. Dropbox is
an online service that will install a small program in your computer that
will keep a folder in your PC syncronised with a folder somwhere else.
Essentially now me and Ed will share this folder. Of course anyone who is
interested in participating should just let me know, and I will send the
invitation for him too. Dropbox folders have size limits (all together not
more than 2 GB, but I have many folders open), so please do not use it to
pass big files (i.e. big videos, movies, etc.). Anything bigger than 10 MB,
please ask me.
(@Ed, please look at the mindmap I made this morning, I think it has some
good ideas to start with)

2) The metagovernment page on Vilfredo
Also, I suggested that I should move the questions that concerned
Metagovernment in a separate room in Vilfredo, and was told to proceed. So
now the question that deal with Metagovernment are all to be found in
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>

3) The question: What CMS should Metagovernment use?
Following the agreed answer at Fabe's question: &quot;Should Metagovernment
transition from a wiki to candiwi?&quot;, I started a new question
What CMS should Metagovernment use?
You can find it here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=83&amp;room=Metagovernment</A>

I tried to send an invitation to everybody, but if it did not reach you.
Please bear with me, and just participate nevertheless.

I think this is a very important question because by answering this we are
defining the format of our community. Please DO participate. It is only by
having the widest possible participation inside the community that the
answer will truly reflect this community.


Personally I really enjoyed the meeting. It was the most colorful meeting I
have ever participated :-). And I think we had a lot of work done. I am
looking forward to more meetings like this in future. Kudos to Manuel for
suggesting the tool

Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. by the way, I chatted with Aur who could not participate, but sent his
greetings.
