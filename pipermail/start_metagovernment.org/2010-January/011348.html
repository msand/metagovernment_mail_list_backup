<PRE>Pietro Speroni di Fenizio a &#233;crit , Le 27/01/2010 13:35:
&gt;<i> You mean you are not going voting, because there were multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> elections in the US where the program was not open source. And yes 
</I>&gt;<i> that was heavily criticised and rightly so. I agree that it should not 
</I>&gt;<i> have been done. But I still think I would have gone voting.
</I>
People are voting with proprietary software in USA (and France) because 
they are not informed, they are naturally trusting new technologies 
providing by government (and others). But with internet expansion and 
the large diffusion of informations, I hope that this state of things 
will soon change.
Something that gives me hope is the rollover of the vaccination campaign 
against the H1N1 in France; less than 30% of the people asks for the 
vaccine though the huge tv and magazine campaign in the vaccination 
favor. Internet has effectively playing its role spreading informations 
to the people.

&gt;<i> You also mean that you avoided participating to the brainstorming 
</I>&gt;<i> session that Obama did when he asked people to comment about 
</I>&gt;<i> e-government using Mixed Ink? because it was using Mixed Ink?
</I>
if this is just for a brainstorming and doesn't lead to a public 
decision for execution, I think I should participate.

&gt;<i> And I suppose you also will not have posted a question to the 
</I>&gt;<i> president of the united states, because the venue that was chosen was 
</I>&gt;<i> YouTube? After all YouTube is not open source.
</I>
same as above

&gt;<i> it is ok to criticize, and to change things that do not work. But 
</I>&gt;<i> refusing to use anything which is not pure will lead you to paralysis.
</I>
the paralysis is already here and only utopists think that everlasting 
compromise with the actual system could change something.

&gt;<i> Please, don't leave this list.
</I>
thanks :)

&gt;<i> But as I invite you to stay here, I also invite you to be a bit more 
</I>&gt;<i> flexible.
</I>
I can be flexible Pietro, but sometimes radicality is necessary to get 
out of this actual democratic mascarade...
FOSS for e-dem is as necessary as a keel for the boat, a fin for the 
plane or the brakes for the car... in a word it is &quot;not negotiable&quot;.
And if this is not obvious for you, we should stop here this discussion.

Kind regards

Philippe
