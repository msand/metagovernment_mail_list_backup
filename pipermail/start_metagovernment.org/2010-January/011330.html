<PRE>Nine people attended today's meeting. You can see the transcript and  
work-product here:
<A HREF="http://piratepad.net/fiuASvRqss">http://piratepad.net/fiuASvRqss</A>

In terms of the agenda, I think the general lesson was that we waited  
far too long between meetings. So we didn't get very far through the  
listed items. Instead, we realized that more frequent meetings would  
be more productive. We'll try every two weeks and see how that goes  
(I'll send another e-mail about that).

Among actionable items we did resolve, the most significant was the  
proposal that we start a blog for announcements, updates from  
individual projects, news about e-democracy, and perhaps opinion  
articles. Even though Jackie wasn't there, she was nominated to do it,  
assuming she would be interested. I contacted her and she does seem  
interested in getting it rolling. The important thing is that it's not  
me who does it, so we can have some more distribution of administration.

The plan is to host the blog on a non-profit service for FOSS  
projects, such as: <A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/about">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/about</A> and to have more  
than one person be the admin. If it works well for the blog, maybe we  
can migrate the wiki and perhaps other services. Individual projects  
might want to migrate there as well. We'll see how it goes. The  
proposed blog software is WordPress.

Separately, Thomas volunteered to do some translation of the wiki (at  
least the Main Page) into German. Others are welcome and encouraged to  
make other translations.

There is more you can see in the transcript, but overall I think we  
got somewhat bogged down by the size of the agenda. I'm going to  
propose that for the next meeting we limit people to adding a maximum  
of one item to the agenda... or that we only have 1-3 agenda items  
total. If we have biweekly meetings, the latter should be reasonable.

The venue was pretty good, and I think everyone was happy with the  
capabilities PiratePad provides.
