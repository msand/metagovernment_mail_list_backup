<PRE>Replying to Ed (verification) and Pietro (forking);
also mooting the idea of register mirroring (bottom):

</I>
You mention trust levels and sock puppets.  Both come together in the
registration lists.  Registration lists are what the voting engines
see, so the crucial thing is to ensure they're correct.  I added a use
case for this, with example data from the live trustserver:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Verification_of_registration_lists">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Verification_of_registration_lists</A>

There should be no way for an administrator to tamper with that data.
Can anyone see a loophole?  We should be able to prototype most of the
verification stuff, within a week or two.  It's part of the prototype
design.

&gt;<i> If however the admin's actions had to be duplicated by three other
</I>&gt;<i> geographically disparate admins, then the chance of any kind of tampering is
</I>&gt;<i> extremely low.
</I>
This is essentially what the watchdog/verifiers do.  They duplicate -
both data and procedures.  It should be possible for any technically
inclined user to verify an entire voter register on her own, in this
way.

&gt;<i> Again, I understand that distributed redundant systems are no easy task,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is something to at least keep in mind. I am not sure if these operate
</I>&gt;<i> on the same principle, but I *think* the root nameservers are set up in a
</I>&gt;<i> similar way:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nameserver</A>
</I>
They designed the Internet to be highly robust.  (You probably know,
ARPA was a military outfit.)  I guess e-democracy has to be robust,
too.  Redundancy is a big part of that (I agree).

</I>
Hopefully it won't be possible for anything like that to happen within
the e-dem infrastructure.  All essential services must be fork-able.
Even if a fork isn't popular at first, it must be viable.  For the
most part, I think the design of the prototype ensures this.

An idea: we might improve fork-ability by enabling a form of register
mirroring.  It would have use cases similar to vote mirroring:
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Use_cases">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Use_cases</A>
But instead of users free-ranging across voting engines, they would
free-range across competing streetwikis and voter registers.  (If this
is a good idea, I think we can probably prototype it in a few weeks.)
