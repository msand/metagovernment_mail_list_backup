Yes, as far as I understand, Vilfredo is very unique among the other 
voting-tools. But I think, that some of the information users give to 
Vilfredo can be mirrored into other tools. At the very least the last 
vote each user casts in a certain question before a new generation has 
started. If he doesnt participate in the new generation then its an open 
question, wether he gave up to convince the others or was convinced 
himself by the majority of the others.

If I understand Vilfredo right, this is actually an interesting question 
for every user. Does the result reflect the majority now or is it just a 
measure of the patience of the users to convince the others, i.e. their 
felt importance of the debate?
Maybe this question could be answered by the users, if you add an option 
like: &quot;I still stay with my last vote, but dont participate any longer.&quot;

In that case even the votes from former generations could be exported.

&gt;<i> Still I see more problems coming out. For example, the pareto front
</I>&gt;<i> works perfectly well both if you use binary voting (support/ignore) a
</I>&gt;<i> three votes (YES, maybe, NO), n-values ranking, complete ranking, and
</I>&gt;<i> so on. In fact it is such a general concept that, provided that in
</I>&gt;<i> each generation a user only votes using one system, Vilfredo could
</I>&gt;<i> cope with that too.
</I>
Mirroring votes is just a way of translating. Each mirroring engine has 
to decide, how he tanslates something. This can be done well or not well 
(then it will be critiqued for the bad job). If you want to translate a 
ranked voting (-10 to +10) into a binary, information will be lost. But 
it is still a valid information to tanslate the +10 votes into a &quot;Yes&quot;. 
I would even say all votes from +1 to +10 are translatable to &quot;Yes&quot;.

&gt;<i> What would you do about the rooms? The room existence in private. you
</I>&gt;<i> might be aware of some rooms, but in general the rooms are there to
</I>&gt;<i> let people have a place to discuss things in private. If I were to let
</I>&gt;<i> an external entity know about what rooms are active, the whole privacy
</I>&gt;<i> issue would be gone.
</I>
One way could be to only allow public rooms to mirror. Another could be, 
that in a private poll the mirroring engine also only allows the same 
users to participate.

Greetings,
Thomas
