</I>&gt;<i>  You mean you are not going voting, because there were multiple elections
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the US where the program was not open source. And yes that was heavily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> criticised and rightly so. I agree that it should not have been done. But I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> still think I would have gone voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People are voting with proprietary software in USA (and France) because
</I>&gt;<i> they are not informed, they are naturally trusting new technologies
</I>&gt;<i> providing by government (and others). But with internet expansion and the
</I>&gt;<i> large diffusion of informations, I hope that this state of things will soon
</I>&gt;<i> change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Do they have a choice? If you go to vote, and there is a machine, can you
ask to vote instead on a paper ballot?
I don't think you can, and I think the only other option is not to vote,
which in my opinion is even worse.


&gt;<i> Something that gives me hope is the rollover of the vaccination campaign
</I>&gt;<i> against the H1N1 in France; less than 30% of the people asks for the vaccine
</I>&gt;<i> though the huge tv and magazine campaign in the vaccination favor. Internet
</I>&gt;<i> has effectively playing its role spreading informations to the people
</I>

Agreed, but there they had the choice.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  You also mean that you avoided participating to the brainstorming session
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that Obama did when he asked people to comment about e-government using
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mixed Ink? because it was using Mixed Ink?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if this is just for a brainstorming and doesn't lead to a public decision
</I>&gt;<i> for execution, I think I should participate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people possible to
test things out.
For a long time most of the e-gov will just be for brainstorming. Reason
being that in most countries anything else would require to change the
constitution. Which is generally a long and laborious process (rightly so).


&gt;<i>  it is ok to criticize, and to change things that do not work. But refusing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to use anything which is not pure will lead you to paralysis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the paralysis is already here and only utopists think that everlasting
</I>&gt;<i> compromise with the actual system could change something.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name calling
into the actual discussion, sir.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Please, don't leave this list.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  But as I invite you to stay here, I also invite you to be a bit more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can be flexible Pietro, but sometimes radicality is necessary to get out
</I>&gt;<i> of this actual democratic mascarade...
</I>&gt;<i> FOSS for e-dem is as necessary as a keel for the boat, a fin for the plane
</I>&gt;<i> or the brakes for the car... in a word it is &quot;not negotiable&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And if this is not obvious for you, we should stop here this discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I understand that something is for you un-negotiable.
And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not obvious
for me.

&gt;<i>From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are FOSS, I
</I>recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects that are not so.
And I have seen in many cases proprietary software being the first software
to produce a product, just to have to compete later with an open source
alternative. I think of microsoft word, I think of mind manager (mind map
software that predated freemind), and I believe there are many other
examples out there.
Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a project.
Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the open world.

The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a scientist. I
publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the corporate world,
the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, ... ) using my results.
I speak with everybody, and I will tell to everybody how things are. Because
my commitment is toward the truth.

Now you said that if something was not obvious to me, you would stop here
this discussion, and before you threatened to go.

Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not change idea,
because if not you will leave or will not speak with me.
I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the possibility
of any member to join our team.
And decide case by case what is appropriate to do.

Pietro
