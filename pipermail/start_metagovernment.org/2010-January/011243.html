<PRE>Thanks,
I can see how this can help in some cases to permit to people to set
up try better voting engines.


I still have doubts. For example in Vilfredo you don't vote for things
once and for all,
you vote on them, and revote, and revote. And each time you refine.
Sometimes the same user votes for something in one generation, and
then ignores it in another generation. And all this is part of the
process that sends implicit feedback to the other users.

I don't see how in this system it would work to have it all mirrored.
But maybe the idea would be to mirror between different forks of
vilfredo. All having the same basic genetic algorithm procedure.

Still I see more problems coming out. For example, the pareto front
works perfectly well both if you use binary voting (support/ignore) a
three votes (YES, maybe, NO), n-values ranking, complete ranking, and
so on. In fact it is such a general concept that, provided that in
each generation a user only votes using one system, Vilfredo could
cope with that too. What is more of a problem, is how do you handle
the unfairness of all this.

I mean, some people would be allowed to rank things in n ways, other
in only 2 ways.

Of course the first are doing more work, so it seems fair. The problem
comes with the size of the pareto front. The more different ranking
the user use (n-rank system versus m rank system, with n&gt;&gt;m), the more
the pareto front will remain expanded.

This can be unpleasent in terms of the other users. They have accepted
to cut their desires with an axe, and now they have to accepts the
whims of someone who would rather &quot;see this, than that, but not as
much as the other one...&quot; and so on.

So probably a question will have to come with its rules, so maybe it
would make more sense to mirror the question, and then have each
system cope with that.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Thomas says Vilfredo can probably be mirrored in Votorola. &#160;He's also
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;been chasing down some of the privacy problems. &#160;He may be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;answer your concerns.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why would you want to mirror the whole site?

What would you do about the rooms? The room existence in private. you
might be aware of some rooms, but in general the rooms are there to
let people have a place to discuss things in private. If I were to let
an external entity know about what rooms are active, the whole privacy
issue would be gone.

and finally, I remain that you should not scrape the html site. If not
for any other reason because I don't want to be responsible for
breaking things downstream because I am working on the UI. In case you
set up a an XML page. With a URL that include the room name. If you
send me the PHP code for the XML page, I can test it. But don't expect
from Vilfredo any form of UI consistency for a long time. We are
testing things out.

&gt;<i> Acknowledgements (I should have mentioned earlier):
</I>&gt;<i> Autocast vote mirroring is Thomas von der Elbe's invention. &#160;The rapid
</I>&gt;<i> prototyping idea came out of discussions with Thomas and David Bovill.
</I>&gt;<i> The underlying architecture (registration and vote mirroring) was
</I>&gt;<i> reviewed and critiqued last month by Friedrich Lindenberg, Martin
</I>&gt;<i> H&#228;cker, David Bovill, Andreas Nitsche and Thomas von der Elbe. &#160;Kai
</I>&gt;<i> Londenberg and Fred Gohlke also contributed to the discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Replying to Ed, Pietro and Owen,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed Pastore wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Michael, I am not sure that the geographical registration should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> outsourced from the individual systems (ie, sections 1a &amp; 1b1). Some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems such as Candiwi and (at least for now) Vilfredo, are deliberately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignorant of geography.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The coders/admins may ignore the registration property of &quot;primary
</I>&gt;<i> residence&quot;. Global tallies of results need not filter on that
</I>&gt;<i> property, in any case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They may still be interested in &quot;residential trust level&quot;, which is
</I>&gt;<i> another property of the residential register. &#160;It assures that the
</I>&gt;<i> user is not a sock puppet. &#160;It's a universal assurance, so it's
</I>&gt;<i> especially useful in the less localized polls (national, global). &#160;But
</I>&gt;<i> it requires a special type of register (mutually tight):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor#List_chaining">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor#List_chaining</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There may be other types of mutually-tight registers (aside from
</I>&gt;<i> trust-based residential). &#160;If so, we can run them side by side.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In my perspective of governance, anyone who cares enough to participate in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an issue is a stakeholder in that issue and should have a voice. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clearly demonstrated in issues such as environmental pollution or water
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use, where the actions of one geographic jurisdiction can have substantial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effects on people far away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's a use case we didn't document. &#160;I've added it here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Free_expression">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Free_expression</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the same token:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Personal_vote_filtering">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Personal_vote_filtering</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Owen says, &quot;Clearly, geography should not be deemed to be part of
</I>&gt;<i> the essential attribution of individuals but should be available for
</I>&gt;<i> usage when and where appropriate.&quot; &#160;With personal vote filtering, the
</I>&gt;<i> user decides when and where.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or if the intention is to simply link users to geography in order to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> develop a unique identifier...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not for personal identification. &#160;The properties (residence, trust
</I>&gt;<i> level) are merely associated with one's personal identifier. &#160;The
</I>&gt;<i> purpose of the register is to make that association. &#160;Different
</I>&gt;<i> registers will associate different types of property - residential,
</I>&gt;<i> group membership, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Could the below system work with the geographic unit severed (or made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> internal to each system), or is that the basis of the rest?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use of internal registers is OK. &#160;Use of external registers (including
</I>&gt;<i> residential) is always optional. &#160;Each voting engine makes its own
</I>&gt;<i> choices. &#160;You can mix and match registers (and thus property types) in
</I>&gt;<i> any combination.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've done some tests. &#160;I think it will work. &#160;Streetservers (S) can
</I>&gt;<i> pull trust edges from the wiki (who trusts whom) using a query:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Special:Ask/-5B-5BUser:%2B-5D-5D-5B-5BTrust::%2B-5D-5D/-3FTrust/format%3Dcsv">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Special:Ask/-5B-5BUser:%2B-5D-5D-5B-5BTrust::%2B-5D-5D/-3FTrust/format%3Dcsv</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To push the calculated trust data back to the wiki (problems A and B,
</I>&gt;<i> previous post) the streetserver uploads the data to a single page of
</I>&gt;<i> the wiki. &#160;Wiki users cannot edit this page:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/w/index.php?title=Okidoke:Trust_in&amp;action=edit">http://okidoke.referata.com/w/index.php?title=Okidoke:Trust_in&amp;action=edit</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Trust levels of users are then visible throughout the wiki:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Volunteer administrators/registrars can do the wiki setup for their
</I>&gt;<i> hometowns (one wiki per town). &#160;Then users can start registering
</I>&gt;<i> locally. &#160;Once registered and trusted, they can free-range and vote in
</I>&gt;<i> tight polls (no sock puppets) anywhere in the world. &#160;They can elect
</I>&gt;<i> registrars and other admins, and vote up other e-dem stuff. &#160;(It's
</I>&gt;<i> just a hack. &#160;The streetwikis will probably bog down if just 10,000
</I>&gt;<i> people register. &#160;Voting engines may be overloaded by then, too.)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few things:
