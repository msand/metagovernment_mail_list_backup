<PRE>Hi! I answering between lines...

For example, <A HREF="http://www.fengoffice.com.">http://www.fengoffice.com.</A> They host OpenGoo for you, for a
fee. This software (a 2.0 office, like Google Docs, etc.) is open source,
you could use it without paying if you have a server and can install it
there. As companies don't want complications doing this stuff and desire
support, they hire a third party. Meanwhile, FengOffice is the main
developer of OpenGoo.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux comes to my mind, too.

There are two model organizations we could use together for this approach. I
&gt;<i> have not researched either one extensively, but they each handle one side of
</I>&gt;<i> the equation with an open approach:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> E Text Editor, the open company. [...]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>MyFootballClub.
&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> If these two approaches are combined, one can imagine a company where
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can be an &quot;owner&quot; and anyone can be an &quot;employee.&quot; Wow. The more I
</I>&gt;<i> think about this, the more my head spins. A company completely defined by
</I>&gt;<i> the amorphous community of people who feel like contributing to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This concept exists. When employees are also owners, the organization is a
cooperative (like gcoop &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gcoop.com.ar/en/home">http://www.gcoop.com.ar/en/home</A>&gt;). Collaborative
governance must be very natural to them. I sustain that it could be useful
(generate value) even though employees aren't owners.

We could charge owners if we host the decision making plataform that
employees use. It's compatible with owners: they keep owning and giving
general orders. It's unnatural to them: employees behave democratically to
find the best way to work down those orders. If this really generates more
profit than the vertical structure, owners will buy our free software
product/service.

With a strategy like this one, we are able to take a loan.
