&gt;<i> Do they have a choice? If you go to vote, and there is a machine, can 
</I>&gt;<i> you ask to vote instead on a paper ballot?
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think you can, and I think the only other option is not to 
</I>&gt;<i> vote, which in my opinion is even worse
</I>
ok this a matter of opinion :)

&gt;<i> Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people 
</I>&gt;<i> possible to test things out. For a long time most of the e-gov will 
</I>&gt;<i> just be for brainstorming. Reason being that in most countries 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else would require to change the constitution. Which is 
</I>&gt;<i> generally a long and laborious process (rightly so).
</I>
yes of course.

&gt;<i> First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name 
</I>&gt;<i> calling into the actual discussion, sir.
</I>
I apologize if you feel offensed, it was a rhetoric tweezers that would 
help you feeling to be not concerned by my caricatural meanings.
I will stop this really.

&gt;<i> I understand that something is for you un-negotiable.
</I>&gt;<i> And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not 
</I>&gt;<i> obvious for me.
</I>
like me : generally, this doesn't mean always.

&gt;<i> From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are 
</I>&gt;<i> FOSS, I recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects 
</I>&gt;<i> that are not so. And I have seen in many cases proprietary software 
</I>&gt;<i> being the first software to produce a product, just to have to compete 
</I>&gt;<i> later with an open source alternative. I think of microsoft word, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think of mind manager (mind map software that predated freemind), and 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe there are many other examples out there.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a 
</I>&gt;<i> project. Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the 
</I>&gt;<i> open world.
</I>
ok your point of view, extensive debate...

&gt;<i> The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a scientist. 
</I>&gt;<i> I publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the 
</I>&gt;<i> corporate world, the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, 
</I>&gt;<i> ... ) using my results. I speak with everybody, and I will tell to 
</I>&gt;<i> everybody how things are. Because my commitment is toward the truth.
</I>
good ! wouldn't this be the basis of human relation ?

&gt;<i> Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not change 
</I>&gt;<i> idea, because if not you will leave or will not speak with me.
</I>
just this discussion Pietro, don't we have already reach the consensus 
that each of us will not compromise ?
I would like of course speak with you on other subject.

&gt;<i> I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility of any member to join our team.
</I>&gt;<i> And decide case by case what is appropriate to do.
</I>
Case by case !? naturally not, I'm just defending the simple but 
essential idea that FOSS is the first prerequisite for e-dem software 
development. You will surely not find me to argue like this on the fact 
that we should rather use a blog or a wiki or something else for 
metagovernment.org...
Please don't forget that we are anyway discussing on a major grounding 
of software e-dem : transparency, and by consequence if we should 
radicalize metagovernment.org in order to fit the tuxfamily.org 
requirements.
If I'm alone to defend this radicalization, ok I will wait and as you 
said one time FOSS will win :) (I hope so).

kind regards

Philippe
