<PRE>&gt;<i> Sorry to not be naive Pietro, but in term of software, I only trust the
</I>&gt;<i> code that I can read and I must be sure that this code in which I can trust
</I>&gt;<i> will always be able to be reviewed by anyone who wants to do it. In
</I>&gt;<i> addition, as a citizen, I will never use a e-dem software that is not a
</I>&gt;<i> FOSS, democracy is too important and should'nt give a little chance for a
</I>&gt;<i> malicious person to inject malicious code in a software and ruins the goal
</I>&gt;<i> that the software pretends to reach.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>You mean you are not going voting, because there were multiple elections in
the US where the program was not open source. And yes that was heavily
criticised and rightly so. I agree that it should not have been done. But I
still think I would have gone voting.

You also mean that you avoided participating to the brainstorming session
that Obama did when he asked people to comment about e-government using
Mixed Ink? because it was using Mixed Ink?

And I suppose you also will not have posted a question to the president of
the united states, because the venue that was chosen was YouTube? After all
YouTube is not open source.

it is ok to criticize, and to change things that do not work. But refusing
to use anything which is not pure will lead you to paralysis.

Please, don't leave this list.
But as I invite you to stay here, I also invite you to be a bit more
flexible.


Pietro
