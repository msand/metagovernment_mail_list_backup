Hey, that is wonderful!
You did already help a lot, just by writing this message!

So now we can say, Telematics Freedom Foundation, World Parliament 
Experiment, Vote World Parliament and Votorola agree on the plan of 
connecting into a network. Adhocracy has shown interest and Vilfredo has 
shown openness. This is great!

Ed seems to like the idea too. Now I am really interested in the opinion 
of the Candiwi developers. What do you think?

Giovani, I am a Project Manager too and I think, what we can do, is to 
more deeply understand and discuss the possibilities and requirements of 
such an open architecture and to communicate it to other projects and 
people. Mikes and my thoughts are basically these:

<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture</A>

What do you think?

Actually we, i.e. all the concerned projects, could start to use our own 
tools to vote and find consensus about these common standards. Maybe we 
have a prototype-hack of the network itself soon, otherwise we can do it 
in parallel in the different tools. We already started a poll about the 
registration framework in Votorola. It has only one real Position (Mike) 
but I vote for it and there are a few test-voters mirrored from the 
NationBuilder tools:

Does anyone know of related polls somewhere else?

Kind regards,
Thomas
