That's very interesting. My suggestion would be to make a jigsaw of
existing process.

The first step should be to map all the existing tool, and see each of
them what is it good for.

Example:
Vilfredo:
strong side: let you ask open questions, and is very strong in letting
people look for a consensus. No position gets overlooked.
weak side: requires constant participations, can be boring, and does
not work on closed questions or to find the majority.


On the other side it is improbable that Vilfredo will become a full
website for a community to self govern in the near future. I would
need the specifications of the community to know how to program that.
It is more like one of the tools. Like the steering wheel in the car.
You still need the rest.
What I can easily do is to add an xml file from each room, so people
can get in rss format info of what is going on in the room they look
at. This should be enough to integrate that room inside any e-gov
website.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In such a large-scale use-case it seems to make at least some sense, to let
</I>&gt;<i> each user choose, which software to use. Especially because there are
</I>&gt;<i> actually really different ones, which still address the same use-cases.
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola and Candiwi are very much alike compared to Liquid Feedback for
</I>&gt;<i> example. But Votorola and Liquid Feedback have unlike Vilfredo exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> same use-cases.
</I>&gt;<i> And also I dont think, there is a way to prevent users to start voting on
</I>&gt;<i> the same issue, but using a different tool. If just in the case, that they
</I>&gt;<i> dont know of each other yet, voting on some global issue.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Sometimes misunderstanding a word can give little problems,
sometimes you might map something into a totally different semantic meaning.

I suspect you will not be able to get this to work when you try to
mirror Vilfredo, but you are welcome to try. At least you will show
how our approach is effectively original.

Honestly, you have taken up a challenge that I would not touch with a
pole. Your battle.

For me, what I can say is that you are welcome to get info out of
Vilfredo, as long as you do not require me to change Vilfredo because
of that. Information from outside will not be mirrored inside because
it would be easy to set up an automating voting tool, and as a result
stall Vilfredo.

What I expect that we should eventually have are ways to import open
questions from the outside. But voting should strictly be done via the
website. Unless someone shows me a way to permit external voting
without permitting automatic voting.

Cheers,
Pietro
