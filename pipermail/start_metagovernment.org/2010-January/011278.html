<PRE>An update on progress: we're just getting started on streetwikis.
(Unfortunately, there's nothing here for users yet.  It's all just
wires sticking out.)

  1. What's new
  2. Problem (request for tech help)
  3. What else is needed

Overall, we're at step 1 (we're doing these steps out of order):
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Rapid_prototyping">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Rapid_prototyping</A>

1. What's new
-------------
We have a partial implementation of visible containment (can't think
of better name for it).  It relates to residence.  Here's an example,
from the testbed wiki:

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Joe">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Joe</A>

Joe has a trust level of 1.  His vote probably counts on some engines.
But there's a warning on his user page, because he hasn't actually
told us where he lives.  Note his &quot;Primary residence&quot; is blank.
Here's a better example:

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Sock_puppet">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Sock_puppet</A>

This guy *has* told us where he lives, but the street is apparently
bogus.  It isn't referenced as visible/known from any of the
neighbourhood pages:

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Nowhere_Street">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Nowhere_Street</A>

But that's all OK.  The trust network will deal with it.  Both user
pages have visible warnings, and both are listed as problematic:

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Property:Invisible_placement">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Property:Invisible_placement</A>

2. Problem
----------
The real problem is improper containment.  Here's an example: these
two guys are supposedly OK (no warnings):

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Michael_Allan">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Michael_Allan</A>
  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Test">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Test</A>

It's not obvious that something is wrong, but user Test's whole street
is contained in my apartment:

  <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/My_Street/108/Basement">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/My_Street/108/Basement</A>

Most users aren't going to inspect dwellings, looking for improper
containments.  So we need to auto-detect them.  Possible solutions:

  i) When back-tracing containment in template IP, ensure that
     subpages are contained only in their proper parent pages (p/q/r
     in p/q), and top-level pages are contained only in other
     top-levels (p in q, not in q/r) else raise &quot;invisible
     containment&quot; alarm: <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Template:IP">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Template:IP</A>

 ii) Show occupany counts at street level (of each building), and
     corridor level (of each apartment/flat), and so forth.  Can this
     be done in a tamper-proof way?  Can this be done without bringing
     the wiki-server to its knees?

iii) If all else fails, we can trace containment on the trustserver.
     The tree of visible containment is logically a trust network,
     rooted in the top level page (whole city).  The trustserver can
     easily trace that.  (But the I/O between server and wiki is an
     ugly hack, and we don't want to depend on it more than
     necessary.)

Or is there a better way?  (I'm leaving this aside for now.)

3. What else is needed
----------------------

 * Backtracing of trust in the wiki.  So, if there's a problem, you
   can navigate toward the root of the network, closer to registrars
   and admin, where the ultimate responsiblity lies.

 * Range restrictions for trust extension.  So everything's kept
   localized, where it can be moderated by ordinary social
   constraints.

   (etc., there's a dozen minor technical things)

 * Look and feel - making the streets look like streets - making it
   all more-or-less useable.

 * Setting up the first real streetwikis (hopefully by next week) and
   getting the trustserver(s) to serve them.

 * Drafting do-it-yourself instructions.  Hopefully it takes no more
   than an hour for an ordinary user to create a streetwiki for his
   hometown - basically by importing (copying) from another town's.

If all goes well (?), we might have a streetwiki that's more-or-less
usable (?), by the end of next week (a week longer than expected).
