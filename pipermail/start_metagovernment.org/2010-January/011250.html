This sounds different from what I had originally thought the project  
was trying to achieve. I think where Pietro and I are both getting  
lost is in the need for having the same issue voted on by multiple  
engines.

That may be necessary in large-scale implementations, but if we take  
the more patient approach of trying to get adopted first in very small  
communities, then it becomes unnecessary to allow multiple voting  
systems on the same issue (doesn't it?).

For example, a small nonprofit wishing to organize themselves using  
our softwares might want to use Candiwi to draft their bylaws,  
Vilfredo to develop ideas, and Votorola to make formal decisions. They  
would benefit greatly from having user portability between the engines  
(including a trust metric and user-tags)... but I don't think they  
would want to encourage people to vote in any engine on any issue. The  
different engines have different applications (in this example, at  
least), and need not directly overlap on any singular issue.
