<PRE><A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Progress">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Progress</A>
An update on progress (plus reply to Ed):

We now have a trustserver running (prototype step 2).  Test users in a
wiki enter registration and trust data into their user pages, here for
example: <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Michael_Allan">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/User:Michael_Allan</A>

The calculated trust levels are then visible in other wiki pages, such
as this street page: <A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street</A>

More info on the trustserver is available here, along with its current
data: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/system/host/t/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/">http://zelea.com/system/host/t/home/v/votorola/out/votrace/</A>

So altogether, we now have running code for (2,4,5).  Next we need to
hack together 1 and 3.  If all goes well, it might take two weeks.
Again, the prototype steps are:

  1. Users set up a federation of semantic register-wikis
     (streetwikis)

  2. Separate servers (trustservers) compile the registration lists
     and post them to the Web as flat files

  3. Voting engines read the registration lists and compile their
     voter lists

  4. Vote data of each engine are likewise posted as flat files

  5. Other engines read the vote data and image the votes

         ^  |   / \   |   /

         v  | /     \ | /
            |/       \|/
    2      (T)       (T)      trustservers
             \       /
         |    \     /
         v     \   /
                \ /
  3,4,5        ((V))          voting engines
                / \
         ^     /   \
         |    /     \
             /       \
           (R)       (R)      other voter registers


The trustservers are simple affairs (easy to set up).  The streetwikis
are more labour intensive, but the work can be distributed out to the
users.  Once the first wiki is up and running, as an example, then the
residential register (1,2) should be able to self-deploy.  The
residential register provides:

  a) Universally tight registration list - no sock puppets

  b) Identifier correlation for free-ranging across all voting engines

Logically, we need both (a) and (b) in order to vote on issues of
e-democracy itself, such as architectural designs, administration of
the common infrastructure and boundary disputes.  We can't corral the
users into a single brand of voting engine for that purpose, they
won't go.  At the same time, if we give the users a free choice of
tools, plus real stuff to vote on, then the overall e-democracy
project becomes more attractive.  (It looks like Jim Gilliam was right
about this, and I was wrong.  The crucial thing is to be attractive to
the users, up front.)

It's still needed, I think.  The reasons aren't obvious, at first.
One reason: where two small communities join in a vote on a common
issue, they often need both (a) and (b).  They usually need (a) in
order to filter out the accidental sock puppets that come from having
some voters who are members of both communities.  They do this by
intersecting their combined voter list with the larger, tight list.
They only need (b), I guess, when the other community is using a
different engine design.  Then vote mirroring allows the results to
play out across both engines.

More generally, there is probably no practical way for groups to
enforce a choice of voting tools on their members.  Small groups will
often share voting facilities with larger ones.  They won't run their
own servers.  Mirroring will be built into the common infrastructure.
So the group may open a decision on tool (T), and may even favour the
use of T.  But there would be nothing to stop a member from casting
her vote on a different tool (U).  The issues would thereby be joined,
and the votes mirrored in both directions T&lt;--&gt;U.  Only a lock-down of
T (if warranted) could prevent that.
