<PRE>I'm a member of an Internet governance discussion list where a similar 
conversation came up a few months ago. As a result, I've become 
convinced that, if the question comes down to what kind of election has 
the most integrity, FOSS matters far less than using auditable (paper) 
ballots cast anonymously.  FOSS or not, the integrity of any online 
election is very much in question.

Since my goal with Indaba is to create a venue for open discussion and 
debate, rather than a mission-critical site for anonymous decision 
making, those kinds of concerns don't apply. Everyone using WeVote can 
check their own vote and can immediately see how everyone else voted. 
(It seems to me that WhiteHouse2 is structured like an open petition 
venue, and anonymity is less of a concern there as well.)

That said, from time to time I occasionally consider the possible 
benefits of refactoring what I've built so far within a FOSS structure. 
As it turns out, I don't see any incentives to do so. What little time I 
have for the project these days has to go into other, more promising 
efforts.
