I see; sorry... I have been traveling and working rather a lot recently.

However, I would like to take your answer a little further. The most  
secure way to prevent admin abuse is to have multiple redundant  
systems which checksum each other. This adds a substantial layer of  
complexity/difficulty to the architecture (and indeed, it probably  
could be skipped at the outset, as long as it is kept in mind during  
the initial stages), but it is the only way to reliably check abuse.

&gt;<i> Do you have a specific example of corruption?  We can try to document
</I>&gt;<i> it under the use cases.
</I>

I can think of so many that I don't know where to start. There are  
obvious ones, like an admin deleting a post they don't like, or  
changing a user's trust rating.

But then there are subtle things like an admin moving an issue they  
like to greater prominence, or authenticating a single sock puppet  
past the sock puppet controls. These latter sorts of things may not be  
caught for a long time, which is why relying on the &quot;crowd&quot; to police  
the admins isn't reliable. Sure, people could fork to a new engine...  
but only if they notice a reason to do so.

If however the admin's actions had to be duplicated by three other  
geographically disparate admins, then the chance of any kind of  
tampering is extremely low.

Again, I understand that distributed redundant systems are no easy  
task, but it is something to at least keep in mind. I am not sure if  
these operate on the same principle, but I *think* the root  
nameservers are set up in a similar way:
