<PRE>Hello,

I'm Philippe from Strasbourg France, Linux system administrator and 
PHP/Perl developper. I believed yesterday that I had found THE idea to 
give true democracy to earth people by the development of an ambitious 
software project. In fact a Web 2.0 application developped in an open 
source way, in a collaborative manner by all the people. The first 
reflex was to do a search about this idea and I've found the 
metagovernment.org. So here I'm, I have a lot of things to read :)
As you have probably understand my interest goes mainly to software 
development.
I can resist to mention what kind of idea cross my head...

My na&#239;ve vision of the thing was this kind of scheme :

1 - Official registered user can open any thread on specialized forums 
on any topics related to civil or military life.
2 - Discussions follows, a corum (to define) of users can decide after a 
time delay (to define) to formulate a recomandation from a topic.
3 - The recommandation is publicly evaluated by expert/specialists.
4 - The evaluated recommandation is submitted to the user definitive vote.
5 - The recommandation is abandonned, re-evaluated or adopted for execution

this kind of workflow :

1.idea  ---&gt; 2.recommandation ---&gt; 3.evaluation ---&gt; 4.vote --&gt; 
5.rejection or execution

I was also thinking of a system that would link this kind of workflow to 
a cititzen tax dispatching system :
the tax amount for a citizen is something due to the state, but the 
citizen decide where he wants to invest it's tax.

This is just ideas thrown away, I know that I have to learn all the 
things you've already done. I would be happy to contribute.

I'm really convince that there is no way for democracy to reach the 
truth outside of Internet. Time urge, they are considering to kill the 
legitimacy of internet (cf HADOPI law near to be ratified in France) all 
over the world to keep alive their democracy junk.

Best regards

Philippe
