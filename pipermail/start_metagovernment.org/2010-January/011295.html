<PRE>We had something similar happening in a forum I participate in.

I don't know if I told the story. The old forum broke down, and we, the old
crowd, decided we wanted now to make a new forum, where we could decide how
it would work. We discussed all the details, and also the name. Among us was
a new person, we did not know very well. Before we finished deciding he
bought the domain name, installed a standard forum, and invited everybody
in. Calling it &quot;our website&quot;. But he kept all control. When we discussed
this further, the community has already settled. It was starting to grow. We
tried to set up a concurrent community, but the community would only visit
it in the week-ends. And eventually it died.

It was a great lesson.

After some years this guy lost interest in the topic, so he defined a few
low level administrators to policy the system, went to live in Africa, and
we pretty much lost all tracks of him. The board remained there, with its
google adsense, request for donations when you sign in, and is now the top
forum in its topic.

Forking only makes sense if you have some really good novelty.

</I>&gt;<i> However, I would like to take your answer a little further. The most secure
</I>&gt;<i> way to prevent admin abuse is to have multiple redundant systems which
</I>&gt;<i> checksum each other. This adds a substantial layer of complexity/difficulty
</I>&gt;<i> to the architecture (and indeed, it probably could be skipped at the outset,
</I>&gt;<i> as long as it is kept in mind during the initial stages), but it is the only
</I>&gt;<i> way to reliably check abuse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Do you have a specific example of corruption?  We can try to document
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it under the use cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can think of so many that I don't know where to start. There are obvious
</I>&gt;<i> ones, like an admin deleting a post they don't like, or changing a user's
</I>&gt;<i> trust rating.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then there are subtle things like an admin moving an issue they like to
</I>&gt;<i> greater prominence, or authenticating a single sock puppet past the sock
</I>&gt;<i> puppet controls. These latter sorts of things may not be caught for a long
</I>&gt;<i> time, which is why relying on the &quot;crowd&quot; to police the admins isn't
</I>&gt;<i> reliable. Sure, people could fork to a new engine... but only if they notice
</I>&gt;<i> a reason to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If however the admin's actions had to be duplicated by three other
</I>&gt;<i> geographically disparate admins, then the chance of any kind of tampering is
</I>&gt;<i> extremely low.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I understand that distributed redundant systems are no easy task,
</I>&gt;<i> but it is something to at least keep in mind. I am not sure if these operate
</I>&gt;<i> on the same principle, but I *think* the root nameservers are set up in a
</I>&gt;<i> similar way:
