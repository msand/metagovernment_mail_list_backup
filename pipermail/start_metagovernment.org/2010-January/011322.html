<PRE>This is, by now, an old conversation. But, I am just now catching up
on all the recent metagov activity. Sorry for the late response!

I wanted to bring the group's attention to mysociety.org 's source of
funding -- useful because it's a halfway-successful model

<A HREF="http://www.mysociety.org/">http://www.mysociety.org/</A>

<A HREF="http://www.ukcod.org.uk/Structure">http://www.ukcod.org.uk/Structure</A>

They have a few paid developers and many volunteers, supported in part
by a commercial-web-development arm (builds and designs
democracy-related websites for government, BBC, etc).

If, for example, metagov raised funds in this manner, a particular
project such as VGtA might not bring a profit on its own, but the
group learns from it. Those within the group who take on commercial
software development jobs benefit from the collective knowledge of the
group and have access to the developers of sister projects, so each
(such as VGtA) adds to overall sustainability whether it brings in
cash or not.

To clarify, I am certainly not advocating that we adopt this type of
structure, nor that we raise funds by soliciting commercial
development jobs. But the example has given me some ideas.

</I>&gt;<i> Speaking from the Vilfredo point of view, the project was able to get
</I>&gt;<i> much better in the last months because I have a friend, a programmer,
</I>&gt;<i> who was in the particular situation that he had a lot of free time,

</I>&gt;<i> future. Of course if we could pay for the work of our programmers
</I>&gt;<i> (even part time) this would make a huge difference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand right now the work is also being carried out thanks

</I>&gt;<i> university time. I just asked for a grant to study the topic further.
</I>&gt;<i> I am also not allowed to be employed by anyone else while on my
</I>&gt;<i> university contract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As my research is part of a university research, the focus is
</I>&gt;<i> academic. We prove that things are true, mathematically. If we want to
</I>&gt;<i> show that a website is helping online discussion we need to employ a
</I>&gt;<i> psychologist that runs some tests over a group of people. This is
</I>&gt;<i> quite different from how the topic would be done if we were an
</I>&gt;<i> enterprise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a university I am expected to create open source code. To have a
</I>&gt;<i> prototype that shows the idea. Not to employ my time in smoothing off
</I>&gt;<i> the program too much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In all cases the program would not bring any money back. Not 10%,
</I>&gt;<i> nothing. This is the nature of university research. Nice solid
</I>&gt;<i> academic work that can be used as a foundation for anything. But no
</I>&gt;<i> monetary return. Of course if your investors would be interested in
</I>&gt;<i> funding some of this project it would be welcome. But would they be
</I>&gt;<i> happy with it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was mentioned that this money should help in developing a series of
</I>&gt;<i> different websites, interacting. This is something that could work
</I>&gt;<i> well for Vilfredo too. We have reached the conclusion already in
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo that there should be some API that let a different website
</I>&gt;<i> start an open question, receive the answers. All automatically. I
</I>&gt;<i> don't see this as being developed very soon from the University. But
</I>&gt;<i> maybe it could be the aim of this extra work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course we would have to look into the details of how could it be
</I>&gt;<i> done legally.
