<PRE>I'll just shoehorn in here that I think there need to be some real  
attempts at definition. There are now many words such as open  
government, government 2.0, and eDemocracy to name some popular ones,  
with very little consensus on what any of them mean.

I'll reiterate what I said on the originating thread, which is that  
there appear to be (at least) four distinct areas of focus:
1. Government data, transparency &amp; accessibility of services
2. Participation in government processes (bureaucratic)
3. Political processes, campaigns &amp; elections
4. Participation in government decision-making (legislative &amp; executive)

The term &quot;government 2.0&quot; usually seems to apply to only 1 &amp; 2 (though  
for some people only 1).

&quot;eDemocracy&quot; tends to refer most to 3, with 4 (sometimes) and 2  
(occasionally) included.

And fwiw, Metagovernment (our latest favored term is &quot;collaborative  
governance&quot;) is focused almost exclusively on 4, which tends to get  
overlooked most... particularly by politicians, who have a vested  
interest in shifting focus away from it.

And on a separate note, I'd like to emphasize that a US focus, while  
inevitable for US-based meetings, should be at least somewhat de- 
emphasized for two reasons. First, the most desperate need for  
openness is not in the federal government, where we see quite a lot  
already; but in local government, which is often completely opaque,  
inaccessible, and corrupt. Second, because the internet knows no  
boundaries. Instead of fighting the inevitable by trying to force web- 
based processes to obey geographic limits, we should be embracing the  
connectedness allowed by a global internet.

Note that these two points mesh nicely: instead of focusing on a  
single national government, if focus is placed on localities, the  
ideas are much more readily ported around the world.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I woke up this morning to three different threads regarding this  
</I>&gt;<i> year's open gov unconferences.  I'm actually in Melbourne from now  
</I>&gt;<i> until the end of May, working with Collabforge and diving into the  
</I>&gt;<i> Australian Open Gov scene (which is quite ripe! check out the Aus  
</I>&gt;<i> Fed's Gov 2.0 task force blog).  I'll be back just in time for PdF  
</I>&gt;<i> and the accompanying unconference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Apologies to those of you on multiple lists who will receive  
</I>&gt;<i> duplicates of this... And thanks Steven and Wayne for asking for my  
</I>&gt;<i> opinion :-) You got it.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Participation Camp did indeed piggyback on PdF, and this worked out  
</I>&gt;<i> quite well, even though I started things far too late to really  
</I>&gt;<i> integrate with PdF's plans.  One great moment was having Steven,  
</I>&gt;<i> Craig Newmark, and a bunch of other open gov heavies who were in  
</I>&gt;<i> town for PdF in on an excellent session by local open gov leader  
</I>&gt;<i> City Councilmember Gale Brewer and attended by many of NYC's most  
</I>&gt;<i> active on-the-ground open gov organizers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think piggybacking on Politics Online is a smart move, and the  
</I>&gt;<i> difference in focus should be seen as a strength rather than a  
</I>&gt;<i> weakness.  Those of us who organize the OpenNY forum (the OpenGovNYC  
</I>&gt;<i> meetup re-branded) were planning to repeat our PdF-piggybacking this  
</I>&gt;<i> year as well.  We recently heard from Micah and Andrew that PdF was  
</I>&gt;<i> already planning its own unconference, and from what I understand  
</I>&gt;<i> from a distance, we're figuring out right now how it all fits  
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm laying this all out because I think the overall lesson is that  
</I>&gt;<i> we ought to coordinate our efforts across all of these groups to  
</I>&gt;<i> provide an ongoing open gov narrative.  Think of it as a giant open  
</I>&gt;<i> space grid with the all of the the cities in the U.S. on the X axis,  
</I>&gt;<i> and the entire 2010 calendar on the Y axis (I've been pushing a  
</I>&gt;<i> similar vision for NY).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This was, in part, the rationale behind Participation Camp.  It was  
</I>&gt;<i> meant to build on Transparency Camp, and a Collaboration Camp was  
</I>&gt;<i> discussed for December but never happened.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To wrap, from what I can see in the threads, the highly-motivated  
</I>&gt;<i> band of open gov organizers on these lists is particularly focused  
</I>&gt;<i> on how to make *authentic citizen participation* a reality.   
</I>&gt;<i> Politics Online and Transparency Camp are focused, as they should  
</I>&gt;<i> be, on specific domains, but there's a need to focus on  
</I>&gt;<i> participation specifically.  Participation, I'd argue, is the &quot;hard  
</I>&gt;<i> problem&quot; of open government, and needs the most TLC to help it grow  
</I>&gt;<i> to maturity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need to find some way to build momentum through these camps and  
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate existing (fragmented) efforts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's my ten cents.  I have some ideas on what this might look  
</I>&gt;<i> like, but I've written enough :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> G'day!
</I>&gt;<i> Matt
