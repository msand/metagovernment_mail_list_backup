<PRE>The next meeting is proposed for February 6. (Or Feb 7, if that is  
more agreeable.)

The last two have been at 1700 GMT. That is evening in Europe and  
morning in the Americas. Unfortunately it is the middle of the night  
in Asia. Should we rotate the time? Or tweak it some? So far, 1700  
seems to work as well as can be expected given our distribution.

It seems that 90 minutes is the maximum reasonable amount of time for  
such a meeting, so I propose we shoot for 60 minutes and definitely  
stop by 90 minutes.

I made a new page on PiratePad, which seems to be a good venue. So how  
about having the meeting at:
<A HREF="http://piratepad.net/MBX8dXI4ry">http://piratepad.net/MBX8dXI4ry</A>

As for agenda items, I propose that we limit it to a couple items.  
What was brought up at the last meeting is that we need to focus more  
on creating solid, actionable objectives. We have great long-term  
visionary goals, but could use some more short-term, mundane  
objectives to get us to those long-term goals.

So you can start writing such objectives in the pad linked above right  
now, or coming up with them can be the agenda for the meeting.

Or... what do you think? All of the above is just my take; please feel  
free to improve.
