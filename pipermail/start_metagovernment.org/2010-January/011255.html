<PRE>Hello,

Yes, I like this use-case very much. And I too see the great benefit of 
the user portability.
If the others here agree too, that is something we could start working 
on right away - together. Mike is making good progress with the 
trustservers and streetwikis. And here in Germany there is also 
consensus about this with two other e-dem-projects (Adhocracy and Liquid 
Feedback).

</I>
Yes, I mean large-scale implementations.
Ed, here in Germany the whole e-dem-thing is really boiling. The 
Pirate-Party (12000 members only in Germany) is desperatly looking for a 
running software to make its internal desicions with it (and to later 
open it up to the whole public). Their only problem with it right now 
is, that there are 4-5 half-ready ones to choose from. I liked your 
patient approach with the chess-club-example very much, but at least 
here in Germany this patience is not necessary anymore.

In such a large-scale use-case it seems to make at least some sense, to 
let each user choose, which software to use. Especially because there 
are actually really different ones, which still address the same 
use-cases. Votorola and Candiwi are very much alike compared to Liquid 
Feedback for example. But Votorola and Liquid Feedback have unlike 
Vilfredo exactly the same use-cases.
And also I dont think, there is a way to prevent users to start voting 
on the same issue, but using a different tool. If just in the case, that 
they dont know of each other yet, voting on some global issue.

If you mean by &quot;everything&quot;, that no information is lost - then you are 
right. Some information will be lost in some translations (not in all). 
But why not take, what is possible? It would be like giving up to 
translate from Eskimos, just because they have more words for &quot;snow&quot; 
than we have. There is true information coming through in translating 
+10 to a &quot;Yes&quot;, isnt it?

Greetings,
Thomas
