<PRE>I think 12 hours are way too little.

On Vilfredo the minimum time for each phase where people have a chance to
participate in 3 days. And those are 3 days in which I constantly nag people
to go and contribute.

An effort that I find probably as annoying as being on the receiving end.

But I think we are realizing that one of the limits of online democracy is
that people need to actually do something. And in a small group, like we
are, when the participation cost is high (not just a vote, but a creative
comment, an essay, a proposal, ...). Well when all those things are present
the percentage of people who participate are often extremly low, and always
too low.


So giving to people more time, and even avoiding to move on until at least
enough people have turned up to vote seem to be the most sensible thing to
do at this time.

Yes, there is an element of subjectivity in all this. And I would welcome a
different procedure.

But suppose this:
we make a request on Vilfredo or Candiwi. And the request is something that
should have effect for the whole community. No one turns up to vote, but
only one or two people.
Then the request passes, and now everybody should follow it.

And then people, time after, protest: &quot;Hey, I don't agree with that...&quot;.
As Ed correctly pointed out: what does consensus mean in among an open group
of people.

So, I would definitely would suggest that you keep it up for editing for at
least 3 days. If not even, 3 days after the last edit.

And in the meantime, may I nag people about the question on the CMS?

So far we have 6 proposals from 4 people. Please if you did not write your
proposal, do it NOW. It will only take you a second. And your idea will help
shape the website(s) on which metagovernment should use in the future.
