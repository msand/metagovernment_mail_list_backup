</I>&gt;<i> Yes, as far as I understand, Vilfredo is very unique among the other

</I>&gt;<i> If he doesnt participate in the new generation then its an open question,
</I>&gt;<i> wether he gave up to convince the others or was convinced himself by the
</I>&gt;<i> majority of the others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I understand Vilfredo right, this is actually an interesting question for
</I>&gt;<i> every user. Does the result reflect the majority now or is it just a measure
</I>&gt;<i> of the patience of the users to convince the others, i.e. their felt
</I>&gt;<i> importance of the debate?
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this question could be answered by the users, if you add an option
</I>&gt;<i> like: &quot;I still stay with my last vote, but dont participate any longer.&quot;
</I>
Nope, sorry. I thought about that before. But it just makes it easy to
people to write a question, vote for it, and then sit back, and wait
until everybody else agrees with them. SInce the system does not sum
votes, but takes the pareto front it is open to that kind of
exploitation. Yes a person could do that manually, but it is annoying.

So if people are willing to pay the price of going over and over to a
question, they deserve to be inculded in the parteo front. Anything
that let them automatise that process need to be excluded. Or the
whole process would fail.

Pareto front are really powerful, but they have their drawback too.
And one of them is that each user have veto power.

Veto power+automatic voting= stalling.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case even the votes from former generations could be exported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still I see more problems coming out. For example, the pareto front
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works perfectly well both if you use binary voting (support/ignore) a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> three votes (YES, maybe, NO), n-values ranking, complete ranking, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so on. In fact it is such a general concept that, provided that in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each generation a user only votes using one system, Vilfredo could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cope with that too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mirroring votes is just a way of translating. Each mirroring engine has to
</I>&gt;<i> decide, how he tanslates something. This can be done well or not well (then
</I>&gt;<i> it will be critiqued for the bad job). If you want to translate a ranked
</I>&gt;<i> voting (-10 to +10) into a binary, information will be lost. But it is still
</I>&gt;<i> a valid information to tanslate the +10 votes into a &quot;Yes&quot;. I would even say
</I>&gt;<i> all votes from +1 to +10 are translatable to &quot;Yes&quot;.
</I>
Nah, that would not work. If you have people voting all 10 and 9, they
deserve to be considered as much as people voting all 1 and 0. The
problem is always that you are comparing apples (summing up votes) and
oranges (comparing sets).

I am ok to add a page with the info about the whole history of a page.
But I have no trust that you can take part of that information and
keep it meaningful. And if you take the whole of it, you are basically
recreating Vilfredo. Why?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would you do about the rooms? The room existence in private. you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> might be aware of some rooms, but in general the rooms are there to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> let people have a place to discuss things in private. If I were to let
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an external entity know about what rooms are active, the whole privacy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue would be gone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way could be to only allow public rooms to mirror. Another could be,
</I>&gt;<i> that in a private poll the mirroring engine also only allows the same users
</I>&gt;<i> to participate.
</I>
There is no such things as public rooms and non public room. Each room
is public to the people who are aware of it.
You could mirror the common room. And some key rooms that we chose to
mirror. But understand that there is no formal definition of public
room.
