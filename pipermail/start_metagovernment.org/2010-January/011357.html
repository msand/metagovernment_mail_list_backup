<PRE>Trustworthiness should be evaluated by an &#147;authority&#148; that itself has been
certified (and is routinely audited) as being capable of assessing
trustworthiness and is accepted as such by the community affected.  Any
system or record that has not been certified by such an authority is, by
definition, untrustworthy (except to the degree that we are inclined to
accept it because it reinforces our preconceived, albeit perhaps
ill-conceived, notions).

 

When we developed the first &lt;<A HREF="http://et.gov/stage1.htm">http://et.gov/stage1.htm</A>&gt;  stage of the ET.gov
site &lt;<A HREF="http://et.gov/">http://et.gov/</A>&gt; , we recognized that emerging technology components
and specifications should be tested and certified as conforming to the
applicable standards.  Those requirements are documented in the tabulation
at <A HREF="http://et.gov/history/enhancementrequirements.htm">http://et.gov/history/enhancementrequirements.htm</A>  Unfortunately, the
resources to build out the process never materialized.  However, at some
point, volunteers in a community (like Metagov?) could build it out and it
could come to be recognized as having legitimacy
&lt;<A HREF="http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm">http://ambur.net/French&amp;Raven.htm</A>&gt;  because it is in fact inherently
trustworthy (as least to the degree that truth can be known in this life, at
the current state of science).

Let's turn it around.

I don't think you can impose to other to put a signature to say that they
are not worth our trust. Just because people would not do it.

Instead, we could have a flag if it IS verifiable.

Hey Philippe, you are surely not alone in this. I'm also favorable to the
idea that e-dem software works only if it is fully open and transparent
(going further, not only the software but the entire telematic communication
- see our battle at
<A HREF="http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en/projects/user-verifiable-telematics">http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en/projects/user-verifiable-telematics</A>)

Now, regarding metagov and its integration with other, closed projects:

.... but I would be leery of including them in free-range voting, since
their output may be skewed. At the very least, I would encourage the FOS
projects to put tags on their output, flagging it as unverifiable. 


Man, that is just awesome! The fact that closed solutions can integrate with
our (future?) standard but be marked as &quot;unverifiable&quot; or &quot;untrusted&quot; is a
fantastic idea. It communicates the fact that transparency can be made only
by using FOSS and at the same time leaves choice to users that consiously
want to (or are obliged to) use closed solutions.
I'd just like to hear the members of closed projects that are on this list
about what they think of it...






But anyway, getting to the heart of the issue at hand; I think Jacki's
summary is good as-is, and if TuxFamily doesn't like our non-commercial wiki
despite our doing the blog without the NC, then we could just try some of
the other sites Philippe listed earlier in the thread. 

 

About the blog... Why exactly we should keep the non-commercial clause ?

cheers,
giovani

I think we, as an organization, have the goal of furthering FOSS 
software, and encouraging useful tools to release code and license 
using a FOSS license. 

If we agree on that as a goal, can we also agree that the best way to 
accomplish this would be to *include* non-FOSS projects in our 
discussions? And, in collaborations like 'Standardization', etc? 

Going FOSS to a commercial interest can be threatening; it is our job 
to demonstrate concrete benefits of releasing code. And the threat of 
'non-inclusion' in Metagov is, frankly, not a very big factor in their 
decisions. Much more persuasive will be the interaction with community 
members, where going OS can be beneficial in terms of cooperation, 
exchange of ideas, etc. 

I also think that, given that our second basic principle is to support 
transparency and FOSS, we can gain approval from projects like 
TuxFamily.org even though we may also agree to dialogue with non-FOSS 
projects. I don't think these are inconsistent. 

My two cents, anyways.

Do they have a choice? If you go to vote, and there is a machine, can you 
ask to vote instead on a paper ballot? 
I don't think you can, and I think the only other option is not to vote, 
which in my opinion is even worse 


ok this a matter of opinion :) 




Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people possible 
to test things out. For a long time most of the e-gov will just be for 
brainstorming. Reason being that in most countries anything else would 
require to change the constitution. Which is generally a long and laborious 
process (rightly so). 


yes of course. 




First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name calling 
into the actual discussion, sir. 


I apologize if you feel offensed, it was a rhetoric tweezers that would help

you feeling to be not concerned by my caricatural meanings. 
I will stop this really. 




I understand that something is for you un-negotiable. 
And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not 
obvious for me. 


like me : generally, this doesn't mean always. 




&gt;<i>From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are FOSS, I 
</I>recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects that are not so.

And I have seen in many cases proprietary software being the first software 
to produce a product, just to have to compete later with an open source 
alternative. I think of microsoft word, I think of mind manager (mind map 
software that predated freemind), and I believe there are many other 
examples out there. 
Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a project. 
Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the open world. 


ok your point of view, extensive debate... 




The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a scientist. I 
publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the corporate world,

the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, ... ) using my results.

I speak with everybody, and I will tell to everybody how things are. Because

my commitment is toward the truth. 


good ! wouldn't this be the basis of human relation ? 




Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not change 
idea, because if not you will leave or will not speak with me. 


just this discussion Pietro, don't we have already reach the consensus that 
each of us will not compromise ? 
I would like of course speak with you on other subject. 




I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the possibility 
of any member to join our team. 
And decide case by case what is appropriate to do. 


Case by case !? naturally not, I'm just defending the simple but essential 
idea that FOSS is the first prerequisite for e-dem software development. You

will surely not find me to argue like this on the fact that we should rather

use a blog or a wiki or something else for metagovernment.org... 
Please don't forget that we are anyway discussing on a major grounding of 
software e-dem : transparency, and by consequence if we should radicalize 
metagovernment.org in order to fit the tuxfamily.org requirements. 
If I'm alone to defend this radicalization, ok I will wait and as you said 
one time FOSS will win :) (I hope so). 

kind regards 

Philippe
