<PRE>I was going to write basically what Jacki wrote below, so I'll just  
elaborate a bit.

If commercial projects want to participate, we can't/(won't) stop  
them. This list is open to anyone who wishes to subscribe, as is the  
wiki.

However, if they choose to act on behalf of this project under the  
principle of adhocracy, then when doing so they implicitly must uphold  
at least our first two basic principles.

It might be nice to have <A HREF="http://policypitch.com">http://policypitch.com</A> join our community,  
but I would not be willing to say that the product of their engine is  
trustworthy, since the source is decidedly closed. So for example,  
they could participate in our standardization effort (e.g., user  
portability), but I would be leery of including them in free-range  
voting, since their output may be skewed. At the very least, I would  
encourage the FOS projects to put tags on their output, flagging it as  
unverifiable.

But anyway, getting to the heart of the issue at hand; I think Jacki's  
summary is good as-is, and if TuxFamily doesn't like our non- 
commercial wiki despite our doing the blog without the NC, then we  
could just try some of the other sites Philippe listed earlier in the  
thread.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> which in my opinion is even worse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ok this a matter of opinion :)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to test things out. For a long time most of the e-gov will just be  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> brainstorming. Reason being that in most countries anything else  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> would
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> require to change the constitution. Which is generally a long and  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> laborious
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> process (rightly so).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes of course.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> calling
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> into the actual discussion, sir.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I apologize if you feel offensed, it was a rhetoric tweezers that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you feeling to be not concerned by my caricatural meanings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will stop this really.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I understand that something is for you un-negotiable.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> obvious for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like me : generally, this doesn't mean always.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> FOSS, I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects that  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are not so.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And I have seen in many cases proprietary software being the first  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> software
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to produce a product, just to have to compete later with an open  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> source
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> alternative. I think of microsoft word, I think of mind manager  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (mind map
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> software that predated freemind), and I believe there are many other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> examples out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> project.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the open  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ok your point of view, extensive debate...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> scientist. I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> corporate world,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, ... ) using  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my results.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I speak with everybody, and I will tell to everybody how things  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> are. Because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> my commitment is toward the truth.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good ! wouldn't this be the basis of human relation ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> idea, because if not you will leave or will not speak with me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just this discussion Pietro, don't we have already reach the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> each of us will not compromise ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like of course speak with you on other subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibility
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of any member to join our team.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And decide case by case what is appropriate to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Case by case !? naturally not, I'm just defending the simple but  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> essential
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea that FOSS is the first prerequisite for e-dem software  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development. You
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will surely not find me to argue like this on the fact that we  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use a blog or a wiki or something else for metagovernment.org...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please don't forget that we are anyway discussing on a major  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> grounding of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software e-dem : transparency, and by consequence if we should  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> radicalize
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> metagovernment.org in order to fit the tuxfamily.org requirements.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I'm alone to defend this radicalization, ok I will wait and as  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you said
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one time FOSS will win :) (I hope so).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind regards
