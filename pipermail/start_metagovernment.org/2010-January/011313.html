<PRE>Hello All,

I woke up this morning to three different threads regarding this year's open
gov unconferences.  I'm actually in Melbourne from now until the end of May,
working with Collabforge &lt;<A HREF="http://collabforge.com">http://collabforge.com</A>&gt; and diving into the
Australian Open Gov scene (which is quite ripe! check out the Aus Fed's Gov
2.0 task force &lt;<A HREF="http://gov2.net.au/">http://gov2.net.au/</A>&gt; blog).  I'll be back just in time for
PdF and the accompanying unconference.

(Apologies to those of you on multiple lists who will receive duplicates of
this... And thanks Steven and Wayne for asking for my opinion :-) You got
it.)

Participation Camp did indeed piggyback on PdF, and this worked out quite
well, even though I started things far too late to really integrate with
PdF's plans.  One great moment was having Steven, Craig Newmark, and a bunch
of other open gov heavies who were in town for PdF in on an excellent
session by local open gov leader City Councilmember Gale Brewer and attended
by many of NYC's most active on-the-ground open gov organizers.

I think piggybacking on Politics Online is a smart move, and the difference
in focus should be seen as a strength rather than a weakness.  Those of us
who organize the OpenNY forum &lt;<A HREF="http://opennyforum.org">http://opennyforum.org</A>&gt; (the OpenGovNYC
meetup re-branded) were planning to repeat our PdF-piggybacking this year as
well.  We recently heard from Micah and Andrew that PdF was already planning
its own unconference, and from what I understand from a distance, we're
figuring out right now how it all fits together.

I'm laying this all out because I think the overall lesson is that we ought
to coordinate our efforts across all of these groups to provide an ongoing
open gov narrative.  Think of it as a giant open space grid with the all of
the the cities in the U.S. on the X axis, and the entire 2010 calendar on
the Y axis (I've been pushing a similar vision for
NY&lt;<A HREF="http://opennyforum.org/open-space/">http://opennyforum.org/open-space/</A>&gt;
).

This was, in part, the rationale behind Participation Camp.  It was meant to
build on Transparency Camp, and a Collaboration Camp was discussed for
December but never happened.

To wrap, from what I can see in the threads, the highly-motivated band of
open gov organizers on these lists is particularly focused on how to make
*authentic citizen participation* a reality.  Politics Online and
Transparency Camp are focused, as they should be, on specific domains, but
there's a need to focus on participation specifically.  Participation, I'd
argue, is the &quot;hard problem&quot; of open government, and needs the most TLC to
help it grow to maturity.

We need to find some way to build momentum through these camps and
coordinate existing (fragmented) efforts.

That's my ten cents.  I have some ideas on what this might look like, but
I've written enough :)

G'day!
Matt
