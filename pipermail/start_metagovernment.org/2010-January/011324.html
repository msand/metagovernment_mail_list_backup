<PRE>Hey... what about presenting Metagov and/org Eugager  there:

Metagov

 * Platforms, methods and tools for creating, sharing and curating open
   knowledge
 * Light-weight, adaptive interaction models
 * Open government data and content (public sector information)
 * Incentive and rewards open-knowledge contributors


EUGAGER

 * Open, decentralized social network applications
 * Light-weight, adaptive interaction models




I'm sure many of the projects the other people in this list are running
could also fit in the same or other topics...

cheers
gio

## Introduction

OKCon, now in its fifth year, is the interdisciplinary conference that
brings together individuals from across the open knowledge spectrum for
a day of presentations and workshops.

Open knowledge promises significant social and economic benefits in a
wide range of areas from governance to science, culture to technology.
Opening up access to content and data can radically increase access and
reuse, improving transparency, fostering innovation and increasing
societal welfare.

This is a time of great change. In addition to high profile initiatives
such as Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap and the Human Genome Project, there is
enormous growth among open knowledge projects and communities at all
levels. Moreover, in the last year, many governments across the world
have begun opening up their data.

And it doesn't stop there. In academia, open access to both publications
and data has been gathering momentum, and similar calls to open up
learning materials have been heard in education. Furthermore this
gathering flood of open data and content is the creator and driver of
massive technological change. How can we make this data available, how
can we connect it together, how can we use it collaborate and share our
work?

Join us to discuss all of this and more!
