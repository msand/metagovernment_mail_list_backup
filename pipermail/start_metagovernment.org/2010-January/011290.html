<PRE>I started documenting the use cases, requirements, and so forth in the
wiki.  It's still pretty rough:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> * Backtracing of trust in the wiki.  So, if there's a problem, you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   can navigate toward the root of the network, closer to registrars
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   and admin, where the ultimate responsiblity lies.

I answered generally to your concern on the 10th:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-January/002480.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2010-January/002480.html</A>
Do you have a specific example of corruption?  We can try to document
it under the use cases.

&gt;<i> Additionally, in terms of trust, I'd like to remind you of Manuel &amp; 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's idea of an internal trust mechanism (sorry; can't dig up the 
</I>&gt;<i> reference from my phone). It basically uses spheres of influence to 
</I>&gt;<i> determine user authenticity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As an example, if I set up a hundred sock puppets and have them all rate 
</I>&gt;<i> each other as trustworthy, the fact that all of their relationships are 
</I>&gt;<i> internal to their group (with no/few external relationships) would allow 
</I>&gt;<i> the software to essentially collapse them all into one person.
</I>
Detecting sock puppets by statistics or pattern matching, and raising
alarms - sounds OK (maybe tricky, like Pietro says).  In any case, the
machine probably shouldn't take corrective action on its own.  It'll
make mistakes.  We'd rather allow a sock puppet to live another day,
than offend a bonafide user.

I documented the principle use case for sock puppets.  It illustrates
how the trust network is supposed to function:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Policing_for_local_sock_puppets">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Streetwiki#Policing_for_local_sock_puppets</A>

The crucial problems I see at this point - and where documentation
should help - are:

  a) Visualization in the wiki, especially the layout of
     neighbourhoods, streets and other common areas.  We need to
     understand what we're trying to build in there (or I do anyway,
     because it's not always clear to me).

  b) Explaining it to people - concerns were expressed off list that
     streetwikis might be controversial
