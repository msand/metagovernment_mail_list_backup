<PRE>Acknowledgements (I should have mentioned earlier):
Autocast vote mirroring is Thomas von der Elbe's invention.  The rapid
prototyping idea came out of discussions with Thomas and David Bovill.
The underlying architecture (registration and vote mirroring) was
reviewed and critiqued last month by Friedrich Lindenberg, Martin
H&#228;cker, David Bovill, Andreas Nitsche and Thomas von der Elbe.  Kai
Londenberg and Fred Gohlke also contributed to the discussions.

Replying to Ed, Pietro and Owen,

Ed Pastore wrote:
&gt;<i> Michael, I am not sure that the geographical registration should be

</I>
The coders/admins may ignore the registration property of &quot;primary
residence&quot;. Global tallies of results need not filter on that
property, in any case.

They may still be interested in &quot;residential trust level&quot;, which is
another property of the residential register.  It assures that the
user is not a sock puppet.  It's a universal assurance, so it's
especially useful in the less localized polls (national, global).  But
it requires a special type of register (mutually tight):
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor#List_chaining">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/p/edor#List_chaining</A>

There may be other types of mutually-tight registers (aside from
trust-based residential).  If so, we can run them side by side.

&gt;<i> In my perspective of governance, anyone who cares enough to participate in 
</I>&gt;<i> an issue is a stakeholder in that issue and should have a voice. This is 
</I>&gt;<i> clearly demonstrated in issues such as environmental pollution or water 
</I>&gt;<i> use, where the actions of one geographic jurisdiction can have substantial 
</I>&gt;<i> effects on people far away.
</I>
That's a use case we didn't document.  I've added it here:
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Free_expression">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Free_expression</A>

By the same token:
<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Personal_vote_filtering">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:ThomasvonderElbe_GmxDe/Vote_mirroring#Personal_vote_filtering</A>

As Owen says, &quot;Clearly, geography should not be deemed to be part of
the essential attribution of individuals but should be available for
usage when and where appropriate.&quot;  With personal vote filtering, the
user decides when and where.

&gt;<i> Or if the intention is to simply link users to geography in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> develop a unique identifier...
</I>
Not for personal identification.  The properties (residence, trust
level) are merely associated with one's personal identifier.  The
purpose of the register is to make that association.  Different
registers will associate different types of property - residential,
group membership, and so forth.

&gt;<i> Could the below system work with the geographic unit severed (or made 
</I>&gt;<i> internal to each system), or is that the basis of the rest?
</I>
Use of internal registers is OK.  Use of external registers (including
residential) is always optional.  Each voting engine makes its own
choices.  You can mix and match registers (and thus property types) in
any combination.

    (W)  (W)  (W)  (W)   streetwikis
  ^  |   / \   |   /   ^
  |  |  /   \  |  /    |  (residential
  v  | /     \ | /     v   register)
     |/       \|/
    (S)       (S)        streetservers
      \       /
  |    \     /    |
  v     \   /     v
         \ /
        ((V))       voting engines (many)
         / \
  ^     /   \     ^
  |    /     \    |   
      /       \
    (R)       (R)   other registers (internal to V,
                    or external for party, club, school)

I've done some tests.  I think it will work.  Streetservers (S) can
pull trust edges from the wiki (who trusts whom) using a query:
<A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Special:Ask/-5B-5BUser:%2B-5D-5D-5B-5BTrust::%2B-5D-5D/-3FTrust/format%3Dcsv">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Special:Ask/-5B-5BUser:%2B-5D-5D-5B-5BTrust::%2B-5D-5D/-3FTrust/format%3Dcsv</A>

To push the calculated trust data back to the wiki (problems A and B,
previous post) the streetserver uploads the data to a single page of
the wiki.  Wiki users cannot edit this page:
<A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/w/index.php?title=Okidoke:Trust_in&amp;action=edit">http://okidoke.referata.com/w/index.php?title=Okidoke:Trust_in&amp;action=edit</A>
Trust levels of users are then visible throughout the wiki:
<A HREF="http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street">http://okidoke.referata.com/wiki/Test_Street</A>

Volunteer administrators/registrars can do the wiki setup for their
hometowns (one wiki per town).  Then users can start registering
locally.  Once registered and trusted, they can free-range and vote in
tight polls (no sock puppets) anywhere in the world.  They can elect
registrars and other admins, and vote up other e-dem stuff.  (It's
just a hack.  The streetwikis will probably bog down if just 10,000
people register.  Voting engines may be overloaded by then, too.)

We're trying to document some of that.  Please critique:

&gt;<i> A few things:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) better than scrape: send me a hack to the vilfredo code and I will add it.
</I>&gt;<i> Probably an XML version of the historypage. That would do.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) yes, the vote have a time, but I am not happy with the time being
</I>&gt;<i> released for privacy reason of the voter. If you read when a person
</I>&gt;<i> have voted you are actually having important information about when a
</I>&gt;<i> person was online in RL. Not sure this is ok.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead I think people voting and addition should all be set to the
</I>&gt;<i> next moveon. That's when they are counted, and considered by the
</I>&gt;<i> system. After all each person can re-edit its votes many times before
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>
(Thomas says Vilfredo can probably be mirrored in Votorola.  He's also
 been chasing down some of the privacy problems.  He may be able to
 answer your concerns.)
