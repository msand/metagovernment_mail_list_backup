<PRE>Uncle Sam is dipping his toes into Cloud Computing.  See, for example, <A HREF="http://gcn.com/articles/2009/12/14/tech-trends-cloud-computing.aspx?sc_lang=en">http://gcn.com/articles/2009/12/14/tech-trends-cloud-computing.aspx?sc_lang=en</A> &amp; <A HREF="http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/12/14/Numerator-USAGov.aspx">http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/12/14/Numerator-USAGov.aspx</A> &amp; <A HREF="http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/11/09/Numerator-cloud-computing-savings.aspx">http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/11/09/Numerator-cloud-computing-savings.aspx</A> &amp; <A HREF="http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/12/10/Open-government-cloud-computing.aspx">http://gcn.com/Articles/2009/12/10/Open-government-cloud-computing.aspx</A> 

 

Although exactly what that means is not clear yet, hopefully, it will enable agencies to focus more directly on their own missions, goals, and objectives while outsourcing technical IT support functions to others who are willing and able to provide the best values at the lowest costs.  To the degree that may occur, service providers should be able to capture a share of the savings.  

 

Indeed, the eGov Act authorized such a program: <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c107:1:./temp/~c107CRIHAT:e108363:">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?c107:1:./temp/~c107CRIHAT:e108363:</A>   However, it has apparently been controversial -- <A HREF="http://www.pubklaw.com/papers/ShareInSavingsContractg.pdf">http://www.pubklaw.com/papers/ShareInSavingsContractg.pdf</A> -- and is no longer operational, according to the note at the top of the article at  <A HREF="http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC">http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC</A> &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC&amp;contentId=14409&amp;noc=T">http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?contentType=GSA_BASIC&amp;contentId=14409&amp;noc=T</A>&gt; &amp;contentId=14409&amp;noc=T 

 

The coop model seems applicable.  However, regardless of the construct by which they choose to organize, it seems like any group of people who are pursuing common objectives should be more than happy to reduce the administrative overhead associated with &#8220;governing&#8221; their activities.  Many voluntary organizations collect dues from their members, and even among those that don&#8217;t, individuals who are committed to the cause may be more than willing to share the cost of providing services required to support it effectively.

 

It seems to me that lack of resources is a pretty clear indicator of lack of commitment.  It also seems to me that we spend too much time worrying about what others may or may not be willing to do and too little time focusing on what we ourselves can do, individually as well as collectively.

Hi! I answering between lines...

I think that active projects could be profitable, just like other open source projects that are. They product is free for the community and non-free for enterprises. I believe collaborative governance has a lot of potential regarding these latters too, just we should find the spin-off.


That is an intriguing approach. I guess all it requires is creative terminology in the license. Can you think of a specific company/OSS project that does this well?


For example, <A HREF="http://www.fengoffice.com.">http://www.fengoffice.com.</A> They host OpenGoo for you, for a fee. This software (a 2.0 office, like Google Docs, etc.) is open source, you could use it without paying if you have a server and can install it there. As companies don't want complications doing this stuff and desire support, they hire a third party. Meanwhile, FengOffice is the main developer of OpenGoo.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux comes to my mind, too.

There are two model organizations we could use together for this approach. I have not researched either one extensively, but they each handle one side of the equation with an open approach:

E Text Editor, the open company. [...] 

MyFootballClub.

 

If these two approaches are combined, one can imagine a company where anyone can be an &quot;owner&quot; and anyone can be an &quot;employee.&quot; Wow. The more I think about this, the more my head spins. A company completely defined by the amorphous community of people who feel like contributing to it.


This concept exists. When employees are also owners, the organization is a cooperative (like gcoop &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gcoop.com.ar/en/home">http://www.gcoop.com.ar/en/home</A>&gt; ). Collaborative governance must be very natural to them. I sustain that it could be useful (generate value) even though employees aren't owners. 

We could charge owners if we host the decision making plataform that employees use. It's compatible with owners: they keep owning and giving general orders. It's unnatural to them: employees behave democratically to find the best way to work down those orders. If this really generates more profit than the vertical structure, owners will buy our free software product/service.

With a strategy like this one, we are able to take a loan.
