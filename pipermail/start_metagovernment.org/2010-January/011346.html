&gt;<i> Aren't we limiting ourselves ahead of time.
</I>
I, of course, as a true parano&#239;d guy, feel under this comment ;)

My intervention on this list is matter of debates that would, I hope so, 
drives us to rich consensus instead of weak ones.
Consensus doesn't mean compromise. During a debate if each stakeholder 
doesn't expose his point of view by a radical manner, ideas would 
necessarily drive to a weak consensus. Rich consensus emerges from &quot;the 
clash of ideas&quot; in a first step. Radicality usually offense soft 
thinking. If I disturb too much I can leave the list of course, because 
don't expect me to not be radical, I will usually put the foot in...

&gt;<i> Yes it's true that transparency is important. But I would not 
</I>&gt;<i> subscribe that our community will only, and always have only FOSS 
</I>&gt;<i> projects as members.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What if tomorrow MixedInk wants to join us.
</I>&gt;<i> Think how important the exchange would be.
</I>&gt;<i> Both technically and strategically.
</I>&gt;<i> Should we close the door on their face because they are not FOSS?
</I>&gt;<i> And WhiteHouse2 was not open source when joined, nor for some time was 
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact what if we receive some money from the EU to develop the 
</I>&gt;<i> community software. We already have found how difficult was to dialog 
</I>&gt;<i> between our community, and the external, non FOSS, community.
</I>
Sorry to not be naive Pietro, but in term of software, I only trust the 
code that I can read and I must be sure that this code in which I can 
trust will always be able to be reviewed by anyone who wants to do it. 
In addition, as a citizen, I will never use a e-dem software that is not 
a FOSS, democracy is too important and should'nt give a little chance 
for a malicious person to inject malicious code in a software and ruins 
the goal that the software pretends to reach.

&gt;<i> I think we should be inclusive, and not exclusive, so I now question 
</I>&gt;<i> the choice of TuxFamily.
</I>
It is not us that would exclude those projects, they would excluding 
themselves by not joining the evidence that a e-dem software must be 
FOSS for respect to transparency. Our job would be to try to convince 
them to release their softwares with a FOSS licence.

kind regards

Philippe
