Just to be clear, we use trust ratings for this purpose - not
rules-based enforcement.  See steps (1c and 2) for details:

&gt;<i> I understand that for now this is just a rapid prototype. But at some 
</I>&gt;<i> point, do you forsee these servers being distributed? I would like to see 
</I>&gt;<i> any server which is claiming any sort of authority to be distributed among

</I>&gt;<i> from hacking, but also from corrupt administrators.
</I>
In principle, the prototype is pretty safe.  All of its services are
easily forked.  Here's the latest architecture:


    1      (S)  (S)  (S)  (S) streetwikis
         ^  |   / \   |   /
         |  |  /   \  |  /
         v  | /     \ | /
            |/       \|/
    2      (T)       (T)      trustservers
             \       /
         |    \     /
         v     \   /
                \ /
 3,4,5,7       ((V))          voting engines (many)
                /|\
         ^     / | \
         |    /  |  \
             /   |   \
    6      (C)  (C)  (C)      poll-classifier wikis


(S).  Streetwikis are distributed, at least one per city or region.
Admins and registrars are elected I imagine (assuming the local voters
organize this).  The biggest risk of corruption is maybe the owner of
the server hardware.  But the content is always exportable to a new
wiki.  Any user can do this, or (easier) an admin can do it from an
off-site archive (assuming there is one).

A single neighbourhood can also independently migrate to a new wiki.
To avoid complicating things at the trustserver, a whole postal code
would have to migrate as a unit. (In Canada, for e.g., this is maybe
10 to 20 homes.)

(T).  These are just communication glue.  They have no content and no
users, so no scope for corruption.

(V). Vote mirroring precludes corruption here.  It enables a new
engine to effectively fork an old one.  Users can free-range over to
the new engine, one by one.  They cannot be captured by the old engine
(or by the new one).

(C). (These were added in response to a suggestion by V&#225;clav Bel&#225;k.)
Same as S here - the content is easy to export to a new wiki.
