<PRE>I think we, as an organization, have the goal of furthering FOSS
software, and encouraging useful tools to release code and license
using a FOSS license.

If we agree on that as a goal, can we also agree that the best way to
accomplish this would be to *include* non-FOSS projects in our
discussions? And, in collaborations like 'Standardization', etc?

Going FOSS to a commercial interest can be threatening; it is our job
to demonstrate concrete benefits of releasing code. And the threat of
'non-inclusion' in Metagov is, frankly, not a very big factor in their
decisions. Much more persuasive will be the interaction with community
members, where going OS can be beneficial in terms of cooperation,
exchange of ideas, etc.

I also think that, given that our second basic principle is to support
transparency and FOSS, we can gain approval from projects like
TuxFamily.org even though we may also agree to dialogue with non-FOSS
projects. I don't think these are inconsistent.

My two cents, anyways.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do they have a choice? If you go to vote, and there is a machine, can you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ask to vote instead on a paper ballot?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I don't think you can, and I think the only other option is not to vote,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which in my opinion is even worse
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok this a matter of opinion :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to test things out. For a long time most of the e-gov will just be for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> brainstorming. Reason being that in most countries anything else would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> require to change the constitution. Which is generally a long and laborious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process (rightly so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name calling
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> into the actual discussion, sir.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if you feel offensed, it was a rhetoric tweezers that would help
</I>&gt;<i> you feeling to be not concerned by my caricatural meanings.
</I>&gt;<i> I will stop this really.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand that something is for you un-negotiable.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obvious for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> like me : generally, this doesn't mean always.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are FOSS, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects that are not so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I have seen in many cases proprietary software being the first software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to produce a product, just to have to compete later with an open source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative. I think of microsoft word, I think of mind manager (mind map
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software that predated freemind), and I believe there are many other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> examples out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the open world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok your point of view, extensive debate...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a scientist. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the corporate world,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, ... ) using my results.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I speak with everybody, and I will tell to everybody how things are. Because
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my commitment is toward the truth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> good ! wouldn't this be the basis of human relation ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> idea, because if not you will leave or will not speak with me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just this discussion Pietro, don't we have already reach the consensus that
</I>&gt;<i> each of us will not compromise ?
</I>&gt;<i> I would like of course speak with you on other subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the possibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of any member to join our team.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And decide case by case what is appropriate to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Case by case !? naturally not, I'm just defending the simple but essential
</I>&gt;<i> idea that FOSS is the first prerequisite for e-dem software development. You
</I>&gt;<i> will surely not find me to argue like this on the fact that we should rather
</I>&gt;<i> use a blog or a wiki or something else for metagovernment.org...
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't forget that we are anyway discussing on a major grounding of
</I>&gt;<i> software e-dem : transparency, and by consequence if we should radicalize
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org in order to fit the tuxfamily.org requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm alone to defend this radicalization, ok I will wait and as you said
</I>&gt;<i> one time FOSS will win :) (I hope so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> kind regards
</I>&gt;<i>
