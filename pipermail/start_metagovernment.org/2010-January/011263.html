<PRE>Hi all, 

earlier today I received a very nice message from Ed inviting the Adhocracy project to join this list and the Metagovernment project. I've been a great fan of the Metagoverment wiki and its projects - particularly NationBuilder, Candiwi and Votorola - for a while, so I look forward to participating in the discussions here. 

Let me quickly introduce my project, Adhocracy, and myself. The goal is to develop a simplistic discussion and voting tool based around delegated voting. The software has been under development since last fall and is still somewhat prototypical, although we're going to release a more stable beta version this month. We have an outdated demo site running at <A HREF="http://adhocracy.cc,">http://adhocracy.cc,</A> some FAQ info is available at <A HREF="http://habermas.liqd.de/Adhocracy/FAQ/en.">http://habermas.liqd.de/Adhocracy/FAQ/en.</A>   

As for myself, I am one of the german Pirate Party guys Thomas mentioned in the ongoing thread on Rapid prototyping. Yet my interest is not only in providing the PP with usable software but also in offering a democratic management tool to other communities, like net groups (hence the name), NGOs etc. This interest is shared by the Liquid Democracy e.V. group that Thomas and I are members of and that I think follows many of the same goals that MG has. Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of English info on the group available at the moment. 

I'm looking forward to learning more about your projects and goals! 

Friedrich
