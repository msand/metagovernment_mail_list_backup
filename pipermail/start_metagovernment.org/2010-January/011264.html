<PRE>I am traveling now and don't want to dig through all your links with  
my phone. :) But I do want to say that while I am more interested in  
user portability, I certainly have no objection to this larger  
coordination project. I may come to appreciate it more when I see it  
in action.

Some replies in-line below...

OK; that certainly makes sense. Personally I have no objection to sock  
puppets (because I think trust ratings and spheres of influence can  
overcome tampering better than rules-based enforcement), but I do see  
the usefulness in disparate communities/engines comparing votes on the  
same issue.

&gt;<i> More generally, there is probably no practical way for groups to

</I>&gt;<i> often share voting facilities with larger ones.  They won't run their
</I>&gt;<i> own servers.  Mirroring will be built into the common infrastructure.
</I>&gt;<i> So the group may open a decision on tool (T), and may even favour the
</I>&gt;<i> use of T.  But there would be nothing to stop a member from casting
</I>&gt;<i> her vote on a different tool (U).  The issues would thereby be joined,
</I>&gt;<i> and the votes mirrored in both directions T&lt;--&gt;U.  Only a lock-down of
</I>&gt;<i> T (if warranted) could prevent that.
</I>
I understand that for now this is just a rapid prototype. But at some  
point, do you forsee these servers being distributed? I would like to  
see any server which is claiming any sort of authority to be  
distributed among a minimum of four unrelated instances. This protects  
the server not only from hacking, but also from corrupt administrators.
