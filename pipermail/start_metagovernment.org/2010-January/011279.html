<PRE>Hello Philippe,

I completely understand your disappointment with the competition. If you 
read my first posts to this list, they were exactly about the same thing.

And it still makes me sad to see, that if we would have cooperated right 
from the beginning, we would have been ready with the developement long 
ago. Instead we have 20 unfinished tools. Actually quite a shame for a 
movement, which is all about consensus, collaboration, democracy, ...

Ok, but whats the situation now? We have a few tools now, which are 90% 
ready, and people which are not willing to give up the uniqueness of 
their tools for working on another one. And if you look closely, some of 
them are really unique. The world had (and still has) to pay a high 
price for these uniquenesses, but they are here now anyway.

So I feel, the only thing that I can do, is to try to help to connect 
those tools, so that at least the voters dont get split among them. And 
I&#180;d be happy, if you would join this effort.

Mike and I stopped working on Votorola for now and instead we work on a 
common registration, which every tool can use. Because this is a 
prerequisite for free range voting (a voter votes anywhere, but his 
votes count everywhere).

Greetings,
Thomas
