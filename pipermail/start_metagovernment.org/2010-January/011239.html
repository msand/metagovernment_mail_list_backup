<PRE>Ed, I too have two residences, in different States.  

Clearly, geography should not be deemed to be part of the essential
attribution of individuals but should be available for usage when and where
appropriate.

We plan to address the geographic attribution of organizations, goals,
objectives, and stakeholders in Part 3 of the StratML standard:

Michael, I am not sure that the geographical registration should be  
outsourced from the individual systems (ie, sections 1a &amp; 1b1). Some  
systems such as Candiwi and (at least for now) Vilfredo, are  
deliberately ignorant of geography.

In my perspective of governance, anyone who cares enough to  
participate in an issue is a stakeholder in that issue and should have  
a voice. This is clearly demonstrated in issues such as environmental  
pollution or water use, where the actions of one geographic  
jurisdiction can have substantial effects on people far away.

Or if the intention is to simply link users to geography in order to  
develop a unique identifier... I see a problem in that people are not  
intrinsically linked to an individual address. For example, I  
currently have two residences in two different cities, and I spend a  
lot of time in a third city. Other people have no residence. Some  
residences do not have clear addresses or are not linked to streets.  
Some streets are defined one way in one mapping system and a different  
way in a different system. And so on... And of course, people change  
residences, sometimes frequently.

Could the below system work with the geographic unit severed (or made  
internal to each system), or is that the basis of the rest?
