<PRE>Hi guys,

It's been a while since I posted here - hope you're all well. Apologies I
haven't read all of the posts over the last few months, some of them are a
little over my head.

Anyway, a quick update from our small group Egality (<A HREF="http://egalitynow.org">http://egalitynow.org</A> -
redesign coming next week..):

Copenhagen - we were out in Denmark in December, protesting the ridiculously
undemocratic attempts to stop our planet burning up. We managed to drop our
banner in the central square though the police were on us pretty quickly
(watch our 1-min vid here <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQXv1sIgKQQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQXv1sIgKQQ</A>). Plus
a pre-emptive couple of arrests earlier in the week it was difficult to get
much done but we made lots of links with global south groups which we're
going to be using in our...

Vote World project - we're mobilising people at the moment for this UK
election project/stunt (<A HREF="http://voteworld.org">http://voteworld.org</A>). Our target is 1,500 UK voters
giving their votes up to participants in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Ghana.
We're starting the website development for that at the moment which is all
very exciting. There's going to be a section for...

Metagovernment - (or a similar group) to put forward the argument for how
digital solutions can take us to an age of direct democracy beyond borders.
Basically, a section of the site called &quot;solutions&quot; is going to look at
other ways to reach global decisions. We're going to have George Monbiot (
<A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/georgemonbiot">http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/georgemonbiot</A>) writing a piece about World
Assembly and how to get there outside the state system. We're going to have
Marianne Maeckelbergh (<A HREF="http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Reinventing-democracy">http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Reinventing-democracy</A>)
talking about local consensus decision making up to a global level, and we
want to have you guys (or someone/some people from Metagovernment) putting
forward the digital direct democracy alternative. There'll be a section
where visitor can submit their own proposals but the above &quot;solutions&quot; will
be the featured ones.

The Vote World project is going to be 20% technology and 80% media work and
awareness raising. We're not planning for it to be the democratic solution,
but rather to be a high profile platform for mainstream discussion in this
area.

We'd love to hear from anyone who might be interested in:

- writing the content requested above
- helping organise the Vote World project (we're 2 people working full time
but need all the help we can get). Drop us an email to find out how.
- helping us source funding. we're working on something of a shoestring at
the moment and most funds are terrified of supporting overtly political
projects. if you have any ideas, they'd be welcome!

Peace,

J
PS Did you guys see Evo Morales is talking about arranging a world
referendum on climate change? Interesting stuff.
