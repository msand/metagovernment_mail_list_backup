<PRE>I don't see the existing environment as competitive as much as it is  
experimental. We are trying to create an entirely new mode of human  
social governance. It is unlikely that any one project will get it  
right.

There is a real strength to the diversity of approaches we are taking.  
In the end, many may fail... but it is also quite likely that eventual  
solutions will be permutations and combinations of several of the  
approaches we are developing.

We just cannot know if one approach is better than another until the  
world has had a chance to play with them and let us know.

That is why when I realized that there were numerous projects taking  
different approaches from Metascore, I wanted to get them all together  
(not to see them all fail in favor of my initial, now obsolete, idea).

There certainly are elements of competition here, but I think for the  
most part most of us are simply thrilled to see any project making  
progress.

I know it is slower than all of us working on one system; but in the  
end I do think we will be much stronger.

</I>&gt;<i> I completely understand your disappointment with the competition. If

</I>&gt;<i> same thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And it still makes me sad to see, that if we would have cooperated  
</I>&gt;<i> right from the beginning, we would have been ready with the

</I>&gt;<i> quite a shame for a movement, which is all about consensus,  
</I>&gt;<i> collaboration, democracy, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, but whats the situation now? We have a few tools now, which are  
</I>&gt;<i> 90% ready, and people which are not willing to give up the  
</I>&gt;<i> uniqueness of their tools for working on another one. And if you  
</I>&gt;<i> look closely, some of them are really unique. The world had (and  
</I>&gt;<i> still has) to pay a high price for these uniquenesses, but they are  
</I>&gt;<i> here now anyway.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I feel, the only thing that I can do, is to try to help to  
</I>&gt;<i> connect those tools, so that at least the voters dont get split  
</I>&gt;<i> among them. And I&#180;d be happy, if you would join this effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike and I stopped working on Votorola for now and instead we work  
</I>&gt;<i> on a common registration, which every tool can use. Because this is  
</I>&gt;<i> a prerequisite for free range voting (a voter votes anywhere, but  
</I>&gt;<i> his votes count everywhere).
