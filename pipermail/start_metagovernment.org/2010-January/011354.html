<PRE>Let's turn it around.

I don't think you can impose to other to put a signature to say that they
are not worth our trust. Just because people would not do it.

Instead, we could have a flag if it IS verifiable.

</I>&gt;<i> Do they have a choice? If you go to vote, and there is a machine, can you

</I>&gt;<i> I don't think you can, and I think the only other option is not to vote,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok this a matter of opinion :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Happy to see that you would participate. We need all the people possible
</I>&gt;<i> to test things out. For a long time most of the e-gov will just be for
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorming. Reason being that in most countries anything else would
</I>&gt;<i> require to change the constitution. Which is generally a long and laborious
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> process (rightly so).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First you call me naive, then utopist. shall we move on from name calling
</I>&gt;<i> into the actual discussion, sir.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if you feel offensed, it was a rhetoric tweezers that would
</I>&gt;<i> help
</I>&gt;<i> you feeling to be not concerned by my caricatural meanings.
</I>&gt;<i> I will stop this really.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that something is for you un-negotiable.
</I>&gt;<i> And I am interested to hear why so. So, no, things are generally not
</I>&gt;<i> obvious for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> like me : generally, this doesn't mean always.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From my point of view, even though I appreciate that projects are FOSS, I
</I>&gt;<i> recognise that there are a lot of very interesting projects that are not
</I>&gt;<i> so.
</I>&gt;<i> And I have seen in many cases proprietary software being the first software
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> to produce a product, just to have to compete later with an open source
</I>&gt;<i> alternative. I think of microsoft word, I think of mind manager (mind map
</I>&gt;<i> software that predated freemind), and I believe there are many other
</I>&gt;<i> examples out there.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes only the corporate word has the resources to start a project.
</I>&gt;<i> Which can then be copied in its spirit quite easily by the open world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok your point of view, extensive debate...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The project on which I participate is FOSS. But I am also a scientist. I
</I>&gt;<i> publish my papers, and I have no problems with anyone, (the corporate
</I>&gt;<i> world,
</I>&gt;<i> the FOSS world, the Talibans, the Pentagon, the CIA, ... ) using my
</I>&gt;<i> results.
</I>&gt;<i> I speak with everybody, and I will tell to everybody how things are.
</I>&gt;<i> Because
</I>&gt;<i> my commitment is toward the truth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> good ! wouldn't this be the basis of human relation ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Honestly... I like you to be in this list,&lt;nobr&gt;but I will not change
</I>&gt;<i> idea, because if not you will leave or will not speak with me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just this discussion Pietro, don't we have already reach the consensus that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> each of us will not compromise ?
</I>&gt;<i> I would like of course speak with you on other subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I stand by my position that we should keep ourself open to the possibility
</I>&gt;<i> of any member to join our team.
</I>&gt;<i> And decide case by case what is appropriate to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Case by case !? naturally not, I'm just defending the simple but essential
</I>&gt;<i> idea that FOSS is the first prerequisite for e-dem software development.
</I>&gt;<i> You
</I>&gt;<i> will surely not find me to argue like this on the fact that we should
</I>&gt;<i> rather
</I>&gt;<i> use a blog or a wiki or something else for metagovernment.org...
</I>&gt;<i> Please don't forget that we are anyway discussing on a major grounding of
</I>&gt;<i> software e-dem : transparency, and by consequence if we should radicalize
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.org in order to fit the tuxfamily.org requirements.
</I>&gt;<i> If I'm alone to defend this radicalization, ok I will wait and as you said
</I>&gt;<i> one time FOSS will win :) (I hope so).
