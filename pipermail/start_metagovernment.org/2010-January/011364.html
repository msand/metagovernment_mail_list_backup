An issue we didn't get to at the last meeting, but which certainly  
deserves consideration is migrating the wiki away from MediaWiki and  
into a member project's software such as Candiwi or Draft2Gether.

If we decide to make such a transition, we would probably need to  
migrate all the content from the old wiki, then vote on whether or not  
to go live with it. That would be the perfect opportunity to drop the  
non-commercial clause, since any previous editor who wishes to keep  
their contributions non-commercial would then technically be able to  
vote against that content.
