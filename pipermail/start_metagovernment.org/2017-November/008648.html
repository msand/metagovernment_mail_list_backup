Actually, it's still running (<A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A>). I've even
updated it a few times, but only bug fixes as I've been swamped with
work in the real world and so haven't had time to do any feature
upgrades (and I've got a whole list of them, starting with upgrading
to Angular 4 which will enable many of the others).

I also was able to leverage it to submit what I think was a very
credible entry to the Global Challenges competition, even though it
explicitly didn't comply with many of the rules (my claim was that any
entry that did would by design fail to achieve anything, let alone the
kind of change that they were trying to facilitate). As part of that I
also experienced a bit of a shift in my general philosophy about the
local/global balance of power: I'm coming around to a more localist
perspective, albeit with a few explicit tweaks to prevent antisocial
behavior at the locality level. Haven't had time to update the
matchism.org site with this, though, either.

IMHO you've misdiagnosed the problem. Egos *are* a major problem with
our existing misrepresentative governments, but these projects I think
suffer mainly from lack of resources and to a lesser extent with lack
of understanding (or perhaps vision) about what we really need to
solve our problems with previous versions of democracy. Case in point
is the Democracy Earth project, which I've been playing gadfly to
recently. Here's a link to the paper (read the PDF), then click on the
&quot;Issues&quot; tab and read the critiques and comments about them:
