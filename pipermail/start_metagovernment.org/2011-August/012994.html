<PRE>I like the script, especially the first 3rd.  It reads well.  But then
it leaves me all revved up with no place to go.  It highlights the
problems, but offers no solutions.  About half way through, I feel
cheated.

I think what's lacking at this stage is the means, not the motivation.

</I>&gt;<i> What I have scripted so far follows this outline:
</I>&gt;<i> - Problems with representative democracy
</I>&gt;<i> - Traditional problems with direct democracy
</I>&gt;<i> - Introduction to collaborative governance
</I>&gt;<i> - Some introduction to some member projects, perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is turning out to possibly be somewhat long. How long should a  
</I>&gt;<i> movie like this be? I was initially thinking of 5 minutes, but I  
</I>&gt;<i> wonder if 15 or even 30 minutes would be more engaging. Or would it  
</I>&gt;<i> just be boring?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Another approach would be to make it a series of three or four 5- 
</I>&gt;<i> minute movies; one about each of the points above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
