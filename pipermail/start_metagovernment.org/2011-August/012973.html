<PRE>Do not take it personally Matteo, I think the goal is more difficult
than you imagine.  I'm pretty sure it requires a technical solution
that has yet to be implemented.  (The manual is for admins and doesn't
say much about this.)

If you can repost to the Votorola list, it's maybe a better place to
discuss the details.  <A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> ideas, however I would like to make few points about it.  My
</I>&gt;<i> impression reading the manual is that Votorola is bound to be a very
</I>&gt;<i> powerful and flexible system, still I fear that it may be that its
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility may become one of its weakest points.
