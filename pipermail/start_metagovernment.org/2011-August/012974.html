<PRE>Instead of guessing whether or not Matteo can imagine the goal or not, maybe
you could suggest to enlighten him and others about it or do so right away.

So what exactly is the problem? And what is the goal?

On the one hand, in the past we were talking about finding communities that
use votorola or other metagov tools to give valuable feedback, but on the
other hand votorola or whatever other systems are there need more
implementation until they are ready for communities to use them. That's
contradictionary.

I think the &quot;flexibility&quot; in votorola has a fatal flaw, thus its flexible
concept and how it is supposed to work is not communicated in a simple and
powerful fashion, ... because if it is, this fatal flaw can be turned into
its greatest strength.

Is Votorola really a system or more a concept?

Votorola is orchestrating communities and their effort to find consensus.
Therefor it takes the tool a single community uses as an &quot;atomic element&quot;
from which it hopes to get input. Does votorola care for the tool a
community uses? Does it want them to use votorolas wiki-like tools? If not,
how does it import the results from the community?

What is the current status of votorola, what has been done, what needs to be
done?
I think information like this is valuable to many people on this list and
not only about votorola, but about all the the metagov tools.
Something that fits on one page and is updated once a month, so that people
know about the progress and whether they soon could consider to use the
tools or not. It might also be of interest for anyone who joins the list to
see what needs to be done and where or how to help. ...

Do not take it personally Matteo, I think the goal is more difficult
than you imagine.  I'm pretty sure it requires a technical solution
that has yet to be implemented.  (The manual is for admins and doesn't
say much about this.)

If you can repost to the Votorola list, it's maybe a better place to
discuss the details.  <A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/</A>
