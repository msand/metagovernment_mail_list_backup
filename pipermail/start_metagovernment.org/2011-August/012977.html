<PRE>In my opinion, it should be a easy to follow step by step flow chart model -
yes and no at each stage leading you to the next level with option to go
back to previous level. No one should be able to make mistakes and loose
track.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> at first, I apologize for not commenting much here.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that, same as many people here, I have much work to do and
</I>&gt;<i> not much spare time.
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I have been focusing more on trying to help building a community
</I>&gt;<i> around Votorola and the Metagovernment project, instead of participating
</I>&gt;<i> directly in helping building the software.
</I>&gt;<i> I have managed to get some people like Armando and Nicola to become
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully) interested in the project, but no other people brought by me are
</I>&gt;<i> joining or plan to join the project and contributing.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope I will perform better from now on.
</I>&gt;<i> As for the project itself, I believe it has some excellent points and
</I>&gt;<i> ideas, however I would like to make few points about it.
</I>&gt;<i> My impression reading the manual is that Votorola is bound to be a very
</I>&gt;<i> powerful and flexible system, still I fear that it may be that its
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility may become one of its weakest points.
</I>&gt;<i> I have the feeling reading the manual that Votorola may become too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to use for the normal guy, I do not know how many people would be
</I>&gt;<i> able to understand the difference between voting for a proposal and
</I>&gt;<i> endorsing a person, I still do not understand the difference properly after
</I>&gt;<i> reading the theory few times.
</I>&gt;<i> As for the level of endorsement there is no limitation on this, which makes
</I>&gt;<i> the system very flexible, but what about understanding who created which law
</I>&gt;<i> and how many people voted for it?
</I>&gt;<i> My suspect is that, while &quot;geek&quot; people may be able to handle the system
</I>&gt;<i> properly, the usual ordinary guys may have a problem with it.
</I>&gt;<i> When I first thought about a system of direct voting such as Votorola, I
</I>&gt;<i> was thinking about making it simpler.
</I>&gt;<i> For example, only two levels of delegation, not more.****
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This is just an example of proposal)
</I>&gt;<i> The reason why software like Facebook and Skype has become so successful is
</I>&gt;<i> that was built around a trade-off between flexibility and easiness of use.
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if Votorola  is not becoming too powerful and flexible but little
</I>&gt;<i> bit too much &quot;geeky&quot; to be used by non-geeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Matteo****
