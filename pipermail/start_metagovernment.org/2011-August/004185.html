<PRE>Hi all,
at first, I apologize for not commenting much here.
The problem is that, same as many people here, I have much work to do and not much spare time.
So far, I have been focusing more on trying to help building a community around Votorola and the Metagovernment project, instead of participating directly in helping building the software.
I have managed to get some people like Armando and Nicola to become (hopefully) interested in the project, but not so many other people brought by me are joining the project and contributing.
I hope I will perform better from now on.
As for the project itself, I believe it has some excellent points and ideas, however I would like to make few points about it.
My impression reading the manual is that Votorola is bound to be a very powerful and flexible system, still I fear that it may be that its flexibility may become one of its weakest points.
