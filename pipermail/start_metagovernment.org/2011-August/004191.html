<PRE>To all:At first I apologize for the mess I did with sending mails to this list.This is the problem of trying to comment on this list while doing your usual job with your boss looking after you :)
I would like to be clear that I definitely love the concept of Votorola and there are some very good ideas behind it.I just tried to read and understand the manual of Votorola in the past few days, there are some good ideas but I got the impression that the manual is not so easy to understand.Maybe it is just me.Or maybe Votorola at the end will need a good GUI (Interface) to attract usual people.&#160;In my view of things, any kind of &quot;Internet-democracy&quot; system needs to be used by the masses to become successful.I fear some people, especially people with not so much knowledge of software may have some problems in understanding concepts like vote delegation, communicative and mass assent, etc.But, again, please remember that this is just my impression and I may well be wrong.In any case, I am not implying that Votorola should be changed, just that we should maybe consider in the future the possibility to add some interface or some manual to make the whole
 system easier to understand to the public.
As for now, I am looking to contributing to the completion of the system as it is!
Regards,Matteo
