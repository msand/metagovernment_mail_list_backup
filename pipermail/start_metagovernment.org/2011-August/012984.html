<PRE>Sure :-)
Some time ago I was talking to Thomas about doing such a thing, but it was
about a powerpoint slideshow and not about a video, but a video would be
even better ;)

Maybe we could do the script in powerpoint? ...maybe we could use
slideshare.com?
I think it's a lot more fun to do it through powerpoint and then rearrange
the slides till it fits.

I think we could use google to find appropriate pictures of everything we
need to put it together.
As soon as the script is done, we could redo all the slides with copyleft
pictures.

Subject: [MG] Lets make a movie about collaborative governance

Would you like to join me in making a movie about this project?

I am thinking of something pretty simple: not lots of flashy video and  
sound, but more like a well-polished slideshow with a voiceover.  
Something which can more directly make the case for what we are trying  
to build, since a lot of people respond to video better than to text.

I've started writing the script. So far, I've mostly talked about what  
is wrong with the status quo. Next is to talk about what is right with  
collaborative governance, and then to tell people what they can do to  
make it happen.

My time is still very pressed these days, but I'll try to keep working  
on the script. Or you are welcome to contribute. Here it is:

Once the script is done, I (or someone else?) can put together the  
video. What I was thinking would be really cool is if we crowdsource  
the narration. Instead of just me narrating the whole thing, how about  
if each one of us narrates one or a few paragraphs?

What do you think? Are you in?
