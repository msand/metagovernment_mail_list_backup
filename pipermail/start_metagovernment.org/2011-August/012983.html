<PRE>Nice :-) But I think a key to that explains the symbols could help a lot.
What is a green circle?
What is a yellow pentagon? (with numbers and without)
What is the ghost dot?
What is the red text?
What is the red numbers?

Subject: Re: [MG] About Votorola

I never could compose a text summary of the whole thing.  Maybe it's
too complicated or too abstract, or maybe I just lack the skill.  The
best I could accomplish is that list of links backed by a graphic.  I
took the same approach on Votorola's home page, throwing away the text
and replacing it with this: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.xht">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.xht</A>

Later we'll float a live widget at the top and pull people straight
into Crossforum Theatre.  I'm coding that now.

Best to all,

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> at first, I apologize for not commenting much here.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that, same as many people here, I have much work to do and
</I>&gt;<i> not much spare time.
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I have been focusing more on trying to help building a community
</I>&gt;<i> around Votorola and the Metagovernment project, instead of participating
</I>&gt;<i> directly in helping building the software.
</I>&gt;<i> I have managed to get some people like Armando and Nicola to become
</I>&gt;<i> (hopefully) interested in the project, but not so many other people
</I>brought
&gt;<i> by me are joining the project and contributing.
</I>&gt;<i> I hope I will perform better from now on.
</I>&gt;<i> As for the project itself, I believe it has some excellent points and
</I>ideas,
&gt;<i> however I would like to make few points about it.
</I>&gt;<i> My impression reading the manual is that Votorola is bound to be a very
</I>&gt;<i> powerful and flexible system, still I fear that it may be that its
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility may become one of its weakest points.
