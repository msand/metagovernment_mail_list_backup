<PRE>This overview  (<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>) looks very
nice and I find it very impressive, but it's still a bit technical.
If you already know what the components can do, it probably makes a lot of
sense, but if you are not so familiar with all the different elements it's
still very confusing.
Is there a one-page-description that roughly describes the elements and
their purpose and how they work together?
Maybe I'm not the only one who would like to know about it :-)

Thank you for the nice response :)

Subject: [MG] About Votorola

 


Hi all,
at first, I apologize for not commenting much here.
The problem is that, same as many people here, I have much work to do and
not much spare time.
So far, I have been focusing more on trying to help building a community
around Votorola and the Metagovernment project, instead of participating
directly in helping building the software.
I have managed to get some people like Armando and Nicola to become
(hopefully) interested in the project, but not so many other people brought
by me are joining the project and contributing.
I hope I will perform better from now on.
As for the project itself, I believe it has some excellent points and ideas,
however I would like to make few points about it.
My impression reading the manual is that Votorola is bound to be a very
powerful and flexible system, still I fear that it may be that its
flexibility may become one of its weakest points.
