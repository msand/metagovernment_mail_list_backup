Well, the status quo is cheating you. :) I wanted to lay out all the  
problems before approaching the solution. I just haven't gotten to the  
solution part yet.

&gt;<i> I think what's lacking at this stage is the means, not the motivation.
</I>
Means for the movie? I am pretty sure it can be done &quot;on the cheap&quot;  
and still look pretty good. I am hoping to use presentation software  
to composite it, then something like iMovie to overlay a soundtrack.  
Of course, anyone with better means or capabilities is welcome to step  
up here.

OK, for now I'll keep thinking of the script as a singular entity to  
see what it looks like as a whole. Then we can look at segmenting it.

Artistically, these are over my head. But again, if someone else feels  
up to it, please feel free...
