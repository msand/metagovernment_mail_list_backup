I think Matteo can imagine the goal.  He states clearly that his aim
is a community of contributors.  What I think he underestimates - and
who doesn't? - is the difficulty of achieving that goal.

I would answer further, but not here.  Please see below.

Well, what is done (for better or worse) is presented here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>

What still needs doing (it isn't carved in granite) is discussed here:
<A HREF="http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/">http://mail.zelea.com/list/votorola/</A>
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/votorola/">http://zelea.com/var/cache/irc/votorola/</A>

Those are good places to talk about Votorola, Crossforum Theatre and
the Outcast network.  We were asked to move the technical chatter out
of this list, and I feel it is only appropriate that we comply.
