True, and it's proper to study the problems first.

This may help.  Here I pinpoint the source of the problems in a flaw
of conventional election methods:
<A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2011-August/028266.html">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2011-August/028266.html</A>

We can make the experts (like Warren) squirm as they try to defend
their election methods against the implication that *they* are
cheating us of democracy.  It works like this:

  1. The rules of conventional election methods leave the individual
     voter entirely powerless, with no say whatsoever in the outcome
     of the election, or anything else.

     This will surprise many people, but I think the math experts in
     that list must admit to the truth of it.

  2. Their only defence is to suggest that multiple voters *together*
     might influence the outcome of the election by coordinating their
     votes.

  3. At that point, they are confronted with this historical scenario:

       (a) The flawed voting method renders the individual voter
           powerless in the election.

       (b) A power vacuum is created.

       (c) The party system steps into the power vacuum.

       (d) The party system comes to dominate government and
           democracy.

     From (a) to (d), it follows:

       (e) The party system is an artifact of the election method.
           The election method is propagating a systematic distortion
           of democracy *through* the effects of the party system.

This is what the voting experts must answer for.  I'd feel less
cheated if they fessed up and shared in the responsibility. :-)
