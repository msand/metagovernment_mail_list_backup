Hi Max,

As you know, when philosophers such as Rawls and Habermas use the term 
&quot;rational discourse&quot;, they actually mean something special by it.

    Rawls&gt; Our exercise of political power is fully proper only when it
    is exercised in accordance with a constitution, the essentials of
    which all citizens as free and equal may be reasonably expected to
    endorse in the light of principles and ideals acceptable to their
    common human reason -- Political Liberalism, p.137

After Mike turned me on to Habermas a while ago, I started finding the 
term popping up in my own writing.

But then last summer at a certain point, Stephen gently took me aside 
and apprised me of his observation that &quot;rational discourse sounds like 
something a bunch of old-white-male-philoshphy professors do for fun on 
a Friday night while sipping Sherry and smoking cigars.&quot; Since then, I 
have been attempting to discretely distance myself from the term. 
(Nothing personal, just business -- some of my best friends are rational 
...).

So anyway, should I take your remarks to be actionable in some way?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

On a perhaps related note, awhile back you had this to say:

    7. The two stones I wish to place in the mosaic matrix is a
    discussion format and a document creation process that makes
    everyone more thoughtful. Doing this with respect to public policy
    discussions is no more urgent than with respect to many other areas.
    But I believe if we cannot get more thoughtfulness we all will
    continue as we have been in terms of results.

Are either of those stones ready to place yet? (If not as operational 
systems, at least in the form of functional specifications and design 
notes and such ...)
