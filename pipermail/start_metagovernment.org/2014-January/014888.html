&gt;<i> Hi Alex,

</I>&gt;<i>    if you use &quot;permanent voting&quot;, that means you can vote for something

</I>&gt;<i>    then voting is &quot;always on&quot; and between switching your vote from one

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    ... so if you think about time and continuous permanent voting, then
</I>&gt;<i>    i dont see the difference between those, more that they complement

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; What appears to be missing in what you are saying is the occurrence
</I>&gt;<i> of actually making a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At the point that the decision regarding the proposal (or whatever) is
</I>&gt;<i> actually made, that ends the decision process for that matter. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> permanent anything beyond that point for that proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Why?
Count total votes and if the decision rule decides in favor of proposal X,
it is decided for. A minute later, some people might withdraw their votes
so that the favor turns against proposal X, so it now stops and is
prevented. Next day, it turns again in favor of proposal X, so it is
continued. Whats the problem?
Its radical, but who cares? Its the only solution.


&gt;<i> (After the decision has been made, the matter would be reopened by making
</I>&gt;<i> a brand new proposal, that would then go through its own decision process
</I>&gt;<i> and be decided.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
why?
if u want it to be that way, i wonder way, i wouldnt want it to be that way.


If we specifically focus on decision making, then the decision rule that
&gt;<i> will be used really is an either/or question. There is no convergence, no
</I>&gt;<i> matter how long the actual making of the decision is delayed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Its not delayed. its decided all the time.



&gt;<i> (The decision outcomes may or may not converge that two different decision
</I>&gt;<i> rules might produce, but any particular decision itself will be made using
</I>&gt;<i> a specific decision rule.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Continual voting does create a &quot;video&quot; of the status quo (successive
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;snapshots&quot;), but it does not produce a decision so long as the voting
</I>&gt;<i> process remains open.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

its not open, its final all the time.
if 50 people vote against death penalty and 51 vote for death penalty, than
&quot;death penalty&quot; is put into practice ...UNTIL at least one person changes
its mind. ...sometimes this could lead to: 5:31pm &quot;death penalty is an
option&quot;, 5:43pm &quot;death penalty is not an option&quot; 5:51pm &quot;death penalty is
an option&quot;, 6:13pm &quot;death penalty is not an option&quot;.
I believe for almost everything, vote proportions would be somehow stable
for most active laws or whatever proposals could be.
For those which are currently heavy discussed in public, they would
fluctuate a lot until they become stable... after a long public discussion.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If a for-profit company were to leave matters open forever
</I>&gt;<i> (continual/permanent voting), thus never actually making any decisions, the
</I>&gt;<i> for-profit company would fail, as would any democratic polity that never
</I>&gt;<i> actually made any decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
1. countries are not for-profit organisations.
2. even in ngo's it could work.
3. i believe, if structured efficiently, it would even work for for-profit
companies, but that is something not that important to this mailinglist and
it is still to be proven :-) but i bet there is already examples out there,
where they handle it like that and they work.
One example is the german company: &quot;Premium Cola&quot;


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eventually the decision must be made, and that will involve selecting a
</I>&gt;<i> specific decision rule. Yes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If i were allowed to choose, i would want a permanent decision rule. this
would probably also render quite a couple of &quot;strategic voting problems&quot;
obsolete.
