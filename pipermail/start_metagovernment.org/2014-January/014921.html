<PRE>Separately, I will provide a few reasons that might explain why I am getting so confused by your explanations. I'm going to quote bits from various responses you've made as I've pressed for this one thing.


&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO presentation provides a particular formalization of the meaning of &quot;defensible in discourse&quot;. If that formalization is still not clear enough, I will greatly appreciate any feedback you can offer to help me make it more clear.
</I>
Okay, you say that, but the word &quot;defensible&quot; does not even appear in the MLOVRTO presentation. So how is that a definition? I do not see anything on this page that defines what the defensible-in-discourse standard actually means.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO</A>

In fact, most of your explanations are pure, single-sentence assertions. Example: &quot;The opposite is true.&quot; That is not an explanation.


&gt;<i> #6 Items are put onto the list by successfully proposing that they be put on it. Items are removed from the list by successfully proposing that they be removed.
</I>
and in defense of that:
&gt;<i> The step #6 that you quote above is indeed the step that specifies how items are put onto and taken off of the list, after it has been created as an empty list.
</I>
How is that an explanation? I see no reasoning here, except that things are added or removed. But *why* are they added or removed? Who makes that decision? What standard is used for that decision?


&gt;<i> But it is also possible to set up instantiations in which NO ONE has any kind of special authority with respect to such matters.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO decision system is absolutely egalitarian -- everyone that participates is equally a proposer, on absolutely equal footing.
</I>

This is not an explanation, but pure assertion. There is nothing here explaining *why* the &quot;MLOVRTO decision system&quot; is egalitarian. I do not see that explanation anywhere. That's why I keep asking for it.

So I have offered the above merely as explanation for why I don't see you answering the one question I have been asking. You don't need to respond to all of my points here because I have not made any. All I really need is for you to please fill in the blank in my previous message.

&gt;<i> Hi, Ned.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to simplify this conversation both for my benefit and for anyone who is not up for pouring through many different links leading to long, complex, unconventionally-formatted explanations. So I'm going to state this very briefly and see if you object to my characterization and if you can help fill in the blank. (And no, I just don't see the answer to the blank below in any of the links you provided... sorry if I didn't get through all of it.) Then I can go into detail on the issues; once I understand this one thing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ed and Ned agree that proposals should be implemented only if there are no unresolved objections to them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ed tentatively defines a proposal as having unresolved objections when there are any significant number of dissenters as defined by a percentage of the total number of people voting on that proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned defines unresolved objections as any objection which is defensible in discourse. And the standard of &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; is not inherently subjective (and thus arbitrary and thus authoritarian) because _________.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree with you that, if we can get through this (which we will), that will be a Very Good Thing, for many reasons.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Ed&gt; I continue to not understand what you define NUO as. Every time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  you describe it, there appears to be some intelligent selection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  mechanism. That sounds to me like a person exercising authority. Can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  you please very simply (as in, in one paragraph) explain how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  something can be defined as having no unresolved objections without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  someone making that decision on their own authority. And if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  answer is that there is some other standard by which objections are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  judged, then who makes that standard?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The MLOVRTO PROPOSAL that sets up the MLOVRTO Decision System (if the proposal succeeds) defines very precisely what NUO means for that particular version of NUO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to help me try to make that definition more clear, would it be possible for you to talk to me specifically about what you do not understand in that proposal?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Earlier, you were confused about step 3 of that proposal. Did I succeed in clearing up that confusion?
