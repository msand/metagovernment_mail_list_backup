<PRE>Hi Bentley, (Great Questions!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; I think a clarification of &quot;UnResolved&quot; would be helpful.

Ned&gt; Yes! So I will try.

Reaching decisions through &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; has been around as 
an ordinary part of everyday life since the dawn of the human experience 
on earth. It is not Rocket Science (except when rocket scientists are 
conversing).

When a jury of 12 convenes for the first time after closing arguments, 
they will typically start with a show of hands: &quot;Everybody who thinks 
that Mortimer is guilty, raise hands.&quot; The show of hands is not a vote 
that decides, but a poll that shows where to begin.

If ten raise hands and two do not, the group will then turn to the first 
of the two and ask: &quot;Adeline, why do you not think that Mortimer is 
guilty?&quot; Adeline will then respond with her reasons: &quot;I think that The 
Butler Did It, because he has such strong hands, and because, well, he's 
the butler.&quot;

Mary may then say: &quot;But Adeline, there is traffic cam footage showing 
that the butler was in Tampa when things went down.&quot; If Adeline's 
response to this is &quot;Hmmph!&quot;, this response from Adeline acknowledges to 
the group that she understands and accepts that her objection to the 
guilt of Mortimer on the basis that the butler has strong hands and is 
the butler has been successfully resolved.

Resolving objections is all about getting to &quot;Hmmph!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; SettleIt.org could consider an objections resolved if there
    is a higher weight of pros for the decision. I'm not sure if that
    would be the same as your proposal.

Ned&gt; You are correct that it is not the same. In the system of my 
proposal, each particular objection remains unresolved so long as there 
has been no successful objection to it.

In general, if a proposal has even one objection to it that has NOT been 
(knocked-down = resolved), then the proposal HAS BEEN (knocked-down = 
resolved).

(We may find that in practice there are exceptions to this, and we may 
find that we need a richer ontology than resolved/unresolved. Also, 
there may be cases where &quot;partially resolved&quot; ratings are useful. But 
such ratings will need some serious rationalization and validation -- 
they will not be simple counts of how many objections there are.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; Can you provide a one sentence description of what criteria
    must exist for an objection to be resolved?

Ned&gt; Philosophers such as Habermas and Rawls have spent their entire 
lives trying to come up with criteria that we might all agree to, that 
could form sufficient basis for resolving objections to allow us to live 
peacefully and productively together on the planet.

Procedurally, if (A) proposes and then (B) objects, the objection must 
be based on considerations that have previously been successfully 
proposed as valid bases for objection (the Golden Rule or whatever).

To resolve (B)'s objection, someone must then object to (B)'s objection, 
with the second objection again based on considerations that have 
previously been successfully proposed as valid bases for objection.

(Darn! That was three sentences!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; Does every participant need to agree that an objection is
    resolved or is there a process to make sure a suggestion was
    considered and accommodated as well as possible?

Ned&gt; Because the decision process is multi-threaded (multiple 
simultaneous objections) and recursive (objections to objections to 
objections), it is really confusing to think about the process as being 
&quot;straight and flat&quot;. Voting systems are typically &quot;straight and flat&quot; -- 
one proposal, one decision.

(SettleIt, on the other hand, is multi-threaded and recursive. But the 
scoring algorithm does not give each particular element an up/down 
status based on the up/down statuses of the individual elements in the 
recursive level below it -- did I get that right?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Bentley&gt; Could a single irrational person block a decision without
    reason or consequence?

Ned&gt; The single irrational person would need to come up with a valid 
objection -- an objection based on considerations that had previously 
been successfully proposed as valid bases for objection.

To answer the question more directly, the person would need not just a 
reason, but a valid reason.

In the jury example above, Adeline actually has a full veto. Even after 
she has said &quot;Hmmph!&quot;, she can still hold to her position that Mortimer 
is not guilty, and the jury will be &quot;hung&quot;.

In the system we are setting up, if &quot;Hmmph!&quot; were advanced as the basis 
for an objection, someone would object that &quot;Hmmph!&quot; had not been 
previously successfully proposed as a valid basis for objections, and 
the &quot;Hmmph!&quot; objection would thereby be (knocked down = resolved).
