<PRE>Hi Max,

Sounds like fun -- I am looking forward to seeing the results. Here are 
my ten candidate survey items. (Do with them as you will -- they belong 
to you now.)

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1. Definition: Proposal Filter

      A &quot;proposal filter&quot; is a conception of some sort that proposals
      must successfully &quot;pass through&quot; in order to be eligible to be
      implemented. (Examples to follow ...)

      Once successfully proposed to a particular public decision system,
      a proposal filter can function as the basis for objecting to
      subsequent particular proposals made to that decision system.

      Is this definition/explanation clear enough?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No ------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu ------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   2. Golden Rule

      (JGR) &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept the Golden Rule as a valid proposal
      filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No ------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu ------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   3. Discourse Principle (Habermas)

      (HDP) &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly
      affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept the Discourse Principle as a valid
      proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -----&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -----&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   4. Precautionary Principle

      (WPP) &quot;If an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm
      to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific
      consensus that the action or policy is harmful, the burden of
      proof that it is NOT harmful falls on those proposing the policy
      or action.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept the Precautionary Principle as a
      valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -----&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -----&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   5. &quot;Better&quot; Can Filter

      (BCF) &quot;When a proposal is made, and an objection is made
      containing or pointing to an arguably &quot;better&quot; alternative
      (faster, greener, cheaper, etc.), and if the objection itself
      succeeds, then it will serve as a filter through which the
      original proposal has not successfully passed.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept (BCF) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   6. Cost/Benefit Can Filter

      (CBF) &quot;When a proposal is made, and a objection is made arguing
      that the benefit of implementation will not be great enough to
      justify the cost, and if the objection itself succeeds, then it
      will serve as a filter through which the original proposal has not
      successfully passed.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept (CBF) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   7. Value Prioritizations Can Filter

      (VPF) &quot;When a proposal is made, and an objection is made arguing
      that implementing the proposal would violate a previously
      successfully proposed value prioritization (e.g., avoiding species
      extinction trumps the specified benefits of constructing a new
      dam), and if the objection itself succeeds, then it will serve as
      a filter through which the original proposal has not successfully
      passed.

      Would you be willing to accept (VPF) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   8. The Prime Directive

      (TPD) &quot;(Globally) For democracy to sustain itself, there must be
      (by design) no concentrations of power entailed, caused, or
      permitted within the social system. Such concentrations set up
      positive feedback loops, which will eventually concentrate power
      to the point that democracy will /de facto/ go away.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept (TPD) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   9. The Second Second Amendment

      (SSA) &quot;(Globally) Organized police and military forces must not
      possess any weapons that are more potent than those legally and
      affordably available to private individuals.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept (SSA) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  10. Governance Design #1

      (GD1) &quot;In our governance designs: no distinctions between
      governors and governed.&quot;

      Would you be willing to accept (GD1) as a valid proposal filter?

         1. Yes
         2. Maybe --&gt; Comment Box: Why maybe?
         3. No -------&gt; Comment Box: Why not?
         4. Mu -------&gt; Comment Box: (anything ...)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

</I>&gt;<i> I decided to implement yet another test decision attempt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Someone mentioned that the mailing list member list has about 200

</I>&gt;<i> community.  Since typically being a member of a mailing list does not

</I>&gt;<i> size of the MG community, depending on definitions, is likely to be 
</I>&gt;<i> smaller.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Polls and surveys are an important part of the political process 
</I>&gt;<i> around me.  If I sent a survey out to the names on the mailing list, 
</I>&gt;<i> simply the number of responses would be interesting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It appears that survey monkey will help do surveys for free as long as 
</I>&gt;<i> the number of responses is limited to 100.  The survey can have up to 
</I>&gt;<i> ten questions.  The survey monkey site says they are good people with 
</I>&gt;<i> respect to confidentiality. ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So here is the decision process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The admin of the shared resource, the mailing list, says he will 
</I>&gt;<i> cooperate under some sort of protocol.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I say that I am enthusiastic and will spend the rest of this month 
</I>&gt;<i> making this work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Five or more MG members submit one or more questions in a format and 
</I>&gt;<i> content and size that I approve. My decisions here will be 
</I>&gt;<i> transparent.  My inclinations are to short likker approval questions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No one says I will do whatever I can to stop this survey.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think it too obvious to say but notice there was a statement 
</I>&gt;<i> of leadership, resource controller approval, participation commitment, 
</I>&gt;<i> and no one is willing to commit to war as a decision criteria.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The anticipated consequence is we know how many responses we get.  We 
</I>&gt;<i> may have useful reports on responses to up to ten questions. The maybe 
</I>&gt;<i> unanticipated consequences might be privacy violations and offensive 
</I>&gt;<i> stupidity on my or your part.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So continuing,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have a leadership commitment.  Who might want this survey to happen?
</I>&gt;<i>
