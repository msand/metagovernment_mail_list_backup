<PRE>I'll put my name in as well as an avid participant, I believe in this cause
and will invest my free time into furthering its creation where ever I can.
I'll let you guys know now, I am pretty clueless when it comes to computers
and their lingo, so that entire 2nd paragraph of max's was hard to follow.
Would you mind explaining it a bit? I paid for my site to be created that's
how little I know, but also how serious I am to this idea.

I think the tryouts are a good idea and will go a long way in discovering
what exactly our goals are together. Furthermore I'd be in favour of
creating some sort of beta site where we can implement and combine certain
tools that have a positive tryout period and see how they interact with
each other, try to form a real structured system.

This may be jumping the gun a bit, but even having a donation pot where
funds go towards the promotion and expansion of the metagovernment idea,
beefing up the beta site, internet video creation, ad space, whatever.
Things to attract members and get them excited about its potential.

Again I'll re-iterate my problem with this mailing list style of
communication, it's messy and awkward and if membership participation
increases and their's more replies coming in addressing various topics,
it's going to be very hard to manage. I believe that a communal discussion
forum would serve us much better for organizing ideas and categorizing
results. Again I'll offer my www.theinternetswebsite.com forum as I viable
alternative to this mailing list. Ed you were talking about linking a list
server to a forum, is there really much point in doing that if there's only
a few of us who participate anyway?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bentley Davis said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I would participate if Metagovernment hosts try-outs of tools
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; (even if my tool was not included).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And not otherwise?  I.e. no try-outs, no Bentley?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Again the basic form of the answer is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (answer) I will participate if X.  Otherwise I will not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's a two-fold promise, which means sincerity is doubly important.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone uncomfortable with sincerity is advised not to answer. ;^)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I would participate in other things also depending on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; availability and interest at that time. ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course, but the question (as I intend it) is what you'd *require*
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first in order to make yourself available and interested.  If you're
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already happy with the group and ready to participate in just about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything that comes down the pipeline (within reason), then the answer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (answer) I require nothing.  I like Metagov as it stands and will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             participate in just about anything here (within reason).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would be a valid answer if you're sincere about it, and a very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generous one.  Almost a blank cheque.  I doubt even Ed would be that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> generous with the group.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Like:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Attend presentations on tools and systems for enhancing government.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Participate in brainstorming sessions about tools needed for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Participate or attend debates on different methodologies of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Curate news articles and posts for people interested in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    governance. (on the wiki)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Build or piece together a tool for Metagov to communicate better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    this email thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Prototype suggested tools for collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Build a catalog of tools for collaborative governance with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> comparisons
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    and metrics (on the wiki)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Design a curriculum for people wishing to learn about the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    possibilities and history of collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create graphic videos to encourage people to join collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    governance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create info-graphics about the potential influence of collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Share information in my social media accounts about Metagov
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - condense these long emails into actionable or informative summaries
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create a marketing campaign and slogan (Government, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> productive...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Follow Eds lead and invite people with interesting projects to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> share
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    them on Metagov (although the experience was less than ideal)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Work on a suggested code of conduct for Metagov to foster positive
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    mutually beneficial interactions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Host a local meetup group to discuss Metagov
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Work on my own ideas for tools for collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;    - Give $10 a month to the organization Ed is starting.
