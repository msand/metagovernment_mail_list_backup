<PRE>People,

I decided to implement yet another test decision attempt.

Someone mentioned that the mailing list member list has about 200 names.
This then suggests an upper bound on the size of MG as a community.  Since
typically being a member of a mailing list does not imply receiving mail,
reading mail, or responding to mail, the actual size of the MG community,
depending on definitions, is likely to be smaller.

Polls and surveys are an important part of the political process around
me.  If I sent a survey out to the names on the mailing list, simply the
number of responses would be interesting.

It appears that survey monkey will help do surveys for free as long as the
number of responses is limited to 100.  The survey can have up to ten
questions.  The survey monkey site says they are good people with respect
to confidentiality. ?

So here is the decision process.

The admin of the shared resource, the mailing list, says he will cooperate
under some sort of protocol.

I say that I am enthusiastic and will spend the rest of this month making
this work.

Five or more MG members submit one or more questions in a format and
content and size that I approve. My decisions here will be transparent.  My
inclinations are to short likker approval questions.

No one says I will do whatever I can to stop this survey.

I would think it too obvious to say but notice there was a statement of
leadership, resource controller approval, participation commitment, and no
one is willing to commit to war as a decision criteria.

The anticipated consequence is we know how many responses we get.  We may
have useful reports on responses to up to ten questions. The maybe
unanticipated consequences might be privacy violations and offensive
stupidity on my or your part.

So continuing,

We have a leadership commitment.  Who might want this survey to happen?

Blessings,

Max
