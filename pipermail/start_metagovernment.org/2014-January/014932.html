<PRE>Hi Max,

Your first post was three steps ahead of me. I didn't get the gist of it 
until your response to Ed. (Sometimes I'm slow ...)

Assuming that I now understand the question (which may be questionable), 
here is one possible sequence of events:

Max&gt; Initial Proposal: (SUN)

    * It is proposed that I set up a nonprofit.

Max&gt; Initial Proposal: (IL)

    * The nonprofit will make a significant effort to influence legislation.

Max&gt; Initial Proposal: (L)

    * Basis: &quot;Each decision is to be legal per the IRS.&quot;
    * It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

Max&gt; Objection to (IL): (IL.1.L)

    * The IRS frowns on nonprofits influencing legislation. (aside: I
      don't actually know this, but the example seems to require it.)
      Therefore it is proposed that (IL) not be implemented, since doing
      so would violate (L).

Ned&gt; Did I get it right?

</I>&gt;<i> Ed,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.  I think you and Ned might want to reflect a bit more.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> reason is that my presentation asked about how the approval of a basis 
</I>&gt;<i> would  proceed.  That had as yet little to do with an actual decision 
</I>&gt;<i> to start a nonprofit but you jumped there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the proposed basis would have invalidated the proposed 
</I>&gt;<i> decision.  I wonder how that slipped by you.  I wonder.

</I>&gt;<i>     What happens next is that you (the only participant of the
</I>&gt;<i>     community agreeing on your proposal) can go ahead and start the
</I>&gt;<i>     nonprofit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     That will change one we have a charter; but asked what happens
</I>&gt;<i>     before there is a charter. Once there is a charter, then if, for
</I>&gt;<i>     example, we use a decision-rule similar to the one used for the
</I>&gt;<i>     Metagov wiki, then it will require a minimum of three people to
</I>&gt;<i>     make any binding decision, and the agreement among all voting
</I>&gt;<i>     parties must hold for at least a week (or more). If a fourth
</I>&gt;<i>     person jumps in and disagrees, then we start over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Also I should note that the nonprofit I hope to build has no
</I>&gt;<i>     intention of affecting legislation. I don't care what current
</I>&gt;<i>     governments do. They are the antiquated systems we intend to push
</I>&gt;<i>     out of the way as we present better, more effective, more
</I>&gt;<i>     democratic community institutions.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I recall Ed wants to create a nonprofit.  There is much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     interesting discussion about how to decide anything.  Something i
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     take away from the discussion is that it depends on what is to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     decided.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Jim White's letter suggest to me several concrete decisions to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     made around Ed's nonprofit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Here is one:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The nonprofit will make a significant effort to influence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     legislation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I propose then a basis: the decision is to be legal per the IRS. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     We label this L.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So somehow we need to decide if this is a valid basis.  We have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     no charter or members.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I say yes on the L basis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The basis is therefore approved.  Per me.  The only participant.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     What happens next?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
