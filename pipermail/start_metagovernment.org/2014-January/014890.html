I believe its the only system that ever worked, e.g. money.
money is a special voting system and it makes the world spin.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hadn't noticed you posting this before, but I thought you knew better
</I>&gt;<i> than to characterize advanced democracy systems (i.e., some Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> projects) as having anything to do with this antiquated, broken, primitive
</I>&gt;<i> form of voting. In philosophical terms, that's an inductive fallacy or
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a definist fallacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The above quote assumes that democracy is equivalent to majority rule. Our
</I>&gt;<i> form of democracy is about consensus. You will never find a consensus of
</I>&gt;<i> the voters &quot;voting themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> That's absurd. It is their treasury, and at least a few people will be
</I>&gt;<i> smart enough to understand that.* I cannot possibly imagine any
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance system where any proposal can be voted on without
</I>&gt;<i> the funding being a part of the proposal and the dialog. In a sense, most
</I>&gt;<i> government proposing is in fact about funding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *I boldly make the assertion that if consensus is defined as a massive
</I>&gt;<i> majority, such as 80-90% of participants, then there will always be 10-20%
</I>&gt;<i> of the people reasonable enough to stop stupidity from reigning.
</I>&gt;<i> Additionally, I do not think any past system can be compared to
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance, because in even current &quot;advanced democracies&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> most people are disenfranchised almost all the time: so their level of
</I>&gt;<i> interest and participation is nothing like what can be expected if they
</I>&gt;<i> have the power to participate in any decision as they please.
