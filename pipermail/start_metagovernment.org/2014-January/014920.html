<PRE>Hi, Ned.

I'm trying to simplify this conversation both for my benefit and for anyone who is not up for pouring through many different links leading to long, complex, unconventionally-formatted explanations. So I'm going to state this very briefly and see if you object to my characterization and if you can help fill in the blank. (And no, I just don't see the answer to the blank below in any of the links you provided... sorry if I didn't get through all of it.) Then I can go into detail on the issues; once I understand this one thing.


Ed and Ned agree that proposals should be implemented only if there are no unresolved objections to them.

Ed tentatively defines a proposal as having unresolved objections when there are any significant number of dissenters as defined by a percentage of the total number of people voting on that proposal.

Ned defines unresolved objections as any objection which is defensible in discourse. And the standard of &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; is not inherently subjective (and thus arbitrary and thus authoritarian) because _________.


Thanks!
