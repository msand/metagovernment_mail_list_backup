<PRE>Greetings, colleagues, and welcome to 2014!

With the new year in front of us, I'd like to ask you what your plans are for working on collaborative governance in the upcoming year, and what objectives you would like to see this group achieve.

For the group, I'd like to see us come up with a somewhat more formal internal governance structure. Adhocracy has worked well so far, but at some point we probably should (as programmers say) eat our own dog food.

I would also like to see us start up the blog we had talked about several years ago. I think it can be easy if we do it as a fairly open community blog where several people can be authors. I'll add ramping up the blog to my personal objectives (unless there are objections).

For my personal objectives, I hope to:
1. Start up an American non-profit 
2. Speak at at least two conferences on behalf of the group
3. Start up the blog and contribute to it periodically
4. Be a more frequent tester/experimenter with related/member software projects

That's all I have at the moment, but I'm open to suggestion if there is more others want from me. My time has been severely impinged upon for the past couple of years primarily due to family medical issues. But I am optimistic I will be finding more time in this year, and that you'll be hearing a lot more from me.

What would you like to see from this group, and what do you intend to do personally?
</PRE>
