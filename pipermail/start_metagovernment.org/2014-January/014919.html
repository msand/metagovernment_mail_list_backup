<PRE>Hi Ned,


I am ok with the response method. I'll follow it.


----------------------------------

Ned&gt; But what I discovered in the process of trying to tweak is that there
are problems intrinsic to all &quot;Count Votes&quot; systems that no amount of
tweaking can resolve, or even mitigate. I discovered what Alexander Tyler
among many others had discovered long before me: &quot;Count Votes&quot; systems
cannot be used to produce sustainable democracy. This was not what I had
expected to find.


 The whole point of my post is that I think there is no single
decision-making process that can &#8220;produce&#8221; sustainable democracy. The first
reason is that decision-making is just a part of the puzzle and my
experience and &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; tells me that although of utmost importance,
decision-making will not by itself sustain any kind of sustainable
democracy. So that, even if you think &#8220;vote counting&#8221; is terrible for
sustainable democracy, &#8220;NUO&#8221; will not by itself solve the problem you are
looking at. As posted before, &#8220;NUO&#8221; by itself can be good or bad. And, in
my point of view, the same applies to &#8220;vote count&#8221;. Circumstances
surrounding the problem-solving decision-making process are not to be
looked down at.

 ----------------------------------


Ned&gt; However, once I had &quot;grokked in fullness&quot; that &quot;Count Votes&quot; could not
serve as the basis for sustainable democracy, I then turned to the task of
trying to find/formulate a method of public-matter decision making that
WOULD be able to serve as the basis for sustainable democracy, at the
global scale.


Assuming that the best decision-making process is dependent on the
circumstances, I believe the first procedure (really really important) of a
social group is to decide, *for each problem*, what should be the
decision-making process for solving the issue. The choice of
decision-making process to be used should be &#8220;NUO&#8221; whenever possible; i.e.
everyone has a say, anyone can block a proposal for good reason, and
everyone feels good about the decision made at the end. So &#8220;NUO&#8221; should
apply here whenever possible, but not necessarily in the manner through
which the problem itself will be solved. It is entirely possible that the
group chooses in a certain situation to &#8220;count votes&#8221;. It is also entirely
possible that the group chooses someone to take care of the problem on its
own. And that is to be thought of as sustainable democracy, as everyone
chose that decision-making process in the most democratic way possible.


I am not saying this example is THE system for sustainable democracy, but
just making the point that I do not think there is a single method of
public-matter decision making that would be able to serve as the basis for
sustainable democracy. If you like I could give you real examples, but
mostly related to small groups.

 ----------------------------------


Ned&gt; From your perspective, the problem is that I won't compromise. From my
perspective, the problem is that you want us to jump out of the airplane
wearing parachutes that I know won't work.


I can certainly agree with you there, if the only parachute is &#8220;vote
count&#8221;. I am trying to wear as many parachutes as I can here in order to
solve the puzzle and I am finding that for each wind there will be
parachutes failing and parachutes working. In other words, you&#8217;ve got to
leave all the options on the table and, &#8220;NUO&#8221; way, decide &#8220;on the run&#8221;
which one to use.

 ----------------------------------

Gustavo&gt; (..) if you are imposing a no-vote system onto the world, how does
that make you different from those in power now?


Ned&gt; When you say this, I am confidant that you are reasonably responding
to something, but I confess that I have no idea what.


I was not clear. My point here is philosophical in nature, and not a
response to a text of yours. If you assume there is a single method of
public-matter decision making that would be able to serve as the basis for
sustainable democracy, at any scale, you are taking options away from
people that do not agree with your point of view. Now, I do not suppose we
are thinking about vanishing from the face of Earth the decision-making
process of tribal groups, Quaker groups, Gypsies, Tibetan Monks, and so on.
A sustainable governance system should not be based upon restricting
options from people, but embracing all of them and letting people choose
between them with the most freedom possible. This is very very difficult in
a national or global scale and I sympathize with the enormous challenge I
think Metagovernment faces. Right now most national &quot;democracies&quot; are stuck
with very rigid and hierarchical &#8220;vote counting&#8221;. The problem of democratic
governance is multilayered, but the rigidity of the decision-making process
is an important piece of this problem; in my view, more so than &#8220;vote
count&#8221; itself.

&gt;<i> Hi Gustavo,

</I>&gt;<i> In starting out, my thought is that we take tiny baby steps, to try to be

</I>&gt;<i> motivated to try to have us wind up working together.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One way for me to take baby steps is to do a sentence-by-sentence

</I>&gt;<i> news is, that is a thorough and efficient way to respond. One piece of bad
</I>&gt;<i> news is that it would produce a book-length response, if I were to put all
</I>&gt;<i> the pieces into one post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, (unless/until you suggest otherwise), my plan is to start with the
</I>&gt;<i> first sentence of your post, and try to break my responses into &quot;one topic
</I>&gt;<i> per post&quot; pieces.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Gustavo&gt; Not sure I will be helpful here, but I think Ned is really
</I>&gt;<i>    trying to figure out how to not solve problems through voting and
</I>&gt;<i>    hierarchical structures. And that his main problem is with issues
</I>&gt;<i>    related to tyranny of the majority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; When I first started working on the project that has led to Isonomea
</I>&gt;<i> and Blinap, my thinking was pretty much entirely &quot;in the box&quot;. At the
</I>&gt;<i> start, I viewed the project as being about writing planks for a new
</I>&gt;<i> political party. In fact, the original name for the project was &quot;The Meek
</I>&gt;<i> Party Platform&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During the first three years of the project, I assumed without question
</I>&gt;<i> that voting could be made to &quot;work&quot;, and that the problem was just a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tuneup&quot; problem -- a matter of finding just the right tweaks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what I discovered in the process of trying to tweak is that there are
</I>&gt;<i> problems intrinsic to all &quot;Count Votes&quot; systems that no amount of tweaking
</I>&gt;<i> can resolve, or even mitigate. I discovered what Alexander Tyler among many

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Gustavo&gt; If that is so Ned, than I think we are in need of a certain
</I>&gt;<i>    level of compromise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; From your perspective, the problem is that I won't compromise. From
</I>&gt;<i> my perspective, the problem is that you want us to jump out of the airplane

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Gustavo&gt; I believe your phylosophical and political points are
</I>&gt;<i>    essentially right. But if you are imposing a no-vote system onto the
</I>&gt;<i>    world, how does that make you different from those in power now? It
</I>&gt;<i>    would be a contradiction.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; When you say this, I am confidant that you are reasonably responding
</I>&gt;<i> to something, but I confess that I have no idea what. What have I said that
</I>&gt;<i> has led you to the view that I want to impose anything on anyone? (If you
</I>&gt;<i> could cite quotes from me and provide their contexts, that would be very
</I>&gt;<i> helpful.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Once I know what has caused you to say this, then I will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> respond further ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will now ship this as my first response to your excellent post, even
</I>&gt;<i> though it actually contains three topics:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1. Can &quot;Count Votes&quot; serve as the basis for sustainable democracy?
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Is it a good idea to compromise when the compromise solution won't
</I>&gt;<i>      work?
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Does Ned want to impose anything on anyone?
</I>&gt;<i>
