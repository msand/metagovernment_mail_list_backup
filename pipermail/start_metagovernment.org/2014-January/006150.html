<PRE>My question is prompted both by Bentley's post, and my earlier reply
to Reid.  I think participation in Metagov as a group is currently
lacking.  We each subscribe to the mailing list in order to further
our own purposes, which are largely independent of others' purposes.
So we use Metagov instrumentally, as we might use any mailing list.

What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it did
*not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in order
to participate even when it was not directly in your own interest, but
rather for the sake of the group?

The answers would give us a sense of the potential purpose of Metagov,
and its potential membership.  We might then turn that potential into
something real.  For example:

(Answer) I will participate if Metagov takes deliberate aim and pushes
hard toward any goal that I care about.  Otherwise I will not.

That would be my answer.  What is your answer?
