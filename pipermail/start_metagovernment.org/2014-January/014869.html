<PRE>Hi Ned,

Sorry again for blundering into and briefly throw in my 2ct:

Well, is this really the one-million-dollar-question: Which decision rule to 
choose?

    A) &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot;
    B) &quot;Count Votes&quot;

IMHO there is no need to choose one rule over the other!

Because both rules not only typify different paradigms for decision-making, 
but they focus on entirely different aspects of the democratic process also! 
Hence in the end they are not comparable to each other. Thus no decision 
possible. (This reminds me of the Mission Impossible tune - really no clue 
why! ;o)

&gt;<i>From my point of view there are two serious differences; a qualitative and a 
</I>quantitative one:

    (1) While (A) focuses on equity, (B) strives for majority.
    (2) While (A) solely suits well for small groups, (B) can also handle 
large scale effectively.

This leads me to the assumption that we should implement *both* rules and 
choose which one to use depending on the current context of a decision to be 
made on demand.

What do you think?

Cheers
marc
