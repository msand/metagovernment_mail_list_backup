<PRE>Hi, Ned. For the sake of brevity (which I always advocate) I think I can simplify my objections to these key points:

&gt;<i> In a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, successful proposals are supported by being defensible in discourse, from the perspective of defensible considerations.
</I>
I don't see what &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; means. It sounds to me like a second, vague layer of decision rule, buried behind the no-objections one. It's a qualifier of what kind of objections are legitimate and what kind are not. So... who makes that decision? Who is the arbiter of reasonableness? Who gets to decide that something is being defended in discourse or not? If your answer in any way involves specific individuals, then how are those people not authoritarian?

&gt;<i> My contention is that the voting layer is unnecessary, extraordinarily expensive, and actually counter-productive in several ways.
</I>
I'd say the opposite (unless your answer to my question above is something I don't yet understand) -- that a continual, mutable voting system actually is necessary and greatly increases efficiency. How else is it decided that there are now no unresolved objections and thus a proposal should be acted upon? In a discussion where there are even a hundred active participants, how is one to follow everything and come to the conclusion that there are no unresolved objections? Wouldn't it help to have a scoreboard tracking that for you? A system like Votorola is only that.

&gt;<i> What does it add to make me have to track you down and ask you what your objection is? (If there are a million people not voting for my proposal, am I to track each one of them down?)
</I>
No, that's exactly what online systems help with. You don't have to track down anyone. You can identify the million people not voting for your proposal with a click, and you can address them all at once if the system chooses to allow for that. How is that inferior to trying to read everything all those million people have said and determining if they have reasonable objections?

&gt;<i> I would say that it [vote-count democracy] is not reasonable, and I would say that it [90% support] is not consensus -- it is a super-majority.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In such a system, I would pretty much always be a member of the losing 10%, and I am not a psychopath. (Am I?)
</I>
I understand what it's like to be on the short-side of 90% of the public; but I actually doubt a complex collaborative governance voting system would be anything like current voting systems. Since there aren't a handful of hot-button issues, the people invlved in discourse on any issue would be the engaged. It's not &quot;do we go to war with this nation or not&quot; but rather &quot;do we spend money on renovating the community park or not, and if so how, and what specific improvements do we make, and how do we pay for them, and who should manage the project?&quot; When you get discourse to that level of nuance, achieving 90% requires deep consensus and buy-in by everyone who could have a reasonable objection.

But society has to have some losers in discourse sometimes. That's the problem with society. It cannot be perfect for everyone every time. I'd say that's the price we have for the fact that most of the time society (if managed well) works in our favor.
