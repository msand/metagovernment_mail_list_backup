<PRE>Hi Marc, (again -- fifth response to same email)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
    qualitative and a quantitative one:

        * (2) While (NUO) solely suits well for small groups, (CV) can
          also handle large scale effectively.

Ned&gt; In making my previous response to this, I totally missed the word 
&quot;solely&quot; in your statement above. (That was sloppy on my part ..., and 
must have had you wondering why I was objecting to &quot;Vote&quot; on that 
Resolution System arrow.)

Now that I have belatedly seen the word &quot;solely&quot;, I must object: Blinap 
uses (NUO), and does not use (CV), and can successfully scale to the 
global level, where &quot;successfully&quot; means:

   1. The decision system makes wise decisions more reliably than the
      decision systems we have now, and
   2. the quality of the decisions does not degrade as the volume of
      decisions increases to and through tens of millions per year, and
      the number of participants increases to and through billions.

In the terms of the AG_MFT Big Picture, Blinap is capable of serving as 
both the Discussion System and the Resolution System, at the global 
scale. (It also contains considerable Information System functionality, 
with the three kinds of functionality fully integrated -- not separate 
at all.)

(I regret that I missed the word &quot;solely&quot; the first time -- my 
presentation of this point could have been clearer had I not ...)
