<PRE>Hi Ed,

I used to take your own participation for granted.  But that's a
mistake, of course.  So let me ask, what would be your own answer?
What would send you packing if you didn't find it here?

&gt;<i> ... How about if we start trying out other systems for set periods
</I>&gt;<i> of time [?] ...
</I>
Speaking for myself, the first thing I'd need to know is the purpose
of these try-outs.  It sounds to me like we'd be pushing toward a goal
(which is good).  So my first question would be, What goal precisely?

Maybe it's a goal I share.  Then I'd want to know who else shares it;
how clearly we articulate it; and generally whether we (together) are
capable of making progress toward it.  Then I'd decide whether to
participate, bearing in mind that I'd be expected to shoulder a bit of
the work even when my own interests weren't directly at stake.
Finally, I'd lend a hand in the critique of your try-out proposal, so
together we could judge whether or not it would help the goal.

Here I reiterate my own answer to the title question at some length,
not because I think my personal participation is especially important
to the group, but only to shed light on the meaning of the question.
The question again is:

&gt;<i> &gt; What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; did *not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; order to participate even when it was not directly in your own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interest, but rather for the sake of the group?
</I>

&gt;<i> I&#8217;d like to reiterate Michael&#8217;s question and encourage others to answer it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it did *not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in order to participate even when it was not directly in your own interest, but rather for the sake of the group?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I agree with Reid that we should experiment more. That&#8217;s a long tradition here: experimenting on our own community to see if we can find models that can be reproduced in other communities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we can turn the weakness of this list server into a strength in that regard. How about if we start trying out other systems for set periods of time, but simultaneously we keep this list open as a sort of meta-conversation about what we&#8217;re trying within that system. Note, we have effectively done this in the past a little bit with Vilfredo and with Votorola:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00</A>
</I>&gt;<i> In those instances, we just grabbed a tool that looked handy. I&#8217;d be up for deliberate experiments where we try something for a set period.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also, Marc, back in November you hinted you&#8217;d try to look into the Pirate Party&#8217;s tech for linking a list server to a forum. Any progress on that? :)
</I>
