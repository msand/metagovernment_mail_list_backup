I'm not fond of this process, since it leads to uncertainty. In my vision, there are two things preventing this sort of &quot;flapping&quot; on/off of decisions.

First, I strongly oppose any system where 51% of the votes results in a decision. Majority rule is the bane of democracy. The United States is the best example: we have a pure majority rule system (or really plurality-rule, but let's not get into that), which has funneled us into a 2-party system where every decision is framed as for-or-against. In a consensus system (in which I include a huge majority, such as 80-90%), nothing can be decided until a solution is developed that can get broad acceptance, and so it's not a question of if you support or oppose, but rather of what can everyone support. That sort of consensus rule should inherently prevent flapping. Once a proposal has been crafted so well that almost everyone is onboard with it, chances are it's not going to flap unless the community of voting participants expands significantly.

Second, decisions can have a simple waiting period. For example, in the Rules page, we defined waiting periods (W) of one and three weeks for two kinds of decisions:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
That solves a simple problem. If three people all agree on a new proposal and it passes; it still doesn't go into effect until the larger community has had time to mull it over. If a fourth person notices that those three proposed something ridiculous, person #4 can jump in, break their consensus, and effectively reset the timer. Now those three have to get #4's buy-in by modifying their proposal to make more sense. And the process can continue to scale in that way indefinitely until there is a proposal that works for the whole community.
