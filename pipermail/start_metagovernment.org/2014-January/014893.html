<PRE>I made a paper for the pirate conference in Frankurt (I don&#8217;t know  yet if it is accepted). The proxy is only part of the system and there are a lot of possiblities. But I think that it is essential that the proxy vote can&#8217;t be a secret vote.

I dont know.
The pirate party has a system called &quot;liquid feedback&quot; which allows proxies, but it doesnt work well.
Personally, i'm undecided, but if there will be proxies, than ONLY, if &quot;delegating to a proxy&quot; means, that for every decision/vote/whatsover that happens through the proxy, the original voter, who delegated, will receive information about that.

So, in social medai terms, that would mean &quot;FOLLOW&quot; and its mandatory. Either you delegate and then u have to deal with being informed all the time, or u dont delegate.
If you delegate, u owe your fellow citizens, that you evaluate the performance of the proxy. If you dont, then all the bad experience happens that the pirates had and have with their liquid feedback system.

  In my world this flip flopping ends up messing with my property interests and is actionable.  I do like it though.  And will we allow proxies?

      Hi Alex,

         Alex&gt; i dont believe &quot;counting votes&quot; vs. &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;
         is an either-or-question.

         i feel they converge if you bring in the dimension of time and
         repeated voting.
         =&gt; voting creates a snapshot of the current &quot;status quo&quot;.

         if you use &quot;permanent voting&quot;, that means you can vote for something
         or withdraw your vote at anytime and switch it to something else,
         then voting is &quot;always on&quot; and between switching your vote from one
         thing to another, there is discussion and resolving &quot;unresolved
         objections&quot;

         ... so if you think about time and continuous permanent voting, then
         i dont see the difference between those, more that they complement
         each other

      Ned&gt; What appears to be missing in what you are saying is the occurrence of actually making a decision.

      At the point that the decision regarding the proposal (or whatever) is actually made, that ends the decision process for that matter. There is no permanent anything beyond that point for that proposal.



    Why?
    Count total votes and if the decision rule decides in favor of proposal X, it is decided for. A minute later, some people might withdraw their votes so that the favor turns against proposal X, so it now stops and is prevented. Next day, it turns again in favor of proposal X, so it is continued. Whats the problem?
    Its radical, but who cares? Its the only solution.



      (After the decision has been made, the matter would be reopened by making a brand new proposal, that would then go through its own decision process and be decided.)


    why?
    if u want it to be that way, i wonder way, i wouldnt want it to be that way.
     

      If we specifically focus on decision making, then the decision rule that will be used really is an either/or question. There is no convergence, no matter how long the actual making of the decision is delayed.


    Its not delayed. its decided all the time.

     
      (The decision outcomes may or may not converge that two different decision rules might produce, but any particular decision itself will be made using a specific decision rule.)

      Continual voting does create a &quot;video&quot; of the status quo (successive &quot;snapshots&quot;), but it does not produce a decision so long as the voting process remains open.



    its not open, its final all the time.
    if 50 people vote against death penalty and 51 vote for death penalty, than &quot;death penalty&quot; is put into practice ...UNTIL at least one person changes its mind. ...sometimes this could lead to: 5:31pm &quot;death penalty is an option&quot;, 5:43pm &quot;death penalty is not an option&quot; 5:51pm &quot;death penalty is an option&quot;, 6:13pm &quot;death penalty is not an option&quot;.
    I believe for almost everything, vote proportions would be somehow stable for most active laws or whatever proposals could be.
    For those which are currently heavy discussed in public, they would fluctuate a lot until they become stable... after a long public discussion.

     

      If a for-profit company were to leave matters open forever (continual/permanent voting), thus never actually making any decisions, the for-profit company would fail, as would any democratic polity that never actually made any decisions.


    1. countries are not for-profit organisations.
    2. even in ngo's it could work.
    3. i believe, if structured efficiently, it would even work for for-profit companies, but that is something not that important to this mailinglist and it is still to be proven :-) but i bet there is already examples out there, where they handle it like that and they work.
    One example is the german company: &quot;Premium Cola&quot;
     

      Eventually the decision must be made, and that will involve selecting a specific decision rule. Yes?


    If i were allowed to choose, i would want a permanent decision rule. this would probably also render quite a couple of &quot;strategic voting problems&quot; obsolete.
