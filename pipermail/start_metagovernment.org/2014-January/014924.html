<PRE>Hi Mark,

&gt;<i> BUT I think it is possible to enhance the qKonsens also to be able
</I>&gt;<i> to rate and argue on the document level!
</I>
If that were done, then I think qKonsens and Votorola could be made
plug-compatible for macro-voting purposes, i.e. voting on whole texts.
So an individual user would be able to choose either of the two
designs for that purpose, or switch back and forth between them.

Votorola also includes tools for the related purposes of text
composition, and for micro-voting (i.e. on text parts).  Should we
therefore (I ask myself) make Votorola's tools plug-compatible with
qKonsens' tools for either of these purposes, instead?

No (Mike), it would probably result in a mess.  The interrelations
among text composition, micro-voting and macro-voting facilities are
too tight and complex to break apart as separate components that could
then be independently interchanged.  While we certainly want to see
different designs for the whole, and let the user to switch back and
forth among those, we rarely want to see Frankenstein combinations of
their internal parts:

    qKonsens micro-voting
  + Wirite text composition
  + Votorola macro-voting
    ---------------------------
  = Unhappy monster

The user wants to pick one of the 3.  (Actually there's over 50 out
there currently, and new ones popping up all the time.)  The crucial
thing is to make them plug-compatible with each other *as a whole*.
That's also the easiest thing, since all it requires is macro-vote
translation (coarse vote mirroring), whether through D!sco, or some
other data transport.

So (coming back to my point) this explains why I think qKonsens would
actually need a macro-voting facility (as you suggest) in order to be
plug-compatible with Votorola (or with nearly any of the 50 or so
designs that compete with it).

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting... so qKonsens allows an individual to formally express
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agreement (vote) for a text?  I can't get a clean translation of:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Datei:Definition-qKonsens-2013-12-DRAFT.pdf">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/Datei:Definition-qKonsens-2013-12-DRAFT.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> YES! This is what qKonsens is about: individuals can vote for whole 
</I>&gt;<i> documents by rate and argue on their paragraphs. The documents are called 
</I>&gt;<i> *Konsenskiste* and the paragraphs are called *Kernaussagen* (that means 
</I>&gt;<i> essential sentences). Normally a *Konsenskiste* (document) consists of one 
</I>&gt;<i> to many *Kernaussagen* (paragraphs).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seems to describe micro-voting on arguments or discussions that are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; related to a text, not macro-voting on the whole text itself...  but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then it's hard to tell from the translation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, the methodology allows for subdividing documents into multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> paragraphs to rate and argue on each of them independently. This is by 
</I>&gt;<i> design, because it seems to be the case, that one just agrees with *parts* 
</I>&gt;<i> of a document and not with the whole.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BUT I think it is possible to enhance the qKonsens also to be able to rate 
</I>&gt;<i> and argue on the document level!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers
