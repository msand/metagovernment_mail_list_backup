<PRE>Hi All,

Daniel, Bentley, AG_MFT, Reid, Pietro, and others are working on 
projects to facilitate discussion.

Here is Rawls also trying to help to facilitate discussion:
John Rawls: The Idea of Public Reason Revisited (1997):
<A HREF="http://www.hartsem.edu/academic/courses/summer2009/Idea%20of%20Public%20Reason%20Revisted%20%28Rawls%29.pdf">http://www.hartsem.edu/academic/courses/summer2009/Idea%20of%20Public%20Reason%20Revisted%20%28Rawls%29.pdf</A>

We are a group that is interested in &quot;Metagovernment&quot; issues. In this 
piece, Rawls is discussing how to discuss such issues. (Which comes 
before deciding how to decide such issues -- which is one of the primary 
metagovernment issues there is to be discussed, and decided.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rawls&gt; Public reasoning aims for public justification. We appeal to
    political conceptions of justice, and to ascertainable evidence and
    facts open to public view, in order to reach conclusions about what
    we think are the most reasonable political institutions and
    policies. Public justification is not simply valid reasoning, but
    argument addressed to others: it proceeds correctly from premises we
    accept and think others could reasonably accept to conclusions we
    think they could also reasonably accept. This meets the duty of
    civility, since in due course the proviso is satisfied. -- pdf p.23/44

So there it is (a &quot;soundbite&quot; version). (&quot;Public reasoning&quot;, &quot;political 
conceptions of justice&quot;, &quot;duty of civility&quot;, and &quot;the proviso&quot; are all 
terms of art for Rawls. Philosophy is fun -- like playing with Russian 
Dolls.)

(And now a word from our sponsor -- I will climb up on my soapbox for 
just a bit ...)

    [COMMERCIAL] Using &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; as our decision rule
    allows the process that Rawls is describing to proceed to
    completion. Counting votes to decide truncates the process, and in
    practice actually renders it moot. [/COMMERCIAL]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My criticisms of Rawls that follow are tangential and inconsequential to 
his philosophical case that we can have reasonable, sustainable 
democracy, if we want it. (I am 100% on his side in that, and see him as 
having been a friggin' genius for how well he has argued for that 
possibility.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A criticism: Rawls himself (in this piece and elsewhere) speaks as 
though he (&quot;thinking in the box&quot;) assumes that polyarchy is not just 
what we have, but what we will have: voting, elections, candidates, 
party platforms, government officials, legislatures, chief executives, 
judges, courts, supreme courts, &quot;three-part division of the public 
forum&quot; -- he appears to take all of these social system features for 
granted, without defending them, or comparing them to other possible 
arrangements, or even acknowledging that there may be other possible 
arrangements. His &quot;deepest level&quot; appears to be a bit shallow in this 
regard. (In his defense, it was not his work to think outside of that 
particular box; his work was philosophy, not social systems design.)

To put this &quot;parochial myopia&quot; in perspective: Isonomea -- as one 
example -- is a &quot;well ordered constitutional democracy&quot; that features 
NONE of the arrangements listed above: no voting, no elections, no 
candidates, no party platforms, no government officials, no 
legislatures, no chief executives, no judges, no courts, no supreme 
court, no &quot;three-part division of the public forum&quot;.

This example shows that there do exist conceivable alternatives to 
polyarchy, which then raises the question whether there exist, or can 
exist, *better* alternatives to polyarchy -- which is quite properly a 
&quot;Metagovernment&quot; question, and a question to which his idea of public 
reason must apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A criticism: He states that he is concerned only with &quot;a well ordered 
constitutional democracy ... understood also as a deliberative 
democracy. The definitive idea for deliberative democracy is the idea of 
deliberation itself.&quot;

But any democracy that makes decisions by counting votes is a 
vote-counting democracy, not a deliberative democracy. As a philosopher, 
he well understood that distinction in his own work. He himself was 
persuaded by what others said, not by how many others said it.

When decisions are reached through counting votes rather than actually 
through interactive deliberation (to the point of &quot;no unresolved 
objections&quot;), public reason is rendered nothing but window dressing with 
respect to the decision process.

Victory achieved through vote-count popularity has no more deliberative 
legitimacy than does victory achieved through having the pointiest 
spears. The only exception to this is &quot;unanimous direct democracy&quot;. See 
*Robert Paul Wolff: In Defense of Anarchism* for an excellent discussion 
of this exception:
<A HREF="http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/robert-paul-wolff-in-defense-of-anarchism">http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/robert-paul-wolff-in-defense-of-anarchism</A> 


------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rawls&gt; In constant pursuit of money to finance campaigns, the
    political system is simply unable to function. Its deliberative
    powers are paralyzed.

In my view this is a superficial diagnosis. The deeper problems are (1) 
that popularity (votes) can be bought (through propaganda advertising 
among many other means), and (2) that wealth is extremely concentrated. 
So long as those two fundamental problems exist together, &quot;campaign 
finance reform&quot; can only affect HOW the money will buy the votes, not 
whether.

If public decisions were made through interactive deliberation rather 
than through counting votes, there would be no campaigns, and no pursuit 
of money to finance the campaigns, and (perhaps) less paralysis, and 
(perhaps) better decisions. (We would need to run the experiments to 
find out.)

The experiments: We know that science and philosophy don't generally 
rely on voting. We know that interactive deliberation can work at the 
team scale -- juries, boards of directors, etc. We know that the IETF 
has been working well globally, without voting.

Following upon all of this, implementing a decision system such as 
Blinap would enable testing and exploring the feasibility of interactive 
deliberation as an alternative to counting votes, at the scale of large 
general populations.

Until we have run such experiments, we have no empirical basis for 
judging how deliberative democracy would compare to the vote-counting 
democracies that we have. (Systems such as Blinap have not been possible 
until now -- they require computers and global electronic 
communications, and LOTS of software.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rawls&gt; Thus, in considering whether to make homosexual relations
    between citizens criminal offenses, the question is not whether
    those relations are precluded by a worthy idea of full human good as
    characterized by a sound philosophical and nonreligious view, nor
    whether those of religious faith regard it as sin, but primarily
    whether legislative statutes forbidding those relations infringe the
    civil rights of free and equal democratic citizens. This question
    calls for a reasonable political conception of justice specifying
    those civil rights, which are always a matter of constitutional
    essentials.

A criticism: Here Rawls very carefully parses different sorts of reasons 
for deciding such issues. But the evidence suggests that actual voters 
in actual populations do not reliably do this sort of parsing as they 
(hastily) cast their (secret, inarticulate) votes.

The only effective way to bring this sort of parsing to bear upon 
democratic decision making is through interactive deliberation, in which 
each and every (self-selected) decision participant must publicly 
present his or her reasoning, thereby exposing the reasoning to 
criticism and systematic examination through discourse.

Vote-counting democracy and deliberative democracy are two entirely 
different (mutually exclusive, incompatible) systems. Rawls can only 
have what he wants in deliberative democracy. It just does not happen in 
vote-counting democracy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is my hope that we few in the world who are interested in 
Metagovernment issues will have a great coming year exploring, 
discussing and deciding issues such as those above.

(Responses to particular parts of the above would fit fine on their own 
new threads -- creating new threads is cheap and easy ...)
