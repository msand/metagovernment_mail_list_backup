<PRE>Yes Mike, this is what I'm talking about, getting some kind of organization
going, even community. We are after all wanting a strong community of
internet users to participate in our vision, whatever that may be, so we
should be encouraging it as much as we can in each other. I should think
we'd all want to see each other succeed since we all have a relatively
similar vision and any progress will be progress for us all.

Max, don't know where that saying's from but by that logic no one should go
to bed with anyone ever. We've got to take risks sometimes, we've gotta
trust people sometimes. Granted that that is especially hard on the
internet and yes having anything totally secure is maybe impossible online,
but you gotta go for it sometimes if it's what you want.

I'll make the hopeful suggestion that we might highlight one project of
ours every week, one that's ready for some presentation and experimentation
on it. Have each other participate in a test run of the idea to get a
feeling of the functionally. We can then provide comments and feedback on
each others sites, help us understand the direction to take. This will help
bring up the fundamental questions for us to discuss and hopefully we can
build from there. Even if we don't really know where we're going we should
not be afraid to explore. That's how I feel anyway.
