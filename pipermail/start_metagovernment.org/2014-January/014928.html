<PRE>Ned, I will reply to some of your points below to further emphasize my point, but my relevant comments will all be here at the top.

You continue to not answer my question. Instead, you are trying to shift the burden of proof (or rather of disproof) onto me, claiming that you are right until I can decipher what you are talking about and prove you wrong. But I can't prove you wrong if you never answer the very simple question I am asking.

In every one of your responses, you have made reference to some kind of list of defensible considerations by which decisions are judged. But you have not explained what is the decision rule behind the creation of that list.

How is that list made? By what decision rule does something appear on or get removed from that list? Who gets to be the arbiter of something getting added to the list?

If you have answered that basic question, I do not see it. And until you answer it, I cannot evaluate anything else you say, since everything is pinned on this one, in my mind, Achilles heel.




Here is the detailed response...

</I>
So which one is it? And if the latter, my whole question again is who gets to decide what is a defensible consideration? And do they have to follow a decision rule? If so, who makes that decision rule?

I did not ask for you to fill in the blank with standards for discourse. Here's the blank again:

</I>
All I am asking you to do is tell me why it is not completely arbitrary, why it is not a decision made by an individual for whatever reason they care to choose. And please do not answer &quot;because it is not arbitrary,&quot; which is the level of answer you have heretofore been providing. Whatever your standard of evaluation is, all I want to know is who gets to make the decision, and why their decision is better than yours or mine or anyone else's.

&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO approach to filling in that blank is strictly &quot;play it by ear&quot;. When someone needs a basis (what you have called a &quot;standard&quot;), the someone proposes that the basis/standard be put onto the MLOVRTO list.
</I>
But see, here's where you've gone into purely circular logic again. What is the decision rule for something being put on the list? Just because someone felt like putting it there? How is that a decision rule and not arbitrary?

You say that someone proposes that something gets put on the list. Does it go on automatically? Or is there some decision by which it is deemed worthy of going onto the list?

If it is the latter, than what is the basis for that decision?

&gt;<i> If the proposal succeeds, then the basis/standard (e.g., &quot;Proposals must be clear, explicit, and unambiguous.&quot;) becomes available to serve as a basis/standard for proposing objections to proposals, and for resolving objections.
</I>
If the proposal succeeds... based on what standard? The standard that that person just felt like creating?

Who decides if a proposal succeeds?

&gt;<i> (You are now objecting to my version of &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; using (implicitly) the &quot;clear, explicit, unambiguous&quot; basis. One of my defendings is that the basis does not apply: the MLOVRTO proposal IS clear, but you are refusing to look at it.)
</I>
I've looked at it several times. My conclusions are that:

1. It is very poorly formatted, thus extremely difficult to follow in any way. (Yes, format is extremely important to rational discourse, especially in online communities.)

2. Almost all claims made in it are pure assertions.

3. It boils down to an arbitrary decision rule: things go on the list because some individual decides to put them there. That person is thus the authoritarian.

You are telling me that until I can understand this complex, unreadable, circular-logic (to me) document, I have no ground to debate you. That is not a rational response. If you want your proposal to win, you need to support it better than with that document.

I put forth the proposition that you should be able to explain yourself fully in no more than four sentences. I have explained my decision rule in two or three, and I believe it was very clear. I can defend it in another two.

&gt;<i> How I define &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;:

</I>&gt;<i> If you wish to understand what &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; means in MLOVRTO, you will need to study the MLOVRTO proposal, and the extended example of the MLOVRTO decision system in action.
</I>
Yes, I have studied it, and it is very clear that it is arbitrary. What am I missing?

Also, no, the burden is not on me. If your whole system is based on that, then it means all someone has to do is confuse and obfuscate and dodge for long enough that they can exhaust everyone debating with them and then... presto! They have won by successfully defending in discourse.

&gt;<i> (And also, in this very email exchange between you and I, there has been discoursing going on, and defending going on, and objections being raised and resolved. &quot;Defending in discourse&quot; and &quot;resolving objections&quot; are more familiar than you may think. You resolve objections routinely in the course of ordinary everyday life, so you do know what it means, even if you don't.)
</I>
As I see it, we have not had real discourse. Again and again, I have asked you who is making the decisions to put things on the list and what standard they are using, and again and again you have ignored my question, avoided it, diverted from it, or presented arbitrary answers such as &quot;things go on the list if they succeed&quot; or &quot;MLOVRTO does this better.&quot; That is not discourse.

But regardless, whether or not something is resolved in discourse is arbitrary. You are proving it again and again. You keep thinking you have resolved this debate, and I keep thinking you have not. Which one of us is right?

Or is the entire basis of your proposal that nothing can ever be passed until all argument dies? In that case, the winning proposal will always be the one that has the most tireless defenders, regardless of whether or not they are even vaguely rational.
