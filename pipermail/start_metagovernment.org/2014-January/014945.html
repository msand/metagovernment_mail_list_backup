<PRE>Mike,

Yes, I would participate if Metagovernment hosts try-outs of tools (even if
my tool was not included)
I would participate in other things also depending on my availability and
interest at that time.
Like:

   - Attend presentations on tools and systems for enhancing government.
   - Participate in brainstorming sessions about tools needed for collaborative
   governance.
   - Participate or attend debates on different methodologies of collaborative
   governance.
   - Curate news articles and posts for people interested in collaborative
   governance. (on the wiki)
   - Build or piece together a tool for Metagov to communicate better than
   this email thread.
   - Prototype suggested tools for collaborative governance.
   - Build a catalog of tools for collaborative governance with comparisons
   and metrics (on the wiki)
   - Design a curriculum for people wishing to learn about the
   possibilities and history of collaborative governance.
   - Create graphic videos to encourage people to join collaborative
   governance
   - Create info-graphics about the potential influence of collaborative
   governance.
   - Share information in my social media accounts about Metagov
   - condense these long emails into actionable or informative summaries
   - Create a marketing campaign and slogan (Government, but productive...)
   - Follow Eds lead and invite people with interesting projects to share
   them on Metagov (although the experience was less than ideal)
   - Work on a suggested code of conduct for Metagov to foster positive
   mutually beneficial interactions
   - Host a local meetup group to discuss Metagov
   - Work on my own ideas for tools for collaborative governance.
   - Give $10 a month to the organization Ed is starting.

What are you willing to do to decrease word suck?

Bentley
