<PRE>This post will attempt to defend against the objection that there may be 
authoritarians lurking in the vague shadows of the abstract &quot;No 
Unresolved Objections&quot; decision rule, by arguing that there are no 
authoritarians lurking specifically in the MLOVRTO decision system.

The MLOVRTO Decision System:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO</A>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; The voting/delegation apparatus [of Votorola] allows people to
    judge if a proposal is being supported.

    Ned&gt; The question is, supported by what?

        In Votorola and other vote-counting systems, the proposal is
        being supported by vote-count popularity.

        In a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, successful proposals are
        supported by being defensible in discourse, from the perspective
        of defensible considerations.

    Ed&gt; I don't see what &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; means. It sounds to
    me like a second, vague layer of decision rule, buried behind the
    no-objections one. It's a qualifier of what kind of objections are
    legitimate and what kind are not. So... who makes that decision? Who
    is the arbiter of reasonableness? Who gets to decide that something
    is being defended in discourse or not? If your answer in any way
    involves specific individuals, then how are those people not
    authoritarian?

Ned&gt; You are correct that the abstract rule allows authoritarian 
designs. It is of course possible to set up instantiations of the 
abstract &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule that DO feature 
individuals in roles having special authority with respect to legitimacy 
of arguments and such. In our standard polyarchies, judges and juries 
are typically vested with that kind of special authority. (Judge: 
&quot;Objection overruled!&quot;)

But it is also possible to set up instantiations in which NO ONE has any 
kind of special authority with respect to such matters.

The MLOVRTO decision system is absolutely egalitarian -- everyone that 
participates is equally a proposer, on absolutely equal footing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      DEFENSIBLE IN DISCOURSE

The MLOVRTO presentation provides a particular formalization of the 
meaning of &quot;defensible in discourse&quot;. If that formalization is still not 
clear enough, I will greatly appreciate any feedback you can offer to 
help me make it more clear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      FORMALIZATION OF INFORMAL DISCOURSE

In the foregoing, the arguments and counter-arguments are presented 
informally. Now I will attempt to formalize the exchange, from the 
perspective of the MLOVRTO decision system.

(This is just one way that the exchange could be formalized; several of 
the points in the exchange were implicit, and subject to multiple 
interpretations.)

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (JPS)

       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should enable us to
          judge if a proposal is being supported.&quot;
       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (IV_JPS)

       1. It is proposed that the voting/delegation apparatus of
          Votorola should be part of the decision system that we adopt,
          because that will satisfy basis (JPS).

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (CEU)

       1. Basis: &quot;Items on MLOVTRO should be clear, explicit, and
          unambiguous.&quot;
       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Objection to (JPS): (JPS.1.CEU)

       1. &quot;Supported by vote-count popularity&quot; and &quot;supported by being
          defensible in discourse&quot; are two distinguishably and
          significantly different possible meanings of the term &quot;being
          supported&quot; in (JPS). (JPS) does not clarify which of these two
          meanings is intended.
       2. Therefore it is proposed that (JPS) be removed from MLOVRTO on
          the basis that it violates (CEU).

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (JDD)

       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should enable us to
          judge if a proposal is being supported by being defensible in
          discourse.&quot;
       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (SME)

       1. Basis: &quot;In choosing between two system versions, the more
          efficient of the two should be selected, absent other bases
          for selection.&quot;
       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Objection to (IV_JPS): (IV_JPS.1.JDD,SME)

       1. The MLOVRTO decision system directly satisfies basis (JDD),
          without needing the voting/delegation apparatus of Votorola to
          do so.
       2. The basis (JPS) for including the functionality of Votorola
          has been removed, leaving Votorola with no other basis for
          inclusion.
       3. Including Votorola would decrease the decision-making
          efficiency of the overall system.
       4. It is therefore proposed that (IV_JPS) not be implemented,
          since doing so would violate (SME).

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (NAP)

       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should be absolutely
          egalitarian. There should be no distinctions between governors
          and governed in the operation of the decision system. There
          should be no authoritarian powers vested in specific individuals.&quot;
       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (CML)

        * It is proposed that we adopt the decision system specified
          below (MLOVRTO), on the basis that it satisfies (NAP) and
          (JDD) and (SME).

              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           1. A proposal that faces no unresolved objections will be
              implemented.
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           2. A proposal that faces even one objection that has not been
              resolved will not be implemented.
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           3. Set up a list: the Master List Of Valid Reasons To Object
              (MLOVRTO, pronounced ...)
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           4. To be valid, a proposed objection must point to at least
              one item on the list as the basis for the objection, and
              must argue successfully that the basis does apply. (An
              invalid objection is considered resolved.)
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           5. A proposed objection can be resolved by:
                 1. successfully proposing that its basis be removed
                    from MLOVRTO, thereby rendering it invalid.
                 2. successfully proposing that the basis does not
                    apply, thereby rendering it invalid.
                 3. successfully proposing an objection to the
                    objection, by pointing to at least one item on
                    MLOVRTO as the basis, and arguing successfully that
                    the basis does apply.
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
           6. Items are put onto the list by successfully proposing that
              they be put on it. Items are removed from the list by
              successfully proposing that they be removed.
              ------------------------------------------------------------------------
