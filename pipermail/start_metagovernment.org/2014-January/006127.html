<PRE>Hi Gustavo,

In starting out, my thought is that we take tiny baby steps, to try to 
be both thorough and efficient in resolving our differences. (I am 
highly motivated to try to have us wind up working together.)

One way for me to take baby steps is to do a sentence-by-sentence 
read-and-respond to your post, as the first step on a long road. The 
good news is, that is a thorough and efficient way to respond. One piece 
of bad news is that it would produce a book-length response, if I were 
to put all the pieces into one post.

So, (unless/until you suggest otherwise), my plan is to start with the 
first sentence of your post, and try to break my responses into &quot;one 
topic per post&quot; pieces.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Gustavo&gt; Not sure I will be helpful here, but I think Ned is really
    trying to figure out how to not solve problems through voting and
    hierarchical structures. And that his main problem is with issues
    related to tyranny of the majority.

Ned&gt; When I first started working on the project that has led to 
Isonomea and Blinap, my thinking was pretty much entirely &quot;in the box&quot;. 
At the start, I viewed the project as being about writing planks for a 
new political party. In fact, the original name for the project was &quot;The 
Meek Party Platform&quot;.

During the first three years of the project, I assumed without question 
that voting could be made to &quot;work&quot;, and that the problem was just a 
&quot;tuneup&quot; problem -- a matter of finding just the right tweaks.

But what I discovered in the process of trying to tweak is that there 
are problems intrinsic to all &quot;Count Votes&quot; systems that no amount of 
tweaking can resolve, or even mitigate. I discovered what Alexander 
Tyler among many others had discovered long before me: &quot;Count Votes&quot; 
systems cannot be used to produce sustainable democracy. This was not 
what I had expected to find.

However, once I had &quot;grokked in fullness&quot; that &quot;Count Votes&quot; could not 
serve as the basis for sustainable democracy, I then turned to the task 
of trying to find/formulate a method of public-matter decision making 
that WOULD be able to serve as the basis for sustainable democracy, at 
the global scale.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Gustavo&gt; If that is so Ned, than I think we are in need of a certain
    level of compromise.

Ned&gt; From your perspective, the problem is that I won't compromise. From 
my perspective, the problem is that you want us to jump out of the 
airplane wearing parachutes that I know won't work.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Gustavo&gt; I believe your phylosophical and political points are
    essentially right. But if you are imposing a no-vote system onto the
    world, how does that make you different from those in power now? It
    would be a contradiction.

Ned&gt; When you say this, I am confidant that you are reasonably 
responding to something, but I confess that I have no idea what. What 
have I said that has led you to the view that I want to impose anything 
on anyone? (If you could cite quotes from me and provide their contexts, 
that would be very helpful.)

(Once I know what has caused you to say this, then I will be able to 
respond further ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I will now ship this as my first response to your excellent post, even 
though it actually contains three topics:

   1. Can &quot;Count Votes&quot; serve as the basis for sustainable democracy?
   2. Is it a good idea to compromise when the compromise solution won't
      work?
   3. Does Ned want to impose anything on anyone?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
