<PRE>I suggest that the purpose of these system try-outs is to further
Metagovernments stated main goal:

&quot;The Metagovernment project supports internet tools to enable collaborative
governance.&quot;

It appears to me that there are a lot of proposed and suggested tools but
not much use of those tools to provide in-depth feedback to improve or
narrow down the tools. This may be the most effective use of volunteers at
this time and could provide a common tangible goal and value to the
community.

&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I used to take your own participation for granted.  But that's a
</I>&gt;<i> mistake, of course.  So let me ask, what would be your own answer?
</I>&gt;<i> What would send you packing if you didn't find it here?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... How about if we start trying out other systems for set periods
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of time [?] ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking for myself, the first thing I'd need to know is the purpose
</I>&gt;<i> of these try-outs.  It sounds to me like we'd be pushing toward a goal
</I>&gt;<i> (which is good).  So my first question would be, What goal precisely?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's a goal I share.  Then I'd want to know who else shares it;
</I>&gt;<i> how clearly we articulate it; and generally whether we (together) are
</I>&gt;<i> capable of making progress toward it.  Then I'd decide whether to
</I>&gt;<i> participate, bearing in mind that I'd be expected to shoulder a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> the work even when my own interests weren't directly at stake.
</I>&gt;<i> Finally, I'd lend a hand in the critique of your try-out proposal, so
</I>&gt;<i> together we could judge whether or not it would help the goal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here I reiterate my own answer to the title question at some length,
</I>&gt;<i> not because I think my personal participation is especially important
</I>&gt;<i> to the group, but only to shed light on the meaning of the question.
</I>&gt;<i> The question again is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; did *not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; order to participate even when it was not directly in your own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; interest, but rather for the sake of the group?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed Pastore said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd like to reiterate Michael's question and encourage others to answer
</I>&gt;<i> it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it did
</I>&gt;<i> *not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in order to
</I>&gt;<i> participate even when it was not directly in your own interest, but rather
</I>&gt;<i> for the sake of the group?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I agree with Reid that we should experiment more. That's a long
</I>&gt;<i> tradition here: experimenting on our own community to see if we can find
</I>&gt;<i> models that can be reproduced in other communities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we can turn the weakness of this list server into a strength in
</I>&gt;<i> that regard. How about if we start trying out other systems for set periods
</I>&gt;<i> of time, but simultaneously we keep this list open as a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> meta-conversation about what we're trying within that system. Note, we have
</I>&gt;<i> effectively done this in the past a little bit with Vilfredo and with
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In those instances, we just grabbed a tool that looked handy. I'd be up
</I>&gt;<i> for deliberate experiments where we try something for a set period.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, Marc, back in November you hinted you'd try to look into the
</I>&gt;<i> Pirate Party's tech for linking a list server to a forum. Any progress on
</I>&gt;<i> that? :)
