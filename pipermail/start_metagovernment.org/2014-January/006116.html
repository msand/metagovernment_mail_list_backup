<PRE>Greetings Gustavo!

This is just a quick note, to express my extreme elation. I did a quick 
search of the list archive, and it says that you last posted back in 
2009 (regarding the Reputation Economy). Having now just read your new 
post, I am maximally elated that you have joined the discussion. The 
points and questions that you have raised are all pure gold. Anything I 
can do (or not do) to keep you interested in participating in the 
discussion, you let me know -- please!

If you give me the chance, I am confident that I can show/persuade you 
that the Freetimea&gt;&gt;Isonomea social system (generally) and the Blinap 
decision system (particularly) can &quot;pass muster&quot; with respect to all of 
the issues and problems and questions that you have raised. (In fact, my 
&quot;development methodology&quot; over the years of developing the ideas was 
exactly to take solving each of the problems that you have pointed to as 
a &quot;design specification&quot; that the design needed to meet.) Once you 
understand the systems, I think that you will like them, a lot.

I totally agree with you that demonstration is necessary. The problem 
is, I cannot write all of the necessary software and do all the 
necessary &quot;content development&quot; by myself, and then present the entire 
system as if it were a new car in a showroom, ready to drive off of the 
lot. So, I am put in the position of having to try to persuade others 
(&quot;before the demonstration&quot;) that developing and testing and 
demonstrating the systems is a worthy project. Which has led me to 
experience personally the truth of Machiavelli's remark:

    And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult
    to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its
    success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of
    things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have
    done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those
    who may do well under the new. -- The Prince, Chapter 6

To make matters even worse for me: although I am (IMHO) a pretty good 
designer, I seriously suck at presenting the ideas -- not one of my 
strong suits. (I say that as a sort of suggestion -- don't throw out the 
design baby with the presentation bathwater.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having now expressed my elation, there will be a time-gap until my first 
written response to your excellent post. I already have multiple 
responses to Marc and Ed and Max and Alex in progress, and your post 
contains a veritable cornucopia of points to respond to. Please be 
patient, and please stick around ...

 &gt; Not sure I will be helpful here, but I think Ned is really trying to 
figure out how to not solve problems through voting and hierarchical 
structures. And that his main problem is with issues related to tyranny 
of the majority.
 &gt;
 &gt; If that is so Ned, than I think we are in need of a certain level of 
compromise. I believe your phylosophical and political points are 
essentially right. But if you are imposing a no-vote system onto the 
world, how does that make you different from those in power now? It 
would be a contradiction.
 &gt;
 &gt; I believe you are very well aware of the drawbacks of consensus 
decion making, especially the rigid one you are proposing (meaning &quot;No 
Unresolved Objections&quot; from EVERYONE), including consensus blocking, 
systemic bias and uniformity induction, fear of one speaking one's mind, 
lack of creativity (to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage 
to propose new stuff, framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy 
that ignores the possibility of compromise or other mutually beneficial 
solutions, and so on...
 &gt;
 &gt; If you are well aware of these drawbacks and still thinks it to be a 
great decision-making process then, although I think you are setting the 
bar way too high, a demonstration of your system proposal in the 
framework of large groups would be an exceptional exercise to learn from.
 &gt;
 &gt; However, if we go back to your original post &quot;In making public 
decisions, we need a decision rule. Abstractly, two choices are here now 
on the table: count votes, or deliberate to the point of &quot;no unresolved 
objections&quot;.&quot;, I really think you are missing a lot of alterntives there 
with your dichotomic alternatives.
 &gt;
 &gt; For instance, you jury example reminded me a lot of the sociocratic 
decision-making process. From personal experience, I can tell this 
decision-making process works marvellously within small groups (or 
within the whole framework of sociocracy for large groups). It works 
only for small groups because the extensive discussion needed to have 
empathy for one's arguments, be patient and creative to find solutions 
which work for everyone, and come up with real consent which everyone is 
really happy with (and not just faking to fit onto uniformity) can only 
happen in relatively small groups. And it works for large groups in the 
framework of sociocracy because the system breaks up the big social 
organization into a hierarchy of semi-autonomous social circles. The 
dowside, of course, is that it is a kind of hierarchical representative 
system (although a much much better one than what we have in 
representative democratic national governments).
 &gt;
 &gt; Again from personal experience, there are very extensive empirical 
evidence that within large groups of people not only irrational people 
will come up with consensus blocking, but also that the group will have 
a broad enough spectrum of cultural paradigms that will be the basis for 
blocking a lot of proposals. And that is not to be thought of as a 
problem, but rather as a natural (and positive) aspect of humam life. 
Having different people around is supposed to be a good thing, not a bad 
one. But sometimes there decisions to be made and consensus blocking in 
plainly awful for the group as whole, making most people very emotional 
(and somewhat irrational...) along the way, essentually turning 
consensus decision-making into a terrible system.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Thus, I think your proposal of decision-making process may be very 
good or very bad depending on the circumstances.
 &gt;
 &gt; If you agree to these, than we may understand that there is no such 
thing as the ideal and consensus decision making process, even in a 
relatively coherent group as Metagovernment. My feeling is there never 
will be, in Metagovernment or in any other relatively large group of 
people. And if you develop a governence system with this rigid 
decision-making process the probability is high that it will be 
unhelpful. Also, we should bear in mind that the an ideal governance 
system (or any system for that matter) is not solely dependable on the 
decision making process.
 &gt;
 &gt;
 &gt; Therefore, to me, if I were to choose from a set of governence 
softwares I would choose the one with the broader set of options for 
decision making. One where my social group would be free to detemine for 
themselves the best way to be governed with. I can easily see that a 
software which imposes a certain decision-making process will turn 
people away from it at some point in time because, depending on the 
circumstances, the group may decide to have some aspects of its 
governance (or some moments) where a different system of decision-making 
may be in order.
