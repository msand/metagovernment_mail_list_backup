<PRE>I&#8217;d like to reiterate Michael&#8217;s question and encourage others to answer it:
&gt;<i> What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it did *not* have a mailing list attached?  What would you require in order to participate even when it was not directly in your own interest, but rather for the sake of the group?
</I>
Also, I agree with Reid that we should experiment more. That&#8217;s a long tradition here: experimenting on our own community to see if we can find models that can be reproduced in other communities.

I think we can turn the weakness of this list server into a strength in that regard. How about if we start trying out other systems for set periods of time, but simultaneously we keep this list open as a sort of meta-conversation about what we&#8217;re trying within that system. Note, we have effectively done this in the past a little bit with Vilfredo and with Votorola:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Metagovernment</A>
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00">http://u.zelea.com/w/G/p/m00</A>
In those instances, we just grabbed a tool that looked handy. I&#8217;d be up for deliberate experiments where we try something for a set period.

Also, Marc, back in November you hinted you&#8217;d try to look into the Pirate Party&#8217;s tech for linking a list server to a forum. Any progress on that? :)

&gt;<i> Yes Mike, this is what I'm talking about, getting some kind of organization going, even community. We are after all wanting a strong community of internet users to participate in our vision, whatever that may be, so we should be encouraging it as much as we can in each other. I should think we'd all want to see each other succeed since we all have a relatively similar vision and any progress will be progress for us all.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Max, don't know where that saying's from but by that logic no one should go to bed with anyone ever. We've got to take risks sometimes, we've gotta trust people sometimes. Granted that that is especially hard on the internet and yes having anything totally secure is maybe impossible online, but you gotta go for it sometimes if it's what you want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll make the hopeful suggestion that we might highlight one project of ours every week, one that's ready for some presentation and experimentation on it. Have each other participate in a test run of the idea to get a feeling of the functionally. We can then provide comments and feedback on each others sites, help us understand the direction to take. This will help bring up the fundamental questions for us to discuss and hopefully we can build from there. Even if we don't really know where we're going we should not be afraid to explore. That's how I feel anyway.

</I>&gt;<i> There is a saying you should not go to bed with someone crazier than yourself.  As best i see the functional goal is gen creative ideas but never implement and deploy in a way that i would view as trustworthy.  People need to think of motivations, means, ends, and mitigations.  But if I do do something interesting, I might let you know.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And since people here are often very concrete, I suggest most of what people here want seems to imply a secure Internet and that is a tougher goal than peace on earth.

</I>&gt;<i> My question is prompted both by Bentley's post, and my earlier reply
</I>&gt;<i> to Reid.  I think participation in Metagov as a group is currently
</I>&gt;<i> lacking.  We each subscribe to the mailing list in order to further
</I>&gt;<i> our own purposes, which are largely independent of others' purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> So we use Metagov instrumentally, as we might use any mailing list.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The answers would give us a sense of the potential purpose of Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i> and its potential membership.  We might then turn that potential into
</I>&gt;<i> something real.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Answer) I will participate if Metagov takes deliberate aim and pushes
</I>&gt;<i> hard toward any goal that I care about.  Otherwise I will not.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That would be my answer.  What is your answer?
