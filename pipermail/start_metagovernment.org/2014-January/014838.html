<PRE>Thanks for the feedback, Ned. My objective toward internal governance was prompted by you:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-November/006023.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-November/006023.html</A>

So am I missing something? Determining our own governance is, to me, defining our shared vision of collaborative governance.* Yes we can start with decision-making, but there is the perennial issue that we are an amorphous group. Currently participation is low, so agreement between a few of us isn't necessarily definitive of the group. We need some sort of decision-rule (which to me is a form of governance) that is flexible and agreeable. So I think we are in agreement. What do you propose (and I suggest you propose it in a different thread and try to keep it short and sweet:).

As for speaking on behalf of the group, perhaps I phrased that poorly. My speaking engagements have generally been broad strokes describing some of the possibilities of collaborative governance. I'm speaking as an advocate, not as a representative. My primary goal is to get more people interested in the project, and my secondary is to see what kind of feedback I get so I can bring it back to the group.

&gt;<i> Hi Ed, Mark, and All, (Happy New Year!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point we (various members of the group) do not share a vision of what collaborative governance would best look like. I see that as potentially a tremendous opportunity. We have the opportunity to collaborate in clarifying and working through our differences, with the objective to arrive at a synthesis design that we can all wholeheartedly support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Variety of views at the outset is good because it can enrich and improve the eventual synthesis solution. Variety of views is not good as an end (in our situation), because it scatters our meager resources across more projects than those meager resources can support, with the result that none of our projects thrive. If we indeed think that collaboration is good and synthesis is good, then it behooves us to collaborate and synthesize.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When you (Ed) speak of &quot;coming up with a somewhat more formal internal governance structure&quot; for the group, it is not clear to me that the group needs an internal governance structure. At this point, we each are bringing our own personal resources to the party, and each personally control and direct those personal resources. I do not quite see what there is to &quot;govern&quot; that would need a governance &quot;structure&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Instead what I see is that we very much need a way that we all support to make group decisions, one by one. (I would not even say &quot;binding&quot; group decisions -- we are all in fact utterly autonomous with respect to all group matters, which I take to be a good thing.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The decision system would have a structure, and the decisions made might sometimes have to do with governance of the group in some sense, but the decision system itself would just produce decisions, not govern. The term &quot;governance structure&quot; for me harks back to the bad old days when there used to be a distinction between governors and governed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The blog model suffers from the problems that are discussed in the most excellent TruthMapping video:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XgPDs_pHc&amp;feature=youtu.be">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XgPDs_pHc&amp;feature=youtu.be</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My thought is that we would be better off focusing our efforts on proposing and upon making decisions with respect to those proposals, with all discussion serving those ends. The world (in my view) has enough &quot;thought for the day&quot; blogs. It needs more good proposals, and more good decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At this point, I would see &quot;speaking on behalf of the group&quot; as problematic. We share an intense interest in &quot;Metagovernment&quot; issues. But our views about those issues are all over the map.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which brings me back to the suggestion that we focus our efforts on proposing and upon making decisions with respect to those proposals. As our portfolio of decisions-made grew, there would be more and more to speak about &quot;on behalf of the group&quot;.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Greetings, colleagues, and welcome to 2014!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With the new year in front of us, I'd like to ask you what your plans are for working on collaborative governance in the upcoming year, and what objectives you would like to see this group achieve.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For the group, I'd like to see us come up with a somewhat more formal internal governance structure. Adhocracy has worked well so far, but at some point we probably should (as programmers say) eat our own dog food.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would also like to see us start up the blog we had talked about several years ago. I think it can be easy if we do it as a fairly open community blog where several people can be authors. I'll add ramping up the blog to my personal objectives (unless there are objections).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For my personal objectives, I hope to:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Start up an American non-profit 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Speak at at least two conferences on behalf of the group
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Start up the blog and contribute to it periodically
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Be a more frequent tester/experimenter with related/member software projects
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's all I have at the moment, but I'm open to suggestion if there is more others want from me. My time has been severely impinged upon for the past couple of years primarily due to family medical issues. But I am optimistic I will be finding more time in this year, and that you'll be hearing a lot more from me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What would you like to see from this group, and what do you intend to do personally?
