<PRE>Hi Pablo,

I am definitely interested in participating in such eDemocracy Network.

The AG MFT (where I am a member of) is currently prototyping several 
eDemocracy concepts in the area of discussion systems. The most up-to-date 
information can be found on the disco-network.org homepage.

Cheers
marc

Hi all!

Ed invited me to repost here this idea/project.

I know Metagoverment as a human network or loose group not so well, so
bear with me and please please please, report any similar things you
might know besides Metagoverment.

PD: By the way, I think that what we are proposing would be something
like a &quot;Metametagovernment&quot;, or at least a premetagoverment.

---- IDEA / PROJECT

So, we just came up with this idea. Is there anything like this out
there? If so we would promote it.

A little more text here: <A HREF="http://titanpad.com/b4E6lvMbx7">http://titanpad.com/b4E6lvMbx7</A>

Intention from the start to make it a planet wide initiative.

Would e2d-international be interested in officially being a founder?
That means endorsing communications, sending invitations to
participate to their members and also through their public
communication medias, and in a second phase decide if to support a
fund raising for basic costs.
