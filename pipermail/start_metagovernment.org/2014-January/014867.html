<PRE>Hi Ned + Max,

Sorry for stepping in and *just* grabbing one single aspect from the whole 
thread, but I just came across this by chance:

In response to Max, Ned Conner wrote:

IMHO the AG MFT is exactly working on this at the moment. At least this is 
true for the specification of your second stone. Maybe also including the 
first one, depending on what the meaning of *discussion format* is.

We also already started to prototype an implementation of this 
specification - the so called *Qualified Consensus* (*qualifizierter 
Konsens* in german or just *qKonsens* for short or *qK* even shorter ;o) 
methodology.

Unfortunately at the moment we don't have any free resources to translate 
the specification to english. Maybe you could describe your intention about 
the *discussion format* and *document creation process* in more detail, so 
we can see if that matches with the qK!?

Cheers
marc
