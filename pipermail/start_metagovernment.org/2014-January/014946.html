<PRE>Bentley Davis said:
&gt;<i> Yes, I would participate if Metagovernment hosts try-outs of tools
</I>&gt;<i> (even if my tool was not included).
</I>
And not otherwise?  I.e. no try-outs, no Bentley?

Again the basic form of the answer is:

   (answer) I will participate if X.  Otherwise I will not.

It's a two-fold promise, which means sincerity is doubly important.
Anyone uncomfortable with sincerity is advised not to answer. ;^)

&gt;<i> I would participate in other things also depending on my
</I>&gt;<i> availability and interest at that time. ...
</I>
Of course, but the question (as I intend it) is what you'd *require*
first in order to make yourself available and interested.  If you're
already happy with the group and ready to participate in just about
anything that comes down the pipeline (within reason), then the answer
would be:

   (answer) I require nothing.  I like Metagov as it stands and will
            participate in just about anything here (within reason).

That would be a valid answer if you're sincere about it, and a very
generous one.  Almost a blank cheque.  I doubt even Ed would be that
generous with the group.

&gt;<i> What are you willing to do to decrease word suck?
</I>
I don't understand.  What is &quot;word suck&quot;?
