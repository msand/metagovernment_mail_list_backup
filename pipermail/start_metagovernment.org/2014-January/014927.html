<PRE>Hi Ed,

    Ed&gt; Ned defines unresolved objections as any objection which is
    defensible in discourse. And the standard of &quot;defensible in
    discourse&quot; is not inherently subjective (and thus arbitrary and thus
    authoritarian) because _________. 

Ned&gt; I do not define &quot;unresolved objections&quot; in terms of &quot;defensible in 
discourse&quot;.

It could be said that a proposal has been successfully defended in 
discourse at the point that there are no unresolved objections. This 
statement expresses the relation between two abstract ideas. It does not 
formally define either one of them for decision making purposes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regarding &quot;fill in the blank&quot;:

Philosophers such as Kant and Habermas and Rawls have spent their lives 
attempting to formulate &quot;deep standards&quot; for discourse, that everyone 
might agree to. Trying to fit their relevant musings into the blank at 
the end of the sentence would be problematic ...

The MLOVRTO approach to filling in that blank is strictly &quot;play it by 
ear&quot;. When someone needs a basis (what you have called a &quot;standard&quot;), 
the someone proposes that the basis/standard be put onto the MLOVRTO 
list. If the proposal succeeds, then the basis/standard (e.g., 
&quot;Proposals must be clear, explicit, and unambiguous.&quot;) becomes available 
to serve as a basis/standard for proposing objections to proposals, and 
for resolving objections.

(You are now objecting to my version of &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; using 
(implicitly) the &quot;clear, explicit, unambiguous&quot; basis. One of my 
defendings is that the basis does not apply: the MLOVRTO proposal IS 
clear, but you are refusing to look at it.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

How I define &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;:

The MLOVRTO proposal presents a process for proposing objections, and 
for resolving proposed objections. For decision making purposes, the 
&quot;turn the crank&quot; processes are what matter. They explain how decisions 
are reached using the rule.

If you wish to understand what &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; means in 
MLOVRTO, you will need to study the MLOVRTO proposal, and the extended 
example of the MLOVRTO decision system in action.

(And also, in this very email exchange between you and I, there has been 
discoursing going on, and defending going on, and objections being 
raised and resolved. &quot;Defending in discourse&quot; and &quot;resolving objections&quot; 
are more familiar than you may think. You resolve objections routinely 
in the course of ordinary everyday life, so you do know what it means, 
even if you don't.)

</I>&gt;<i> I'm trying to simplify this conversation both for my benefit and for anyone who is not up for pouring through many different links leading to long, complex, unconventionally-formatted explanations. So I'm going to state this very briefly and see if you object to my characterization and if you can help fill in the blank. (And no, I just don't see the answer to the blank below in any of the links you provided... sorry if I didn't get through all of it.) Then I can go into detail on the issues; once I understand this one thing.

</I>&gt;<i> Ed and Ned agree that proposals should be implemented only if there are no unresolved objections to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed tentatively defines a proposal as having unresolved objections when there are any significant number of dissenters as defined by a percentage of the total number of people voting on that proposal.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Ed&gt;  I continue to not understand what you define NUO as. Every time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    you describe it, there appears to be some intelligent selection

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    you please very simply (as in, in one paragraph) explain how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    something can be defined as having no unresolved objections without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    someone making that decision on their own authority. And if the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    answer is that there is some other standard by which objections are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    judged, then who makes that standard?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt;  The MLOVRTO PROPOSAL that sets up the MLOVRTO Decision System (if the proposal succeeds) defines very precisely what NUO means for that particular version of NUO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In order to help me try to make that definition more clear, would it be possible for you to talk to me specifically about what you do not understand in that proposal?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Earlier, you were confused about step 3 of that proposal. Did I succeed in clearing up that confusion?
