<PRE>*@decision rule*
I also do not like the majority thing, but it was just a simple example.
feel free to swap out the decision rule or voting mechanism

*@waiting time*
This is just a special case, maybe there will be a &quot;tick system&quot;, and the
smallest tick (waiting period) can be 1 second or even less, while it is
totally possible to increase that &quot;waiting period&quot;. There can be even
different &quot;waiting times&quot; for different kinds of proposals...

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I strongly oppose any system where 51% of the votes results in a
</I>&gt;<i> decision. Majority rule &lt;<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Majority_rule">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Majority_rule</A>&gt; is
</I>&gt;<i> the bane of democracy. The United States is the best example: we have a
</I>&gt;<i> pure majority rule system (or really plurality-rule, but let's not get into
</I>&gt;<i> that), which has funneled us into a 2-party system where every decision is
</I>&gt;<i> framed as for-or-against. In a consensus system (in which I include a huge
</I>&gt;<i> majority, such as 80-90%), nothing can be decided until a solution is
</I>&gt;<i> developed that can get broad acceptance, and so it's not a question of if
</I>&gt;<i> you support or oppose, but rather of what can everyone support. That sort
</I>&gt;<i> of consensus rule should inherently prevent flapping. Once a proposal has
</I>&gt;<i> been crafted so well that almost everyone is onboard with it, chances are
</I>&gt;<i> it's not going to flap unless the community of voting participants expands
</I>&gt;<i> significantly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Second, decisions can have a simple waiting period. For example, in the
</I>&gt;<i> Rules page, we defined waiting periods (W) of one and three weeks for two
</I>&gt;<i> kinds of decisions:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Rules</A>
</I>&gt;<i> That solves a simple problem. If three people all agree on a new proposal
</I>&gt;<i> and it passes; it still doesn't go into effect until the larger community
</I>&gt;<i> has had time to mull it over. If a fourth person notices that those three
</I>&gt;<i> proposed something ridiculous, person #4 can jump in, break their
</I>&gt;<i> consensus, and effectively reset the timer. Now those three have to get
</I>&gt;<i> #4's buy-in by modifying their proposal to make more sense. And the process
</I>&gt;<i> can continue to scale in that way indefinitely until there is a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> that works for the whole community.
