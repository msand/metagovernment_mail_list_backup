Sorry, I haven't been following... not sure I can be of help here...
except to say that Ed is not mis-characterizing Votorola.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As far as discussion slowing down the effort: collaboration and synthesis happen THROUGH discussion; voting TRUNCATES discussion, collaboration, and synthesis. Our work is to figure out better ways to keep our discussions productive, not figure out better ways to cut off discussion.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Ned. I think you may be making voting out to be more black-and-white than it needs to be. I agree that voting as it is usually done is horrible for dialog and deliberation. But the more advanced voting systems have the concept of continuous voting. More appropriately, it probably should be called continual voting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I speak of Votorola, because it's the one I'm most familiar with in this regard. In Votorola, anyone who wants to participate on a particular issue can make their own proposal, vote for another proposal, or delegate their vote to another person who can do either of those first two options. And very importantly: at any time, anyone can shift their decision: proposing something new, voting for a different proposal, delegating or withdrawing delegation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola doesn't contain internal logic as to when a decision is reached. But what it does do is facilitate consensus-building specifically because of voting. The voting/delegation apparatus allows people to judge if a proposal is being supported. Further, it actively encourages people to engage in consensus-building dialog. If I see that you're not voting for me, I can ask what your objection is, and I can then try to modify my proposal to resolve your objection. In other words, the voting system places a formal layer on top of the no unresolved objections decision rule, and makes it very easy to navigate through that rule.*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, I will also note that I do have an objection to the severity of no unresolved objections. I think I have stated it before, and Bentley brings it up in his last post. There are irrational people. In fact, there are a lot of psychopaths out there:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Epidemiology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Epidemiology</A>
</I>&gt;<i> So a rule such as yours seems to invite paralysis. Additionally, there are authoritarians out there: people who do not want democracy. I have no objection to their being invited into our fold, but I don't want one person to be able to paralyze our group entirely.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Am I misunderstanding your decision rule? Is it nuanced enough that it can deal with those sorts of problems? In earlier discussions, we had come up with somewhere between 80% and 90% support (in large populations) as an initial test cutoff to start with as a definition for consensus. Is that unreasonable?
</I>&gt;<i>
