<PRE>Hi Marc, (again -- seventh (and last!) response to same email)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; To cut a long story short: IMHO it is all about quality and
    quantity where NUO is towards quality while CV is towards quantity.

        But to get to a certain level of quality using NUO will take its
        time. Hence I think the following might be true:

        * Thesis V: CV seems to increase the speed of decision-making.

Ned&gt; I must demur. Blinap is at least as quick as any halfway reliable 
and affordable (CV) system, and is as quick as it needs to be.

 From the time-point that a new proposal is submitted to Blinap, it will 
typically be only a matter of a few days until the time-point that the 
proposer (and the world) finds out whether the proposal has succeeded, 
and why it did not succeed if it did not.

My suggestion is that this is about as quick as we would want a global 
decision system to be. We could make it quicker, but we would be 
squeezing the notification/response time-window too much if we did. The 
people who receive notification of the new proposal need to be given at 
least a few days of time to read it, and then decide whether they wish 
to respond.

So, on this basis, I object to &quot;Thesis V&quot;: At the global scale, if we 
are using Blinap, (CV) would not increase the speed of decision-making, 
and we would not want to increase the speed of decision-making in any case.
