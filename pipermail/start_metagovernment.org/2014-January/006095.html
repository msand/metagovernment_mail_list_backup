<PRE>Hi Marc, (again -- third response to same email)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; One of our ambitious aims is to cooperate with (nearly) any
    other existing system or theory in the area of decision-making.
    Therefore we are very keen to learn how Blinap fits into our model.

Ned&gt; In developing the Isonomea/Blinap model, I have been working from a 
different ambition. Here it is:

Each year (globally), tens of millions of proposals are formulated that 
affect public matters, and (correspondingly) tens of millions of 
decisions are made each year concerning whether to implement those 
proposals. (Think Fukushima, Monsanto, Syria, and on and on ...)

Of those tens of millions of public-matter decisions made each year, 
only a few thousands are made democratically by &quot;the people&quot; (almost all 
through voting). The rest are made (undemocratically) by legislatures, 
executive branches, courts, corporations, and such. (These are the 
decision-making actors of polyarchy.)

Of those tens of millions of decisions made each year, a great many are 
(in my view) bad decisions. The consequences of those bad decisions are 
all around us: war, poverty, environmental destruction, human rights 
violations, farmers in India committing suicide, and all the rest.

My ambition has been to come up with a decision system design that could 
potentially make *ALL* of those tens of millions of public-matter 
decisions per year, and that would reliably make *BETTER* decisions than 
all of the various polyarchy systems that are making those decisions now.

So, the decision system I want will need to satisfy those two criteria:

    * It must be capable of making tens of millions of public-matter
      decisions per year.
    * It must demonstrate that it can RELIABLY make BETTER decisions
      than the various polyarchy decision systems that are making those
      tens of millions of decisions now.

I am wide open to the &quot;quilting bee&quot; approach (stitching together 
disparate systems and theories to produce the decision system that I 
want) IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A GOOD RESULT.

I am also open to the &quot;organic&quot; approach (growing the decision system 
that I want organically, from a seed) IF THAT APPROACH PRODUCES A GOOD 
RESULT.

The result (a decision system that can satisfy the above criteria) is 
what matters. To produce that result, we should in my view use whatever 
approach works best. The approach is the means to the end. The result is 
the end. The end (result) is what matters, not the means (approach).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The argument that you need to make is that the AG_MFT model of the
    democratic process is &quot;better&quot; than other models such as Blinap, not
    that the democratic process can only be what the AG_MFT model
    declares it to be.

    Marc&gt; Interesting point! The AG-MFT does not try to define a
    *better* model - quite the contrary we try to define a *common*
    model. Another ambitious aim of ours is to enable cooperation
    between all those competing systems and theories around.

Ned&gt; I take you to be saying here that you are pursuing the &quot;quilting 
bee&quot; approach rather than the &quot;organic&quot; approach in attempting to 
produce the result that you want.

This then leads me to ask: What are the criteria that you wish the 
resulting democratic process to satisfy? (I have given my criteria 
above. What are the criteria for the overall system that AG_MFT has in 
mind?)
