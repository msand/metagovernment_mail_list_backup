<PRE>Hi Ed,

I agree with you that, if we can get through this (which we will), that 
will be a Very Good Thing, for many reasons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; I continue to not understand what you define NUO as. Every time
    you describe it, there appears to be some intelligent selection
    mechanism. That sounds to me like a person exercising authority. Can
    you please very simply (as in, in one paragraph) explain how
    something can be defined as having no unresolved objections without
    someone making that decision on their own authority. And if the
    answer is that there is some other standard by which objections are
    judged, then who makes that standard?

Ned&gt; The MLOVRTO PROPOSAL that sets up the MLOVRTO Decision System (if 
the proposal succeeds) defines very precisely what NUO means for that 
particular version of NUO.

In order to help me try to make that definition more clear, would it be 
possible for you to talk to me specifically about what you do not 
understand in that proposal?

Here again is the link to the MLOVRTO PROPOSAL:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO</A>

And here again is the link to the email in which I give an extended 
example of the MLOVRTO Decision System in operation:

Earlier, you were confused about step 3 of that proposal. Did I succeed 
in clearing up that confusion?
