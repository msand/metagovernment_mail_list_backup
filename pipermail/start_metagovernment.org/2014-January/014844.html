<PRE>Ned,

Thanks for starting this thread. Do we have a process for &quot;no unresolved
objections&quot; that has been tried before or are you suggesting that we try a
new process to start (Blinap?). If the latter, would you agree to a process
to revert to voting if the new process requires improvement that
significantly slows down the group. I personally would prefer to have a
non-voting system but my objection is that an untried system could slow
down or halt the effort. On the other hand, If no one is willing to try a
new system then we will never get to a new system. Who else than
Metagovernment would be willing to be the proving ground for a new process.
I think I'm talking myself out of my own objection.

Look forward to your clarification,
Bentley

</I>&gt;<i> In making public decisions, we need a decision rule. Abstractly, two
</I>&gt;<i> choices are here now on the table: count votes, or deliberate to the point
</I>&gt;<i> of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The choice to count votes to decide has been around for thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of those years have
</I>&gt;<i> generally found that it does not work very well:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
</I>&gt;<i>    nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
</I>&gt;<i>    democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
</I>&gt;<i>    discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
</I>&gt;<i>    treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
</I>&gt;<i>    candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
</I>&gt;<i>    most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
</I>&gt;<i>    democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is
</I>&gt;<i>    always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
</I>&gt;<i>    greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about
</I>&gt;<i>    200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that we have computers and global electronic communications, another
</I>&gt;<i> decision rule option is on the table (even at the scale of large
</I>&gt;<i> populations). The option is to keep proposing and counter-proposing until
</I>&gt;<i> the point is reached that, among all those participating (which includes
</I>&gt;<i> all those who wish to participate), there are no unresolved objections to
</I>&gt;<i> implementing the proposal. That marks the point at which the decision has
</I>&gt;<i> been made to implement the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which sort of decision rule shall we adopt?
