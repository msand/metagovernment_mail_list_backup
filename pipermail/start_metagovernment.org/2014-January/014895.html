<PRE>Ned, you haven't overlooked my feedback here have you? I'm having trouble following anything you say about &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; because I cannot understand how it is not an arbitrary/authoritarian criterion. Very simply put: what criteria are used to evaluate the validity of proposals and objections, and who gets to decide those criteria?

Also, in later posts, you appear to continue to assume that voting systems require a quorum, which I objected to here. I see no such requirement. There can be a defined quorum, but it does not need to be anything like a large portion of the affected population. Instead, decisions simply need to be made very public to the affected community before they go into effect. If people have a problem with the decision, they can then jump in, cast votes, and defeat (or better, modify) the measure.

&gt;<i> That's a lot to read, and my time is limited, but from a once-over, I have these objections. I will try to keep them brief because I believe that brevity (when well-thought-out) fosters participation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In your linked page, under the MLOVRTO proposal, this is the point I don't understand:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. Set up a list: the Master List Of Valid Reasons To Object 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Who does that? What decision-rule do they use to create that list? Is it this other point?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6. Items are put onto the list by successfully proposing that they be put on it. Items are removed from the list by successfully proposing that they be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Because that one seems to infer that #3 is valid. If #3 is supported by #6 and #6 is supported by #3... that's simply circular logic. I can't really respond to the rest without resolving that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I of course also can't respond to &quot;MLOVRTO does it better.&quot; Can you explain further while maintaining relative sound-bites? In other words, can you meaningfully respond with two sentences instead of one fragment; just to give us a hint of what you mean?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One other minor objection to the presentation. In the following section, 2.a. is not part of what I would propose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2.a. Quorum Rule: Ninety percent or more of eligible voters vote
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The super-majority rule (as you characterize it; I would call it a defined-consensus rule) is only of participating voters, not of all potential voters. I advocate decision-making by those who care to participate, not by a forced quorum. (I.e., in Metagov, by your definition a quorum would currently require ~6.4 billion people to vote. I don't expect that.) So you can simply delete 2.a. Also note when defining an 80% rule for Metagov, we had more nuance than just straight-up 80%:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Great Post! I heartily applaud your excellent and successful attempt to distill down our differences. This is playing out as one of those dream discussions that actually proves to be productive.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The first objection that I must DEFEND against is the &quot;proposal is vague&quot; objection that you have proposed. (I accept without objection that &quot;proposal is vague&quot; is a legitimate basis for objecting to a proposal, which then enjoins that I not be vague if I want my proposal to succeed -- more on all that to come.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mounting the defense required that I try to come up with a not-vague particular instantiation of the abstract &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule, that would be able to survive all the other objections that you have proposed as well. So, I did. The result was:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO Decision System
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/MLOVRTO</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO Decision System is not an actual piece of what is down the Blinap rabbit hole. It is a stripped-down, simplified arrangement intended to serve as a discussion device to show that the abstract rule can be successfully DEFENDED against the other objections that you have proposed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All of your other objections appear on a &quot;Master List Of Objections&quot; at the bottom of the MLOVRTO wiki-page.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My intention is to respond to each of these objections, with each response serving as the initial post of a new thread devoted to discussing the objection. Since the list of objections already contains over a dozen items, this will involve considerable discussion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Which raises the question: Why would we put time and effort into discussing all of these topics?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My answer: To choose between the abstract &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; decision rule and the abstract &quot;Count Votes&quot; decision rule is (in Thomas Kuhn terms) to choose between two entirely distinct decision making paradigms; two distinct ways to do democracy. In my view, there is no more fundamental choice that we Metagovernment Mavens could be discussing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, that's just me. Before &quot;plunging in&quot;, I would be interested to hear any responses there may be to my proposal that we launch into the extended discussion program that the list of objections on the MLOVRTO wikipage will entail.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi, Ned. For the sake of brevity (which I always advocate) I think I can simplify my objections to these key points:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, successful proposals are supported by being defensible in discourse, from the perspective of defensible considerations.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't see what &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; means. It sounds to me like a second, vague layer of decision rule, buried behind the no-objections one. It's a qualifier of what kind of objections are legitimate and what kind are not. So... who makes that decision? Who is the arbiter of reasonableness? Who gets to decide that something is being defended in discourse or not? If your answer in any way involves specific individuals, then how are those people not authoritarian?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> My contention is that the voting layer is unnecessary, extraordinarily expensive, and actually counter-productive in several ways.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'd say the opposite (unless your answer to my question above is something I don't yet understand) -- that a continual, mutable voting system actually is necessary and greatly increases efficiency. How else is it decided that there are now no unresolved objections and thus a proposal should be acted upon? In a discussion where there are even a hundred active participants, how is one to follow everything and come to the conclusion that there are no unresolved objections? Wouldn't it help to have a scoreboard tracking that for you? A system like Votorola is only that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What does it add to make me have to track you down and ask you what your objection is? (If there are a million people not voting for my proposal, am I to track each one of them down?)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> No, that's exactly what online systems help with. You don't have to track down anyone. You can identify the million people not voting for your proposal with a click, and you can address them all at once if the system chooses to allow for that. How is that inferior to trying to read everything all those million people have said and determining if they have reasonable objections?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would say that it [vote-count democracy] is not reasonable, and I would say that it [90% support] is not consensus -- it is a super-majority.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> In such a system, I would pretty much always be a member of the losing 10%, and I am not a psychopath. (Am I?)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I understand what it's like to be on the short-side of 90% of the public; but I actually doubt a complex collaborative governance voting system would be anything like current voting systems. Since there aren't a handful of hot-button issues, the people invlved in discourse on any issue would be the engaged. It's not &quot;do we go to war with this nation or not&quot; but rather &quot;do we spend money on renovating the community park or not, and if so how, and what specific improvements do we make, and how do we pay for them, and who should manage the project?&quot; When you get discourse to that level of nuance, achieving 90% requires deep consensus and buy-in by everyone who could have a reasonable objection.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But society has to have some losers in discourse sometimes. That's the problem with society. It cannot be perfect for everyone every time. I'd say that's the price we have for the fact that most of the time society (if managed well) works in our favor.
