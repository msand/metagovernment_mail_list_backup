<PRE>Hi Max,

The qKonsens is currently being prototyped. The UI is *just* JavaScript 
hosted within a php file. The backend side is also *just* prototyped as an 
OData Endpoint using ASP.NET Web API yet.

The idea is, that we derive some interface specifications from this 
prototypes to allow everyone to develop their own qKonsens implementations 
using their prefered language, tooling and environment.

Cheers
marc

I am pleased.

Note that having gone down into detail in these many discussion threads, 
there becomes a need for resolution of the setup nd passing that up in a 
more general discussion.
This is an interesting requirement.

But, please favor me with a statement about software tools to be used.  By 
the I might hope to hear say Dango or python.

phrase of  discussion may be much smaller than a paragraph.

Yes indeed. This is why the qKonsens supports breakdown of a *Kernaussage* 
down to a single sentence.

Cheers
