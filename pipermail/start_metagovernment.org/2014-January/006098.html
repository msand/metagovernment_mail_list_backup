<PRE>Hi Marc, (again -- sixth response to same email)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
    qualitative and a quantitative one:

        * (2) While (NUO) solely suits well for small groups, (CV) can
          also handle large scale effectively.

Ned&gt; My objection to this is two-fold:

   1. I have proposed (in the previous email of this tsunami) that there
      exists at least one instantiation of (NUO) that can successfully
      scale to the global level. (That instantiation being Blinap.)
   2. I now propose that there is NO instantiation of (CV) that can
      successfully scale to the global level.

By &quot;successful&quot; I mean this:

   1. The (CV) decision system makes wise decisions more reliably than
      the decision systems we have now, and more reliably than scalable
      (NUO) decision systems such as Blinap.
   2. The quality of the decisions does not degrade as the volume of
      decisions made increases to and through tens of millions per year,
      and the number of participants increases to and through billions.
   3. The composite cost-per-decision is not significantly greater than
      the composite cost-per-decision of current polyarchy decision
      systems, and does not increase significantly as the volume of
      decisions increases to and through tens of millions per year, and
      the number of participants increases to and through billions.
      (Blinap satisfies this cost criterion.)

To express the argument as briefly as possible:

   1. The first problem for (CV) is that it cannot make wise decisions
      more reliably than (NUO) at any scale, and (NUO) systems such as
      Blinap can now scale.
   2. The second problem for (CV) is that the only way that keep cost
      per decision from exploding as volume and participants increase is
      to reduce the quorum requirement for each decision drastically.
      But this then seriously degrades the &quot;wisdom&quot; reliability of the
      decision making, putting it even further behind (NUO) systems that
      can scale.
   3. Both of these problems exist for all possible instantiations of (CV).

I understand that this is a huge assertion to be making. Objections to 
this argument that (CV) cannot successfully scale are cordially and 
heartily invited ...
