<PRE>I have been reading the posts discussing opinions on Metgovernment's
governance structure and it occurred to me that one foundation of this
group could be to exercise the many different tools and theories for
governance. I'm not sure if it is wise to say that the groups official
decision making tool change frequently but that we have a parallel process
to make the same decisions on new tools of governance at the same time as
we use our standard one.

If not, I would like to work with any others in this group to
systematically try our all the tools we can find (and build). Let me know
if you would want to participate.

Let me know if you feel this is better as a focus of Metagovernment or a
sub group or if I'm on my own.

Thanks,
Bentley
