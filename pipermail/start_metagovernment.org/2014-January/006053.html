<PRE>Hi Ed and All

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In making public decisions, we need a decision rule. Abstractly, two 
choices are here now on the table: count votes, or deliberate to the 
point of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.

The choice to count votes to decide has been around for thousands of 
years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of those years have 
generally found that it does not work very well:

    A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
    nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
    democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
    discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
    treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
    candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
    most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
    democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is
    always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
    greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about
    200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)

Now that we have computers and global electronic communications, another 
decision rule option is on the table (even at the scale of large 
populations). The option is to keep proposing and counter-proposing 
until the point is reached that, among all those participating (which 
includes all those who wish to participate), there are no unresolved 
objections to implementing the proposal. That marks the point at which 
the decision has been made to implement the proposal.

Which sort of decision rule shall we adopt?
