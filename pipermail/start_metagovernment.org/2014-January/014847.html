<PRE>Ed,

Thanks for starting this thread and for your work on this mission.

My Goals in this area are:

   - Experiment with new government tools by using SettleIt.org on a real
   complex issue  you can see the super secret demo at Settleit.org/veg
   - Find a way to spend more time on these collaboration and government
   tools.

If I could make one suggestion for you, in the absence of a decision
process we might move a little faster if we had a &quot;benevolent dictator&quot;
that would make early decisions then work hard to be replaced by a
community process. Just a thought.

Happy New Year,
Bentley

&gt;<i> Greetings, colleagues, and welcome to 2014!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the new year in front of us, I'd like to ask you what your plans are
</I>&gt;<i> for working on collaborative governance in the upcoming year, and what
</I>&gt;<i> objectives you would like to see this group achieve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the group, I'd like to see us come up with a somewhat more formal
</I>&gt;<i> internal governance structure. Adhocracy has worked well so far, but at
</I>&gt;<i> some point we probably should (as programmers say) eat our own dog food.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would also like to see us start up the blog we had talked about several
</I>&gt;<i> years ago. I think it can be easy if we do it as a fairly open community
</I>&gt;<i> blog where several people can be authors. I'll add ramping up the blog to
</I>&gt;<i> my personal objectives (unless there are objections).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my personal objectives, I hope to:
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Start up an American non-profit
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Speak at at least two conferences on behalf of the group
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Start up the blog and contribute to it periodically
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Be a more frequent tester/experimenter with related/member software
</I>&gt;<i> projects
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's all I have at the moment, but I'm open to suggestion if there is
</I>&gt;<i> more others want from me. My time has been severely impinged upon for the
</I>&gt;<i> past couple of years primarily due to family medical issues. But I am
</I>&gt;<i> optimistic I will be finding more time in this year, and that you'll be
</I>&gt;<i> hearing a lot more from me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would you like to see from this group, and what do you intend to do
</I>&gt;<i> personally?
