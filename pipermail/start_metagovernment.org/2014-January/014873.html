I hadn't noticed you posting this before, but I thought you knew better than to characterize advanced democracy systems (i.e., some Metagov projects) as having anything to do with this antiquated, broken, primitive form of voting. In philosophical terms, that's an inductive fallacy or perhaps a definist fallacy.

The above quote assumes that democracy is equivalent to majority rule. Our form of democracy is about consensus. You will never find a consensus of the voters &quot;voting themselves generous gifts from the public treasury.&quot; That's absurd. It is their treasury, and at least a few people will be smart enough to understand that.* I cannot possibly imagine any collaborative governance system where any proposal can be voted on without the funding being a part of the proposal and the dialog. In a sense, most government proposing is in fact about funding.


*I boldly make the assertion that if consensus is defined as a massive majority, such as 80-90% of participants, then there will always be 10-20% of the people reasonable enough to stop stupidity from reigning. Additionally, I do not think any past system can be compared to collaborative governance, because in even current &quot;advanced democracies&quot; most people are disenfranchised almost all the time: so their level of interest and participation is nothing like what can be expected if they have the power to participate in any decision as they please.
