<PRE>Hi Michael,

Happy to read your mail!

The good news is, that the AG-MFT has started to *prototype* the qKonsens 
(qualified consensus) methodology last year. And yes, the qKonsens *is* 
document oriented!

Michael, maybe we can schedule a mumble meeting in the near future?

Cheers
Marc

The trouble we had back then is that you've &quot;no facility to express
agreement at the level of whole issues, such as texts (macro-voting).&quot;
<A HREF="https://service.piratenpartei.de/pipermail/ag-meinungsfindungstool/2013-April/002220.html">https://service.piratenpartei.de/pipermail/ag-meinungsfindungstool/2013-April/002220.html</A>

So if Votorola were to cooperate with AG-MFT, we'd have to design and
implement a macro-voting plug-in framework by ourselves.  This would
be risky, because there might never be another facility to &quot;plug in&quot;
to that framework.

Last we spoke, you were going to look at reducing the risk by finding
a partner for us, somebody to cooperate with; perhaps a LiquidFeedback
developer (though LiquidFeedback is more for decision making than
discussion purposes).

But that's a difficult job.  Never before have two voting projects
cooperated in order to give users a fair choice between their tools.
We've been trying to find a willing project for years.  We're still
trying, but AFAIK only Votorola is willing.  (It gives us big heads,
thinking we're the only good guys in the world of voting technology.
Or thinking others are just scared of competing against us. ;^)
