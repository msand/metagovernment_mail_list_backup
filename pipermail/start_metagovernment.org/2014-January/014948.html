<PRE>I require a group of at least 5 people to perform a specific action that
promotes internet tools to enable collaborative governance that requires no
more than 4 hours per week. If there is less than 5 people or it does not
appear to have a good chance of promoting internet tools to enable
collaborative governance then I will probably not participate.

&gt;<i> Bentley Davis said:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I would participate if Metagovernment hosts try-outs of tools
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (even if my tool was not included).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And not otherwise?  I.e. no try-outs, no Bentley?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again the basic form of the answer is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    (answer) I will participate if X.  Otherwise I will not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a two-fold promise, which means sincerity is doubly important.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone uncomfortable with sincerity is advised not to answer. ;^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would participate in other things also depending on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; availability and interest at that time. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, but the question (as I intend it) is what you'd *require*
</I>&gt;<i> first in order to make yourself available and interested.  If you're
</I>&gt;<i> already happy with the group and ready to participate in just about
</I>&gt;<i> anything that comes down the pipeline (within reason), then the answer
</I>&gt;<i> would be:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    (answer) I require nothing.  I like Metagov as it stands and will
</I>&gt;<i>             participate in just about anything here (within reason).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That would be a valid answer if you're sincere about it, and a very
</I>&gt;<i> generous one.  Almost a blank cheque.  I doubt even Ed would be that
</I>&gt;<i> generous with the group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are you willing to do to decrease word suck?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand.  What is &quot;word suck&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mike
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Like:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Attend presentations on tools and systems for enhancing government.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Participate in brainstorming sessions about tools needed for
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Participate or attend debates on different methodologies of
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Curate news articles and posts for people interested in
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governance. (on the wiki)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Build or piece together a tool for Metagov to communicate better
</I>&gt;<i> than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    this email thread.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Prototype suggested tools for collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Build a catalog of tools for collaborative governance with
</I>&gt;<i> comparisons
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    and metrics (on the wiki)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Design a curriculum for people wishing to learn about the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    possibilities and history of collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create graphic videos to encourage people to join collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governance
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create info-graphics about the potential influence of collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Share information in my social media accounts about Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - condense these long emails into actionable or informative summaries
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Create a marketing campaign and slogan (Government, but
</I>&gt;<i> productive...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Follow Eds lead and invite people with interesting projects to share
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    them on Metagov (although the experience was less than ideal)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Work on a suggested code of conduct for Metagov to foster positive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    mutually beneficial interactions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Host a local meetup group to discuss Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Work on my own ideas for tools for collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Give $10 a month to the organization Ed is starting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What are you willing to do to decrease word suck?
