<PRE>Hi Marc,

As far as I am concerned, you *never* need to apologize for jumping in! 
(I am a really big fan of you and the AG_MFT, and have consistently 
found your contributions to the list to be excellent.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; Which raises the question: Why would we put time and effort
    into discussing all of these topics?

        My answer: To choose between the abstract &quot;No Unresolved
        Objections&quot; decision rule and the abstract &quot;Count Votes&quot;
        decision rule is (in Thomas Kuhn terms) to choose between two
        entirely distinct decision making paradigms; two distinct ways
        to do democracy. In my view, there is no more fundamental choice
        that we Metagovernment Mavens could be discussing.

    Marc&gt; Well, is this really the one-million-dollar-question: Which
    decision rule to choose?

        * (NUO) &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot;
        * (CV) &quot;Count Votes&quot;

        IMHO there is no need to choose one rule over the other!

Ned&gt; I am not sure that I am following you here. It appears to me that 
in every particular case that an actual decision is actually made, a 
decision rule has been used in making that decision. The only choice is 
whether the decision rule is explicit or (wink wink) implicit. We always 
in fact do, in every particular case, choose one rule over others.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; Because both rules not only typify different paradigms for
    decision-making, but they focus on entirely different aspects of the
    democratic process also! Hence in the end they are not comparable to
    each other. Thus no decision possible. (This reminds me of the
    Mission Impossible tune - really no clue why! ;o) 

Ned&gt; Again, I am not quite following you. The claim that the two 
abstract rules &quot;focus on entirely different aspects of the democratic 
process&quot; is true in the AG_MFT model because the model declares it to be 
true. But in other equally democratic models (such as the Blinap model), 
the claim is not true, because those other models declare it to not be 
true.

The AG_MFT model separates the democratic process into:

    * opinion forming
    * position forming
    * decision making

The Blinap model contains no such separation of the democratic process 
into three parts. Instead, decisions are arrived at through successive 
recursive proposing. (If you think that Blinap actually does contain the 
three parts as separate parts, show me.)

The argument that you need to make is that the AG_MFT model of the 
democratic process is &quot;better&quot; than other models such as Blinap, not 
that the democratic process can only be what the AG_MFT model declares 
it to be.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
    qualitative and a quantitative one:

        * (1) While (NUO) focuses on equity, (CV) strives for majority.
        * (2) While (NUO) solely suits well for small groups, (CV) can
          also handle large scale effectively.

Ned&gt; I think I may agree that &quot;(NUO) focuses on equity&quot;, but I would 
need to know more about what you mean by &quot;equity&quot; to know for sure.

I would agree that (CV) does strive for some measure of vote-count 
popularity, but &quot;majority&quot; is only such measure among many.

I agree that (NUO) can suit well for small groups.

I *STRONGLY* dispute that (CV) can successfully scale to large populations.

(I keep posting this quote only because no one has so far even tried to 
counter it. We really need to &quot;grok in fullness&quot; that &quot;count votes&quot; 
systems have been around for thousands of years, and have *NEVER* shown 
themselves to be sustainable at the scale of large populations -- for 
reasons that are intrinsic to voting, irrespective of the technical 
particulars of the vote-count system.)

    A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
    nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
    democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
    discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
    treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
    candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
    most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
    democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is
    always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
    greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about
    200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; This leads me to the assumption that we should implement
    *both* rules and choose which one to use depending on the current
    context of a decision to be made on demand.

Ned&gt; I totally agree with you that we need to run the experiments, 
preferably in parallel (resources permitting).

But, you appear to be asserting that you already know which particular 
decision rule will work best in which sort of context. I don't think 
that you do. Show me the data. (I state this provocatively to emphasize 
that I really think that WE NEED TO RUN THE EXPERIMENTS in order to have 
ACTUAL EMPIRICAL SUPPORT for any claims regarding which particular 
decision rules will work best in various particular contexts.)

    Will Rogers&gt; It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's
    what we know that ain't so.
