<PRE>Hi Marc,

You are indeed asking a right question. In this thread, I cast &quot;the 
question&quot; as that of choosing between two abstract decision rules. I did 
that to try to clarify that there really are two distinct abstract 
rules, that really are fundamentally different, and that we really are 
choosing between them when we choose a particular decision system. (And, 
I do indeed think that, abstractly, (NUO) is &quot;better&quot; than (CV).)

But the truth is, both God and the Devil are always in the details. It 
is possible to make really bad instantiations of either abstract rule. 
So, in responding to your query about my actual aims, I will abandon 
characterizing the choice as being a &quot;pure&quot; choice between abstract 
rules, and instead say this:

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * There are lots of public matters that are global and
      multi-generational in scope: that affect humanity, nature, and
      future generations. (All of the decisions over decades and across
      continents that led to the Fukushima disaster are a case in point.)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * I suggest that this reality entails that we need a single global
      grassroot democratic decision system. (Not a collection of
      independent systems that cannot work together as one system to
      produce decisions dealing with public matters that affect
      humanity, nature, and future generations.)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * I suggest that we do not have the resources to independently
      develop, demonstrate, and deploy multiple possible global decision
      systems that cannot work together as one system. We need to
      collaborate, and focus our efforts, if we wish to succeed (&quot;save
      the world&quot;) in a timely fashion.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * In the &quot;consensus through synthesis&quot; design phase (which is mostly
      where we are now), I think that we should consider all available
      designs and design ideas and decision rules and such, and compare
      and contrast and combine and improve them as best we can to
      create/select the single best design that we can come up with, to
      serve as starting point.
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * I think that we should then collaborate and focus on developing,
      demonstrating, and deploying that single best global-scale
      democratic decision system design (which will of course undergo
      further changes all along the way).
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * My initial contribution to the design phase effort is Blinap.
      Blinap does use (NUO), and does not use (CV), but that is only one
      of many factors that (in my view) make it &quot;better&quot; than other
      designs that are currently floating around.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Reference:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * (CV) = the abstract &quot;Count Votes&quot; decision rule
</I>&gt;<i>    * (NUO) = the abstract &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; decision rule
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Marc&gt; Because both rules [(CV) and (NUO)] not only typify different
</I>&gt;<i>    paradigms for decision-making, but they focus on entirely different
</I>&gt;<i>    aspects of the democratic process also! Hence in the end they are
</I>&gt;<i>    not comparable to each other. Thus no decision possible. (This
</I>&gt;<i>    reminds me of the Mission Impossible tune - really no clue why! ;o)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Again, I am not quite following you. The claim that the two
</I>&gt;<i>    abstract rules &quot;focus on entirely different aspects of the
</I>&gt;<i>    democratic process&quot; is true in the AG_MFT model because the model
</I>&gt;<i>    declares it to be true. But in other equally democratic models (such
</I>&gt;<i>    as the Blinap model), the claim is not true, because those other
</I>&gt;<i>    models declare it to not be true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Marc&gt; IMHO the different aspects are not only different in the
</I>&gt;<i>    context of the AG-MFT model. I think they are universal different in
</I>&gt;<i>    general.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; In that case, you have quite a challenge ahead of you to try to map
</I>&gt;<i> the parts and practices of the Isonomea/Blinap model into these
</I>&gt;<i> universally different aspects. I look forward to seeing how you do it.
</I>&gt;<i> (I stand ready to help in any way I can.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Blinap Decision System:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Marc&gt; It is the scalability of the decision rule that makes it act
</I>&gt;<i>    as a different aspect on the democratic process, which might be
</I>&gt;<i>    encountered by the emergence of the decision rule and the
</I>&gt;<i>    decision-making process itself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I suspect that this is a key sentence, which causes me to regret
</I>&gt;<i> that I don't understand what you are saying. When you say &quot;the decision
</I>&gt;<i> rule&quot;, are we talking about both (CV) and (NUO)? When you say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;encountered&quot; ... &quot;emergence&quot; ... (I'm lost).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; The AG_MFT model separates the democratic process into:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        * opinion forming
</I>&gt;<i>        * position forming
</I>&gt;<i>        * decision making
</I>&gt;<i>        * (and now &quot;coordination system&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        The Isonomea/Blinap model contains no such separation of the
</I>&gt;<i>        democratic process into three parts corresponding to these three
</I>&gt;<i>        aspects. More particularly, there is no distinction between
</I>&gt;<i>        &quot;position forming&quot; (discussion system) and &quot;decision-making&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>        (resolution system).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Marc&gt; Just for clarification: The AG-MFT model just states that
</I>&gt;<i>    there are different aspects of the decision-making process that a
</I>&gt;<i>    system *could* focus on in general. In an ideal world those
</I>&gt;<i>    different aspects might be represented by different and seperate
</I>&gt;<i>    systems that interact with each other. But in reality each existing
</I>&gt;<i>    theory or system will be part of at least one of those aspects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Unfortunately I don't know much about Blinap in this regard, so
</I>&gt;<i>        I can't say which aspects of the AG-MFT model it really covers.
</I>&gt;<i>        But IMHO the seperation just exists; independently from any
</I>&gt;<i>        existing theory or system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; It may be that seeing discussion and resolution as separate aspects
</I>&gt;<i> (and having separate systems for discussion and resolution) has seemed
</I>&gt;<i> inevitable because there has not up to this point ever been a (NUO)
</I>&gt;<i> system such as Blinap that could successfully operate at the global 
</I>&gt;<i> scale.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now that such (NUO) systems are possible, use of (CV) must be justified
</I>&gt;<i> (if it can be) for other reasons than just because it is &quot;the only game
</I>&gt;<i> in town&quot; for decision-making at the scale of large populations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of our ambitious aims is to cooperate with (nearly) any other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing system or theory in the area of decision-making. Therefore 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we are very keen to learn how Blinap fits into our model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The argument that you need to make is that the AG_MFT model of the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> democratic process is &quot;better&quot; than other models such as Blinap, not 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the democratic process can only be what the AG_MFT model declares it to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting point! The AG-MFT does not try to define a *better* model 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - quite the contrary we try to define a *common* model. Another 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ambitious aim of ours is to enable cooperation between all those 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> competing systems and theories around.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     qualitative and a quantitative one:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         * (1) While (NUO) focuses on equity, (CV) strives for majority.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         * (2) While (NUO) solely suits well for small groups, (CV) can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>           also handle large scale effectively.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I think I may agree that &quot;(NUO) focuses on equity&quot;, but I would 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> need
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to know more about what you mean by &quot;equity&quot; to know for sure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Bingo! IMHO this is one of the elementary questions! What is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;equity&quot;? To be honest; I can't tell you! But, I believe that we all 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> together as a society need to define what we would like the answer 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should be...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... for me this includes ethical and morally guidelines of how to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reach a *wise decision* that respects (nearly) all facets of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> domain where the decision is to be made.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would agree that (CV) does strive for some measure of vote-count
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> popularity, but &quot;majority&quot; is only such measure among many.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But at the end any &quot;vote-count popularity&quot; is a kind of measurement, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> isn't it? That's my point here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Thesis I: CV is about quantity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Thesis II: NUO is about quality.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that (NUO) can suit well for small groups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Great! We have consensus ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Thesis III: NUO can suit well for small groups (due to Thesis II).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I *STRONGLY* dispute that (CV) can successfully scale to large
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> populations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Great also! Here we have dissent ;o)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I keep posting this quote only because no one has so far even tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> counter it. We really need to &quot;grok in fullness&quot; that &quot;count votes&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems have been around for thousands of years, and have *NEVER* shown
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> themselves to be sustainable at the scale of large populations -- for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reasons that are intrinsic to voting, irrespective of the technical
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> particulars of the vote-count system.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO for now just the following fact seems to be relevant:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Thesis IV: CV might scale better on large groups than NUO do (due 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to Thesis I).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Marc&gt; This leads me to the assumption that we should implement
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     *both* rules and choose which one to use depending on the current
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     context of a decision to be made on demand.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I totally agree with you that we need to run the experiments,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> preferably in parallel (resources permitting).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> But, you appear to be asserting that you already know which particular
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decision rule will work best in which sort of context. I don't think 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you do. Show me the data. (I state this provocatively to emphasize

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> really think that WE NEED TO RUN THE EXPERIMENTS in order to have

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> EMPIRICAL SUPPORT for any claims regarding which particular decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rules
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> will work best in various particular contexts.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No, I don't know! And I guess nobody does! This is why the AG-MFT has 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> started last year to prototype several different systems as proof of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept implementations. We don't know if our model holds or not. So 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we need to eat the pudding!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     Will Rogers&gt; It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     what we know that ain't so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and even more enlightening: as soon as man thinks, he is wrong already!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> To cut a long story short: IMHO it is all about quality and quantity
