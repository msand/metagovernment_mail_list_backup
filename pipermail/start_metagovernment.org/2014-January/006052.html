<PRE>Hi Ed,

I now see that my perception was set and my response triggered by the 
presence of the modifier &quot;internal&quot;:

    Ed&gt; For the group, I'd like to see us come up with a somewhat more
    formal internal governance structure.

Now that I have understood this, it prompts me to ask (belatedly): why 
was &quot;internal&quot; in there? What did you mean by that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My response (having assumed you meant &quot;let's become a club&quot;) was to 
suggest that at this point we don't need internal governance, just a 
decision system -- which is indeed a governance sort of thing, as you say.

In my conception, there should be nothing &quot;internal&quot; about the decision 
system -- anyone in the world should be able to participate in making 
any (public) decision.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amorphous: The decision system itself needs to be formal (software and 
practices), but the group that participates in it can be as amorphous as 
pie -- I don't see a problem. If you do, please help me see it.

In my conception, all participants in the decision system are 
(administratively and from the perspective of the software) small 
partnerships (1 to 24 partners), and the collection of participating 
partnerships are associated only through their participation in the 
decision system. The decision system itself is the 
organizing/formalizing factor, and can operate at the scale of the 
entire global population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low Participation: I do not see low participation in itself as a problem 
(from the perspective of legitimacy and such). However many participate, 
any decisions made will be definitive for those participating, which is 
as it should be. (No Oligarchies! I know that you agree with this.)

The important thing is that &quot;the doors to all decision rooms&quot; should 
always be wide open to anyone and everyone. The design of the decision 
system can and should assure this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation: The motivation to participate (for members of our amorphous 
group) has been and will be that the world needs better governance, and 
we want to help with that.

We can be more effective at helping if we collaborate and synthesize.

Having determined to work together, we can (if we so choose) do that 
through iteratively and recursively proposing to a decision system, once 
we have an operational decision system that accepts proposals. (We don't 
need to become a club).

(Group hugs are also good, but we are spread out all over the world so 
those are limited.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you suggest, I will start new threads for the decision rule 
discussion and for various other &quot;fundamental choice&quot; discussions. And I 
will make the initial posts short, but &quot;sweet&quot; really is too much to ask 
... :^)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE>
