<PRE>Ned, I think you continue to mischaracterize what I am proposing, and I continue to be unclear about what you are proposing.

I do not propose supermajority rule. It would be much more fair to say I support &quot;no unresolved objections.&quot; However, where we differ is that I define NUO as &quot;no objections where there are any significant number of dissenters as defined perhaps by a percentage of votes for lack of any other equitable measure.&quot;

I continue to not understand what you define NUO as. Every time you describe it, there appears to be some intelligent selection mechanism. That sounds to me like a person exercising authority. Can you please very simply (as in, in one paragraph) explain how something can be defined as having no unresolved objections without someone making that decision on their own authority. And if the answer is that there is some other standard by which objections are judged, then who makes that standard?

The only primary decision rule I've seen you propose is that something is defensible in discourse. But that sounds like a completely subjective standard. Have you answered that? If so, it got lost in a wall of text. Can you please answer very simply. I apologize if I cannot sort through tortuous logic chains, but I think this can be answered very simply as I have very simply put forth my standard above.


P.S. Concerning this book, by reading the synopsis I don't see how it applies. It is about the antiquated governance structures of the past, and something like the supermajority rule used in the United States Senate has nothing at all to do with anything like collaborative governance. I do not support supermajority rule. I support consensus. The place where we differ is in how consensus can be measured. I would love to find common ground there, and I'm not sure we're even disagreeing. So again, please, what very simply is the absolute decider of NUO for you?
