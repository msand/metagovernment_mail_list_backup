Bravo. :) very good guys. Looking at human nature is huge in government. 
Just like making biotechnological devices. Its understanding the fine 
analog of humans being.

I agree. It should definitely be for hard work and perseverance. Any 
psychological  analysis would show you need to reinforce positive 
actions with positive awards.

But it has to be fool proof as we are using this as a benchmark. This is 
where we sink or swim because drive and reward fuels the soul and the 
human to keep going. Its the whole reason for being.

I'm not huge on specifics. That's where working together with everyone 
makes a huge difference . That's what makes this project so dynamic and 
fantastic.

If done right this can be a beautiful thing.
