<PRE>Hi Ed,

    Ed&gt; Ned, you haven't overlooked my feedback here have you? 

Ned&gt; I have not at all overlooked your feedback (and I am sincerely 
delighted to have received it, and that you are interested in my 
response). But responses to various parts of it have been going onto new 
threads (jumbled in with my responses to Marc and others), and some 
parts I have not yet responded to. (Those parts are definitely on my 
list ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; In your linked page, under the MLOVRTO proposal, this is the
    point I don't understand:

         &gt; 3. Set up a list: the Master List Of Valid Reasons To Object 

Ned&gt; The MLOVRTO proposal is a recipe for setting up the MLOVRTO 
decision system. If the proposal were instead a recipe for making 
marzipan, the step would read &quot;take out a saucepan&quot;. A saucepan is a 
place to put things, that starts out empty. Correspondingly, the &quot;set up 
a list&quot; step creates a place to put things, that starts out empty.

Perhaps it would have been clearer if I had said &quot;create a new wiki-page 
to contain list items as they are successfully proposed&quot;, but that would 
have been too implementation-specific. We could instead use a tool such 
as SettleIt to receive list items. The recipe doesn't care where the 
list resides, it just needs a place to put things. The recipe also 
doesn't care who sets up the list, and the individual who sets up the 
list (creates the new wiki-page or whatever) has no special authority 
with respect to what goes on the list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Who does that? What decision-rule do they use to create that
    list? Is it this other point?

         &gt; 6. Items are put onto the list by successfully proposing that
        they be put on it. Items are removed from the list by
        successfully proposing that they be removed.

    Ed&gt; Because that one seems to infer that #3 is valid. If #3 is
    supported by #6 and #6 is supported by #3... that's simply circular
    logic. I can't really respond to the rest without resolving that.

Ned&gt; Setting up an empty list (creating a new wiki-page or whatever) 
does not involve any sort of decision rule. It does not matter who sets 
up the empty list. It does not matter where the empty list is set up. 
The individual who sets up the empty list has no special authority with 
respect to what goes on the list. There is no circular logic. &quot;Set up a 
list&quot; is a step in a recipe, like &quot;take out a saucepan&quot;.

The step #6 that you quote above is indeed the step that specifies how 
items are put onto and taken off of the list, after it has been created 
as an empty list.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; I'm having trouble following anything you say about &quot;No
    Unresolved Objections&quot; because I cannot understand how it is not an
    arbitrary/authoritarian criterion. Very simply put: what criteria
    are used to evaluate the validity of proposals and objections, and
    who gets to decide those criteria?

Ned&gt; In the first email of this thread (LURKING AUTHORITARIANS) I 
presented an extended example that shows the process of items going onto 
the list, and being taken off of the list. The example also shows 
criteria (items on the list) being used to support proposals and to 
object to proposals. I look forward to your report regarding whether you 
have spotted any &quot;lurking authoritarians&quot; in the process of the example.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; The voting/delegation apparatus [of Votorola] allows people to
</I>&gt;<i>    judge if a proposal is being supported.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; The question is, supported by what?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        In Votorola and other vote-counting systems, the proposal is
</I>&gt;<i>        being supported by vote-count popularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        In a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, successful proposals are
</I>&gt;<i>        supported by being defensible in discourse, from the perspective
</I>&gt;<i>        of defensible considerations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; I don't see what &quot;defensible in discourse&quot; means. It sounds to
</I>&gt;<i>    me like a second, vague layer of decision rule, buried behind the
</I>&gt;<i>    no-objections one. It's a qualifier of what kind of objections are
</I>&gt;<i>    legitimate and what kind are not. So... who makes that decision? Who
</I>&gt;<i>    is the arbiter of reasonableness? Who gets to decide that something
</I>&gt;<i>    is being defended in discourse or not? If your answer in any way
</I>&gt;<i>    involves specific individuals, then how are those people not
</I>&gt;<i>    authoritarian?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You are correct that the abstract rule allows authoritarian 
</I>&gt;<i> designs. It is of course possible to set up instantiations of the 
</I>&gt;<i> abstract &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule that DO feature 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals in roles having special authority with respect to 
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy of arguments and such. In our standard polyarchies, judges 
</I>&gt;<i> and juries are typically vested with that kind of special authority. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Judge: &quot;Objection overruled!&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is also possible to set up instantiations in which NO ONE has 
</I>&gt;<i> any kind of special authority with respect to such matters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO decision system is absolutely egalitarian -- everyone that 
</I>&gt;<i> participates is equally a proposer, on absolutely equal footing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      DEFENSIBLE IN DISCOURSE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The MLOVRTO presentation provides a particular formalization of the 
</I>&gt;<i> meaning of &quot;defensible in discourse&quot;. If that formalization is still 
</I>&gt;<i> not clear enough, I will greatly appreciate any feedback you can offer 
</I>&gt;<i> to help me make it more clear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      FORMALIZATION OF INFORMAL DISCOURSE
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the foregoing, the arguments and counter-arguments are presented 
</I>&gt;<i> informally. Now I will attempt to formalize the exchange, from the 
</I>&gt;<i> perspective of the MLOVRTO decision system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This is just one way that the exchange could be formalized; several 
</I>&gt;<i> of the points in the exchange were implicit, and subject to multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> interpretations.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (JPS)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should enable us to
</I>&gt;<i>          judge if a proposal is being supported.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (IV_JPS)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. It is proposed that the voting/delegation apparatus of
</I>&gt;<i>          Votorola should be part of the decision system that we adopt,
</I>&gt;<i>          because that will satisfy basis (JPS).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (CEU)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. Basis: &quot;Items on MLOVTRO should be clear, explicit, and
</I>&gt;<i>          unambiguous.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Objection to (JPS): (JPS.1.CEU)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. &quot;Supported by vote-count popularity&quot; and &quot;supported by being
</I>&gt;<i>          defensible in discourse&quot; are two distinguishably and
</I>&gt;<i>          significantly different possible meanings of the term &quot;being
</I>&gt;<i>          supported&quot; in (JPS). (JPS) does not clarify which of these two
</I>&gt;<i>          meanings is intended.
</I>&gt;<i>       2. Therefore it is proposed that (JPS) be removed from MLOVRTO on
</I>&gt;<i>          the basis that it violates (CEU).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (JDD)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should enable us to
</I>&gt;<i>          judge if a proposal is being supported by being defensible in
</I>&gt;<i>          discourse.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (SME)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. Basis: &quot;In choosing between two system versions, the more
</I>&gt;<i>          efficient of the two should be selected, absent other bases
</I>&gt;<i>          for selection.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Objection to (IV_JPS): (IV_JPS.1.JDD,SME)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. The MLOVRTO decision system directly satisfies basis (JDD),
</I>&gt;<i>          without needing the voting/delegation apparatus of Votorola to
</I>&gt;<i>          do so.
</I>&gt;<i>       2. The basis (JPS) for including the functionality of Votorola
</I>&gt;<i>          has been removed, leaving Votorola with no other basis for
</I>&gt;<i>          inclusion.
</I>&gt;<i>       3. Including Votorola would decrease the decision-making
</I>&gt;<i>          efficiency of the overall system.
</I>&gt;<i>       4. It is therefore proposed that (IV_JPS) not be implemented,
</I>&gt;<i>          since doing so would violate (SME).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ed&gt; Initial Proposal: (NAP)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       1. Basis: &quot;The decision system that we adopt should be absolutely
</I>&gt;<i>          egalitarian. There should be no distinctions between governors
</I>&gt;<i>          and governed in the operation of the decision system. There
</I>&gt;<i>          should be no authoritarian powers vested in specific 
</I>&gt;<i> individuals.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>       2. It is proposed that this basis be put onto MLOVRTO as an item.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Ned&gt; Initial Proposal: (CML)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        * It is proposed that we adopt the decision system specified
</I>&gt;<i>          below (MLOVRTO), on the basis that it satisfies (NAP) and
</I>&gt;<i>          (JDD) and (SME).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           1. A proposal that faces no unresolved objections will be
</I>&gt;<i>              implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           2. A proposal that faces even one objection that has not been
</I>&gt;<i>              resolved will not be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           3. Set up a list: the Master List Of Valid Reasons To Object
</I>&gt;<i>              (MLOVRTO, pronounced ...)
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           4. To be valid, a proposed objection must point to at least
</I>&gt;<i>              one item on the list as the basis for the objection, and
</I>&gt;<i>              must argue successfully that the basis does apply. (An
</I>&gt;<i>              invalid objection is considered resolved.)
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           5. A proposed objection can be resolved by:
</I>&gt;<i>                 1. successfully proposing that its basis be removed
</I>&gt;<i>                    from MLOVRTO, thereby rendering it invalid.
</I>&gt;<i>                 2. successfully proposing that the basis does not
</I>&gt;<i>                    apply, thereby rendering it invalid.
</I>&gt;<i>                 3. successfully proposing an objection to the
</I>&gt;<i>                    objection, by pointing to at least one item on
</I>&gt;<i>                    MLOVRTO as the basis, and arguing successfully that
</I>&gt;<i>                    the basis does apply.
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>           6. Items are put onto the list by successfully proposing that
</I>&gt;<i>              they be put on it. Items are removed from the list by
</I>&gt;<i>              successfully proposing that they be removed.
</I>&gt;<i>              
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
