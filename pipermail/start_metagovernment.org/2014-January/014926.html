<PRE>Ned&gt; Having presented the three types, I will now suggest that you are
focused on what I have called &quot;private-matter&quot; decision making, and I am
focused on what I have called &quot;public-matter&quot; decision making. I guess the
first question would be, do you agree?

Yes, I agree.

Question: from your perspective, each &quot;public-matter decision&quot; would be
decided &quot;NUO&quot; way (100% consensus to pass a proposal type) by the billions
of people on Earth?

If the answer is yes, I think you are setting the bar too high for
collaborative governance. I am very skeptic this kind of &quot;NUO&quot; would work
on a national level, much less on a global scale. I firmly believe that due
to cultural and psychiological reasons all such &quot;public-matter&quot; proposals
will be blocked by someone amongst the billions of people on Earth, or
millions of people on a National level. Thus my interest in the
Metagovernment goals.
------------------------------------------

Ed&gt; Gustavo, one point made on that page is that a community needs (or
typically has always had) a charter: some document which lays out in
advance what decision rule will be used. If the decision rule is to change
from time to time, what decision rule is going to decide what decision rule
to use? Isn't it a vicious circle?

Difficult question to address in such a general way that would apply to any
circumstance. I'll take Ned's defintion of &quot;private-matter decisions&quot; since
&quot;an American nonprofit to serve this group&quot; would fit in that definition. I
know for a fact that you can have in your charter a defined rule of
decision-making to use on a regular basis and still be adaptable enough.
Two such ways are to write higher order &quot;rights&quot; in your charter that reads
something like:

1- *The collective of members have the right to overrule the default rules
for decision-making and decide, for a specific circumstance, what kind of
rules should apply. This right can only be resolved through the
[default/NUO/Vote/etc] decision-making process.*
This is how the collective, for instance, can &quot;legally&quot; delegate certain
decisions to a sub-group or individual while also defining the way the
sub-group or individual will come up with decisions acceptable by the
whole. For example, the nonprofit members may decide that Ned and Ed are a
representative enough subgroup to evaluate and directly approve, on behalf
of everyone, the company that will host the organization's website. Of
course everyone else should preserve the right to challenge the decisions
made by the subgroup, but *post factum*. The most important benefits here
are quickness of decision-making and reinforcement of trust amongst group
members.

2- *The collective of members should, for each and every specific
circumstance of the operational/legal/financial/etc. aspect of the
organization, define the rules for decision-making.*
This &quot;right&quot; would be written on the charter and there would be other
documents (regulations/minutes of meetings/...) where the decision making
rules would be defined for each circumstance. The most important benefit
here is reinforcement of freedom, autonomy, adaptability and creativity to
subgroups within the organization.

Anyways, there are options out there that circumvent the &quot;vicious circle&quot;.
All of them have advantages and disadvantages. And that's the reason why I
think freedom of choice on decision-making rules is a really important
principle.
