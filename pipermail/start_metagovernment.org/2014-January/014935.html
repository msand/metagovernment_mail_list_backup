I sense that the actual purpose of those discussions (I mean as events
really unfolded) was to promote ideas, products and so forth.  It was
entirely the purpose of particular individuals and organizations that
was served, not the purpose of the Metagov group.

Metagov's own sense of purpose is lately too weak to prevail in
discussions.  So Metagov is effectively aimless.

This is not necessarily a bad thing.  All of society is aimless, too.
(Now I'm doing it myself...  You see?  In a vacuum of purpose, one can
hardly speak without promoting oneself.)

&gt;<i> Sorry to jump in here but the last few weeks of browsing through the
</I>&gt;<i> discussions has inspired me to add my observations and wishes for this
</I>&gt;<i> group moving forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Firstly, we should try to remember, and stay mindful of how complicated our
</I>&gt;<i> message might be to others. We should try not to be overly fancy with our
</I>&gt;<i> words as it distracts from the actual message, if our goal is to reach
</I>&gt;<i> people, our message needs to be clear. A number of times I've been reading
</I>&gt;<i> and gotten sidetracked by some complex wording or a confusing anagram, the
</I>&gt;<i> simpler we make our questions and answers the more people will be able to
</I>&gt;<i> understand and participate. Having a link as an answer is not always the
</I>&gt;<i> best, try summarizing the part of the link you're getting your answer from.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Secondly, I'd really like to see us collaborate more. I understand we're
</I>&gt;<i> all experimenting in different areas of this idea, which granted has its
</I>&gt;<i> positives, but I think it's important where ever possible to come to
</I>&gt;<i> agreements. Like the charter that ED was proposing, the more things we can
</I>&gt;<i> collectively structure, the easier it will be come up with a real plan of
</I>&gt;<i> action for the future. I think everyone has some unique insights on how
</I>&gt;<i> exactly this idea should work, there are fundamental discussions that need
</I>&gt;<i> to occur but the more we can agree on the more successful we'll be at
</I>&gt;<i> actually establishing goals to move the project forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thirdly, the mechanism for which we're communicating, as I'm sure everyone
</I>&gt;<i> notices, is clunky and unorganized, to try to make sense of the past few
</I>&gt;<i> weeks of discussions and trace the line conversation is very difficult in
</I>&gt;<i> places. This is kind of embarrassing for a group that wants more
</I>&gt;<i> communication and collective action in the decision making process of
</I>&gt;<i> governments, the system we're using ourselves is nothing impressive. I know
</I>&gt;<i> that this e-mail format is a neutral place for us but I feel we should be
</I>&gt;<i> able to do better. It is for this reason that I humbly offer my website for
</I>&gt;<i> our method of communication, it is much more capable then the chain mail
</I>&gt;<i> we're using, it is able to organize and prioritize discussions properly for
</I>&gt;<i> easy referencing for anyone trying to catch up on 3 weeks on conversation.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps there is a reason we are doing it that way, and if that's case
</I>&gt;<i> please let me know why. As far as I can see though we'd be much better off
</I>&gt;<i> on a site that can provide a foundation to properly display our debates.
</I>&gt;<i> www.theinternetswebsite.com
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Also a small side note, the main discussion the past few weeks has been
</I>&gt;<i> about this &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; I applaud those tackling this debate
</I>&gt;<i> but it seems to me that it is an unrealistic goal. There will most likely
</I>&gt;<i> always be objections if posed to a large enough group, I think it's unfair
</I>&gt;<i> to say that any individual is wrong in their objection if they believe it
</I>&gt;<i> to be legitimate. This naturally leads to someone or something coming along
</I>&gt;<i> and overruling the objection and moving forward with the proposal, which,
</I>&gt;<i> as has been suggested, is giving power to some higher entity and against
</I>&gt;<i> what I think we stand for. It seems to me that the only fair way to address
</I>&gt;<i> these objections is to poll the people to determine if the objection holds
</I>&gt;<i> any weight and should stall the advancement of the proposal. We should
</I>&gt;<i> always strive for &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; and of course alter and
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate the proposal to address as many objections as possible but the
</I>&gt;<i> belief that something will ever be 100% agreed upon is too wishful. Again
</I>&gt;<i> I'll shamelessly plug my website for attempting to deal with this problem,
</I>&gt;<i> every comment on my site is able to be &quot;propped up&quot; so everyone can see
</I>&gt;<i> where an objection has favor-ability and should be explored more. That's
</I>&gt;<i> all for now, love to hear any responses. Much love.
