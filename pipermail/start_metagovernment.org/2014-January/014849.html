<PRE>Choosing between abstract decision rules is more like choosing among 
programming languages -- the choice does not speak to specific 
application designs, or to specific implementation choices and 
logistics, or to what the specific applications will be used to do.

The abstract decision rule can be applied to existing designs such as 
SettleIt in any number of concrete ways, just as the abstract idea of 
vote-counting can be implemented in any number of concrete ways.

I take it from your response that you do not see SettleIt as a decision 
making system, and do not see any way to make it into one using the &quot;no 
unresolved objections&quot; decision rule. If this is so, I would be very 
interested to learn your thoughts about the obstacles to doing so.

(Off the top of my head, adding a &quot;not resolved&quot; button to each item, 
that prompted for explanation of why not when pressed, might be a start. 
But, the design of SettleIt already substantially does that, so the 
implementation of the decision rule might only involve an extension to 
the scoring algorithm that the program also already has. But these are 
just guesses until I have spent some hands-on time with the new version.)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Bentley, (Happy New Year!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The Blinap design includes solutions to problems that only arise
</I>&gt;<i>     at the scale of large populations. We (the 200 or so on the
</I>&gt;<i>     Metagovernment mailing list) don't need those features yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Our immediate mission (should we choose to accept it -- cue
</I>&gt;<i>     Mission Impossible music) is to establish &quot;proof of concept&quot; at
</I>&gt;<i>     the &quot;Dunbar's Number Community&quot; scale for the feasibility and
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;betterness&quot; of using the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The tools that we use to accomplish that mission (at the community
</I>&gt;<i>     scale) will then subsequently become fully integrated parts of the
</I>&gt;<i>     Blinap system (that can function at the scale of the global
</I>&gt;<i>     population).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If we were to take SettleIt, and various pieces of the AG_MFT
</I>&gt;<i>     project (except the voting parts of course), and the ideas of
</I>&gt;<i>     Rawls and Habermas (et. al.) concerning public reason, and put
</I>&gt;<i>     them all in a pot and stir them together, we might find ourselves
</I>&gt;<i>     with the beginnings of a really good start toward accomplishing
</I>&gt;<i>     the mission. (I have left out some other important ingredients,
</I>&gt;<i>     only because I don't know enough about them.) Lots of us in the
</I>&gt;<i>     group are already working on projects that can contribute to
</I>&gt;<i>     accomplishing the mission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In one sense, it doesn't really matter what specific issues we
</I>&gt;<i>     decide, because the proof of our pudding is in the deciding. But,
</I>&gt;<i>     there are lots of things we need to decide in order to accomplish
</I>&gt;<i>     the mission, so the mission itself can provide us with grist for
</I>&gt;<i>     our decision-process mill. (Starting with: what specific decision
</I>&gt;<i>     rule shall we use? How will we know when we are done, in actual
</I>&gt;<i>     practice? Even more specifically, can you think of a no-vote
</I>&gt;<i>     decision rule that you could easily incorporate into SettleIt,
</I>&gt;<i>     just to get things started?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As far as reverting to voting: if someone proposes that we revert
</I>&gt;<i>     to voting, I will be very interested to study the reasoning for
</I>&gt;<i>     doing that. Up to this point, no one on the list (correct me if I
</I>&gt;<i>     am wrong) has offered a reasoned defense of vote-counting against
</I>&gt;<i>     the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As far as discussion slowing down the effort: collaboration and
</I>&gt;<i>     synthesis happen THROUGH discussion; voting TRUNCATES discussion,
</I>&gt;<i>     collaboration, and synthesis. Our work is to figure out better
</I>&gt;<i>     ways to keep our discussions productive, not figure out better
</I>&gt;<i>     ways to cut off discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (I could say a lot more in response, but Ed is watching ... :^)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Thanks for starting this thread. Do we have a process for &quot;no
</I>&gt;<i>         unresolved objections&quot; that has been tried before or are you
</I>&gt;<i>         suggesting that we try a new process to start (Blinap?). If
</I>&gt;<i>         the latter, would you agree to a process to revert to voting
</I>&gt;<i>         if the new process requires improvement that significantly
</I>&gt;<i>         slows down the group. I personally would prefer to have a
</I>&gt;<i>         non-voting system but my objection is that an untried system
</I>&gt;<i>         could slow down or halt the effort. On the other hand, If no
</I>&gt;<i>         one is willing to try a new system then we will never get to a
</I>&gt;<i>         new system. Who else than Metagovernment would be willing to
</I>&gt;<i>         be the proving ground for a new process. I think I'm talking

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             In making public decisions, we need a decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>         Abstractly,
</I>&gt;<i>             two choices are here now on the table: count votes, or
</I>&gt;<i>         deliberate
</I>&gt;<i>             to the point of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             The choice to count votes to decide has been around for
</I>&gt;<i>         thousands
</I>&gt;<i>             of years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of
</I>&gt;<i>         those
</I>&gt;<i>             years have generally found that it does not work very well:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always
</I>&gt;<i>         temporary in
</I>&gt;<i>                nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of
</I>&gt;<i>         government. A
</I>&gt;<i>                democracy will continue to exist up until the time that
</I>&gt;<i>         voters
</I>&gt;<i>                discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from
</I>&gt;<i>         the public
</I>&gt;<i>                treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote
</I>&gt;<i>         for the
</I>&gt;<i>                candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that]
</I>&gt;<i>         promise the
</I>&gt;<i>                most benefits from the public treasury, with the result
</I>&gt;<i>         that every
</I>&gt;<i>                democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy,
</I>&gt;<i>             which is
</I>&gt;<i>                always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of
</I>&gt;<i>         the world's
</I>&gt;<i>                greatest civilizations from the beginning of history,
</I>&gt;<i>         has been
</I>&gt;<i>             about
</I>&gt;<i>                200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Now that we have computers and global electronic
</I>&gt;<i>         communications,
</I>&gt;<i>             another decision rule option is on the table (even at the
</I>&gt;<i>         scale of
</I>&gt;<i>             large populations). The option is to keep proposing and
</I>&gt;<i>             counter-proposing until the point is reached that, among
</I>&gt;<i>         all those
</I>&gt;<i>             participating (which includes all those who wish to
</I>&gt;<i>         participate),
</I>&gt;<i>             there are no unresolved objections to implementing the
</I>&gt;<i>         proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>             That marks the point at which the decision has been made to
</I>&gt;<i>             implement the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Which sort of decision rule shall we adopt?
