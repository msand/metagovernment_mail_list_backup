<PRE>Hi Ed, (Good Post!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; I think you may be making voting out to be more black-and-white
    than it needs to be.

Ned&gt; The cast vote that is counted in order to have its effect cannot be 
challenged through discourse. (If Adeline decides to vote as she votes 
because the butler has such strong hands, that is what she will do, and 
her vote will be just as effective as any other vote.)

In contrast, in a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, every proposal by 
every participant in the decision process can be challenged through 
discourse, and will only have its effect if it is able to survive all 
such challenges.

To me, that seems a pretty &quot;black and white&quot; difference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; The voting/delegation apparatus allows people to judge if a
    proposal is being supported.

Ned&gt; The question is, supported by what?

In Votorola and other vote-counting systems, the proposal is being 
supported by vote-count popularity.

In a &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; system, successful proposals are 
supported by being defensible in discourse, from the perspective of 
defensible considerations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Further, it [voting] actively encourages people to engage in
    consensus-building dialog. If I see that you're not voting for me, I
    can ask what your objection is, and I can then try to modify my
    proposal to resolve your objection. In other words, the voting
    system places a formal layer on top of the no unresolved objections
    decision rule, and makes it very easy to navigate through that rule.

Ned&gt; My contention is that the voting layer is unnecessary, 
extraordinarily expensive, and actually counter-productive in several 
ways. If you have an objection to my proposal, you can propose the 
objection. What does it add to make me have to track you down and ask 
you what your objection is? (If there are a million people not voting 
for my proposal, am I to track each one of them down?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; However, I will also note that I do have an objection to the
    severity of no unresolved objections. I think I have stated it
    before, and Bentley brings it up in his last post. There are
    irrational people. In fact, there are a lot of psychopaths out
    there: ... So a rule such as yours seems to invite paralysis.

Ned&gt; I take this to be a key question, and it is an empirical question. 
To find out whether the rule will indeed &quot;invite paralysis&quot;, we need to 
run the experiments, in contexts where irrational people and psychopaths 
are involved. Because it is a &quot;new thing&quot;, the burden of proof lies with 
those who favor the rule. (Except of course, as an informal practice it 
is a very old thing, that has been around even longer than vote-counting 
...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Additionally, there are authoritarians out there: people who do
    not want democracy.

Ned&gt; At this point, the most powerful and sophisticated authoritarians 
in the world (the ones actually &quot;in charge&quot;) clearly DO want &quot;vote-count 
democracy&quot;. The voters decide a few dozen public matters per year, and 
the authoritarians then get to decide all of the millions of other 
public matters per year, with the entire system legitimized by the 
voting -- what's not to like?

All of the actually important decisions are now being made by the 
polyarchies of the world (including the corporations), not 
democratically by &quot;the people&quot; in any sense. Because vote counting 
severely limits the number of decisions per year that can be made 
democratically, no vote-count system can change this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; Am I misunderstanding your decision rule? Is it nuanced enough
    that it can deal with those sorts of problems?

Ned&gt; Those of us who favor the rule need to demonstrate to you that it 
can, even with irrational people and psychopaths in the mix.

And also, the track record of vote-count systems in dealing with such 
problems is not all that great, so I do not see the bar for our 
demonstration as being set unattainably high.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ed&gt; In earlier discussions, we had come up with somewhere between
    80% and 90% support (in large populations) as an initial test cutoff
    to start with as a definition for consensus. Is that unreasonable?

Ned&gt; I would say that it [vote-count democracy] is not reasonable, and I 
would say that it [90% support] is not consensus -- it is a super-majority.

In such a system, I would pretty much always be a member of the losing 
10%, and I am not a psychopath. (Am I?)

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Ned. I think you may be making voting out to be more black-and-white than it needs to be. I agree that voting as it is usually done is horrible for dialog and deliberation. But the more advanced voting systems have the concept of continuous voting. More appropriately, it probably should be called continual voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I speak of Votorola, because it's the one I'm most familiar with in this regard. In Votorola, anyone who wants to participate on a particular issue can make their own proposal, vote for another proposal, or delegate their vote to another person who can do either of those first two options. And very importantly: at any time, anyone can shift their decision: proposing something new, voting for a different proposal, delegating or withdrawing delegation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola doesn't contain internal logic as to when a decision is reached. But what it does do is facilitate consensus-building specifically because of voting. The voting/delegation apparatus allows people to judge if a proposal is being supported. Further, it actively encourages people to engage in consensus-building dialog. If I see that you're not voting for me, I can ask what your objection is, and I can then try to modify my proposal to resolve your objection. In other words, the voting system places a formal layer on top of the no unresolved objections decision rule, and makes it very easy to navigate through that rule.*
