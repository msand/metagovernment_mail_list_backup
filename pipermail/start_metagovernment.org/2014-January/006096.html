<PRE>Hi Marc, (again -- fourth response to same email)

For Reference:

    * (CV) = the abstract &quot;Count Votes&quot; decision rule
    * (NUO) = the abstract &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; decision rule

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
    qualitative and a quantitative one:

        * (1) While (NUO) focuses on equity, (CV) strives for majority.

    Ned&gt; I think I may agree that &quot;(NUO) focuses on equity&quot;, but I would
    need to know more about what you mean by &quot;equity&quot; to know for sure.

    Marc&gt; Bingo! IMHO this is one of the elementary questions! What is
    &quot;equity&quot;? To be honest; I can't tell you! But, I believe that we all
    together as a society need to define what we would like the answer
    should be...

        ... for me this includes ethical and morally guidelines of how
        to reach a *wise decision* that respects (nearly) all facets of
        the domain where the decision is to be made.

Ned&gt; OK. Now I am closer to understanding what you mean by &quot;equity&quot;, but 
not closer to understanding why you use that term.

Would it be fair for me to restate what you said above thusly?

    * (NUO) focuses on making wise decisions.
    * (CV) focuses on making popular decisions.

If this restatement is not a fair restatement of your meaning, I would 
be interested to learn why not. (That might help me understand why you 
use the term &quot;equity&quot;.)

And also, I heartily agree with the distinction as I have stated it:

    * (NUO) more reliably produces wise decisions, that are sometimes
      popular.
    * (CV) always produces popular decisions, that are sometimes (I
      would say seldom) wise.

Since I am interested in having a global democratic decision system that 
reliably produces wise decisions, and don't really care whether the 
decisions are vote-count popular or not, I much prefer (NUO) to (CV).
