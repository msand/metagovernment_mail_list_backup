<PRE>Am I correct if I rephrase it to say that you are proposing that:

   - we design and implement a new decision making process.
   - it will be used to make decisions over shared Metagovernment resources
   etc
   - the design will be based on a set of rules of which you have proposed
   one to be &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; (specifically as opposed to voting)

Am I understanding it correctly?

&gt;<i> Hi Bentley, (Happy New Year!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Blinap design includes solutions to problems that only arise at the
</I>&gt;<i> scale of large populations. We (the 200 or so on the Metagovernment mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list) don't need those features yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Our immediate mission (should we choose to accept it -- cue Mission
</I>&gt;<i> Impossible music) is to establish &quot;proof of concept&quot; at the &quot;Dunbar's
</I>&gt;<i> Number Community&quot; scale for the feasibility and &quot;betterness&quot; of using the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The tools that we use to accomplish that mission (at the community scale)
</I>&gt;<i> will then subsequently become fully integrated parts of the Blinap system
</I>&gt;<i> (that can function at the scale of the global population).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we were to take SettleIt, and various pieces of the AG_MFT project
</I>&gt;<i> (except the voting parts of course), and the ideas of Rawls and Habermas
</I>&gt;<i> (et. al.) concerning public reason, and put them all in a pot and stir them
</I>&gt;<i> together, we might find ourselves with the beginnings of a really good
</I>&gt;<i> start toward accomplishing the mission. (I have left out some other
</I>&gt;<i> important ingredients, only because I don't know enough about them.) Lots
</I>&gt;<i> of us in the group are already working on projects that can contribute to
</I>&gt;<i> accomplishing the mission.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In one sense, it doesn't really matter what specific issues we decide,
</I>&gt;<i> because the proof of our pudding is in the deciding. But, there are lots of
</I>&gt;<i> things we need to decide in order to accomplish the mission, so the mission
</I>&gt;<i> itself can provide us with grist for our decision-process mill. (Starting
</I>&gt;<i> with: what specific decision rule shall we use? How will we know when we
</I>&gt;<i> are done, in actual practice? Even more specifically, can you think of a
</I>&gt;<i> no-vote decision rule that you could easily incorporate into SettleIt, just
</I>&gt;<i> to get things started?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as reverting to voting: if someone proposes that we revert to
</I>&gt;<i> voting, I will be very interested to study the reasoning for doing that. Up
</I>&gt;<i> to this point, no one on the list (correct me if I am wrong) has offered a
</I>&gt;<i> reasoned defense of vote-counting against the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> alternative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as discussion slowing down the effort: collaboration and synthesis
</I>&gt;<i> happen THROUGH discussion; voting TRUNCATES discussion, collaboration, and
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis. Our work is to figure out better ways to keep our discussions
</I>&gt;<i> productive, not figure out better ways to cut off discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I could say a lot more in response, but Ed is watching ... :^)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for starting this thread. Do we have a process for &quot;no unresolved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objections&quot; that has been tried before or are you suggesting that we try a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new process to start (Blinap?). If the latter, would you agree to a process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to revert to voting if the new process requires improvement that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significantly slows down the group. I personally would prefer to have a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new system then we will never get to a new system. Who else than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Metagovernment would be willing to be the proving ground for a new process.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi Ed and All
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In making public decisions, we need a decision rule. Abstractly,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     two choices are here now on the table: count votes, or deliberate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to the point of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The choice to count votes to decide has been around for thousands
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     years have generally found that it does not work very well:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     which is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Now that we have computers and global electronic communications,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     another decision rule option is on the table (even at the scale of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     large populations). The option is to keep proposing and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     counter-proposing until the point is reached that, among all those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     participating (which includes all those who wish to participate),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     there are no unresolved objections to implementing the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That marks the point at which the decision has been made to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     implement the proposal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Which sort of decision rule shall we adopt?
