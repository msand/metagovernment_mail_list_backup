<PRE>Hi Ned,

Before I try to answer to your emails, I need to make sure that I understand 
your aims.

Assuming a new system for decision-making that enables grassroot democracy, 
is it right that you
    - prefer (NUO) over (CV)?
    - don't want to see (CV) supported anymore?

Cheers
marc

Hi Marc, (again -- this is a second response to same email in the
DECISION RULE thread:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-January/006090.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2014-January/006090.html</A>
)

For Reference:

    * (CV) = the abstract &quot;Count Votes&quot; decision rule
    * (NUO) = the abstract &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; decision rule

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; Because both rules [(CV) and (NUO)] not only typify different
    paradigms for decision-making, but they focus on entirely different
    aspects of the democratic process also! Hence in the end they are
    not comparable to each other. Thus no decision possible. (This
    reminds me of the Mission Impossible tune - really no clue why! ;o)

    Ned&gt; Again, I am not quite following you. The claim that the two
    abstract rules &quot;focus on entirely different aspects of the
    democratic process&quot; is true in the AG_MFT model because the model
    declares it to be true. But in other equally democratic models (such
    as the Blinap model), the claim is not true, because those other
    models declare it to not be true.

    Marc&gt; IMHO the different aspects are not only different in the
    context of the AG-MFT model. I think they are universal different in
    general.

Ned&gt; In that case, you have quite a challenge ahead of you to try to map
the parts and practices of the Isonomea/Blinap model into these
universally different aspects. I look forward to seeing how you do it.
(I stand ready to help in any way I can.)

The Blinap Decision System:
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/images/yEd/Decide.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/images/yEd/Decide.html</A>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Marc&gt; It is the scalability of the decision rule that makes it act
    as a different aspect on the democratic process, which might be
    encountered by the emergence of the decision rule and the
    decision-making process itself.

Ned&gt; I suspect that this is a key sentence, which causes me to regret
that I don't understand what you are saying. When you say &quot;the decision
rule&quot;, are we talking about both (CV) and (NUO)? When you say
&quot;encountered&quot; ... &quot;emergence&quot; ... (I'm lost).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Ned&gt; The AG_MFT model separates the democratic process into:

        * opinion forming
        * position forming
        * decision making
        * (and now &quot;coordination system&quot;)

        The Isonomea/Blinap model contains no such separation of the
        democratic process into three parts corresponding to these three
        aspects. More particularly, there is no distinction between
        &quot;position forming&quot; (discussion system) and &quot;decision-making&quot;
        (resolution system).

    Marc&gt; Just for clarification: The AG-MFT model just states that
    there are different aspects of the decision-making process that a
    system *could* focus on in general. In an ideal world those
    different aspects might be represented by different and seperate
    systems that interact with each other. But in reality each existing
    theory or system will be part of at least one of those aspects.

        Unfortunately I don't know much about Blinap in this regard, so
        I can't say which aspects of the AG-MFT model it really covers.
        But IMHO the seperation just exists; independently from any
        existing theory or system.

Ned&gt; It may be that seeing discussion and resolution as separate aspects
(and having separate systems for discussion and resolution) has seemed
inevitable because there has not up to this point ever been a (NUO)
system such as Blinap that could successfully operate at the global scale.

Now that such (NUO) systems are possible, use of (CV) must be justified
(if it can be) for other reasons than just because it is &quot;the only game
in town&quot; for decision-making at the scale of large populations.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The argument that you need to make is that the AG_MFT model of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democratic process is &quot;better&quot; than other models such as Blinap, not that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the democratic process can only be what the AG_MFT model declares it to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting point! The AG-MFT does not try to define a *better* model - 
</I>&gt;<i> quite the contrary we try to define a *common* model. Another ambitious 
</I>&gt;<i> aim of ours is to enable cooperation between all those competing systems 
</I>&gt;<i> and theories around.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Marc&gt; From my point of view there are two serious differences; a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     qualitative and a quantitative one:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * (1) While (NUO) focuses on equity, (CV) strives for majority.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * (2) While (NUO) solely suits well for small groups, (CV) can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           also handle large scale effectively.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I think I may agree that &quot;(NUO) focuses on equity&quot;, but I would need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to know more about what you mean by &quot;equity&quot; to know for sure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bingo! IMHO this is one of the elementary questions! What is &quot;equity&quot;? To 
</I>&gt;<i> be honest; I can't tell you! But, I believe that we all together as a 
</I>&gt;<i> society need to define what we would like the answer should be...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... for me this includes ethical and morally guidelines of how to reach a 
</I>&gt;<i> *wise decision* that respects (nearly) all facets of the domain where the 
</I>&gt;<i> decision is to be made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would agree that (CV) does strive for some measure of vote-count
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> popularity, but &quot;majority&quot; is only such measure among many.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But at the end any &quot;vote-count popularity&quot; is a kind of measurement, isn't 
</I>&gt;<i> it? That's my point here:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Thesis I: CV is about quantity.
</I>&gt;<i>    Thesis II: NUO is about quality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree that (NUO) can suit well for small groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great! We have consensus ;o)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Thesis III: NUO can suit well for small groups (due to Thesis II).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I *STRONGLY* dispute that (CV) can successfully scale to large
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> populations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Great also! Here we have dissent ;o)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I keep posting this quote only because no one has so far even tried to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counter it. We really need to &quot;grok in fullness&quot; that &quot;count votes&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> systems have been around for thousands of years, and have *NEVER* shown
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves to be sustainable at the scale of large populations -- for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons that are intrinsic to voting, irrespective of the technical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> particulars of the vote-count system.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO for now just the following fact seems to be relevant:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Thesis IV: CV might scale better on large groups than NUO do (due to 
</I>&gt;<i> Thesis I).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Marc&gt; This leads me to the assumption that we should implement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     *both* rules and choose which one to use depending on the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     context of a decision to be made on demand.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ned&gt; I totally agree with you that we need to run the experiments,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> preferably in parallel (resources permitting).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, you appear to be asserting that you already know which particular
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision rule will work best in which sort of context. I don't think that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you do. Show me the data. (I state this provocatively to emphasize that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really think that WE NEED TO RUN THE EXPERIMENTS in order to have ACTUAL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> EMPIRICAL SUPPORT for any claims regarding which particular decision 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rules
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will work best in various particular contexts.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I don't know! And I guess nobody does! This is why the AG-MFT has 
</I>&gt;<i> started last year to prototype several different systems as proof of 
</I>&gt;<i> concept implementations. We don't know if our model holds or not. So we 
</I>&gt;<i> need to eat the pudding!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Will Rogers&gt; It isn't what we don't know that gives us trouble, it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     what we know that ain't so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and even more enlightening: as soon as man thinks, he is wrong already!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To cut a long story short: IMHO it is all about quality and quantity where 
</I>&gt;<i> NUO is towards quality while CV is towards quantity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But to get to a certain level of quality using NUO will take its time. 
</I>&gt;<i> Hence I think the following might be true:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Thesis V: CV seems to increase the speed of decision-making.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO given these five theses we can start our experiments...
