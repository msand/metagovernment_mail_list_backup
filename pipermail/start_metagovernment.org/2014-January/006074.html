<PRE>People,

In making a decision I see no need for universal buy-in.  I can as  a
minority of one and with an effective power of disruption of the proposed
project decide the project is a bad bad idea but still decide to let the
project go ahead.  This does not mean I support the project.  It also does
not necessary imply I am being coerced.

Ideally I have been transparent about my misgivings and these have been
heard and mitigations have been put in place and there will be post-project
evaluations  and so on.

Authoritarion types are just fine in lot of situations.  Psychopaths are
just fine in a lot of situations.  Sociopaths are a problem pretty much all
the time.

The real issue is the safety to effectively disagree.  With a full pure
consensus model, it may not be safe to disagree too much or too
effectively.  This is true in all real decision models.

The other item to be added is when to declare a project, whether proposed
or actual, as having a  serious inadequate risk mitigation that seems
unsolveable.  And then, how might we back away from this.  This may be the
biggest problem faced in our current world.

The effectiveness of my idealism needs a bit of improvement.

Blessings,

Max
