<PRE>Hi Bentley, (Happy New Year!)

The Blinap design includes solutions to problems that only arise at the 
scale of large populations. We (the 200 or so on the Metagovernment 
mailing list) don't need those features yet.

Our immediate mission (should we choose to accept it -- cue Mission 
Impossible music) is to establish &quot;proof of concept&quot; at the &quot;Dunbar's 
Number Community&quot; scale for the feasibility and &quot;betterness&quot; of using 
the &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; decision rule.

The tools that we use to accomplish that mission (at the community 
scale) will then subsequently become fully integrated parts of the 
Blinap system (that can function at the scale of the global population).

If we were to take SettleIt, and various pieces of the AG_MFT project 
(except the voting parts of course), and the ideas of Rawls and Habermas 
(et. al.) concerning public reason, and put them all in a pot and stir 
them together, we might find ourselves with the beginnings of a really 
good start toward accomplishing the mission. (I have left out some other 
important ingredients, only because I don't know enough about them.) 
Lots of us in the group are already working on projects that can 
contribute to accomplishing the mission.

In one sense, it doesn't really matter what specific issues we decide, 
because the proof of our pudding is in the deciding. But, there are lots 
of things we need to decide in order to accomplish the mission, so the 
mission itself can provide us with grist for our decision-process mill. 
(Starting with: what specific decision rule shall we use? How will we 
know when we are done, in actual practice? Even more specifically, can 
you think of a no-vote decision rule that you could easily incorporate 
into SettleIt, just to get things started?)

As far as reverting to voting: if someone proposes that we revert to 
voting, I will be very interested to study the reasoning for doing that. 
Up to this point, no one on the list (correct me if I am wrong) has 
offered a reasoned defense of vote-counting against the &quot;no unresolved 
objections&quot; alternative.

As far as discussion slowing down the effort: collaboration and 
synthesis happen THROUGH discussion; voting TRUNCATES discussion, 
collaboration, and synthesis. Our work is to figure out better ways to 
keep our discussions productive, not figure out better ways to cut off 
discussion.

(I could say a lot more in response, but Ed is watching ... :^)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Ed and All
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In making public decisions, we need a decision rule. Abstractly,
</I>&gt;<i>     two choices are here now on the table: count votes, or deliberate
</I>&gt;<i>     to the point of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The choice to count votes to decide has been around for thousands
</I>&gt;<i>     of years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of those
</I>&gt;<i>     years have generally found that it does not work very well:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
</I>&gt;<i>        nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
</I>&gt;<i>        democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
</I>&gt;<i>        discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
</I>&gt;<i>        treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
</I>&gt;<i>        candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
</I>&gt;<i>        most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
</I>&gt;<i>        democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy,
</I>&gt;<i>     which is
</I>&gt;<i>        always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
</I>&gt;<i>        greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been
</I>&gt;<i>     about
</I>&gt;<i>        200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Now that we have computers and global electronic communications,
</I>&gt;<i>     another decision rule option is on the table (even at the scale of
</I>&gt;<i>     large populations). The option is to keep proposing and
</I>&gt;<i>     counter-proposing until the point is reached that, among all those
</I>&gt;<i>     participating (which includes all those who wish to participate),
</I>&gt;<i>     there are no unresolved objections to implementing the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>     That marks the point at which the decision has been made to
</I>&gt;<i>     implement the proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Which sort of decision rule shall we adopt?
</I>&gt;<i>
