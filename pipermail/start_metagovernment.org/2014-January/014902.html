<PRE>Not sure I will be helpful here, but I think Ned is really trying to figure
out how to not solve problems through voting and hierarchical structures.
And that his main problem is with issues related to tyranny of the
majority.

If that is so Ned, than I think we are in need of a certain level of
compromise. I believe your phylosophical and political points are
essentially right. But if you are imposing a no-vote system onto the world,
how does that make you different from those in power now? It would be a
contradiction.

I believe you are very well aware of the drawbacks of consensus decion
making, especially the rigid one you are proposing (meaning &quot;No Unresolved
Objections&quot; from EVERYONE), including consensus blocking, systemic bias and
uniformity induction, fear of one speaking one's mind, lack of creativity
(to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage to propose new stuff,
framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the
possibility of compromise or other mutually beneficial solutions, and so
on...

If you are well aware of these drawbacks and still thinks it to be a great
decision-making process then, although I think you are setting the bar way
too high, a demonstration of your system proposal in the framework of large
groups would be an exceptional exercise to learn from.

However, if we go back to your original post &quot;In making public decisions,
we need a decision rule. Abstractly, two choices are here now on the table:
count votes, or deliberate to the point of &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;.&quot;, I
really think you are missing a lot of alterntives there with your
dichotomic alternatives.

For instance, you jury example reminded me a lot of the sociocratic
decision-making process. From personal experience, I can tell this
decision-making process works marvellously within small groups (or within
the whole framework of sociocracy for large groups). It works only for
small groups because the extensive discussion needed to have empathy for
one's arguments, be patient and creative to find solutions which work for
everyone, and come up with real consent which everyone is really happy with
(and not just faking to fit onto uniformity) can only happen in relatively
small groups. And it works for large groups in the framework of sociocracy
because the system breaks up the big social organization into a hierarchy
of semi-autonomous social circles. The dowside, of course, is that it is a
kind of hierarchical representative system (although a much much better one
than what we have in representative democratic national governments).

Again from personal experience, there are very extensive empirical evidence
that within large groups of people not only irrational people will come up
with consensus blocking, but also that the group will have a broad enough
spectrum of cultural paradigms that will be the basis for blocking a lot of
proposals. And that is not to be thought of as a problem, but rather as a
natural (and positive) aspect of humam life. Having different people around
is supposed to be a good thing, not a bad one. But sometimes there
decisions to be made and consensus blocking in plainly awful for the group
as whole, making most people very emotional (and somewhat irrational...)
along the way, essentually turning consensus decision-making into a
terrible system.


Thus, I think your proposal of decision-making process may be very good or
very bad depending on the circumstances.

If you agree to these, than we may understand that there is no such thing
as the ideal and consensus decision making process, even in a relatively
coherent group as Metagovernment. My feeling is there never will be, in
Metagovernment or in any other relatively large group of people. And if you
develop a governence system with this rigid decision-making process the
probability is high that it will be unhelpful. Also, we should bear in mind
that the an ideal governance system (or any system for that matter) is not
solely dependable on the decision making process.


Therefore, to me, if I were to choose from a set of governence softwares I
would choose the one with the broader set of options for decision making.
One where my social group would be free to detemine for themselves the best
way to be governed with. I can easily see that a software which imposes a
certain decision-making process will turn people away from it at some point
in time because, depending on the circumstances, the group may decide to
have some aspects of its governance (or some moments) where a different
system of decision-making may be in order.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As far as discussion slowing down the effort: collaboration and

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, Ned. I think you may be making voting out to be more black-and-white
</I>&gt;<i> than it needs to be. I agree that voting as it is usually done is horrible
</I>&gt;<i> for dialog and deliberation. But the more advanced voting systems have the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of continuous voting. More appropriately, it probably should be
</I>&gt;<i> called continual voting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I speak of Votorola, because it's the one I'm most familiar with in this
</I>&gt;<i> regard. In Votorola, anyone who wants to participate on a particular issue
</I>&gt;<i> can make their own proposal, vote for another proposal, or delegate their
</I>&gt;<i> vote to another person who can do either of those first two options. And
</I>&gt;<i> very importantly: at any time, anyone can shift their decision: proposing
</I>&gt;<i> something new, voting for a different proposal, delegating or withdrawing
</I>&gt;<i> delegation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Votorola doesn't contain internal logic as to when a decision is
</I>&gt;<i> reached. But what it does do is facilitate consensus-building specifically
</I>&gt;<i> because of voting. The voting/delegation apparatus allows people to judge
</I>&gt;<i> if a proposal is being supported. Further, it actively encourages people to
</I>&gt;<i> engage in consensus-building dialog. If I see that you're not voting for
</I>&gt;<i> me, I can ask what your objection is, and I can then try to modify my
</I>&gt;<i> proposal to resolve your objection. In other words, the voting system
</I>&gt;<i> places a formal layer on top of the no unresolved objections decision rule,
</I>&gt;<i> and makes it very easy to navigate through that rule.*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; However, I will also note that I do have an objection to the severity of
</I>&gt;<i> no unresolved objections. I think I have stated it before, and Bentley
</I>&gt;<i> brings it up in his last post. There are irrational people. In fact, there
</I>&gt;<i> are a lot of psychopaths out there:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Epidemiology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Epidemiology</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So a rule such as yours seems to invite paralysis. Additionally, there
</I>&gt;<i> are authoritarians out there: people who do not want democracy. I have no
</I>&gt;<i> objection to their being invited into our fold, but I don't want one person
</I>&gt;<i> to be able to paralyze our group entirely.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Am I misunderstanding your decision rule? Is it nuanced enough that it
</I>&gt;<i> can deal with those sorts of problems? In earlier discussions, we had come
</I>&gt;<i> up with somewhere between 80% and 90% support (in large populations) as an
</I>&gt;<i> initial test cutoff to start with as a definition for consensus. Is that
</I>&gt;<i> unreasonable?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; *Michael hasn't been on the list recently; so I'm going to ping him
</I>&gt;<i> off-list to make sure he sees this. I can't promise I'm characterizing
