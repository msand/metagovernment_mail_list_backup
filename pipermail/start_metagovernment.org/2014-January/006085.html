<PRE>Hi Alex,

    Alex&gt; i dont believe &quot;counting votes&quot; vs. &quot;no unresolved objections&quot;
    is an either-or-question.

    i feel they converge if you bring in the dimension of time and
    repeated voting.
    =&gt; voting creates a snapshot of the current &quot;status quo&quot;.

    if you use &quot;permanent voting&quot;, that means you can vote for something
    or withdraw your vote at anytime and switch it to something else,
    then voting is &quot;always on&quot; and between switching your vote from one
    thing to another, there is discussion and resolving &quot;unresolved
    objections&quot;

    ... so if you think about time and continuous permanent voting, then
    i dont see the difference between those, more that they complement
    each other

Ned&gt; What appears to be missing in what you are saying is the occurrence 
of actually making a decision.

At the point that the decision regarding the proposal (or whatever) is 
actually made, that ends the decision process for that matter. There is 
no permanent anything beyond that point for that proposal.

(After the decision has been made, the matter would be reopened by 
making a brand new proposal, that would then go through its own decision 
process and be decided.)

If we specifically focus on decision making, then the decision rule that 
will be used really is an either/or question. There is no convergence, 
no matter how long the actual making of the decision is delayed.

(The decision outcomes may or may not converge that two different 
decision rules might produce, but any particular decision itself will be 
made using a specific decision rule.)

Continual voting does create a &quot;video&quot; of the status quo (successive 
&quot;snapshots&quot;), but it does not produce a decision so long as the voting 
process remains open.

If a for-profit company were to leave matters open forever 
(continual/permanent voting), thus never actually making any decisions, 
the for-profit company would fail, as would any democratic polity that 
never actually made any decisions.

Eventually the decision must be made, and that will involve selecting a 
specific decision rule. Yes?
