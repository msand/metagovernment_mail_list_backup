<PRE>Trying to connect the two here, I think extensive discussion must always
occur in any proposal to ensure every objection has been heard and
discussed, we should strive to find &quot;no unresolved issues&quot; but I don't
think it will occur very often, there's bound to be uncertainty in things
that have yet to be implemented, this is why I think voting is still
important. After a period of discussion and tweaking there will be resolved
and unresolved issues, all should be present in the final proposal and
presented in the most simple manner possible to be able to brief anyone
reading for the first time what the issues are, I then think voting still
needs to occur for the simple validation of the proposal. There might in
fact be nothing inherently wrong with the proposal but people still might
not find it necessary or important enough to implement. For example someone
proposing all the bricks in the city be painted orange, though there's
nothing fundamental wrong with this idea, no one could have a valid issue
with it, it is still a pointless proposal and should be voted down.
I hope I'm grasping the basis of this debate and have provided some proper
insight, much love.

&gt;<i> Hi Bentley, (Great Questions!)

</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Bentley&gt; I think a clarification of &quot;UnResolved&quot; would be helpful.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Yes! So I will try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reaching decisions through &quot;no unresolved objections&quot; has been around as
</I>&gt;<i> an ordinary part of everyday life since the dawn of the human experience on
</I>&gt;<i> earth. It is not Rocket Science (except when rocket scientists are
</I>&gt;<i> conversing).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When a jury of 12 convenes for the first time after closing arguments,
</I>&gt;<i> they will typically start with a show of hands: &quot;Everybody who thinks that
</I>&gt;<i> Mortimer is guilty, raise hands.&quot; The show of hands is not a vote that
</I>&gt;<i> decides, but a poll that shows where to begin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If ten raise hands and two do not, the group will then turn to the first
</I>&gt;<i> of the two and ask: &quot;Adeline, why do you not think that Mortimer is
</I>&gt;<i> guilty?&quot; Adeline will then respond with her reasons: &quot;I think that The
</I>&gt;<i> Butler Did It, because he has such strong hands, and because, well, he's
</I>&gt;<i> the butler.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mary may then say: &quot;But Adeline, there is traffic cam footage showing that
</I>&gt;<i> the butler was in Tampa when things went down.&quot; If Adeline's response to
</I>&gt;<i> this is &quot;Hmmph!&quot;, this response from Adeline acknowledges to the group that
</I>&gt;<i> she understands and accepts that her objection to the guilt of Mortimer on
</I>&gt;<i> the basis that the butler has strong hands and is the butler has been
</I>&gt;<i> successfully resolved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Resolving objections is all about getting to &quot;Hmmph!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Bentley&gt; SettleIt.org could consider an objections resolved if there
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    is a higher weight of pros for the decision. I'm not sure if that
</I>&gt;<i>    would be the same as your proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; You are correct that it is not the same. In the system of my
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, each particular objection remains unresolved so long as there has
</I>&gt;<i> been no successful objection to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general, if a proposal has even one objection to it that has NOT been
</I>&gt;<i> (knocked-down = resolved), then the proposal HAS BEEN (knocked-down =
</I>&gt;<i> resolved).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (We may find that in practice there are exceptions to this, and we may
</I>&gt;<i> find that we need a richer ontology than resolved/unresolved. Also, there
</I>&gt;<i> may be cases where &quot;partially resolved&quot; ratings are useful. But such
</I>&gt;<i> ratings will need some serious rationalization and validation -- they will
</I>&gt;<i> not be simple counts of how many objections there are.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Bentley&gt; Can you provide a one sentence description of what criteria
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    must exist for an objection to be resolved?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Philosophers such as Habermas and Rawls have spent their entire lives
</I>&gt;<i> trying to come up with criteria that we might all agree to, that could form
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient basis for resolving objections to allow us to live peacefully
</I>&gt;<i> and productively together on the planet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Procedurally, if (A) proposes and then (B) objects, the objection must be
</I>&gt;<i> based on considerations that have previously been successfully proposed as
</I>&gt;<i> valid bases for objection (the Golden Rule or whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To resolve (B)'s objection, someone must then object to (B)'s objection,
</I>&gt;<i> with the second objection again based on considerations that have
</I>&gt;<i> previously been successfully proposed as valid bases for objection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Darn! That was three sentences!)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Bentley&gt; Does every participant need to agree that an objection is
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    resolved or is there a process to make sure a suggestion was
</I>&gt;<i>    considered and accommodated as well as possible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Because the decision process is multi-threaded (multiple simultaneous
</I>&gt;<i> objections) and recursive (objections to objections to objections), it is
</I>&gt;<i> really confusing to think about the process as being &quot;straight and flat&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Voting systems are typically &quot;straight and flat&quot; -- one proposal, one
</I>&gt;<i> decision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (SettleIt, on the other hand, is multi-threaded and recursive. But the
</I>&gt;<i> scoring algorithm does not give each particular element an up/down status
</I>&gt;<i> based on the up/down statuses of the individual elements in the recursive
</I>&gt;<i> level below it -- did I get that right?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Bentley&gt; Could a single irrational person block a decision without
</I>&gt;<i>    reason or consequence?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; The single irrational person would need to come up with a valid
</I>&gt;<i> objection -- an objection based on considerations that had previously been
</I>&gt;<i> successfully proposed as valid bases for objection.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To answer the question more directly, the person would need not just a
</I>&gt;<i> reason, but a valid reason.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the jury example above, Adeline actually has a full veto. Even after
</I>&gt;<i> she has said &quot;Hmmph!&quot;, she can still hold to her position that Mortimer is
</I>&gt;<i> not guilty, and the jury will be &quot;hung&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the system we are setting up, if &quot;Hmmph!&quot; were advanced as the basis
</I>&gt;<i> for an objection, someone would object that &quot;Hmmph!&quot; had not been
</I>&gt;<i> previously successfully proposed as a valid basis for objections, and the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Hmmph!&quot; objection would thereby be (knocked down = resolved).
</I>&gt;<i>
