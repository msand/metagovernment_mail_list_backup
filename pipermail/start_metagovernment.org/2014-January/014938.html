<PRE>There is a saying you should not go to bed with someone crazier than
yourself.  As best i see the functional goal is gen creative ideas but
never implement and deploy in a way that i would view as trustworthy.
People need to think of motivations, means, ends, and mitigations.  But if
I do do something interesting, I might let you know.

And since people here are often very concrete, I suggest most of what
people here want seems to imply a secure Internet and that is a tougher
goal than peace on earth.

&gt;<i> My question is prompted both by Bentley's post, and my earlier reply

</I>&gt;<i> our own purposes, which are largely independent of others' purposes.
</I>&gt;<i> So we use Metagov instrumentally, as we might use any mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would it take for you to participate in Metagov even if it did

</I>&gt;<i> rather for the sake of the group?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The answers would give us a sense of the potential purpose of Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i> and its potential membership.  We might then turn that potential into

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Answer) I will participate if Metagov takes deliberate aim and pushes
