<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Sorry to jump in here but the last few weeks of browsing through the
discussions has inspired me to add my observations and wishes for this
group moving forward.

Firstly, we should try to remember, and stay mindful of how complicated our
message might be to others. We should try not to be overly fancy with our
words as it distracts from the actual message, if our goal is to reach
people, our message needs to be clear. A number of times I've been reading
and gotten sidetracked by some complex wording or a confusing anagram, the
simpler we make our questions and answers the more people will be able to
understand and participate. Having a link as an answer is not always the
best, try summarizing the part of the link you're getting your answer from.

Secondly, I'd really like to see us collaborate more. I understand we're
all experimenting in different areas of this idea, which granted has its
positives, but I think it's important where ever possible to come to
agreements. Like the charter that ED was proposing, the more things we can
collectively structure, the easier it will be come up with a real plan of
action for the future. I think everyone has some unique insights on how
exactly this idea should work, there are fundamental discussions that need
to occur but the more we can agree on the more successful we'll be at
actually establishing goals to move the project forward.

Thirdly, the mechanism for which we're communicating, as I'm sure everyone
notices, is clunky and unorganized, to try to make sense of the past few
weeks of discussions and trace the line conversation is very difficult in
places. This is kind of embarrassing for a group that wants more
communication and collective action in the decision making process of
governments, the system we're using ourselves is nothing impressive. I know
that this e-mail format is a neutral place for us but I feel we should be
able to do better. It is for this reason that I humbly offer my website for
our method of communication, it is much more capable then the chain mail
we're using, it is able to organize and prioritize discussions properly for
easy referencing for anyone trying to catch up on 3 weeks on conversation.
Perhaps there is a reason we are doing it that way, and if that's case
please let me know why. As far as I can see though we'd be much better off
on a site that can provide a foundation to properly display our debates.
www.theinternetswebsite.com

Also a small side note, the main discussion the past few weeks has been
about this &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; I applaud those tackling this debate
but it seems to me that it is an unrealistic goal. There will most likely
always be objections if posed to a large enough group, I think it's unfair
to say that any individual is wrong in their objection if they believe it
to be legitimate. This naturally leads to someone or something coming along
and overruling the objection and moving forward with the proposal, which,
as has been suggested, is giving power to some higher entity and against
what I think we stand for. It seems to me that the only fair way to address
these objections is to poll the people to determine if the objection holds
any weight and should stall the advancement of the proposal. We should
always strive for &quot;No Unresolved Objections&quot; and of course alter and
incorporate the proposal to address as many objections as possible but the
belief that something will ever be 100% agreed upon is too wishful. Again
I'll shamelessly plug my website for attempting to deal with this problem,
every comment on my site is able to be &quot;propped up&quot; so everyone can see
where an objection has favor-ability and should be explored more. That's
all for now, love to hear any responses. Much love.
