I like the term &quot;communicative action&quot; much better than &quot;rational discourse&quot;. Rational discourse sounds like something a bunch of old-white-male-philoshphy professors do for fun on a Friday night while sipping Sherry and smoking cigars.  Communicative action sounds grassroots....like one might even find blue collar men, single moms, and people of color engaging in it.  I say lets continue to engage in &quot;communicative action&quot;.  :-)  

Questions:

With &quot;communicative action&quot;....at all scales....are we talking when EVERYONE agrees....or some other measure?

Can you imagine there could be &quot;communicative action&quot; and &quot;voting&quot; in the same process of awarding funding for projects?

Can you imagine the degree/amount of communicative action and the percentage of people involved in the process of developing a goal could be one of the *criteria* for deciding whether the project gets funding or not?



&gt;<i> Hi Stephen,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Rational discourse is an everyday thing. You and I, in this email exchange, are engaging in rational discourse. We are trying together to understand and agree upon which method of decision making would work best for us-the-network. In the end, we may reach that understanding and agreement. Or, we may reach a point where we see that further discourse (at least for now) will not take us toward understanding and agreement. At that point, we would table the discourse, always with the possibility of resuming it at a later time, as new insights and understandings and articulations occur to us as we go through life.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The philosopher J&#252;rgen Habermas is the big name in arguing that democracy and &quot;communicative action&quot; are a good match:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   In strategic action, actors are not so much interested in mutual
</I>&gt;<i>   understanding as in achieving the individual goals they each bring
</I>&gt;<i>   to the situation. Actor /A/, for example, will thus appeal to /B/'s
</I>&gt;<i>   desires and fears so as to motivate the behavior on /B/'s part that
</I>&gt;<i>   is required for /A/'s success. As reasons motivating /B/'s
</I>&gt;<i>   cooperation, /B/'s desires and fears are only contingently related
</I>&gt;<i>   to /A/'s goals. /B/ cooperates with /A/, in other words, not because
</I>&gt;<i>   /B/ finds /A/'s project inherently interesting or worthy, but
</I>&gt;<i>   because of what /B/ gets out of the bargain: avoiding some threat
</I>&gt;<i>   that /A/ can make or obtaining something /A/ has promised (which may
</I>&gt;<i>   be of inherent interest to /B/ but for /A/ is only a means of
</I>&gt;<i>   motivating /B/).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   In communicative action, or what Habermas later came to call &#8220;strong
</I>&gt;<i>   communicative action&#8221; in &#8220;Some Further Clarifications of the Concept
</I>&gt;<i>   of Communicative Rationality&#8221; (1998b, chap. 7; German ed., 1999b),
</I>&gt;<i>   speakers coordinate their action and pursuit of individual (or
</I>&gt;<i>   joint) goals on the basis of a shared understanding that the goals
</I>&gt;<i>   are inherently reasonable or merit-worthy. Whereas strategic action
</I>&gt;<i>   succeeds insofar as the actors achieve their individual goals,
</I>&gt;<i>   communicative action succeeds insofar as the actors freely agree
</I>&gt;<i>   that their goal (or goals) is reasonable, that it merits cooperative
</I>&gt;<i>   behavior. Communicative action is thus an inherently consensual form
</I>&gt;<i>   of social coordination in which actors &#8220;mobilize the potential for
</I>&gt;<i>   rationality&#8221; given with ordinary language and its telos of
</I>&gt;<i>   rationally motivated agreement. -- Stanford Encyclopedia of
</I>&gt;<i>   Philosophy: Habermas &lt;<A HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For those who agree that democracy and communicative action are a good match, choosing between voting and rational discourse as the better decision method becomes a question of deciding (or, preferably, observing) which of the two methods more reliably manifests communicative action.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  I think I am the one who doesn't understand. It seems you may be pointing at something more specific in using the term &quot;rational discourse&quot; as a method of decision making?
