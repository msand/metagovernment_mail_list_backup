I've been looking into Blinap and like a lot of what I see. I appreciate your invitation to work together. Let's continue the conversation.....

&gt;<i> In the Blinap design as it currently exists, the key components that attempt to address the &quot;too many proposals&quot; problem are the proposal profile together with the proposal magnet.

Ok...very cool. It could be like a &quot;proposal genome&quot;. If somebody wants to know what proposals there are regarding any particular field, subject, location, entity, phenomenon...or whatever, they could just do a search for all proposals tagged and categorized in that particular way. I may be simplifying this, but it seems to me you're explaining technically how proposals could potentially be highly organized and easy to find.

&gt;<i> In addition, in order for the notification sub-system to be reliable, professional profiling (by the proposer and by the appraisers, with the results compared) is a must.
</I>
Ok....this makes good sense to me so far. Can I ask....where the appraisers come from?  And what is their actual job description?  Do they receive remuneration for their time doing this?   Are they trained and certified?

&gt;<i> Blinap is a decision making system, that can be tightly integrated with any other systems that we wish. I am open to being shown that it would be constructive to formally, programmatically associate it with one or more social network platforms, but at this point it appears to me that there would be no benefits to doing so. The functionality of Blinap would not be enhanced, nor would the functionality of the associated social network platforms be enhanced.
</I>
Let's not call it a social network then. Let's just say it's a platform to gather and assist people who are interested in collaborating with others in creating a better world by offering proposals of their own and supporting others' proposals through communicative action. Persons, and groups can have a webpage where they track their proposals, projects, and other network interests, etc.....and on which others can track theirs. The homepage assists anyone in linking to, and searching around, the network, foundation, and database for whatever they like. 

&gt;<i> My view (or at least one of my views) is that social network platforms are in a sense intrinsically the wrong tool to support the *kind* of organized activity needed to begin healing society and the planet. The kind of regimented organizing that can happen through social networking platforms (get out the vote, get out the protesters, collect the petition signatures, etc.) is reactive and negative, rather active and positive.
</I>
Some people might want to organize a silent protest, commit civil disobedience, boycott polluters, or get everybody to stand on their head at midnight....and they would be free to propose any of those. In my mind, the network, in the process of organizing itself, would be the filter for ineffective communicative action.

 I just want to be able to get up in the morning and have a place to go online where I can see what's happening (in the network), generally, and in the more specific areas of interest to me. I want to be able to connect, and interact, with whomever (in the network) I want. I want to be able to collaborate on, and fund, the proposals/projects that resonate with me. And I want it to be simple and easy.

&gt;<i> The OWS and Arab Spring movements demonstrate this. Twitter and Facebook have indeed been used successfully to &quot;organize against&quot;. But fighting against will not, cannot, heal. The best that such fighting can accomplish is to effect a &quot;changing of the guard&quot; within existing power structures, and perhaps to win a few (temporary) policy concessions, that will be quietly reversed as soon as the social pressure wanes. &quot;Ganging up to go against&quot; is a costly Sisyphean Task.
</I>
I agree....the point I was making (or trying to) is this...a *network* is a great way to &quot;network&quot;. Collaboration can only happen if people are connected. A dedicated, centralized platform, open to all, would make it a lot easier (and more fun)....in my mind.

&gt;<i> Blinap empowers in an entirely different way -- not by facilitating ganging up to go against, but by enabling communicative action at the scale of populations, in the service of *creating* new and better systems and such. Collaborating to create can heal.
</I>
I would love to see a global scale population agree to boycott Monsanto. I would also like to see corporate charters revoked. If we are able to achieve the disempowerment of corporations.....they may be *feel* ganged-up on. I think we are touching on the subjective here. Perhaps we should talk about criteria for making proposals?
