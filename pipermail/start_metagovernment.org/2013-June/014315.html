We would need to put together a proposal and then present it to the Board of Directors.
Our co-op is fairly progressive and I can imagine the BOD would consider any reasonable proposal we put to them.
Particularly if it made their job easier (and perhaps more fun :-) ...and/or brought in an increased level of democracy to our co-op.
They meet the 2nd Wednesday of every other month. The next board meeting is on the 14th of August. 
I'm not sure how much lead time they would need in order to accept a new agenda item. If folks are interested in putting something together, I could find out.
