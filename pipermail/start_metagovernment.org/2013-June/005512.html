<PRE>Hi Stephen,

    (This post follows the post at:
    <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-June/005511.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2013-June/005511.html</A>
    )

    Stephen&gt; Develop a global internet *organization* that funds
    specific projects by rewarding the people/groups that create the
    most widely supported proposals.

    Ned&gt; I have a problem with &quot;widely supported&quot;. I think that we
    should instead go with &quot;deeply supported&quot;. Rather than using
    popularity as the basis for choosing which proposals to reward and
    which projects to fund, I think that we would be better off using
    rational discourse outcomes as the basis.

    Stephen&gt; I'm not clear on the difference between the two. I think
    ultimately we are talking numbers (votes)....other wise we get into
    having &quot;deciders&quot;. We have to trust the collective mind (or the
    common body) to guide itself toward the most favorable outcome.
    Rational discourse (mind) is useful....but so is the irrational
    (heart and gut). The network will govern itself if we set it up so
    it's free to do move with both.

Ned&gt; We will have deciders no matter how the decision gets made. And we 
are both agreed that with respect to every decision, the deciders will 
include *ANYONE* who wishes to participate in making the decision. 
(Yes?) The question is, *HOW* will the decision be made?

Ned&gt; Regarding how, two choices are now on the table. One of the choices 
is voting. The choice to use voting to decide has been around for 
thousands of years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of 
those years have generally found that it does not work very well:

    A democracy [powered by popular voting] is always temporary in
    nature; it simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. A
    democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters
    discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public
    treasury. From that moment on, the majority always vote for the
    candidates who [and directly for the initiatives that] promise the
    most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that every
    democracy will finally collapse due to loose fiscal policy, which is
    always followed by a dictatorship. The average age of the world's
    greatest civilizations from the beginning of history, has been about
    200 years. -- Alexander Tyler (1787)

Ned&gt; Now that we have computers and electronic communications, and 
Habermas, another option is on the table (even at the scale of 
populations). The option is to have everyone who wishes to participate 
in making the decision do so, through participating in rational 
discourse. When the point is reached that, among all those participating 
(which includes all those who wish to participate), there are no 
unresolved objections to implementing the proposal, that marks the point 
at which the decision has been made to implement the proposal.

Ned&gt; If at this point you are still unclear on the difference between 
the two methods of decision making, you are going to have to help me 
out: what is not clear?

Ned&gt; If you are now clear on the difference between the two methods of 
decision making, then the question becomes: which method do you think 
that we-the-network should use to make public decisions, and why?
