&gt;<i> Ned&gt; We will have deciders no matter how the decision gets made. And we are both agreed that with respect to every decision, the deciders will include *ANYONE* who wishes to participate in making the decision. (Yes?) The question is, *HOW* will the decision be made?
</I>
You're right....we will have &quot;deciders&quot;. At the beginning the &quot;deciders&quot; will be those who set the criteria for the initial cycle. It will need to begin somewhere. Following that, the entire network will be *the decider*. I think it's important to distinguish between singular and plural here....between many minds and one mind. It's a different mind &quot;set&quot; if you will...a way of tapping into a collective mind experience out of which arises a *synergic* empowerment heretofore unknown to us. Setting it up so that it can continually self-organize is key, in my mind.  It needs to be rigid enough to avoid the takeover of specific factions or vested interests...but supple enough to evolve as the network evolves. As to how decisions will be made....that is yet to be decided. ;-)  I'm really appreciating your engagement in this. Please read on....

&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Regarding how, two choices are now on the table. One of the choices is voting. The choice to use voting to decide has been around for thousands of years. Those who have studied its efficacy over all of those years have generally found that it does not work very well:
</I>
Consider the consumption of resources by humans and the effect it has on the environment.

When I purchase something I don't always consider it as a *vote* for the product or the manufacturer who makes it....but one could say my purchase has that effect. The outcome for me personally can go either way (good choice/bad choice) based on my subjective experience. The overall outcome for society, or the planet (or whatever) is more difficult to measure....particularly over longer periods of time. The deeper the cascade of effect, the more complex the outcome. We can set up parameters of observation for a given choice (or set of choices) for a certain length of time...and load that with the machinations of our rational mind in order to make more *informed* choices....but ultimately the *outcome* will never be fully known by us because it will continue to play out for a very long time. 

Take climate change for instance. We could say, given the data provided by the measurements of our rational mind, we'll see so many degrees of temperature increase within a given length of time. Then, in order to make use of that *objective* data we need to make *subjective* judgements about the outcome of the projected increase of temperature. One might say, if we don't change our consumption habits, life as we know it will be unbearable by the end of the century. In this though there's a value judgement that &quot;life as we know it&quot; is a *good* thing....worth maintaining. But given the cascade of effect, over eons of time, one has to acknowledge other possible outcomes....perhaps even...climate change *could be good*. For example, one could ask, &quot;did the extinction of the dinosaurs have a good or bad outcome?&quot;. It could be argued that it led to the current iteration of life on this planet....and that humans are more evolved than dinosaurs, therefore it was good. A very subjective piece of logic. And from that one could say the same for our current situation. Climate change....bad for the current iteration....could be good for the next. It will always come down to the subjective positioning of the rational mind. The ultimate outcome will never be known because it will always be *out-coming*.

The heart, mind, and gut are all connected. That's been *proven* by the observation of the rational mind. Yet some humans *knew* this previous to the rational inquiry of medical science. Rational inquiry and discourse are wonderful tools but have their inherent limitations.  Whatever the scale, it will always come down to subjective probabilities of imagined outcomes over fixed periods of time. I believe that at some point we need let go of the dominance of the rational mind and trust it's connection with the *heart and gut* to lead us down the most &quot;favorable&quot; path...because the heart and gut are the only organs capable of tapping into that unconscious realm where all things are known and connected. We need that information or in-fluence as well. If we set the stage with *rational* at the center...we are likely to end up either boring ourselves to death, or endlessly arguing about who's subjective perspective is the most *objective* or relevant. 

In my mind, it's not about the survival of our species....or any species for that matter. It's about caring for that which I love. Survival has a subjective value. Love is an energetic connecting in real time. I use my mind to make decisions/choices about how to live well. But ultimately it comes down to listening to my heart or gut...which doesn't always make sense. I *vote* my way through life by making choices. Sometimes I judge that my choices are bad (mistakes) in the moment...and then later realize/imagine/see they may have actually led to a more favorable outcome. It seems to me, if we're to be really honest about all of this decision-making-process-stuff...we need to acknowledge that it always comes down to, could be *good*/ could be *not good*/ we don't really know....because it's all based on the *subjective* limitations of our rational minds within a specific set of considerations. Ok...enough of that.
 
We now have the tools to play together at the meta/global scale. We've never done this before. We have no real foundation of understanding (other than our imaginations) as to how this will work, and where it will lead. I say let's design a process that is open, attractive, and fun (so that people will actually want to play)....and then trust the *process* to guide us in the most favorable way.

&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Now that we have computers and electronic communications, and Habermas, another option is on the table (even at the scale of populations). The option is to have everyone who wishes to participate in making the decision do so, through participating in rational discourse. When the point is reached that, among all those participating (which includes all those who wish to participate), there are no unresolved objections to implementing the proposal, that marks the point at which the decision has been made to implement the proposal.
</I>
No unresolved objections at a global scale could take a very long time. At that scale there will always be someone with a subjective position contrary to your subjective position. I say the safest process is the one that includes all subjective positions, calls them for what they are, and fosters a creative process for distilling those positions into a collaborative resonance that is deemed, by a large enough percentage of the community, as having enough value to support it. Ultimately that *deeming* comes down to a a meeting of *criteria*....which you could call a process of voting if you like. You could also call it, no reasonable unresolved objections at that particular scale which includes considerations for the subjective positional differences that will always occur in a dissonant culture such as ours. In my mind the intention is to facilitate creative collaboration and to empower the collective mind to find itself. The collective mind may just be an irreverent, irrational beast....but I believe it's the only conduit available to finding our true nature/destiny as a species....and perhaps our connection to the whole of life itself. Rational discourse can support the movement of the collective mind, but it can't direct it. There are too many other players involved in the game.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If at this point you are still unclear on the difference between the two methods of decision making, you are going to have to help me out: what is not clear?
</I>
As I see it....one method makes good *sense*...the other one...not so much. I'm more attracted to the &quot;not so much&quot; method.  ;-)  

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ned&gt; If you are now clear on the difference between the two methods of decision making, then the question becomes: which method do you think that we-the-network should use to make public decisions, and why?
</I>
Above all it should be open, fun, engaging, and empowering at ever larger scales. It should foster and reward creative collaborations that are directed toward outcomes the network deems to be of significant value.
