<PRE>Hi Stephen, (Great Post!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Can you see this kind of organization using &quot;communicative
    action&quot; to organize itself......entirely...without any hierarchical
    structure...or overlords...so to speak? 

The short answer is yes (actually, *YES!!!*). The long answer is pretty 
long and complex, just as the story of the inner workings of an iPad is 
long and complex, however simple and easy the iPad may be to use.

We have systems with hierarchies, oligarchies, and overlords because 
such arrangements, as design features, accomplish various good things. 
The alternative to such design features needs to also accomplish all of 
those good things, better.

(The long answer exists; my ability to communicate that long answer 
continues to improve, but still has a ways to go ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Let's say we have a *project funding platform* similar in
    some ways to Kickstarter. Similar in that ... anyone can propose a
    project ... and anyone can support a project. 

&quot;... anyone can propose a project ...&quot; Yes.

(And also, persons may peruse the presentation of a proposed process for 
proposing a project at *&quot;Project: Propose&quot;*: (perhaps promptly please) :-)
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/5ad0279680a75bfbcd34f91f8467c28d">http://www.wiser.org/article/5ad0279680a75bfbcd34f91f8467c28d</A>

*Directly Supporting Projects*: The way Kickstarter works is that it 
enables each donor to directly donate to any project presented. Each 
donor fully manages her own donations, and only her own donations. The 
reasons for each donation remain private. The individual donor has no 
direct say in which projects get funded (except when the individual 
donor donates the full amount needed).

I agree that our new system should/must include this same &quot;direct 
donation&quot; option, in addition to its other arrangements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; The funding platform would have an (as yet to be
    determined) criteria for the use of it's platform. 

Yes. In the &quot;democracy through communicative action&quot; paradigm, each 
candidate criterion is proposed, and becomes effective (that is, will 
begin being applied to all subsequent proposals) at the point that it 
has itself successfully passed through the &quot;communicative action&quot; 
process. (See a discussion of such &quot;criteria for proposal acceptance&quot; at 
Filter the Proposal 
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/b181a7661c5728b0f24d6cca553e3daa">http://www.wiser.org/article/b181a7661c5728b0f24d6cca553e3daa</A>&gt; )

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Then, in order for a project to be funded it would have to
    raise the funds stated as necessary to get the project
    underway.....and raise them within the time frame of one process
    cycle....or whatever. 

This is a suitable arrangement for funding projects solely through 
personal direct donations (which is the only funding model there is on 
Kickstarter). If our system is someday to also handle public funding of 
projects (from public funds), we will need other sorts of arrangements 
as well. (More on this below ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; The project organizers would need to disclose all relevant
    aspects of the project and the people involved for at least as long
    as it was in process. 

Yes. And also, especially for publicly funded projects, there may need 
to be independent examination and appraisal, in addition to 
self-reported disclosure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Whereas KIckstarter is a marketing platform; this would be
    an begin-healing-the-planet platform. 

Yes. The criteria for proposal acceptance will play the key role in 
this. And also, presumably, project proposals that don't make the cut 
will then just move over to Kickstarter. It will be interesting to see 
how that goes ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; People who fund a proposal wouldn't necessarily walk away
    with some gadget. 

Yes. This is where &quot;communicative action&quot; will need to show its stuff. 
The success of the collaboration to compile the proposal acceptance 
criteria will be measured by the ability of the result to attract and 
inspire donations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; This funding platform would be associated with a *social
    network platform* to deepen the process in terms share-ability...and
    for the purpose of &quot;communicative inter-action&quot; ;-). 

I am open to being shown that this would be constructive, but the social 
network platforms we have had presented to us up to this point look to 
me to be mostly counter-productive from the perspective of 
begin-healing-the-planet. (There is lots to be said about this ...) (And 
also, I know: &quot;Awww ... I'm no fun!&quot;)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; A variety of toolsets are provided for members of the
    social network to use in developing their project proposals. 

Yes. This is a big deal. Right now the governments and corporations and 
think-tanks have vastly better toolsets than those available (at high 
cost) to the general public. They also have money, taken from the 
general public, to pay their minions to use those toolsets. The general 
public is left having to work-for-free, using inferior tools. At the 
beginning, we may want to consider giving priority to tool-building 
projects, which would mean giving high priority to understanding and 
agreeing on what tools we want.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; A *library/database* tracks all relevant details of the
    network and proposal development/funding process. 

Yes. :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; A *non-for-profit foundation platform* awards money (each
    cycle) to best-in a-certain-field proposals (like resolving: hunger,
    global warming, deforestation, etc). 

Where does the foundation money come from? One can donate directly to 
individual projects, and/or can donate to the foundation as a 
distribution agent for the donation? (I think that it would be a great 
idea to offer the option of donating to such a foundation.)

If we have a foundation acting as distribution agent, then we 
effectively have public funds, and will need those other project funding 
arrangements that I referred to above.

*Cycles*: I have already mentioned (in an earlier post) that I am not a 
fan of the &quot;everybody wait until Christmas Morning&quot; arrangement. :'(

*Best-In*: I am also not drawn to the idea of relying on a superficial, 
artificial criterion such as best-in-a-certain-field as a major 
determiner of funding. If using that criterion were proposed, I would 
object. (My gut says no ... :-) )

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Stephen&gt; Anyone who wants to participate in selecting the&quot; best&quot;
    proposals is welcome to do so. 

This brings us to the topic of public funding of projects and proposal 
prizes. That is what Blinap is for (among other things). Blinap answers 
the question: &quot;*HOW* will anyone who wants to participate, participate?&quot;
