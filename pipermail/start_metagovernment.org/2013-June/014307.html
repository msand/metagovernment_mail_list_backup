<PRE>Ned,
I appreciate your thoughtful response to my questions.
Using &quot;communicative action&quot; as you've just described is intriguing to me.
In order to understand this more, it would be best for me to see it applied to the process I/we have been discussing.

Let's say we have a *project funding platform* similar in some ways to Kickstarter. Similar in that...anyone can propose a project...and anyone can support a project.
The funding platform would have an (as yet to be determined) criteria for the use of it's platform. 
Then, in order for a project to be funded it would have to raise the funds stated as necessary to get the project underway.....and raise them within the time frame of one process cycle....or whatever.
The project organizers would need to disclose all relevant aspects of the project and the people involved for at least as long as it was in process.
Whereas KIckstarter is a marketing platform; this would be an begin-healing-the-planet platform. People who fund a proposal wouldn't necessarily walk away with some gadget.

This funding platform would be associated with a *social network platform* to deepen the process in terms share-ability...and for the purpose of &quot;communicative inter-action&quot; ;-).  A variety of toolsets are provided for members of the social network to use in developing their project proposals. 

A *library/database* tracks all relevant details of the network and proposal development/funding process.

A *non-for-profit foundation platform* awards money (each cycle) to best-in a-certain-field proposals (like resolving: hunger, global warming, deforestation, etc). Anyone who wants to participate in selecting the&quot; best&quot; proposals is welcome to do so. 

Here's my question:

Can you see this kind of organization using &quot;communicative action&quot; to organize itself......entirely...without any hierarchical structure...or overlords...so to speak?

&gt;<i> Hi Stephen,

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; With &quot;communicative action&quot;....at all scales....are we
</I>&gt;<i>   talking when EVERYONE agrees....or some other measure?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are talking ... when everyone *who wishes to participate in making that particular decision* agrees. (The number that choose to participate has no effect on the outcome.) Given the incentives that exist in the &quot;democracy through communicative action&quot; paradigm, individual decision processes will probably seldom involve more that a few dozen participants. There can in addition be any number of lurkers that just watch. Lurkers can choose to participate at any time. (Right now there are probably dozens of lurkers watching this decision process involving you and I, who could jump in at any point, as equals.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Globally, tens of millions of decisions are made each year that have effects that reach beyond those who actually participate in making the decision. (For example, various decisions that have been made behind closed doors in the boardrooms of corporations such as Monsanto, Raytheon, and Pfizer have had amazingly far-reaching effects.) My dream is that all such decisions be made publicly and democratically, which will require a decision system that can handle tens of millions of proposals per year.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any particular individual can only participate in making a few thousand of those tens of millions of decisions. (Run the numbers: 1 hour per decision, 10 hours per day, 300 workdays per year -- that's 3000 decisions per year.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Run the numbers another way: 6 minutes per decision per person, $10 per hour living wage cost of time, 7 billion participants -- that's a $7 billion cost for one decision, and the quality of the decision will be that which 6 minutes of study produces. How many such costly, superficial decisions can we afford?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To realize the &quot;democracy through communicative action&quot; potential, four arrangements are crucial:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Anyone must be free to choose to participate in making any public
</I>&gt;<i>     decision.
</I>&gt;<i>   * There needs to be a way for each individual to register in advance
</I>&gt;<i>     to receive notification of proposals that meet selected criteria.
</I>&gt;<i>   * There needs to be professional profiling of each proposal
</I>&gt;<i>     submitted, to guarantee that the notification system actually does
</I>&gt;<i>     its job.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Already existing (settled) criteria must be professionally applied
</I>&gt;<i>     to each proposal submitted, to guarantee that the settled criteria
</I>&gt;<i>     are fully considered for each submitted proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (For a more complete specification, see Blinap &lt;<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/740569be35a413f95a6ee2b555b8834f">http://www.wiser.org/article/740569be35a413f95a6ee2b555b8834f</A>&gt; )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; Can you imagine there could be &quot;communicative action&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i>   &quot;voting&quot; in the same process of awarding funding for projects?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From the perspective of communicative action, voting creates a loophole, truncates the process, and wastes resources.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     LOOPHOLE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In communicative action, all reasons are public -- they are communicated. But the action of casting a vote is not a communicative action. The true motives of the voter are private, not public, and are given effect though the algorithms of an impersonal vote-counting system, rather than through their communication effects on other participants. This is the loophole.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     TRUNCATION
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In communicative action, the process of arriving at a decision continues to the point that everyone is on board. (As an aside, there would be nothing to prevent a set of participants from recognizing &quot;my gut says no&quot; or &quot;the vibe is off &quot; as valid objections to be resolved -- the aim is to have everyone on board.) Voting truncates this process. The decision is made with valid objections still on the table, unresolved.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     WASTE
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it is known that the process can be truncated through voting, the aim of some will become simply to win through voting at the earliest possible opportunity, by any means; the aim of others will become to prevent that, by any means. Communicative action is displaced by competitive/strategic action.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Competitive/strategic actions that attend decision making through voting waste resources in myriad ways (advertising costs, propaganda preparation costs, etc.). Communicative action without voting is much more efficient, besides having better vibes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; Can you imagine the degree/amount of communicative action
</I>&gt;<i>   and the percentage of people involved in the process of developing a
</I>&gt;<i>   goal could be one of the *criteria* for deciding whether the project
</I>&gt;<i>   gets funding or not?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For now, I am drawing a blank on what &quot;degree/amount of communicative action&quot; could mean, but I will keep working on it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the only way to be involved is to say something, and if there were a criterion that required that at least a certain number &quot;be involved&quot;, that would motivate &quot;get out the say-anythingers&quot; drives to pump up the number, which would just clutter the actual process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> However, attaching a &quot;like button&quot; to the project result would be entirely possible, and the count could be used as a criterion. But again, this would create the loophole. The reasons for liking would be private, rather than having their effect through being communicated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (Regarding terminology: I completely agree with you that &quot;communicative action&quot; is a much better term than &quot;rational discourse&quot;. And also, proprietary philosophical terminology is a nightmare. If we use the term, we are sure to catch grief from philosophers. But that's OK -- I will just point out that it was your idea ... :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Great questions!

Rational discourse sounds like something a bunch of old-white-male-philoshphy professors do for fun on a Friday night while sipping Sherry and smoking cigars.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Stephen,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Rational discourse is an everyday thing. You and I, in this email exchange, are engaging in rational discourse. We are trying together to understand and agree upon which method of decision making would work best for us-the-network. In the end, we may reach that understanding and agreement. Or, we may reach a point where we see that further discourse (at least for now) will not take us toward understanding and agreement. At that point, we would table the discourse, always with the possibility of resuming it at a later time, as new insights and understandings and articulations occur to us as we go through life.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The philosopher J&#252;rgen Habermas is the big name in arguing that democracy and &quot;communicative action&quot; are a good match:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   In strategic action, actors are not so much interested in mutual
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   understanding as in achieving the individual goals they each bring
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   to the situation. Actor /A/, for example, will thus appeal to /B/'s
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   desires and fears so as to motivate the behavior on /B/'s part that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   is required for /A/'s success. As reasons motivating /B/'s
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   cooperation, /B/'s desires and fears are only contingently related
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   to /A/'s goals. /B/ cooperates with /A/, in other words, not because
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   /B/ finds /A/'s project inherently interesting or worthy, but
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   because of what /B/ gets out of the bargain: avoiding some threat
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   that /A/ can make or obtaining something /A/ has promised (which may
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   be of inherent interest to /B/ but for /A/ is only a means of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   motivating /B/).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   In communicative action, or what Habermas later came to call &#8220;strong
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   communicative action&#8221; in &#8220;Some Further Clarifications of the Concept
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   of Communicative Rationality&#8221; (1998b, chap. 7; German ed., 1999b),
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   speakers coordinate their action and pursuit of individual (or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   joint) goals on the basis of a shared understanding that the goals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   are inherently reasonable or merit-worthy. Whereas strategic action
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   succeeds insofar as the actors achieve their individual goals,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   communicative action succeeds insofar as the actors freely agree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   that their goal (or goals) is reasonable, that it merits cooperative
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   behavior. Communicative action is thus an inherently consensual form
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   of social coordination in which actors &#8220;mobilize the potential for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   rationality&#8221; given with ordinary language and its telos of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   rationally motivated agreement. -- Stanford Encyclopedia of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>   Philosophy: Habermas&lt;<A HREF="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/habermas/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> For those who agree that democracy and communicative action are a good match, choosing between voting and rational discourse as the better decision method becomes a question of deciding (or, preferably, observing) which of the two methods more reliably manifests communicative action.
