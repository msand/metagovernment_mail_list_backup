</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;The board shall strive to make decisions by consensus, attempting to
</I>&gt;<i> reconcile differing points of view based upon the interests of the Co-op.
</I>&gt;<i> If, in the opinion of a majority of directors present, diligent efforts
</I>&gt;<i> have failed to produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action,
</I>&gt;<i> then such issue shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of directors.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I could imagine the directors might get themselves into trouble at some
</I>&gt;<i> point interpreting the words.....&quot;interests&quot; and &quot;diligent&quot;. But on the
</I>&gt;<i> whole, it seems to be working quite well for them/us. We're one of the
</I>&gt;<i> strongest co-ops in the country. Our system is hierarchical and as members,
</I>&gt;<i> we use voting to select the directors as well as to change our bylaws. I've
</I>&gt;<i> shopped there for 25 years and I can tell you they/we do a really amazing
</I>&gt;<i> job.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my view, our system works because:  We're member owned and operated. The
</I>&gt;<i> invitation to participate is always there. Rational communication and
</I>&gt;<i> action occur regularly at all levels. I wouldn't say that we've have found
</I>&gt;<i> the best way to organize...but it seems to work pretty well.

What would be necessary to cover processes of your coop by our tools to get 
real world experience (and users)? Ideally we would help you expand the 
principles and success of the coop while we all gain tested practices and 
tooling.
