I can see you've thought a lot about all of this.   And I'm really appreciating the immense amount of work you (and others) have already invested in realizing this ideal/vision/goal.

One big thing keeps coming up for me though: In order for a system/process like this to really catch on...and to work at a population scale....it would need to be both empowering and fun. Most people these days aren't going to spend their 30 minutes, or so, of precious alone time each day rustling through 10,000 mundane proposals. Sorting through a bunch of (meaningless to me) stuff would be a real buzz kill. Personally, I just wouldn't do it. It needs to be organized....and it needs to be *connective* in a meaningful way.

&gt;<i> I am open to being shown that this would be constructive, but the social network platforms we have had presented to us up to this point look to me to be mostly counter-productive from the perspective of begin-healing-the-planet. (There is lots to be said about this ...) (And also, I know: &quot;Awww ... I'm no fun!&quot;)
</I>

Personally, I don't do Facebook because it's such a time suck...but it's extremely popular around the world for one reason. Humans are very social creatures and most of us want to connect and share our lives and 'business' with friends and family online. Being able to do this is meaningful and fun for a LOT of people. And it's a really great way to *organize*.  Let me say that again...and it's REALLY great way to *organize*....(think &quot;Arab Spring&quot;). That's the &quot;empowerment&quot; aspect. Having access to a dedicated global platform to facilitate the business of creating a better world...that's furnished with all of the toolsets we would need to engage in &quot;communicative action&quot;, at a population scale, would be really attractive to LOT of people right now....particularly if it was effective in generating and funding some really intelligent projects. 

I'm imagining a networking platform that I could visit each day in order to catch up on all the latest buzz about what is happening in the/my world. I would want to be able to use this platform as an information filtering mechanism, as well as an interaction/action mechanism. I would want to have my own individual and/or group webpage(s). I would want to be able to organize them so that I could track all of things happening on the network that were important to me. I would want to be able to connect directly to the *library/database* so I could have quick access to any info I wanted about the network and it's/our business. I would want to be able to easily connect to other webpages of members and groups (in the same format) so I could easily peruse and gather info about them. I would want to be able to easily manage my involvement in the proposals/projects that I was a part of. I would want to be able to easily make pledges or donations to projects that I liked....and to connect with them personally to become involved in some way if I wanted to do so.    And I would want it all to be accessible on a mobile ap.   I think you get my point....  :-)

I know...it's an &quot;iPad of complexity&quot;....but, in my mind, it's the only way we will ever be able to organize at that scale in order to heal society and the planet sometime before we totally self-destruct.  

What thinks you?


&gt;<i> *Directly Supporting Projects*: The way Kickstarter works is that it enables each donor to directly donate to any project presented. Each donor fully manages her own donations, and only her own donations. The reasons for each donation remain private. The individual donor has no direct say in which projects get funded (except when the individual donor donates the full amount needed).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that our new system should/must include this same &quot;direct donation&quot; option, in addition to its other arrangements.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; The funding platform would have an (as yet to be
</I>&gt;<i>   determined) criteria for the use of it's platform. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. In the &quot;democracy through communicative action&quot; paradigm, each candidate criterion is proposed, and becomes effective (that is, will begin being applied to all subsequent proposals) at the point that it has itself successfully passed through the &quot;communicative action&quot; process. (See a discussion of such &quot;criteria for proposal acceptance&quot; at Filter the Proposal &lt;<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/b181a7661c5728b0f24d6cca553e3daa">http://www.wiser.org/article/b181a7661c5728b0f24d6cca553e3daa</A>&gt; )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; Then, in order for a project to be funded it would have to
</I>&gt;<i>   raise the funds stated as necessary to get the project
</I>&gt;<i>   underway.....and raise them within the time frame of one process
</I>&gt;<i>   cycle....or whatever. 
</I>&gt;<i> This is a suitable arrangement for funding projects solely through personal direct donations (which is the only funding model there is on Kickstarter). If our system is someday to also handle public funding of projects (from public funds), we will need other sorts of arrangements as well. (More on this below ...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; The project organizers would need to disclose all relevant
</I>&gt;<i>   aspects of the project and the people involved for at least as long
</I>&gt;<i>   as it was in process. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. And also, especially for publicly funded projects, there may need to be independent examination and appraisal, in addition to self-reported disclosure.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; Whereas KIckstarter is a marketing platform; this would be
</I>&gt;<i>   an begin-healing-the-planet platform. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. The criteria for proposal acceptance will play the key role in this. And also, presumably, project proposals that don't make the cut will then just move over to Kickstarter. It will be interesting to see how that goes ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; People who fund a proposal wouldn't necessarily walk away
</I>&gt;<i>   with some gadget. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. This is where &quot;communicative action&quot; will need to show its stuff. The success of the collaboration to compile the proposal acceptance criteria will be measured by the ability of the result to attract and inspire donations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; This funding platform would be associated with a *social
</I>&gt;<i>   network platform* to deepen the process in terms share-ability...and
</I>&gt;<i>   for the purpose of &quot;communicative inter-action&quot; ;-). 
</I>&gt;<i> I am open to being shown that this would be constructive, but the social network platforms we have had presented to us up to this point look to me to be mostly counter-productive from the perspective of begin-healing-the-planet. (There is lots to be said about this ...) (And also, I know: &quot;Awww ... I'm no fun!&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; A variety of toolsets are provided for members of the
</I>&gt;<i>   social network to use in developing their project proposals. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. This is a big deal. Right now the governments and corporations and think-tanks have vastly better toolsets than those available (at high cost) to the general public. They also have money, taken from the general public, to pay their minions to use those toolsets. The general public is left having to work-for-free, using inferior tools. At the beginning, we may want to consider giving priority to tool-building projects, which would mean giving high priority to understanding and agreeing on what tools we want.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; A *library/database* tracks all relevant details of the
</I>&gt;<i>   network and proposal development/funding process. 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; A *non-for-profit foundation platform* awards money (each
</I>&gt;<i>   cycle) to best-in a-certain-field proposals (like resolving: hunger,
</I>&gt;<i>   global warming, deforestation, etc). 
</I>&gt;<i> Where does the foundation money come from? One can donate directly to individual projects, and/or can donate to the foundation as a distribution agent for the donation? (I think that it would be a great idea to offer the option of donating to such a foundation.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we have a foundation acting as distribution agent, then we effectively have public funds, and will need those other project funding arrangements that I referred to above.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Cycles*: I have already mentioned (in an earlier post) that I am not a fan of the &quot;everybody wait until Christmas Morning&quot; arrangement. :'(
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> *Best-In*: I am also not drawn to the idea of relying on a superficial, artificial criterion such as best-in-a-certain-field as a major determiner of funding. If using that criterion were proposed, I would object. (My gut says no ... :-) )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   Stephen&gt; Anyone who wants to participate in selecting the&quot; best&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>   proposals is welcome to do so. 
</I>&gt;<i> This brings us to the topic of public funding of projects and proposal prizes. That is what Blinap is for (among other things). Blinap answers the question: &quot;*HOW* will anyone who wants to participate, participate?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
