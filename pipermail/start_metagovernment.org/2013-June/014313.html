I just read the bylaws of the Ashland Food Coop of which I am a member. We've been around for 40 years. We have 8100 owner/members. Our projected sales for 2013 are 28.8 million. We are debt free.  It is a very lively and extremely successful enterprise by all reasonable standards. 
Here is the section of our bylaws regarding decision making: 

&quot;The board shall strive to make decisions by consensus, attempting to reconcile differing points of view based upon the interests of the Co-op. If, in the opinion of a majority of directors present, diligent efforts have failed to produce a consensus and the issue requires immediate action, then such issue shall be decided by a two-thirds majority of directors.&quot;

I could imagine the directors might get themselves into trouble at some point interpreting the words.....&quot;interests&quot; and &quot;diligent&quot;. But on the whole, it seems to be working quite well for them/us. We're one of the strongest co-ops in the country. Our system is hierarchical and as members, we use voting to select the directors as well as to change our bylaws. I've shopped there for 25 years and I can tell you they/we do a really amazing job. 

In my view, our system works because:  We're member owned and operated. The invitation to participate is always there. Rational communication and action occur regularly at all levels. I wouldn't say that we've have found the best way to organize...but it seems to work pretty well.
