<PRE>Hi Ed and Mark -- Great Posts!

Ed, I am right there with you in understanding that it is all about 
resources. Some of us have funds available to donate; some of us feel 
called to work on new governance systems, and do so to the extent that 
we are able (self-supported and/or donation supported). More resources 
would be a very good thing. As you say, the window of danger and 
opportunity is upon us.

Setting up an American non-profit corporation and then funding it 
through grants and such is a common model, and can work. Worth a shot if 
there is evidence that it might. Beyond that, there are also other 
funding models that can work (as you probably know much better than I). 
Brainstorming with a range of potential donors might be useful. 
(Brainstorming with potential recipients of donations, or with 
middle-man agents of donors (foundations, etc.), would probably be less 
useful -- the donors are the drivers.)

Because the work that we are doing (towards true democracy, etc.) is not 
really in the self-serving best interests of the Carnegies and 
Rockefellers and Mellons, or their agents, formality may not be our 
friend when it comes to finding funding. New paradigms become attractive 
(to independent donors, developers, and participants) when those working 
within the paradigm are having the most fun, and making the best progress.

Mark, I very much agree that it would be a good idea for us to set up a 
new sovereign state sort of entity (not geographically defined -- global 
in reach), and have our new governance systems operate in that context. 
To me, &quot;run parallel and render obsolete&quot; seems a much better strategy 
than &quot;try to compete directly within rotten and rigged systems&quot;.

I confess that I didn't follow your references to the freemasons and 
such, but this particular thread may not be the appropriate place to 
have that discussion. You are the one in the best position to know how 
you can help. If you have proposals that you could make (with 
specificity and particularity), that would be great, and I and others 
could respond.

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi, Ned. The idea I have been floating on the Votorola list is
</I>&gt;<i>     just that: an idea I'm mulling over. I brought it up prematurely
</I>&gt;<i>     because of the post Rhett had made there. But it is all about
</I>&gt;<i>     resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Currently, the resources I have available for Metagov are tiny
</I>&gt;<i>     scraps of time I manage to eke out between the heavy demands of my
</I>&gt;<i>     job, my business, and caring for a sick family-member.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I would prefer for Metagov to be my full-time job, but the only
</I>&gt;<i>     practical way for me to make that happen is to organize it as an
</I>&gt;<i>     American non-profit corporation. Then I could work up to spending
</I>&gt;<i>     significant amounts of time writing grant proposals to foundations
</I>&gt;<i>     in the hopes of building up a treasury which we could then use to
</I>&gt;<i>     fund publicity efforts as well as to fund coding projects (plus I
</I>&gt;<i>     could work on making back-end improvements such as expanding on
</I>&gt;<i>     the limitations of the list server).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I've repeatedly floated the idea of creating a formal
</I>&gt;<i>     organization, but I've had a lot of trouble with the idea of
</I>&gt;<i>     making it an American company. It just seems wrong for our group
</I>&gt;<i>     to be tied to one country. Especially the United States, where
</I>&gt;<i>     relatively few of our members reside and where the tax laws are
</I>&gt;<i>     intrusive and burdensome. There's also a lot of legal work to be
</I>&gt;<i>     done to figure out if we can create a non-profit which is governed
</I>&gt;<i>     not by a board of directors but by collaborative governance. On
</I>&gt;<i>     the other hand, the U.S. is the place where a large bulk of the
</I>&gt;<i>     moneyed foundations reside; and generally they only fund American
</I>&gt;<i>     non-profits (&quot;501c3's&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Rather than figuring out what to do with the scarce resources we
</I>&gt;<i>     have now, I would love the opportunity to grow them into a more
</I>&gt;<i>     formidable stash. I am open to ideas, suggestions, alternative
</I>&gt;<i>     thinking, etc.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     following)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     As often happens when we try to use listserv platforms for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     rational discourse, the thread started out as a specific
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     invitation from Rhett Pepe to Michael Allen, and has since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     morphed into a wide-ranging informal conversation between Michael
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Allen and Ed Pastore. (As an aside, to effectively and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     efficiently support decision making through rational discourse,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     we need a system that features professional profiling and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     automatic multi-threading of each unit and sub-unit of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     discourse, and that structurally, procedurally, reliably,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     transparently connects the discourse outcome to the decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     outcome. Blinap alone among all extant decision system designs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     provides these features. The listserv platform has none of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     features.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Below is a list dealing with one issue, extracted from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     thread, of aims and values and objectives and strategies, with my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     addition appended.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Rhett wants to start a new (mixed-format) political party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           (and run for city council), as a means to infiltrate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           Representative Democracy with Direct Democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Ed wants freedom from representation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Ed wants consensus-oriented direct democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Ed is also (like Rhett) considering founding a mixed-format
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           party, as a stepping stone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         * Ned thinks that using our scarce resources to directly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           compete against entrenched powers (that have vastly more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           resources) on their own turf (in our currently existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           polyarchies) would be a monumental waste of our scarce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           resources. We can more quickly and efficiently create a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           more effective global &quot;bully pulpit&quot; if we do not engage in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           the utter waste of competing directly (creating political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           parties, running for office, buying advertising, funding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           political campaigns, etc.).
