Actually, and unfortunately, I believe this is a fundamentally
unworkable idea because it actually makes the
unequal-participation-rate problem worse: The people that are most
likely to participate this way are exactly the *wrong* people to do so
because they're mostly extremists/&quot;stakeholders&quot;/activerts and so are
not representative of the preferences of The People in general.
Government (democracy) must be about what the majority consider to be
fair, not what some vocal minority prefers. Tools like these therefore
IMHO are actually taking us in the opposite direction from our goal of
&quot;good government&quot;.

    Scott
