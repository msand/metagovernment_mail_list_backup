As in a government-run tax-dollar-supported database for sharing this
type of information. Makes sense to me, and would have a lot of
advantages over current systems:
1) No advertising and the manipulation that enables

2) We could build it as an API which would allow:
   a) User choice of UI (i.e. you could have skins to make it look
like any current system or some sort of hybrid)
   b) User control over the matching algorithms (e.g., filter out all
the cat videos your friends post)
   c) Allows search for content (this is a glaring hole in FB: You
can't search for posts by topic)

3) We could implement proper authentication to eliminate bots and
other fake accounts, something that will never be done by any
advertising-supported system because the economics actually *reward*
them for allowing these things.

Unfortunately we probably need a functioning democracy to get anything
like this implemented and so building that is what we should be
concentrating on. It's also important to keep in mind that
FB/Twitter/WeChat/etc. are all doomed in the long run (as is the case
for pretty much *all* technology that we seem to believe is
indispensable and irreplaceable) so IMHO none of them are really worth
getting your shorts in a bunch about. Again, we should be
concentrating on what the next system should look like rather than
trying to find ways to patch up the (probably unsolvable) problems
with the existing systems.

    Scott
