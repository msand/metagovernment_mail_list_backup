<PRE>The only issue I see is someone 'incentivizing' a group to prop up a
manager, without money. Like small towns that only exist because of the
wood mill or something. The owner of the mill could potentially coerce
their employees to vote for a particular manager, without actually doing
anything illegal. Since the vote is public, people of the town might be
bullied into giving their support.

This isn't a problem specific to your proposal but one that I've struggled
with too.

&gt;<i> Finally getting back to working on the Matchism Manifesto. Here's my
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new and improved&quot; manager selection process design. Anything I
</I>&gt;<i> missed?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any adult-certified candidate may apply for Locality Manager by
</I>&gt;<i> filling out an application which will include biographical information
</I>&gt;<i> and links to social media and other informational pages. A nominal
</I>&gt;<i> filing fee should be required to discourage those seeking just to
</I>&gt;<i> disrupt the system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Compensation packages for Locality and Globality Managers (salary,
</I>&gt;<i> housing, etc.) shall by specified by ordinance (no negotiation).
</I>&gt;<i> Compensation should be high by existing government standards (they
</I>&gt;<i> should be paid more like CEOs of comparably-sized companies than
</I>&gt;<i> mayors).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Organizations may publicly endorse a Candidate, but neither they nor
</I>&gt;<i> the candidate may pay for any promotion or advertising in support of
</I>&gt;<i> the candidate (no campaigning).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each voter can express a preference for each Candidate (approve,
</I>&gt;<i> disapprove, abstain) as well as for the current Locality and Globality
</I>&gt;<i> Managers. Candidates are shown in The System ranked by approval
</I>&gt;<i> margins  (number who approve minus the number who disapprove) averaged
</I>&gt;<i> daily over the month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Candidates with a negative margin approval at the end of each month
</I>&gt;<i> will be deleted. They may reapply after a three month waiting period.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the first of each month if the average daily margin of approval of
</I>&gt;<i> the top-ranked Candidate for the previous month was more than 10%
</I>&gt;<i> higher than current Manager, that Candidate will have 48 hours to
</I>&gt;<i> declare that they will accept the position as Manager. If they do,
</I>&gt;<i> they will be considered &quot;Primed&quot; to take over the job. If they refuse,
</I>&gt;<i> they will be removed from the candidate list and prohibited from
</I>&gt;<i> reapplying for one year and the process restarted for any additional
</I>&gt;<i> candidates who exceed the 10% threshold.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A Primed Candidate will contest to maintain daily average margin at
</I>&gt;<i> least a 10% above the existing Manager for a period of one month. If
</I>&gt;<i> this margin is maintained, the Primed Candidate becomes Manager
</I>&gt;<i> effective the 1st of the following month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The transition period shall be one month. The incoming Manager
</I>&gt;<i> immediately gains ultimate authority on each decision, but may
</I>&gt;<i> delegate as necessary. Both managers are paid for the full month
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of hours put in. No new primed candidate can be announced
</I>&gt;<i> for the transition month thereby guaranteeing a new manager at least 3
</I>&gt;<i> months as a &quot;trial period&quot; before they can be replaced.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For Global Manager position, the Candidates are the Locality Managers
</I>&gt;<i> who have served at least one year, but the procedure is otherwise the
</I>&gt;<i> same. A separate tally of *global* approval ratings shall be
</I>&gt;<i> maintained for this list (i.e., each voter can make an approval
</I>&gt;<i> assessment for any Locality Manager, but only local votes count when
</I>&gt;<i> comparing the Locality Manager with the Candidates seeking to replace
</I>&gt;<i> them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any Locality Manager or the Globality Manager can be removed from
</I>&gt;<i> office effective immediately by a majority vote of the Locality
</I>&gt;<i> Managers. The replacement will come from the current sorted list of
</I>&gt;<i> Candidates, with one-month transition period starting immediately
</I>&gt;<i> after the vote to remove.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ==================================
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To provide a real-world simulation, Trump (average -13 margin) would
</I>&gt;<i> have been replaced by Charlie Baker (governor of Massachusetts,
</I>&gt;<i> average 55 margin) months ago. Of course Trump never would have been
</I>&gt;<i> put in office at all under this system as he never would even have
</I>&gt;<i> ever been able to become a Locality Manager.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few features/benefits:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Because Manager selection is based margin rather than ratio
</I>&gt;<i> (approve divided by disapprove) it favors more well-known candidates
</I>&gt;<i> and for the Globality Manager, candidates from larger Localities.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is as it should be.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Candidates are &quot;on&quot; all the time: Their behavior should improve in
</I>&gt;<i> their existing positions because they can't afford to risk creating
</I>&gt;<i> dissatisfied customers in anything they do. This will do wonders to
</I>&gt;<i> eliminate bad actors even from non-government positions. This feature
</I>&gt;<i> may encourage risk-avoidance, but because ratings are in some sense
</I>&gt;<i> cumulative (human memory being a long-term thing) conservatism will
</I>&gt;<i> come with its own risks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) In hard times there will probably be a lot of turnover, which again
</I>&gt;<i> is as it should be: Worst thing is to elect someone who's &quot;big words,
</I>&gt;<i> little action&quot; and have to wait 4 years to get rid of them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The &quot;contest month&quot; allows for debates and other informational
</I>&gt;<i> events, but is short enough that people won't get burned out on them
</I>&gt;<i> like they do in e.g., the US presidential campaign system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) The specified 10% margin is of course arbitrary: You want to set it
</I>&gt;<i> high enough to prevent churn, but low enough that there will be
</I>&gt;<i> turnover when there is a real difference between contenders.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The primary disadvantage I see of this system is that it would be
</I>&gt;<i> relatively difficult and rare for someone to replace the Local Manager
</I>&gt;<i> while being employed in the executive branch of that Locality (imagine
</I>&gt;<i> the working conditions!). I would therefore expect the majority of
</I>&gt;<i> Candidates to hold high-level positions in non-government
</I>&gt;<i> organizations or to come from neighboring Localities. But this seems
</I>&gt;<i> to me already to be the most common transition in our current system,
</I>&gt;<i> so I don't see it as a serious problem. A less-serious disadvantage is
</I>&gt;<i> Localities that find a really good Manager will probably lose them at
</I>&gt;<i> some point, but at least that person will continue to represent them
</I>&gt;<i> albeit at a more diluted level if the promotion is to Globality
</I>&gt;<i> Manager.
