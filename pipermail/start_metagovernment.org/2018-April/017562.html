<PRE>For a long time I thought that the way forward with FB would be for FB to
introduce real democratic rules to handle its groups. Once thaat was in
place, then other entities could have been handled in the same way. Also FB
itself (although I never went far enough to even thinking it, because as
Jacopo points out FB is a company). One time at a web event where I was
about to speak, I met a google engineer who was also another speaker. So
the evening before I had some time to speak with him, and what he told me
crashed all my hopes:
Q) what do you do if someone has a really cool idea for FB?
A) we try our best to ignore him, and even avoid hearing what he has to say?
Q) What???
A) There are too many issues with patents, and litigations, and who owns
what idea, and so on. And FB does not want to get involved with all that.

And that was the first part. Even if the first part was so negative, I
still went forward about the second set of questions. I asked him about
eDemocracy as could be implemented in FB. And saying that they were in the
perfect positionto really transform the world. I don't remember the exact
answer he gave me but it was really disheartening. Something along the
lines that FB does not give a s#!+ about this, and would never implement
any of this. I remember at the time I was quite hopeful. FB had just
introduced various forms of polling, and thought eDemocracy was just one
short step ahead. After that we went backward, and many polling tools were
later retracted (and only left for groups), and then thngs changed again.
And so on.

At the end I reached the conclusion that FB, like political systems, are
really hard to renovate. And the easiest way is to start a new system
planning things well from the beginning.

Which is what I am now working on in the crypto sphere (see my recent
youtube videos if you are curious about it).

So I don't think this will succeed. But maybe, hopefully, I am wrong.
