<PRE>Apologies for the delay in getting back to you: I only had very
limited Internet access for the past couple of weeks (camping).

Again, if you don't trust the government not to do this, how can you
trust them to do anything else?

And as a practical matter this also isn't a concern anyway IMHO as
long as you use an open voting system where anyone can go in and
verify their votes (surely someone will notice if their vote gets
deleted/changed).

&gt;<i> Alternatively, if simply distributed databases and a decentralized web is
</I>&gt;<i> wanted, one can use <A HREF="https://datproject.org/">https://datproject.org/</A> and <A HREF="https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/">https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> as a gossip protocol. No blockchain needed. Can try it today with the
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://beakerbrowser.com/">https://beakerbrowser.com/</A>
</I>
Or use any database that supports sharding on cloud systems (e.g.,
MongoDB on AWS, which is what proxyfor.me is built on). That gets you
the redundancy to deal with outages, DOS attacks, hacks, etc., which
IMHO is 99% of what you need distributed systems for. Note that
&quot;because I don't trust anyone&quot; is not on that list...

&gt;<i> I hope the previous paragraph makes it clear that we need to monitor that
</I>&gt;<i> all data remains immutable, not only our own.
</I>
Sorry, I don't follow: Not only do you not trust the executive branch
not to change/delete the data, but you *also* don't trust your fellow
citizen to detect and report this if it happens to them?

&gt;<i> Fiat currency or quite similar systems can for sure be built on distributed
</I>&gt;<i> immutable log like systems as long as the participants agree on the rules.
</I>&gt;<i> You can do it without any proof-of-work/stake/space/elapsed-time, if a web
</I>&gt;<i> of trust exists among the actors taking part of the economy.
</I>&gt;<i> E.g. <A HREF="https://duniter.org/en/">https://duniter.org/en/</A> implements the Universal Dividend, as specified
</I>&gt;<i> by the theory called Relative Money Theory.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://duniter.org/en/theoretical/">https://duniter.org/en/theoretical/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/">http://vit.free.fr/TRM/en_US/</A>
</I>
Again, I submit that if you don't trust the executive branch (and
indeed the entire banking system with all it's checks and balances) I
submit that no amount of fancy technology is going to cure what ails
you. And if you do, then the technology we use can be vastly
simplified, improving service levels, reliability, and the ability to
detect and deal with attacks on the system. Indeed one of the biggest
problems with cryptocurrencies is their very opacity: When someone
develops a way to game the system it probably won't be discovered
until the damage is so great that the entire economy might collapse as
a result.
