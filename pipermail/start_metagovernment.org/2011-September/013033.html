<PRE>Welcome Paul,

I respond to a statement of Ed's.

</I>
While I wouldn't oppose collaborative forms of governance as a means
to an end, neither would I oppose representative forms.  Depending on
our approach, it might turn out that representative forms are
expedient, or even ideal (I agree with Jonas and Paul here).  But
these are mostly technical concerns.  What I want to suggest is that
we focus more clearly on the goal.

Francis proposes putting legislation in the hands of citizens.  At the
same time, he takes a clear view of the status quo in this regard;
knowing what hands it would be taken from.  This is still a technical
matter of means and affordances, but one thing is made clear, what it
affords is sacrosanct and off limits.  It therefore promises a liberty
and here, if we are clear-eyed about the status quo in *this* regard,
is a goal that becomes an imperative.

I was shocked recently to discover how little freedom we actually
have.  You would think that a hard working, tax paying citizen like
yourself (or even a loafer like me) would have a degree of political
choice, but in fact we have none.  Our political freedoms could not be
less if we were living in China or Saudi Arabia. *  Worn out words
like &quot;democracy&quot; have little meaning here, and technical terms like
&quot;collaborative governance&quot; cannot carry us to the level of a common
cause with others in the world whose human rights are not respected.
At that level, our disagreements would fall away.


* I discovered this fact in Warren Smith's &quot;meaning of a vote&quot; thread,
  and tested the truth of it in argument with him, and other experts:

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment is also an umbrella, but primarily of tools (as opposed  
</I>&gt;<i> to parties) for direct democracy. It is also for any individuals  
</I>&gt;<i> interested in furthering the goal of citizen-lead governance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My understanding (and please correct me if I am wrong) of Demoex and  
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy International is that both are focused on incorporating  
</I>&gt;<i> direct citizen involvement into existing systems of representative  
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. This is done by making the representatives accountable to  
</I>&gt;<i> decisions made by online tools (of which several our member projects  
</I>&gt;<i> are happy to provide). I think Demoex refers to this as Mixdemocracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What I and various others in this group are aiming for is the  
</I>&gt;<i> replacement of the representation system entirely, and a move toward a  
</I>&gt;<i> much more direct form of democracy. Some of our systems, such as  
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola, allow for representation by means of delegated voting, where  
</I>&gt;<i> one can delegate decision-making to another. But these delegations are  
</I>&gt;<i> always transient and at-will. That is, at any moment, anyone can  
</I>&gt;<i> remove their delegation and act directly on one's own behalf or  
</I>&gt;<i> delegate to someone else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do very much like the idea of Mixdemocracy, but in the end I think  
</I>&gt;<i> it is going to run into a lot of problems because it still relies on  
</I>&gt;<i> the goodwill of the representatives and it still requires legislation  
</I>&gt;<i> to be run through the filter of a few individuals instead of opening  
</I>&gt;<i> it up to everyone all the time. Our conception of collaborative  
</I>&gt;<i> governance implies that citizens will undergo a transformation in how  
</I>&gt;<i> they view their responsibility to governance when they realize that  
</I>&gt;<i> they are truly in control of everything:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Again, please feel free to correct any misconceptions I may have about  
</I>&gt;<i> DI or the general idea of Mixdemocracy. And regardless, I do think  
</I>&gt;<i> there are great opportunities for collaboration here. Our goals and  
</I>&gt;<i> ideals are the same, it is only our approaches which differ in some  
</I>&gt;<i> details. There are many opportunities for overlap, and it is probable  
</I>&gt;<i> that the more we work together, the more likely it is that we will all  
</I>&gt;<i> succeed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Wow. It looks like the Participedia article on Metagov has grown  
</I>&gt;<i> quite a lot since I last looked at it:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i> However, it appears that many of our member projects (which are not  
</I>&gt;<i> subservient to Metagov at all, but merely voluntary collaborators in  
</I>&gt;<i> the umbrella) do not have pages there.
