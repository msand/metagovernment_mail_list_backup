<PRE>I'm replying to Paul and Matteo in one mailing:


&gt;<i> &quot;Politics in the U.S. are very combative these days, and any  
</I>&gt;<i> software which is less than rock-solid is going to get severely  
</I>&gt;<i> abused by malicious interests.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> M: -&gt;    This is a point to go for a simpler system. It much easier  
</I>&gt;<i> to make a simple system &quot;rock-solid&quot; than a complicated one
</I>

Representative democracy is even simpler: just vote once and let the  
politicians take care of the rest. I disagree that simple is a value  
in designing a good system of governance.

I don't see how a simple system would work. Like an open wiki? At  
least in the U.S., that would be a disaster. More below.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Who would participate in the software that would tell me what  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to  do? If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violate the  laws of the locality: or at least very much aggravate  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the local  people, since everything else about the status quo is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> set up with  rigid jurisdictional systems (unlike collaborative  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance, which  is much more fluid). If I restrict it to just  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people in the locality  that I represent, then, well... what  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> software can support that  restriction today?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P: We, in Belgium, propose to have several rounds
</I>&gt;<i> 1. a proposal of law
</I>&gt;<i> 2. anyone can propose and discuss amendments but the person(s) who  
</I>&gt;<i> submitted the proposal stay in charge of the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 3. a first round of voting give an idea of the social support and  
</I>&gt;<i> has to reach a threshold (2%) comparable with the signature gathering
</I>&gt;<i> 4. if the threshold is reached a vote can be launched for all  
</I>&gt;<i> citizens concerned (in Belgium, like in Spain ,... we have all an  
</I>&gt;<i> electronic identity card like a bank card)
</I>
I just don't see how I could effect this in the U.S. as a political  
candidate. If I get into office, there will be publicity around it,  
and people here will make it a point to abuse my website. What is to  
stop that?

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; You can set up a system with reciprocal recognition of user  
</I>&gt;<i> locality. I invite a friend as new user and I guarantee his  
</I>&gt;<i> location. Instant messaging on mobile phone also work this way.  
</I>&gt;<i> There are some technical methods to do that.
</I>
Where is this system? Michael has devised something like this, but I  
don't think it is ready to go live. How could I do this today?

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. If any of those above malicious interests play with the inputs  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or  if anything else goes wrong, it can make a very bad name for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our  entire movement. What if I find that the website ends up  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> having me  support the legalization of rape and murder? That could  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be easily  accomplished by people deliberately getting together to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make me look  bad. What is to stop that? Or what if the software  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just doesn't work  right: then what am I supposed to do in the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legislature (or whatever  body I am in)? Just abstain until a new  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> version of the software comes  out? How would that look?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That are all assumptions that do not materialise. If you don't trust  
</I>&gt;<i> people (in great numbers) democracy is not possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Our example in sweden (demoex) shows that it did not happen. And  
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives in direct democracy are also proving that it is not  
</I>&gt;<i> happening.
</I>
Maybe your political process is more friendly. I do trust the people  
in general, but I do not trust all the people all the time. Here in  
the U.S., there are extremely villainous political elements. They will  
stop at nothing to win an election, to smear an opponent, or to get  
their way. I cannot see how they could restrain themselves from trying  
to destroy a mixdemocracy candidate, when that candidate clearly is a  
threat to the source of their power.

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; No, this will not be possible for the reason you stated above,  
</I>&gt;<i> as people will require to get tens of thousands of people sign a law  
</I>&gt;<i> allowing rape and murder and this will not happen.
</I>
That's in a California referendum. If I run for my local city council,  
it would only take a few people to tell me what to do on my website,  
would it not?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Even if everything goes right, our movement could still get a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid ideas (of which  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there are plenty in the U.S.). Collaborative governance works on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the principle  that consensus decision-making only allows the best  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions to pass.  But in a less complex system, what is there  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> besides majority rule? Super-majority rule? That's still nothing  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like real consensus-through- synthesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P: consensus has to be reached if possible and it is more often  
</I>&gt;<i> possible then we might think. But thinking that it is always  
</I>&gt;<i> possible is an illusion in my view.
</I>
I don't think it is always possible, but it is always necessary. When  
it is not possible, then why should there be a law? Why force laws on  
an unwilling populace? Governance without consent of the people is not  
democracy.

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; If you do not trust people to be able to write good laws, and  
</I>&gt;<i> you think they may vote for stupid law in mass, so you are against  
</I>&gt;<i> the very principle of direct democracy, in my opinion.  Laws that  
</I>&gt;<i> look intelligent to you will look stupid to other people, and  
</I>&gt;<i> viceversa.
</I>

I believe in democracy, but no I do not trust mob rule. Just letting  
the mob decide anything on a whim is a proven disaster. It is open to  
demagoguery, which is where they can be swayed by rhetoric into doing  
stupid things. A prime example: George W Bush was able to leverage the  
9/11 attacks into massive support for invasions of Afghanistan and  
Iraq. A consensus system would not have allowed that, because 10-20%  
of the American populace was vehemently opposed to those invasions.  
But since a large majority was worked into a frenzy by political  
rhetoric, it happened. That's the failure of allowing the mob to rule  
without some sort of check. It is not democracy, it is more like  
anarchy.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Technically, how does it work in something like a city council.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is usually a docket of topics for a city council, so if I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were a  council member, I could ask the website what people want me  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to vote on  those. But how do I vote when someone raises a new  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue within a  council meeting? Or a motion? Do I always have to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abstain until I  consult the website? What about committees? Can I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participate in a  committee? Those do a lot of their work without  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making any votes, and  then vote at the end: how do I draw the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> populace into that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P: demoex works there (Vallentuna near stockholm) since 2002.  Talk  
</I>&gt;<i> to Per Norback, he is doiing it.
</I>
I've tried to contact Demoex without success before. I guess I'll try  
again.

&gt;&gt;<i> To me, direct democracy and representative democracy are enormously  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> different. I have yet to be convinced of how or why they should be   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> forced together in some weird hybrid when we have a means to start   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> implementing collaborative governance as a ground-up replacement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P: yes, but if we wait until politicians allow us to make our own  
</I>&gt;<i> decisions it will take decades.
</I>
Collaborative governance is an alternate system, designed to rise up  
from the roots without any support, help, or acceptance by politicians.
