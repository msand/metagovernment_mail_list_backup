<PRE>Hey C,

&gt;<i> ... We could also show something like a distribution of the votes,
</I>&gt;<i> but this does not match the progress view and will confuse users.
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>
Maybe we could show a mock-up of the track stack and related parts of
the toolbar, like the SAC selector.  Then if folks have trouble
answering - if they say, &quot;I don't get it&quot; - that'll be helpful to us.
Because the purpose of the track stack is to convey an immediate (2
second) message.  I guess it's our &quot;marquee&quot; entrance way (think
Broadway) to crossforum theatre and if folks don't get the message on
the big sign, or if they aren't somehow attracted by it, then it's
exactly the kind of problem we want to float in public and discuss.

Overall, this is no easy design problem and would keep a senior
designer well occupied, I'm sure.

school &quot;ward&quot; :-)
tho we *do* intend to enable children to vote

&gt;<i> Hey,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I have started joining Mike in the resource management work and am atm. trying 
</I>&gt;<i> to figure out how to visualise progress in the TrackStack. (1)
</I>&gt;<i> I have collected some ideas about horizontal progress bars (2), nothing too 
</I>&gt;<i> fancy, but you get an idea quickly. We have two scenarios atm.:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) No account is selected. Only a SuperAccount (like US$, Votes, 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;MillingMachine labour hours&quot;, is selected). This means we cannot show a 
</I>&gt;<i> target defined in one of the positions. The progress bars from (2) don't fit 
</I>&gt;<i> that very well, since there is no global target to match. Yet we can for 
</I>&gt;<i> example define the global poll target by having a look at the official 
</I>&gt;<i> registry it is defined for. If you take a local registry, like a school yard, 
</I>&gt;<i> then it would match the total number of votes against the total number of 
</I>&gt;<i> possible voters. Btw. Ed, we do have a way to map official registries. Since 
</I>&gt;<i> we allow mirroring and forking, we can even have different divisions for 
</I>&gt;<i> different voteserver instances, sharing the same registry (if I understand 
</I>&gt;<i> Mike correctly). See (3)
</I>&gt;<i> Another possible alternative would be the average or median of all or some 
</I>&gt;<i> defined targets for this account, which would show a general trend for this 
</I>&gt;<i> resource (yet this is might to be mechanic if targets differ too much).
</I>&gt;<i> We could also show something like a distribution of the votes, but this does 
</I>&gt;<i> not match the progress view and will confuse users.
</I>&gt;<i> Any ideas?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The simpler scenario, an account is selected (Mike is currently designing 
</I>&gt;<i> the model for that), and we therefore know the target definition for this 
</I>&gt;<i> account in this position (even if the account is defined in some delegate's 
</I>&gt;<i> position). We can then show a simple progress bar as mentioned in (2).
</I>&gt;<i> We will define the target as an optional property of each account btw.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let the ideas float in :-)
</I>&gt;<i> conseo
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (1) Atm. you see &quot;[Resource tracks are stacked here]&quot; in this view, have a 
</I>&gt;<i> look at this Crossforum view for example: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox">http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (2) <A HREF="http://whiletaker.homeip.net/progress_1.svg">http://whiletaker.homeip.net/progress_1.svg</A> The count itself would be 
</I>&gt;<i> redundant at least when shown with Votespace, so you can leave that out.
