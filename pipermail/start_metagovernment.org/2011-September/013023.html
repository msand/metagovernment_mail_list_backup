&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ...I imagine an open-source, collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative to what the American Legislative Exchange Council offers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to our lawmakers.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to find a description of ALEC's drafting tools.  All I found
</I>&gt;<i> was &quot;model legislation&quot;, and lots of it: <A HREF="http://alecexposed.org/">http://alecexposed.org/</A>
</I>
Yes, the &quot;model legislation&quot; is what I was referring to. Thinking about it more, I realize that ALEC provides lawmakers other things, e.g. ready connections to a large pool of big donors, that a citizen legislation-drafting group wouldn't be able to. Of course, this kind of citizen group would also have its own carrots and sticks to offer. Is this a topic that is ever explored on MG?
&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you for the pointers to some of what's out there. I read your theory.xht on the Votorola site and I believe it's exactly the kind of thing I was hoping would be out there.

&gt;<i> What motivated you to search for drafting tools?  Do you have a
</I>&gt;<i> particular legislative project in mind?
</I>
No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the available options for political participation. I plan to set up a collaborative drafting site, probably using Votorola, and to invite people back home to participate (I live in California now, but I still identify politically with Cleveland, Ohio). I see this process as the 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a petition. I would hope to crank out something simple, non-controversial, to campaign to push through a local legislature. I haven't thought this through past that, yet.
