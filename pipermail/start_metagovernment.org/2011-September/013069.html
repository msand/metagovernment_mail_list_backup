When I first read the above sentence, the first thing that came to my  
mind is, &quot;this is how our movie should start.&quot; That's a powerful and  
moving statement. It also gives me the idea of making the entire movie  
script first-person, and yet still crowdsourcing the narration. So  
each paragraph is a different person talking about how he or she is  
not enfranchised (within the overarching thread of the narrative).

I think that would work really well for part one (which is the only  
part that I have a first draft of at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Promotion/Movie/Script">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Promotion/Movie/Script</A> 
  ), but I don't know if it would work for part two: how we can do  
anything about it. Maybe once the narrative shifts from the flaws of  
representative democracy to the possibilities of collaborative  
governance, it should switch from &quot;I&quot; to &quot;We.&quot; How does that strike  
anyone?

In other words, so sum up the whole movie in two short sentences:
I am not free because representative democracy has failed me.
We will be free when we take control of our own governance.


&gt;<i>   Whether I vote or not, and regardless of who I vote for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) the candidates are chosen ahead of time, and I have no
</I>&gt;<i>         influence over the choice;
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) the course of the election is unaffected by my vote;
</I>&gt;<i>     (c) the outcome is the same, regardless;
</I>&gt;<i>     (d) state power is unaffected; and
</I>&gt;<i>     (e) the laws are unaffected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If I disobey (d) state power or (e) the laws, then I am brought
</I>&gt;<i>   into submission by force.  The powers that affect me are unaffected
</I>&gt;<i>   by any comparable power of mine.  In regard to my political
</I>&gt;<i>   freedom, I might as well live in China or Saudi Arabia.
</I>&gt;<i>   Disobedience is my only freedom, and yet the cost of exercising it
</I>&gt;<i>   is physical confinement or worse.  In this regard, it follows that
</I>&gt;<i>   I am a slave.
