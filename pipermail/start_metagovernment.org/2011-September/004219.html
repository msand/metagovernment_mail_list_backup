<PRE>Hi, Arthur. I hope you don't mind that I have included the list on  
this thread.

We have put a lot of thought and effort into developing systems which  
favor constructive solutions and cooperation over antagonism and  
demagoguery. Some of the ways we work toward this end are:

1. Openness and inclusion. A lot of antagonism comes from  
disenfranchisement and/or the inability to have one's voice heard.  
Collaborative governance naturally counteracts this. When people feel  
empowered and responsible for their own governance, it seems more  
likely that they will be more inclined to act responsibly.

2. Avoiding polarization of issues. By working to open up all issues  
to all opinions, we avoid the simplification of issues into black-and- 
white yes/no issues, which never really suit reality anyway. We don't  
force individuals to pick a side, agree with a platform, or join a  
party: instead, people simply contribute and vote as they please.

3. Removing the middle-man. As I've already noted in the script,  
politicians feed on polarized issues because it lets them distinguish  
themselves from their opponents and mobilize supporters. This  
generally works against finding agreement among people.

4. Actively promoting synthesis over compromise, conflict, or edict.  
Many of our solutions have incorporated systems which drive people to  
find common ground and to look for answers that work for all &quot;sides&quot;  
of an issue. It is our belief that solutions which arise out of  
synthesis are much more long-lasting because they can get buy-in from  
everyone. By comparison, compromises are never appealing to anyone and  
leave all parties looking for a way to overcome them.

These are some of the ideas that have yet to be worked into the  
script. They are difficult to get across, but are the real focus of  
what we are talking about with collaborative governance. I am very  
open to suggestions as to how to present these ideas in a way that is  
both compelling and easy to grasp.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Arthur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The script is still in early development: the first draft is only  
</I>&gt;<i> about half complete. But you can see what there is here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Promotion/Movie/Script">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Promotion/Movie/Script</A>
</I>&gt;<i> The indications of images to go along with slides are currently very  
</I>&gt;<i> primitive (if at all) and not very artistically inspired.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you would prefer to skip looking at this very early stage, I can  
</I>&gt;<i> notify you when the script is more mature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The one novelty I had come up with for this production would be to  
</I>&gt;<i> have each scene/paragraph read by a different member of our project.  
</I>&gt;<i> In other words to effectively crowdsource the narration, which is in  
</I>&gt;<i> the spirit of the project overall.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any help you would like to contribute, even if it is just to suggest  
</I>&gt;<i> production methods, would be very welcome. And again, I can notify  
</I>&gt;<i> you later when the script is more mature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your interest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. Please feel free to respond on-list: it is always good for  
</I>&gt;<i> everything having to do with this project to be done in public.
