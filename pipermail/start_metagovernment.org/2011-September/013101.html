<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for your feedback and suggestions.&#160; A few comments and responses below:


&gt;<i>From: Michael Allan &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mike at zelea.com</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>Hi David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Your posts are thoughtful and I'd wanted to respond earlier.&#160; I try to
</I>&gt;<i>make up for lost time:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>David Gleason wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160; A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (resources, people, groups, organizations) and dynamic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationships.&#160; In other words it has to model the real world. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Kind of like object-oriented programming, but without the emphasis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on programming, without the limitations of typical OO structures,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and with an equal emphasis on the dynamic relationships between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objects.)&#160; If a system does not accurately capture existing reality,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most people will not be able to understand the existing reality,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what changes or optimizations are therefore appropriate, or what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> effects those changes would have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Our formal models (a) take information from the real world; (b) chug,
</I>&gt;<i>chug... generate something useful from it; and (c) contribute it back
</I>&gt;<i>to the world.&#160; OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a web information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> construct and share any type of data structures and relations to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> model those kinds of things.&#160; It's probably many ~6 months away from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> being useful however.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>With &quot;this&quot; referring to (a)?&#160; At first blush, I would say no, the
</I>&gt;<i>initial design effort must focus almost exclusively on (c).&#160; Design
</I>&gt;<i>questions to ask are: what precisely to give back (detailed use case);
</I>&gt;<i>why is it needed in the real world (theory); and how to deliver it
</I>&gt;<i>(practice, tooling).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I was referring to the representation of information in a clear, complete, intuitive way, which would mostly fall under &quot;(b)&quot;.&#160; And although this is maybe is not critical for simple issues, or for issues relating more to morals, or highly subjective areas, for other things that relate more to resource allocation options with many variables, or for example to the history of a political candidate's campaign contributions and voting history, I think some clever ways of representing large data sets would be a big value add to many types of collaboration systems. As an example, one helpful visual tool is often a timeline - e.g. <A HREF="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/jfk/jfk.html">http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/examples/jfk/jfk.html</A> - which can be quite helpful in understanding a complex issue that otherwise would take 10 times longer if you were to sort through dozens of sources to attempt to assemble all the information into a cohesive form with links to all the original sources.&#160; Another example of a visual
 aid might be in illustrating the net economic effects of large public works proposals, using something like a Sankey diagram or other charts showing the various inputs and outputs.&#160; Anyone who has taken economics 101 probably would agree that optimizing economics equations is usually not intuitive and usually requires some visualization to find the optimum inflection point or points where various curves cross.&#160; Charts and visual tools are not my primary goal however, the first thing I'm focusing on is making it very easy for average people to get data into a system in a way that allows that data to be easily shared, verified, updated, etc.&#160; The visual tools should then be relatively easy to add as a UI layer.


So yes my project is now focused on (a) - getting information from the real world, and representing it in a natural, flexible, and dynamic way.&#160; It will be awhile before I get too far into (b), and (c) is a step I have not put much thought into yet.&#160; Hopefully I'll have some more to say on my progress in a few months.&#160; The basic idea though is to provide essentially a distributed CMS platform which is extremely simple in a formal mathematical sense, and which can be easily extended for purposes of data visualization, simulation, and collaboration.&#160; (Which of course is all a fairly vague concept at the moment, and I apologize for taking up everyone's time with my explanation of this idealistic system before I actually have anything to show for it.&#160; But maybe someone else has thought about the same thing, or seen something similar, and might have some good input for me, thus my reason for mentioning it.)


&gt;&gt;<i> I think the biggest barrier to collaborative governance of any sort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is complexity management.&#160; If a framework does not exist that allows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reality to be accurately visualized and understood by average
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (non-technical) people, for potential changes to be simulated, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for users to provide input on a granular basis, then runaway
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity and chaos quickly results.&#160; Which I believe is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> biggest reason we have the political systems we have today.&#160; 98% of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people don't understand the subtle details of how things really work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with complex government-related systems, and thus emotion is all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they are left with for a decision framework.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I take it &quot;collaborative governance&quot; means the participation of
</I>&gt;<i>ordinary folks in politics.&#160; An interesting perspective to consider is
</I>&gt;<i>that the disorganized population of ordinary folks (lifeworld) is
</I>&gt;<i>perhaps the most complex social thing on the planet.&#160; The stuff of the
</I>&gt;<i>lifeworld isn't neatly ordered, but it has plently of internal and
</I>&gt;<i>external interrelations that are multiplied across the expanse of the
</I>&gt;<i>population.&#160; This means complexity, and this complexity becomes the
</I>&gt;<i>natural environment in which the ordinary person lives and breathes.
</I>&gt;<i>(But this is just one perspective.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes there is indeed complexity everywhere, and I think there could be a big shift coming in the next decade in computer science where current development paradigms, bloated inefficient processes and reliability issues will be rethought and the CS field might start to return more to its roots in math and science.&#160; I could be wrong though :)


&gt;&gt;<i> One of the biggest deceptions of law is to introduce a faux brand of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> complexity into affairs such that only lawyers and politicians are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;qualified&quot; to administer things, and the rest of the people are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> left with no sufficiently powerful logical framework from which to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counter.&#160; Only when science and technology are able to rise to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occasion, surmount their own complexities, and provide an inarguably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> solid framework, will we be able to replace the old system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The other side of that perspective coin is that the administrative
</I>&gt;<i>machinery of the government is overtaxed in attempting to grapple with
</I>&gt;<i>the complexity of the lifeworld.&#160; Stuff ordinary folks deal with in
</I>&gt;<i>their sleep, so to speak, has the government stretched beyond its
</I>&gt;<i>limits and growing bigger daily in an attempt to cope with it.
</I>
Sure, but no more so than typical reactionary corporatism which exploits whatever it can and then just fine tunes things as problems arise, which is easy to do when you have relatively unlimited resources and own the media and the government.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have lots of other ideas too but just thought I'd throw those out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there for now as I see the information system part of the equation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> as key.&#160; The web as it is today is in many ways just an extension of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the concepts of print media which came before it and I think there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to be a radical shift in that.&#160; Email chains, blogs, articles,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc. 99% of the time just contribute to long blobs of static
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information that quickly become unmanageable, unbounded, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> obsolete.&#160; I think that with a dynamic, interlinked view of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information, an appropriate framework could enable information to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built, maintained, and refined as a cohesive interlinked structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Dangers with starting at (a) are you model the wrong aspects of the
</I>&gt;<i>real world, and have to backtrack later; or you overmodel it and end
</I>&gt;<i>up with an expensive simulation of something that doesn't need
</I>&gt;<i>simulating.
</I>
Fortunately I'm keeping things as simple as possible (in the data model at least), so it should be pretty general purpose and flexible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>David Gleason wrote in reply to Matteo Martini:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I maybe alluded to this in another thread but figured it might be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good to restate, I think that most of the time when voters make a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bad decision in how they vote, probably 90% of the time it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they didn't fully understand the issues and the details of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proposal (or in the case of a candidate, the details of his/her
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> platform and real intentions).&#160; The modern political system (in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> US at least) has perfected the art of portraying something one way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when in fact it does completely the opposite (Orwellian doublespeak
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at it's finest).&#160; And this is easy to do because very few have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> individual financial motivation to invest the time to properly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> document what the issues are and make a clear case to voters, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those who stand to profit have vastly more incentive and resources
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to devote to presenting their proposal to the public in whatever way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they want.&#160; So the system gets abused very easily and the incentives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for disinformation are much higher than those for truth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You observe a failure in the system (it made a poor decision) and
</I>&gt;<i>attempt to trace the cause.&#160; Along the way, you depend on an
</I>&gt;<i>assumption that the decision was made by the voters.&#160; But there is
</I>&gt;<i>good reason to suppose otherwise.&#160; Please see the analysis in the
</I>&gt;<i>second post of the &quot;Freedom&quot; thread. [1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Mind you, when the voters *do* start making decisions for themselves,
</I>&gt;<i>they may very well welcome the assistance of reasoning tools, such as
</I>&gt;<i>you propose.
</I>
Well as the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but it's up to them to drink.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everyone on this mailing list is probably well aware of these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> things, but in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> public to understand what the complex reality is behind issues, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what the subtleties and side effects may be, and provide features
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that allow the community to document issues/platforms in a clear and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formal way (i.e. with references, and with a mechanism to ensure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objectivity, e.g. allowing subjective statements to be flagged, like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia articles).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>This comes down now to your delivery side, again (c).&#160; It would be
</I>&gt;<i>helpful to know what other tooling exists there, because likely you
</I>&gt;<i>must integrate with it.&#160; Unfortunately, no such tooling is mature,
</I>&gt;<i>yet.&#160; You may be working a little ahead of your time.&#160; If so, I hope
</I>&gt;<i>you find a useful surrogate application that's not too unlike the (as
</I>&gt;<i>yet unknown) real McCoy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, lots of work lies ahead to find out what other similar things are being done and find the best ways to integrate with / expand upon those.


&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe I'm asking too much of a collaborative governance system, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe most would see that as a separate concern, but would not a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c.g. system be better off as a secondary layer on top of that type
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of information / content management system, rather than being a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> separate system?&#160;&#160;&#160;You can have the best voting system in the world,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but if the users are not properly informed about the complex details
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of what they're voting on and the government /administrative systems
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affected by that, then you will still get the wrong outputs from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting system, and it may be no more effective against corruption
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and monied influences than the representative systems we have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> today.&#160; Looking forward to hear anyone's feedback on this idea,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>You already *do* expect tight integration... but perhaps you give your
</I>&gt;<i>own tools too foundational a role.&#160; There is theory that the
</I>&gt;<i>rationality of public decisions cannot be cognitive-instrumental
</I>&gt;<i>alone.&#160; The objective world is not the only world involved in the
</I>&gt;<i>decision space, but that space also includes the social and subjective
</I>&gt;<i>worlds, which require moral-practical and aesthetic-practical forms of
</I>&gt;<i>reasoning [2 p.238].&#160; All three forms of reasoning must be employed
</I>&gt;<i>simultaneously by persons oriented to mutual understanding and
</I>&gt;<i>agreement as a means of deciding what to do.&#160; This combination of
</I>&gt;<i>rationalities is called (I think) commmunicative reason and the
</I>&gt;<i>overall decision + execution process, &quot;communicative action&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>Fortunately it all happens more-or-less naturally when people are
</I>&gt;<i>engaged in frank discussion with their peers.&#160; This is not to say that
</I>&gt;<i>they won't be needing reason-tools, but it does suggest that and
</I>&gt;<i>objective orientation and cognitive-instrumental rationality cannot be
</I>&gt;<i>foundational, as the rational foundation is necessarily tri-partite.
</I>&gt;<i>All of this might figure into the design task (c).
</I>
Agreed.&#160; I'm definitely not trying to cover every use case - just those which relate more to complex issues that are now not being served well by existing tools.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>David Gleason wrote in reply to Matteo Martini:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> p.s. - This email chain is a good example of what I referred to as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runaway complexity in an earlier post. To rewind a bit, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> following paragraph is from my original post in this thread, and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> kind of sums everything up:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of collaborative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the public to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand what the complex reality is behind issues, and what the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia articles).&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's all there was to it.&#160; (And to clarify, when I say community
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> above, that just means those in the community (or their delegates)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> who wish to be involved.)&#160; I apologize if I was unclear about that,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and for the several follow on emails which turned 1 paragraph into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 20.&#160; But for the purposes of clarity I maintain that the first issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> we're facing is complexity.&#160; And the establishment knows all too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well how to leverage that to their advantage.&#160; And this is a verrry
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subtle thing - if you take complexity as a given, and do nothing to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minimize it within a social information system such as the types we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are all interested in, then - in my opinion - you'll have a much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> harder time achieving larger scale adoption of any such system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>There *is* a gaping hole in the current structure of society, but it
</I>&gt;<i>seems not so much a complexity-handling deficit *in the first
</I>&gt;<i>instance*.&#160; The fact is not generally known yet, but I believe it is a
</I>&gt;<i>fact that a fault (or breakage) exists between these two structural
</I>&gt;<i>elements of society:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; * individual person
</I>&gt;<i>&#160; &#160; * individual vote
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>The individual person matters greatly in a modern society (subject of
</I>&gt;<i>human rights), while the individual vote matters not at all.&#160; It
</I>&gt;<i>matters not at all because the course and outcome of the election are
</I>&gt;<i>absolutely unaffected by it.&#160; The individual person (as a voter) is
</I>&gt;<i>thus disengaged from the electoral system, which is his/her only
</I>&gt;<i>formal connection to politics.&#160; Politics is about power.&#160; The vote is
</I>&gt;<i>the only power granted to the individual, and hence the only means of
</I>&gt;<i>exercising power.&#160; There are many voters in society, and the sum of
</I>&gt;<i>their disengagement therefore amounts to a massive power vacuum.&#160; This
</I>&gt;<i>power vacuum cannot be filled by the individual voters as such owing
</I>&gt;<i>to the fault in the electoral system; but a vacuum is not too picky
</I>&gt;<i>about what fills it, so something other than the individual voters
</I>&gt;<i>rushes in and does the job. [1]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I mention all this in order to suggest that, because the ordinary
</I>&gt;<i>individual *as such* has been exluded from participation in politics,
</I>&gt;<i>we may safely conclude that the lifeworld has also been excluded.
</I>&gt;<i>This may well account for the deficit in complexity handling that you
</I>&gt;<i>diagnose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, there has indeed been quite a disconnect as you describe, which is certainly quite convenient for the oligarchs as it lets them do whatever they want while the people remain under the illusion that they have &quot;democracy&quot;.

And I believe the only practical solution is - as R. Buckminster Fuller said, &quot;You never change things by fighting the existing reality.&#160; To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete&quot;.&#160; So let's create a great platform and start using it at the local and community level and then over time it can expand to do bigger things.&#160; The key to this however I feel is that is has to be not just a technology platform, but a formal, provable &quot;mathematically correct&quot; system which does not have the inherent bugs, complexity, and inconsistency of current approaches.

By the way I really like a lot of what I'm seeing on zelea and votorola, haven't read into it too much yet but the documentation is great and everything seems intuitive and well thought out, definitely looking forward to see how things evolve.


Thanks,
David
