<PRE>Hello,

I am only a guest here ;-)
Do you are talking about some form of &quot;Fluid Democracy&quot; ?

Regards

Paul

&gt;<i> Hello, Francis, and welcome!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the  available 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options for political participation. I plan to set up a  collaborative 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drafting site, probably using Votorola, and to invite  people back home 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to participate (I live in California now, but I  still identify 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> politically with Cleveland, Ohio). I see this process  as the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a petition.  I would 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hope to crank out something simple, non-controversial, to  campaign to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> push through a local legislature. I haven't thought this  through past 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that, yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to caution on the distinction between setting up something  that 
</I>&gt;<i> can work on one piece of legislation and something which can work  on all 
</I>&gt;<i> legislation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When people get focused into one issue, that issue tends to polarize  into 
</I>&gt;<i> camps and the issue tends to grow into something larger than it  really 
</I>&gt;<i> should be. California is a great example of how this can go  wrong, as you 
</I>&gt;<i> see referenda taking on the force of huge campaigns,  when their focus is 
</I>&gt;<i> really a tiny fraction of the important issues in  the state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea behind collaborative governance (at least as I see it) is to 
</I>&gt;<i> enable individuals to participate in every decision. That  fundamentally 
</I>&gt;<i> changes the nature of their participation. Because  instead of everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> getting emotional and frenzied about one simple  issue, people scatter 
</I>&gt;<i> into the issues that really matter to them. That  is, instead of millions 
</I>&gt;<i> of people raging at each other about whether  or not to tighten 
</I>&gt;<i> immigration, you may instead see a few hundred  people working on how 
</I>&gt;<i> farmers can better take in their crops without  promoting immigration 
</I>&gt;<i> problems while another few hundred might be  working on a way to make 
</I>&gt;<i> public healthcare for immigrants work for the  social good without being a 
</I>&gt;<i> direct contributor to increasing  immigration. (Just entirely made up 
</I>&gt;<i> examples, mind you.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing people to contribute to one piece of legislation lets them  into 
</I>&gt;<i> the process, but only in that one little way. Those who actually  feel 
</I>&gt;<i> empowered by this access would probably be inclined to leverage  this 
</I>&gt;<i> little bit of power as much as they can, and the end legislation  may 
</I>&gt;<i> suffer from the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what I am suggesting is that you keep your expectations small in  terms 
</I>&gt;<i> of community. It is good that you are focusing on a local  legislature. I 
</I>&gt;<i> would suggest you go as micro-local as you can: such as  one department in 
</I>&gt;<i> one township, or even smaller to something like a  home owners' 
</I>&gt;<i> association. In such small communities, you then have the  opportunity to 
</I>&gt;<i> really open up all the decision-making, since the  overall number of 
</I>&gt;<i> decisions and issues are manageable in number. If  collaborative 
</I>&gt;<i> governance can prove itself in these small domains, it  can then begin 
</I>&gt;<i> scaling up as it gains acceptance and the tools mature.
