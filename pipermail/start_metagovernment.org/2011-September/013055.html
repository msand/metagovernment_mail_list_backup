<PRE>Hi Michael,

one us wrote a book about &quot;direct democracy&quot; who is to download for free in 
several languages and I think this is a good start (and it is not to big 
;-).

&gt;<i> Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for replying.  Thanks also to Ed for starting this thread.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hopeful we can recognize a common cause here, despite our differences
</I>&gt;<i> in methodology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Living in a community means acceptance of some rules. Call it a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;social contract&quot;. If democracy (in the real sence) starts in rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> small communities who are free to accept associations (right of free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> association), and also te right to leave them if they want (right of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> secession), there should be choice enough for most of us who are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing to pay the price of living in a community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree, that would be nearly ideal.  Competition would then do the
</I>&gt;<i> work of ensuring that societies in general were respectful of freedoms
</I>&gt;<i> and other human rights, since each individual could easily vote with
</I>&gt;<i> his/her feet, as they say.  Even better would be to remain in the
</I>&gt;<i> society we find ourselves in, to speak with one's fellows and work
</I>&gt;<i> together to solve the problems we confront.  Then one could truly say,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;This is my society.&quot;  - and, on looking around at the others and
</I>&gt;<i> recognizing that each is equally responsible, &quot;This is our society.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe that would be the fullest expression of political freedom.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is probably one of the reasons that the direct democracy in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Switserland is very differenciated between the canton's and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> working totally different compared to California who is probably the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> greatest (in numbers) &quot;direct democracy&quot; in the world. Comparing all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those &quot;democratic evolutions&quot; is very interesting (one of us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attended the &quot;2010 Global Forum on Modern Direct Democracy&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
you have to make a distinction between &quot;plebiscite&quot; who is a referendum on 
government  initiative and the citizens initiated &quot;initiatives and 
referendum&quot;. Plebiscites are prohibited in Switzerland.

&gt;<i> I have several questions.  I'm less familiar with plebiscite systems,
</I>&gt;<i> or referenda, or petitions, since we don't use them here.  I know they
</I>&gt;<i> are meant to provide a means to participate in a legislative process
</I>&gt;<i> that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.  So, for instance,
</I>&gt;<i> when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I have no effective
</I>&gt;<i> means of influencing its content, or amendments, or likelihood of
</I>&gt;<i> passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection of law makers
</I>&gt;<i> who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey the law if
</I>&gt;<i> they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to that law,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My questions concern the case of a plebiscite system:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. When a plebiscite is prepared and presented, what effective means
</I>&gt;<i>     do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i>     likelihood of passage?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
</I>&gt;<i>     case of ordinary legislation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3. How therefore does the plebiscite offer me an opportunity of
</I>&gt;<i>     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
</I>&gt;<i>     oppression?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
sorry, plebiscites don't belong to the tools of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.
