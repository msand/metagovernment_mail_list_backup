</I>&gt;<i> Thank you Paul, I'll have a look.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorry, plebiscites don't belong to the tools of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not at all, my mistake.  You were referring to direct democracy in
</I>&gt;<i> California and Switzerland so maybe the correct word is &quot;initiative&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> I restate my questions (I hope) in correct form:
</I>
The initiative is a law proposal on citizens initiative and the referendum 
is a submission to vote on a law that is proposed by the government.
About the &quot;50% majority&quot; , also this is no &quot;natural law&quot;. The Swiss 
developed the &quot;double majority&quot; system for federal referendum. (50 % of all 
swiss + 50% in half of the cantons, that way inserting some kind of 
geografic consent also)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not familiar with [initiative] systems, since we don't use them
</I>&gt;<i> here.  I know they are meant to provide a means to participate in a
</I>&gt;<i> legislative process that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.
</I>&gt;<i> So, for instance, when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I
</I>&gt;<i> have no effective means of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i> likelihood of passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection
</I>&gt;<i> of law makers who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey
</I>&gt;<i> the law if they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to
</I>&gt;<i> that law, but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My questions concern the case of an [initiative] system as it operates
</I>&gt;<i> in California, Switzerland and other direct democracies (as you say):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. When an [initiative] is prepared and presented, what effective
</I>&gt;<i>     means do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i>     likelihood of passage?
</I>
An itinitiative is prepared by a citizen, a group of citizens or an existing 
organisation. They can launch a call to help to prepare the initiative. The 
more help , debate and critisism while developing an initiative the more 
chanche that it will appeal to a great number of people and that most 
critics are already met.
That is why we hope to incorporate this developing stadium in our website 
system.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
</I>&gt;<i>     case of ordinary legislation?
</I>
It is a citizens initiative and the citizens decide how they develop the 
initiative. They have only to gain if they prepare it well with the broadest 
consensus possible because once launched it can't be altered anymore. 
Therfore surveys must give the proposal a great majority (70% for example) 
before it starts because opposition has to start yet. If you start with 70% 
without organised opposition it is maybe possible to get the 50% needed.
Ordinary legislation need only a very small majority to agree (some tens of 
people?)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  3. How therefore does the initiative offer me an opportunity of
</I>&gt;<i>     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
</I>&gt;<i>     oppression?
</I>
It is a continuous development to a more acceptable society. The question is 
&quot;what is better if I compare system A (representative democracy) with system 
B (direct democracy)&quot;. Is system B better, fine I accept it with the freedom 
of the possibility of developping a system C. Even that is only possible in 
system C in our case.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for replying.  Thanks also to Ed for starting this thread.  I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; hopeful we can recognize a common cause here, despite our differences
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in methodology.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Living in a community means acceptance of some rules. Call it a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;social contract&quot;. If democracy (in the real sence) starts in rather
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; small communities who are free to accept associations (right of free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; association), and also te right to leave them if they want (right of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; secession), there should be choice enough for most of us who are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; willing to pay the price of living in a community.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, that would be nearly ideal.  Competition would then do the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; work of ensuring that societies in general were respectful of freedoms
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and other human rights, since each individual could easily vote with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; his/her feet, as they say.  Even better would be to remain in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; society we find ourselves in, to speak with one's fellows and work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; together to solve the problems we confront.  Then one could truly say,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;This is my society.&quot;  - and, on looking around at the others and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; recognizing that each is equally responsible, &quot;This is our society.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that would be the fullest expression of political freedom.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is probably one of the reasons that the direct democracy in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Switserland is very differenciated between the canton's and is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; working totally different compared to California who is probably the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; greatest (in numbers) &quot;direct democracy&quot; in the world. Comparing all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; those &quot;democratic evolutions&quot; is very interesting (one of us
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; attended the &quot;2010 Global Forum on Modern Direct Democracy&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you have to make a distinction between &quot;plebiscite&quot; who is a referendum 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government  initiative and the citizens initiated &quot;initiatives and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> referendum&quot;. Plebiscites are prohibited in Switzerland.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I have several questions.  I'm less familiar with plebiscite systems,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or referenda, or petitions, since we don't use them here.  I know they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are meant to provide a means to participate in a legislative process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.  So, for instance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I have no effective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; means of influencing its content, or amendments, or likelihood of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection of law makers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey the law if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to that law,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  1. When a plebiscite is prepared and presented, what effective means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     oppression?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
