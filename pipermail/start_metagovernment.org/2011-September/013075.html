<PRE>Matteo, I think you misunderstood me.&#160; Maybe in your country the laws are simple and everyone understands them very easily, but often in the US and in California (where I live), the proposed laws and initiatives are often intentionally written to be complex - and even smart and well educated people often do not take the time to read the many pages of complicated legal language, or fully understand the implementation implications or alternatives. Therefore voters will often rely on the opinions they see in the media to make their judgements.&#160; But the opinion with the most exposure in the media is most likely to be the one which has the most funding behind it - and typically this is not the one that is best for the public. i.e. the tyranny of the majority which you mentioned earlier is often not intentional - it is more likely the 
result of media influence and the influence of monied special 
interests - i.e. it is in fact the tyranny of the elite, which only indirectly appears to be the tyranny of the majority, due to the influence of the elite over the majority.

And if you were to claim that a large majority of voters all take the time to fully understand all the issues and could not benefit from the help of better tools to make understanding the issues easier, you would only be fooling yourself. Again however, the media in your country is probably much less biased and more independent than the US media - so you may be missing the significance of my comments within the context of the US.&#160; Therefore, I think you are quite incorrect to imply that I think everyone is too stupid or that there is no point in having a system which makes it easier for people to understand those things.&#160; Voting should involve some research to educate yourself, regardless of how smart you may be, and if a collaborative governance system provided voting tools only - without providing other associated resources, the end result in many cases may be no better than it was with the previous system.

So to reiterate my view, I think in any case where the issues to be decided are complicated enough that a collaborative process is necessary in the first place, then in that case it should be explicitly clear that an underlying framework which makes it as easy as possible to document at a granular level, refine, discuss, etc. the issues at hand would be a major value add.

Thanks,
David

I maybe alluded to this in another thread but figured it might be good to restate, I think that most of the time when voters make a bad decision in how they vote, probably 90% of the time it is because they didn't fully understand the issues and the details of the proposal (or in the case of a candidate, the details of his/her platform and real intentions).?&#160;



-&gt; If you think that people are stupid enough not to understand the issues involved when proposed by a law, then there is no point to propose any system, in my opinion
