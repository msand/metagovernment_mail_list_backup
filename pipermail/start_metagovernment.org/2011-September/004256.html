<PRE>
&quot;The ballot initiatives 
in&#160;California&#160;(and other places) are routinely&#160;&#160;criticized, and justifiably so, in my 
opinion. First, they are forced &#160;on everyone with the power of 
law even if they get 50.001% of the&#160;vote.&quot;
-&gt;&#160; I&#160;do not think 
anything bad with forcing anyone to pass a law if they get 50.001% of the vote. 
The same happens if you elect a pPresident, he gets elected if he/she gets the 
50.001% of the vote. I see no problem on that.
&#160;
&quot;Second they are 
pre-written with one form of language and nobody can re-write them without 
making a completely separate proposal,&quot;
-&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; In this way the 
system becomes much more simple. Allowing people to re-write laws would require 
a loop of decisions that could and would make the system much more complicated 
and user-unfriendly. 
&#160;
&quot;but... third, they 
require tens or even hundreds of thousands of&#160;signatures to get onto the ballot. 
This means that only the most&#160;&#160;
popular and/or high-profile 
issues have a chance of getting voted on.&quot;
-&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; True, but when 
do you want to start from? It is clear that the system has to start to popular 
and/or high profile issues and then to move to low-profile systems. If you hope 
to create from scratch a system that works perfectly for all decisions, you are 
doomed to failure, I fear.&#160; 
&#160;
&quot;And since they are 
written by an organization that can afford the&#160;effort to get thousands of 
signatures, they usually are colored by theinterests of that 
organization.&quot;
-&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; Which is not 
exactly bad.&#160; GreenPeace, Save Bradley Manning, Medicines Sans Frontieres and 
Amnesty are examples of organizations that can use such 
system
&#160;
&quot;Politics in the U.S. are very combative 
these days, and&#160;any software which is less than rock-solid is going to get 
severely&#160;abused by malicious interests.&quot;
-&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a point to go for a 
simpler system. It much easier to make a simple system &quot;rock-solid&quot; than a 
complicated one&#160; 

&quot;Who would participate in the software that would tell me 
what to&#160;do? If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may violate 
the&#160;laws of the locality: ..&quot;
-&gt; You can set up a system with 
reciprocal recognition of user locality. I invite a friend as new user and I 
guarantee his location. Instant messaging on mobile phone also work this way. 
There are some technical methods to do that.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

&quot;If any of those above malicious 
interests play with the inputs or if anything else goes wrong, it can make a 
very bad name for our&#160;entire movement.&quot;
-&gt; Not necessarily. You can not hope to 
make everything fine and dandy from the start. There will be problems, problems 
will be addressed and solved. You can not hope not to have problems at 
all.
&#160;
&quot;What if I find that the website ends up 
having me&#160;support the legalization of rape and murder? That could be easily 
accomplished by people deliberately getting together to make me 
look&#160;bad.&quot;
-&gt; No, this will not be possible for 
the reason you stated above, as people will require to get tens of thousands of 
people sign a law allowing rape and murder and this will not happen
&#160;
&quot;Even if everything goes right, our 
movement could still get a bad&#160;reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid 
ideas (of which there are&#160;plenty in the U.S.). &quot;
-&gt; If you do not trust people to be 
able to write good laws, and you think they may vote for stupid law in mass, so 
you are against the very principle of direct democracy, in my opinion.&#160; Laws 
that look intelligent to you will look stupid to other people, and 
viceversa.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
&#160;
&quot;.. how do I draw the populace into 
that?&quot;
-&gt; You have to start from simple 
things: allow users to vote on known issues using intenet.&#160;
