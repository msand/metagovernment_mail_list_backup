I don't know what you mean by &quot;direct democracy system&quot;. There is of course no one &quot;direct democratic system&quot; because in all of them the details are decided by the people. And in half of the states of the US there is &quot;direct democracy&quot; (you probably only hear about California) and also in Switserland and Liechtenstein. Yes, california and Oregon and arizona and so on are no countries but I think they have more people living in it than Switserland. And there direct democracy is working. Most people living in those states and countries are not in favor of abolishing their system, may be  they want to improve it but that is an ongoing work, everywhere.

One of the things we experienced (at least Demoex) is that you have to be able to deliver something. It is of no use that you can present a law or vote for something or what ever if there is no means to adapt it. Therefore we chose the &quot;demoex&quot; system  who can deliver if it has some success.

  Subject: [MG] Votorola and Internet Democracy


        Just few words about Electronic Direct Democracy or Internet democracy (as I call it). 
        There are quite a lot of initiatives about direct democracy around the world, still the global movement for direct democracy (if we can call it so, since there is not official &quot;one&quot; movement) fails to pick up.
        Fails to pick up means that most of the current political decisions are still taken by the conventional political system and that in no country the direct democracy system is out there working.
        My idea about why this is happening is that big changes start from small things.  
        This is true especially in the realm of internet.
        Big successful sites like Facebook started as simple sites to exchange pictures among friends.
        Internet democracy needs to grow in the same way.
        We need to start looking at who needs this tool first, and help such people use the tool of internet democracy.  
        At first, I believe, Internet Democracy should start by targeting groups like GreenPeace, Sea Shepard down to the local group of people that want to protect their children from the pollution of the local power plant.
        When targeting such groups of people, it is possible to offer them a software that allows them to get connected together and create a joint document to be sent to the local mayor or senator.  
        This is where we should start from, I believe.
        The potential users are already out there.
        All the big things start from the small, and we can not think to immediately start a country or world government from the start.
        I believe we may need a simple tool to offer to people and invite them to use it for what they really need it. 
        If the system works out, then it would be easier to implement the system at wider and wider scale.
        I have received the mailing list of Votorola since few months ago now, and I believe that Votorola can potentially become a very powerful system.
        But my point is that the power of Votorola can be its main weakness. 
        I have tried to read the specs of Votorola under the chapter &quot;Theory&quot; quite a few times and I have to admit that I could not understand few main points of what is written there.
        I think Votorola is bound to be a very flexible system, but will it be simple enough to be used by the average user?
        Please believe that I am not willing to criticize the excellent work done by Mike Allen and Conseo so far (and Thomas), I believe you are excellent people and you are working hard to create a good tool that many people in the world need to use.
        But sometimes I wonder if people should not instead start to use a much simpler tool, without many functionalities, that just allows them to vote between three or four different proposals of law and send this proposal to the local mayor or senator.
