The overarching goal of metagov is well defined in the Mission and  
Vision:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
This project works to make collaborative governance a reality on any  
(and eventually every) scale. Projects such as a movie on the topic  
are directly aimed at that goal, as it is a persuasive and  
motivational tool. Projects such as Outcast are also directly in line  
with Metagov goals because it helps bring edem projects together.

Writing a charter would help better clarify this. I wish Thomas were  
able to contribute, as he has proven to be one of the best at this.  
Have you heard anything from him recently? I can start drafting a  
charter, but would rather he took a shot at it if he is available to  
do so.

For what it is worth, though much of it is now out of date, the  
original Metagov wesite was by-and-large written in the tone of a  
charter:
