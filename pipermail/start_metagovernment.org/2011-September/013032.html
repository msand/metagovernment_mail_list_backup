  Welcome, Paul!


  Metagovernment is also an umbrella, but primarily of tools (as opposed to parties) for direct democracy. It is also for any individuals interested in furthering the goal of citizen-lead governance.

  -first of all I think that we have to make clear what we mean by &quot;democracy&quot; in the first place. We are referring to &quot;democracy&quot; in the old Greek meaning of &quot;demos kratia&quot; or &quot;demos kratos&quot; meaning that the &quot;people decide&quot; or that the &quot;people has the power&quot;. &quot;Direct democracy&quot; means for us that the decisions are taken directly by the people (if wanted) and not by representatives. 


  My understanding (and please correct me if I am wrong) of Demoex and Democracy International is that both are focused on incorporating direct citizen involvement into existing systems of representative democracy. This is done by making the representatives accountable to decisions made by online tools (of which several our member projects are happy to provide). I think Demoex refers to this as Mixdemocracy.

  - Initially Demoex tryed to cooperate with the politicians of the representative parties but this did not succeeded. They were forced to compete (see our ppt  <A HREF="http://www.e2d-i.net/DEMOEX,%20a%20failure%20v15082011.ppt">http://www.e2d-i.net/DEMOEX,%20a%20failure%20v15082011.ppt</A> ) . In that sense the experiment (Demoex = short for &quot;democratic experiment&quot;) was a failure. Politicians will not share their power voluntary. But Demoex showed us, all over the world, that the representative system can be penetrated by a &quot;direct democratic&quot; initiative by his own tools, elections. Our aim is to elect representatives who's decisions are made by the citizens on a dedicated website (this is not always allowed by law but then we can use the &quot;party discipline&quot;). This is also another aspect of our aim, we are braking the monopoly of the government to let the people vote in a secure way. (for example the Helios &quot;end to end auditable voting system&quot;. <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/End_to_end_auditable_voting_system_%22Helios%22">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/End_to_end_auditable_voting_system_%22Helios%22</A>  



  What I and various others in this group are aiming for is the replacement of the representation system entirely, and a move toward a much more direct form of democracy. Some of our systems, such as Votorola, allow for representation by means of delegated voting, where one can delegate decision-making to another. But these delegations are always transient and at-will. That is, at any moment, anyone can remove their delegation and act directly on one's own behalf or delegate to someone else.


  I do very much like the idea of Mixdemocracy, but in the end I think it is going to run into a lot of problems because it still relies on the goodwill of the representatives and it still requires legislation to be run through the filter of a few individuals instead of opening it up to everyone all the time. Our conception of collaborative governance implies that citizens will undergo a transformation in how they view their responsibility to governance when they realize that they are truly in control of everything:
  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship</A>

  - E2D (demoex system) is only a step in the direction of &quot;direct democracy&quot;. It forces entry, we call it our trojan Horse. After that it is for the people to decide what way to go.


  Again, please feel free to correct any misconceptions I may have about DI or the general idea of Mixdemocracy. And regardless, I do think there are great opportunities for collaboration here. Our goals and ideals are the same, it is only our approaches which differ in some details. There are many opportunities for overlap, and it is probable that the more we work together, the more likely it is that we will all succeed.


  P.S. Wow. It looks like the Participedia article on Metagov has grown quite a lot since I last looked at it:
  <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment</A>
  However, it appears that many of our member projects (which are not subservient to Metagov at all, but merely voluntary collaborators in the umbrella) do not have pages there.
  - Participedia is an open wiki, everyone can contribute what he want. I am only keeping an eye on spam (together with some other members of Participedia), deleting it when I find it. The owners are changing platform but in the mean time it is open for spam so I have to do some work on it.

    Hi,

    may be I must tell you some more of myself.
    I am a collaborator of Participedia <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/</A> and therefore browsing the internet.
    Not only that but I am also looking for common ground between organisations in particular for those who have in their objectives some kind of involvement of the citizens in the broad terms of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.
    I myself am a member of &quot;democracy International&quot; <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democracy_International">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democracy_International</A> and E2<A HREF="Dhttp://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International">Dhttp://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International</A> on participedia and a local organisation for more <A HREF="democracyhttp://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democratie_nu">democracyhttp://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democratie_nu</A> in Belgium, where I live.
    E2D is a combination of &quot;referendum democracy&quot; and &quot;fluid democracy&quot; in the sense that initiatives are possible and direct voting or by representatives is also possible. We presenteted our project (politics without politicians) at the ENA conference  <A HREF="http://www.e2d-i.net/">http://www.e2d-i.net/</A>  and as a result we are invited at the ATTAC conference in Paris in oct 2011 . At this moment, and since 2002 only DEMOEX in Sweden has a succeeded to put it in practice and their experiences are for us at great value.
    My objective is to bring together as much organisations as possible with the same goal in a broad sense, decisive involvement of the citizens in what is their own community.

    Paul

        Hello,

        I am only a guest here ;-)
        Do you are talking about some form of &quot;Fluid Democracy&quot; ?

        Regards

        Paul

          Hello, Francis, and welcome!

            No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the  available options for political participation. I plan to set up a  collaborative drafting site, probably using Votorola, and to invite  people back home to participate (I live in California now, but I  still identify politically with Cleveland, Ohio). I see this process  as the 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a petition.  I would hope to crank out something simple, non-controversial, to  campaign to push through a local legislature. I haven't thought this  through past that, yet.


          I'd like to caution on the distinction between setting up something  that can work on one piece of legislation and something which can work  on all legislation.

          When people get focused into one issue, that issue tends to polarize  into camps and the issue tends to grow into something larger than it  really should be. California is a great example of how this can go  wrong, as you see referenda taking on the force of huge campaigns,  when their focus is really a tiny fraction of the important issues in  the state.

          The idea behind collaborative governance (at least as I see it) is to enable individuals to participate in every decision. That  fundamentally changes the nature of their participation. Because  instead of everyone getting emotional and frenzied about one simple  issue, people scatter into the issues that really matter to them. That  is, instead of millions of people raging at each other about whether  or not to tighten immigration, you may instead see a few hundred  people working on how farmers can better take in their crops without  promoting immigration problems while another few hundred might be  working on a way to make public healthcare for immigrants work for the  social good without being a direct contributor to increasing  immigration. (Just entirely made up examples, mind you.)

          Allowing people to contribute to one piece of legislation lets them  into the process, but only in that one little way. Those who actually  feel empowered by this access would probably be inclined to leverage  this little bit of power as much as they can, and the end legislation  may suffer from the results.

          So what I am suggesting is that you keep your expectations small in  terms of community. It is good that you are focusing on a local  legislature. I would suggest you go as micro-local as you can: such as  one department in one township, or even smaller to something like a  home owners' association. In such small communities, you then have the  opportunity to really open up all the decision-making, since the  overall number of decisions and issues are manageable in number. If  collaborative governance can prove itself in these small domains, it  can then begin scaling up as it gains acceptance and the tools mature.
