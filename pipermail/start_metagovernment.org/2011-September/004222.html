<PRE>Hello,

I've just found the metagovernment website yesterday( googling for exactly meta government).

I am happy to have found you guys and I hope we will be working together for a long time.

In the last few years I've purchased the webocrat domain names (.org, .eu, .ro, .tv, .tv and recently .com)

I'm also in the proces of registering the webocrat trademark in the European Union. The reason is to protect domain ownership as people who won't like what we are doing could register it and later claim ownership of the domain.

My intent is to protect it until we have a working management system that would allow me to trust it can't go into wrong hands or that it can be controlled by a small group of people.


Creating an international legal entity, as it was pointed out today, would be a great way to secure a set of rules among other benefits.
This would also allow access to funding.

The webocat.sk website (no connection with me) had a 1.8 million EUR grant from the EU. I'm not sure what the results were.
At the moment, Romania is not even applying for the EU funds that are available here. We're basically saying no to free money if you can believe that.
Writing a project and getting a few millions would be extremely doable for an international entity.
I can't and won't do it alone. If anyone is interested in this at this point let's discuss it further.

Reading the first page of metagovernment.org made me very happy. I can safely bet that we're the ones that are going to build and deliver the tools people so desperately need.

I know that at times it might look like the boulder is too big to push. But the people's desire is stronger. We just need to bridge the gap. We're basically building an online massive multiplayer game. And it helps to remember that in the end it's only a game.

I'm from Romania. The political situation here and my interest in collective counciousness pushed me to act on this matter. There are times when I see clearly I don't have a choice to do anything else or better said, that the choice has been made for me. And I love it !

This is my childhood dream. I never have thought that life would be so kind to me.

I was born in 1980. Started programming at 10 on a borrowed Romanian Z80 because we didn't have a cassete player to load games on it :)
That was 100% luck, right ? 
What kid in his right mind would willingly choose programming over games ? 
Turn it on. Blink. Blink. Hmmm. This looks like a nice toy :) It got to me.

In 1989 we just have had the revolution. 
I always knew something big, involving large amounts of people should happen. It wasn't this.

Communism was out, everyone was in the streets, hoping a better life will come. It did. It just didn't happen for everyone in the way they've expected it.
Some even regret communism when looking at  the capitalist dictatorship. 
Everyone had a home and a job. Both sucked probabbly. We had no external debts. We didn't care. 

People want to participate, they want their voices heard. They want to do more than just vote. This is what killed the communism and this is what will finally kill corrupt democracy.
In this light, communism was more honest. They said it. It's sad to see the worms of corruption eating up people's hopes and dreams. But finally they have their purpose, as they're pushing us to act and better ourselves.

I believe that essentially we're all the same being. That thinking we're separated is just an effect of the incomplete perception we currently have. And that in the following years, we, as a race, will start grasping more and more to our true identity. As soon as people will see the power of thousands brains acting together in solving real problems, they will jump on this side with open arms.

Until then, we have to make sure we do a great job at building the tools and communicating the concept to the people.

In Romania, this will go like a hot knife trough butter. We need it now. Today.
We can also find a lot of good programmers here and I'm hoping to build a small team soon. Funding would help and more important than money - your support.


On the technical side, my main concern was scalability, so I've searched for a solution and finally decided on Google App Engine.
I know that in theory it's better to have our own servers and not rely on a third party for this but let's face it: we're relying on Google everyday and the association can only benefit us.
Then, who has better experience in scalability than Google ? They're also commited to developing this great Engine that makes life much easier now. 

I've learned python and continued thinking and rethinking a system that would be extremely easy to use, free, open-sourced and that would allow true collective leadership.

There should be no body governing the content other than the users and we should find ways to make it economically feasible. Donations or whatever works to cover costs of running the servers.

Writing long emails is my weakness. And I also talk a lot when it comes to things I care about. 

I hope I haven't taken too much of your time and please let me know if I can be of any help with anything on your projects. 

The first app I would like to develop on webocrat is a virtual protest system.
On Google Maps. To actually have a copy of yourself in front of the government or at the mining site they're so desperately trying to open against all laws and final court decisions.
My size would be 9 pixels high at the maximum zoom level.

Visual feedback works great in all games. We need it to make the concept appealing.

Anyone using Google App Engine with python here ?

Thank you !

All my love and support !
Vlad
