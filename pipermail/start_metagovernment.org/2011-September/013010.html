Hello Matias,



This type of organisation (vereniging zonder winstoogmerk or &quot;not for
profit&quot;) exists not only in Belgium but the problem is that they have
legal differences in every country. This type of organisation is, in
my view, only important if large sums of money are involved or for
some other reason it may be safe to create a juridical entity apart
from the people who are working in it. Main purpose for such an
organisation type is that this legal entity can be held responsible on
his own in some cases without involving his members. Otherwise all
members are equally responsible for all decisions who are made, also
financially. Therefore it is important, here in Belgium, if you have a
&quot;free&quot; organisation that you give a good definition in the statutes
(this is a legal binding agreement between individuals) about what an
how a board can decide without the consent of his members. Without
that consent the board is acting on his personal responsibility
without compromising the members of the organisation. That way a
&quot;free&quot; organisation has to work, by definition, very democratically if
the statutes are made with the intend to leave decision powers with
the members. It is dangerous to work otherwise. This is proven every
day, politicians take the decisions without consulting the people, but
the citizens have to pay the bill and bear the consequences. We have
to avoid such a system in our organisations.

Apart from that I also think that a part of the members must have his
residence in Belgium in order to get the &quot;not for profit&quot; statute. But
it is a long time ago that I studied the law about this subject and I
am sure there were major changes in recent years. And we don't have a
legal advisor at hand for the moment.

Another possibility is to join an organisation that has already a
legal status like &quot;Democracy International&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.democracy-international.org/">http://www.democracy-international.org/</A> (DI) and who intend to work on
the same subjects. They just (refounded) their organisation
accordingly to German law in a &quot;not for profit&quot; and I am one of the
founding members. I don't know if the objectives are fully compatible
but if interested this can be subject of a joint study . In any way
this is the most easy way to get a &quot;legal&quot; status reasonably fast, if
you think this can serve you (objective is to start effectivly in
October this year). If , after a while, this organisation is not
performing in the sense that you want you can leave any time, but it
gives you the time to study alternatives and in the mean time you are
protected by the legal status.

With the organisation E2D
<A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International</A> ,of who I am a
member also, we are thinking about becoming a &quot;chapter&quot; of Democracy
International or just become members of DI and form within that
organisation a dedicated task force. We are planning to start that
negotiations with DI at the end of the year.



Kind Regards



Paul

Dear Paul,

I have your contact address since you wrote to Eudemocracia
(<A HREF="http://eudemocracia.org">http://eudemocracia.org</A>) presenting yourself and Democratie.nu.
(Briefly I remind you that Eudemocracia is an NGO based in Argentina
that promotes the open governance philosophy.)

Now I am writing you to ask you about a subject concerning
Metagovernment (<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>), an international hub of
projects like ours. At Metagovernment we would like to have a legal
status, so we are thinking in creating a non-profit, finding
particularly interesting a type of organization that seems to exist
only in Belgium called Internationale Vereniging Zonder Winstoogmerk.

Would you recommend this type of corporation? If it is suitable for us
and we gather the necessary resources for its foundation and
maintenance, is there a possibility for you to aid us? (For example,
getting us a lawyer to fill the papers...)

Warm Regards,
Mat&#237;as
