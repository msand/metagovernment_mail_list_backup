I call that tyranny of the majority. Having rule by 50%+1 of the  
voting populace is a great prescription for oppression of minorities.  
It is playing out here in the U.S. now with oppressive anti- 
immigration laws.

&gt;<i> &quot;Second they are pre-written with one form of language and nobody  
</I>&gt;<i> can re-write them without making a completely separate proposal,&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;    In this way the system becomes much more simple. Allowing  
</I>&gt;<i> people to re-write laws would require a loop of decisions that could

</I>
But forcing people to vote yes/no on a law that is written in such a  
way that they do not really support or oppose it is bad governance.  
Very frequently, people support the idea of a law but not the way it  
is worded. But they can only vote for it or against it. Making the  
system more complicated by allowing a continuous drafting process (as  
collaborative governance entails) may result in fewer laws getting  
passed. That's not necessarily a bad thing.

&gt;<i> &quot;but... third, they require tens or even hundreds of thousands of  
</I>&gt;<i> signatures to get onto the ballot. This means that only the most
</I>&gt;<i> popular and/or high-profile issues have a chance of getting voted on.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;    True, but when do you want to start from? It is clear that the  
</I>&gt;<i> system has to start to popular and/or high profile issues and then  
</I>&gt;<i> to move to low-profile systems. If you hope to create from scratch a  
</I>&gt;<i> system that works perfectly for all decisions, you are doomed to  
</I>&gt;<i> failure, I fear.
</I>
No, starting at the top and trying to work down is, I believe, doomed  
to failure. You said it yourself in another post: the peoper place to  
start is in very small communities.

&gt;<i> &quot;And since they are written by an organization that can afford the  
</I>&gt;<i> effort to get thousands of signatures, they usually are colored by  
</I>&gt;<i> theinterests of that organization.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;    Which is not exactly bad.  GreenPeace, Save Bradley Manning,  
</I>&gt;<i> Medicines Sans Frontieres and Amnesty are examples of organizations  
</I>&gt;<i> that can use such system
</I>
You assume these groups are necessarily good. Many people do not agree  
with you, particularly about Greenpeace. The people should be able to  
promote those interests themselves, not have to rely on organizations.  
There are a lot more monied organizations out there which do not have  
the good of all people at heart.
