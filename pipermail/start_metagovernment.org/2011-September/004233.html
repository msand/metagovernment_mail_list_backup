<PRE>I am a complete stranger to the concepts of collaborative governance.
I apologize if I ask here about some things that have already been
thoroughly discussed.

This morning, I started searching online for a wiki framework for
drafting legislation. I imagine an open-source, collaborative
alternative to what the American Legislative Exchange Council offers
to our lawmakers.

Layers of discussion pages could help make between-the-lines
reading/writing more accessible. Allowing multiple versions of
controversial sections, developed in parallel, might help to
illuminate (instead of obscure) sources of disagreement. These two
considerations probably barely scratch the surface of the challenges
involved.

The bottom line for me is that individually, most citizens are unable
to recognize or articulate their own interests in terms of actual
policy. Collectively, however, I believe the story can be different.

Am I barking up a good tree here? What are the projects out there that
I need to be aware of?

Thanks for any responses and also for what you all are doing for governance,
FR
