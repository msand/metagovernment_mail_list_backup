<PRE>Ciao Matteo

</I>I think the base on which metagovernment works is that there are multiple
possible positions. When you reduce a discussion into a yes and no vote,
then of course you generate a tyranny of the majority. A different situation
is when people are allowed to express their needs, co-draft the law, and
chose among several different versions of the same vote (for example with
approval voting). The result of this is still a majority and a minority. But
who is in the majority and who is in the minority is more fluid. And the
majority is generally much much wider than 50%+1. In such a system a person
will be working for several laws, it might happen that he disagrees with the
final decision in some of them, but in even more he agreed, and in all he
could voice his opinions, needs (which are more important) and suggestions.

Cheers,
