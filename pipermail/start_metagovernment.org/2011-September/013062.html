<PRE>I guess I'm thinking about building a similar thing, but i believe the
most important thing of the product to be the user interface.
There are such advanced software out there that could do everything i
can and cannot imagine, when it comes to the backend and how it
manages data and its verious forms.
The one thing that really matters for the people who use it, is the
user interface.
Its all they see and of course, they like performance and everything
to work smooth, but if the user interface is to complicated, they wont
use it.

I'm thinking about letting people interact or lets say communicate on
a very direct level. (Like a mindmap instead of collumns and rows)
You might know mindmap software/ You can use colors, pictures and so
much stuff to personalize it... you probably could define types and
map  yellow-ballons-with-ducks-on-it to a type u think might be best
described by that picture.
Now i'm thinking about excel and how you can define operations over
rows and columns ... what if you could define those on elements of
your personal mindmap?

Sure, because there is a data structure in the background, you could
still create plugins that use it to visualize it in different ways,
but the core visualzation lets you directly interact with your data
model... so everything your data  model is capable of has to be mapped
to a visual element representing it in an intuitive way.
Thats what &quot;visual analytics&quot; is all about...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A few random thoughts:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - I agree that collaborative governance has to start from the bottom up.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - c.g. has to be based on open source software,and must be provable as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mathematically correct, i.e. as simple as possible (see some of Alan
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Kay's recent work e.g.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/">http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/</A>), and inherently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bug-free.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The system must deal with sets of simple issues at a granular level,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> i.e. things that can be resolved to a single change in a process or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource allocation. &#160;These could be grouped into larger things but the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> granularity has to be there to allow the full extent of any proposal to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be completely clear, with references/sources provided, etc. &#160;That way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people can refine and comment on individual things as needed, but it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> won't turn into a huge blob of text and subjective interpretations.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software, which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes (resources,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people, groups, organizations) and dynamic relationships. &#160;In other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> words it has to model the real world. &#160;(Kind of like object-oriented
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> programming, but without the emphasis on programming, without the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> limitations of typical OO structures, and with an equal emphasis on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamic relationships between objects.) &#160;If a system does not accurately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> capture existing reality, most people will not be able to understand the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing reality, what changes or optimizations are therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriate, or what effects those changes would have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> web information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> construct and share any type of data structures and relations to model
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those kinds of things. &#160;It's probably many ~6 months away from being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> useful however.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi! I'm also has a lot of id&#233;as about how to model the world with all
</I>&gt;<i> the types of relations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm building <A HREF="http://gov.e2d.se/">http://gov.e2d.se/</A> on top of an application framework I
</I>&gt;<i> developed, inspired by RDF and the semantic web. It's uses a realy
</I>&gt;<i> powerful and flexible nodal network database.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's just a prototype. Lots of things to do. But it's built to be
</I>&gt;<i> actually useful for voting on internal issues in the Aktiv Demokrati
</I>&gt;<i> party. It includes condorcet priority voting, delegated voting and a
</I>&gt;<i> couple of other things. See example here:
