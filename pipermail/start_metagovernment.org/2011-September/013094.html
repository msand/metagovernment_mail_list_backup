have edited out the words of the other subscriber.

I used to admire your party spirit from a distance, but now I long for
what the party itself has.  The party has influence in the selection
of candidates; in the success or failure of their campaigns; and in
the drafting and passage of laws.  Yet I never heard it said that a
party has a right to these political freedoms that are denied to me.

If I were to exchange my independence for a party membership, then it
would gain me little.  The party would grant me a vote in the primary,
but the outcome of the primary would be unaffected by that vote.
 
&gt;<i> [influence not with vote, but time, money, discussions]
</I>
When I was a child, I was taught the importance of voting.  I was told
that a vote is a precious thing, because not all places in the world
have it.  I was told that my vote, and my neighbour's, and every
citizen's - rich or poor - would be equal.  Those were the important
things.  But now, having learned that my vote is meaningless, I wonder
if the promise of equality *in equal opportunity* is also meaningless.

&gt;<i> [ties and near ties do happen, in which single vote is decisive]
</I>
I fear I would not live long enough to see an election in which my
vote affected the outcome, or anything else in this world.  Yet every
day I am affected by the decisions of those in power, and every day I
must obey the laws.  I look around and I note that my fellow citizens
are in the same situation as I, each affected by administrative powers
and laws over which he (or she) has no comparable influence.  It was
not supposed to be this way.

&gt;<i> [other freedoms such as speech, press, assembly, competitive
</I>&gt;<i>  elections]
</I>
I value those freedoms and their sanctity, just as you say, and I also
respect the sacrifices of those who struggled for them.  But didn't
they also struggle for political freedom?  And now that political
freedom is denied, might not those other freedoms be denied, also?

&gt;<i> [affect power and laws by joining with others]
</I>
(The voter's resistance to joining with those others is a deliberate
strategy of the argument, I admit.  But I don't fully understand why
it seems to work so well.)

Mike
