<PRE>I dont have a specification. But i don't think its worth the effort of
creating one.
The intention of &quot;Simple-to-use-tools&quot; was to make the installation and
registration process easy, so someone who knows nothing about computers but
how to open a webbrowser, clicking on download links and installing a
program on a windows machine and maybe knows how to use gmail or outlook
could manage to host a server for his friends or his community.
Would be nice if he could also do it by only using an android phone.
...the best option would be to make every metagovernment-tool available in
such a way. What is a &quot;simple-to-use-tool&quot; when it comes to the actual
consensus process within a micro community is up to them. metagovernment
tools will compete and hopefully can be given by the micro communities
through services like &quot;uservoice.com&quot; and the like.

What i mean by this &quot;tool-builtin-broadcasting-updates-functionality &quot;, is a
mechanism like firefox offers it.
If i write a plugin for firefox, i could upload it to mozilla and i could
release new versions and firefox will inform users and autoupdate my
plugins.
There might be similar mechanisms in other browsers. Which platforms should
be supported? Which of the several options would be the best?
I think programers have to give there input on this, because they know
better of the options that exist and they could estimate the effort it would
take to use one or several of them.
It also might depend on the experience or if programers are familiar with
one of the mechanisms...

All i wanted to say is, it is a good thing to have an infrastructure that
could deploy metagovernment tools even if they are only in alpha or prealpha
phase, because if someone decides to download the installer, chooses a tool
and gets all the autoupdates through mechanisms like the one that is
supported through firefox and which lets you, as a programmer, autoupdate
your plugin on every system that has installed it. ...this would make it
possible for prealpha users to give feedback and what they like and what
they dont like.

It creates an option for people who are interested in metagovernment tools
to play around and grasp what the current state of the technology is...

We don't have to code everything on our own. I'm not into it, but APACHE
MAVEN comes to my mind when i hear of JAVA. I think a lot of code of at
least some of metagovernment infrastructure and tools is written in java,
but probably MAVEN supports other languages as well and probably MAVEN could
help to incorporate services, like the autoupdate or autodeploy of mozillas
firefox and in general MAVEN is a nice tool when it comes to deploying one's
code.

&gt;<i> @Alex
</I>&gt;<i> I have not clear what you are exactly talking about &quot;simple-to-use-tools &quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tool-builtin-broadcasting-updates-functionality &quot; it looks to me like a
</I>&gt;<i> very general idea about a tool, but do you have clear what this tool should
</I>&gt;<i> do and how it should work? If not, you should write down at least a
</I>&gt;<i> specification paper on how the functioanlity of the system should work.
</I>&gt;<i> If you do not have a specification paper to discuss what you want to do, it
</I>&gt;<i> is difficult to even talk about this topic.
</I>&gt;<i> I have represented my idea here: www.idemocrazia.it still I have not
</I>&gt;<i> prepared any specification paper, as I was looking if anything like what I
</I>&gt;<i> had in mind is already out there.
</I>&gt;<i> I think that, if you do not have a specification paper you can not do
</I>&gt;<i> anything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @Paul
</I>&gt;<i> In all the states of the US (including California and Oregon), all the main
</I>&gt;<i> decisions of politics are taken by the local government, that same of which
</I>&gt;<i> happens in Austria, Germany and Nepal.
</I>&gt;<i> I am not aware of any democracy tool via internet that is widely used by
</I>&gt;<i> the majority of the people of country or one state to promote democracy
</I>&gt;<i> by-passing the democracy system.
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think such system exists.
</I>&gt;<i> When you speak about &quot;delivering something&quot;, I am not sure what you mean.
</I>&gt;<i> Please be precise with your words, otherwise other people will not
</I>&gt;<i> understand what you are saying.
</I>&gt;<i> If you can deliver a proposal of law voted by 10000 people to the local
</I>&gt;<i> senator and you tell him that if he does not follow he will not be voted
</I>&gt;<i> anymore, this is already something that can be done.
</I>&gt;<i> Just look at this idea here:

</I>&gt;<i> @Francis
</I>&gt;<i> I may agree that the principles of Votorola may be simple, but this is not
</I>&gt;<i> the point, in my opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> The point is that most of the people need a software which is simple to use
</I>&gt;<i> and everybody can understand.
</I>&gt;<i> I have read many times the theory behind Votorola, I do not think I am a
</I>&gt;<i> stupid, but I have still to understand many points.
</I>&gt;<i> I am scared that it will end up with a very powerful software that many
</I>&gt;<i> people will not want to learn as it is too complicated to use.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, I have the impression that much much time and effort is spent to make
</I>&gt;<i> the software with any functionalities, when people instead may want a simple
</I>&gt;<i> softare to be used right now.
</I>&gt;<i> Also, there are already many people working on complex systems, and they
</I>&gt;<i> are many years in the working and never get completed.
</I>&gt;<i> I have the fear that the same may happen to Votorola, already in
</I>&gt;<i> development phase since much time ago.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the revolution will instead come from a simpler, Facebook-style,
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy software that just allows people to write a proposal of law
</I>&gt;<i> and ask other people to vote it.
</I>&gt;<i> As you can see from the link here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/2011/09/scaricare_ogni/index.html,">http://www.beppegrillo.it/2011/09/scaricare_ogni/index.html,</A> what we need
</I>&gt;<i> is just maybe a software that allows to click on a proposal of law. Simple
</I>&gt;<i> like that.
