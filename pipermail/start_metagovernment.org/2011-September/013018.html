Thanks for suggesting this, Ed.  It might not meet the technical
requirements, but maybe we can strengthen it.  The group, or effort,
or organization (whatever the form) would be more attractive if its:

  1. Goal is clear and transparent.

  2. Existing resources are applied vigorously in pursuit of the goal.

  3. New resources (people, money) are sought on the basis of past
     accomplishments in respect of the goal.

I would especially emphasize the first two.  The script you floated
last month had its heart in the right place (I liked it) but it lacked
clarity and force.  In the plainest of terms, what is the goal?

Anyone?
