<PRE>Hi Matteo,

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Tool development needs the help of (1) ..&quot;-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have to be very sincere on this. I did not understand much of what
</I>&gt;<i> you are saying. Who are the &quot;activist users&quot; you are talking here?
</I>&gt;<i> Do you know many of them? What are the &quot;political projects&quot; in
</I>&gt;<i> practice?
</I>
You refer to the GUEPO plan:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004272.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004272.html</A>

The activist users are the users for whom the crossforum extension and
vote mirroring tools (3, 4) are designed.  They are political
campaigners with an adventurous streak, mostly end candidates and
delegates, who cut across the turf of competing technical and
political projects in their endeavours to attract (and liberate) the
captive voters.  These activist users do not exist as of yet, because
they lack the necessary tools for this kind of activism.

Political projects (2) include Metagov here, Paul Nollen's E2D
International, and Jonas Liljegren's Aktiv Demokrati - to mention a
few that have been discussed in recent threads.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I get the impression you guys want lots of users, but we can't do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  anything with lots of users yet. &quot;-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And when do you expect to get this high number of users? How many
</I>&gt;<i> users are currently using Votorola after so many months of
</I>&gt;<i> development? How many users are understanding in detail how Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> works? 2? 3? 5? 10? In the mean time, a simple post on a blog has
</I>&gt;<i> drawn more than 50000 (!)  users to vote on a simple list of yes/no
</I>&gt;<i> questions. Link: <A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html">http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html</A>
</I>
A misunderstanding (sorry).  We do not want lots of users at this
time.  We want only (1) a few core alpha users, and/or (2) a few core
projects, and we want them working with each other.  The RAC tools (3,
4) would bring them, I think.

However, I'm now thinking that an essay about the broken electoral
system and its consequent effects in society might be a better way to
bring the necessary users or projects together.  To be sure, we'd
still need the RAC tools ASAP, but I think the essay would provide a
faster and more effective impetus to working together, and it might
bring other needed resources as well.  By &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, I mean all
e-democracy projects that aren't closed to some degree of
technical/political cooperation among projects.

Pointing to the broken electoral system (dumb machine) might help us
in other ways.  Society overall is a complex and adaptive system.  A
break in one crucial part can easily cause symptoms of failure to
appear here, there and everywhere.  These symptoms are difficult to
trace, of course, so people are apt to point in the wrong places, or
at each other, or society, or even at human nature.  It might help us
to know that it was never anything more than a technical failure.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;But it won't work that way, because that's not possible in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this strange domain we're working in.&quot;-&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What are you actually talking about when you say &quot;it won' t work
</I>&gt;<i> that way&quot; and, if you are talking about a more direct approach to
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy as I was talking about before, why are you so sure
</I>&gt;<i> it will not work (please read the more than 50000 replies above)?
</I>
I was talking about the preceding sentence, which you did not include
in the quote.  It referred to the strategy of a project &quot;putting all
its energy into getting users (or members) in the hopes of attaining a
critical mass and assuring itself of success.&quot;  I'm saying there are
no grounds for such a hope, because no stable monopoly nor monopoly
sustaining network effects (nor therefore critical mass) can exist at
the core of a democracy of free individuals.  It's not possible.

&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;If we had (1) a few core alpha users, then we could get busy with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.  We already have the tools for it, &gt; all we'd need is to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make them more usable.  We like that kind of &gt; work more than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything, so we're not trying to avoid it.   And &gt; users will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bring developers&quot;-&gt;
</I>
&gt;<i> My feeling is that most users (and I mean, 99% of them) will not
</I>&gt;<i> understand and will not use a system that requires co-drafting of
</I>&gt;<i> laws (see my reply to Pietro below)
</I>
Drafting should not be required of anyone.  Your guess of 1% drafters
might easily be accurate, but the other 99% would not thereby be
excluded from participation.  If all they did was to vote and join in
discussions, then that would be sufficient.  They would gain roughly
99% influence over the drafted content.  All they would lose is the
ability to express themselves with the utmost of precision by drafting
exactly what they wished to see and offering, &quot;Please do it thus, or
you will lose my vote.&quot;

&gt;<i> ...  95%,99% of the people are lazy and can only be involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> voting if the whole process is super-easy, does not involve any
</I>&gt;<i> drafting, involves reading one or two pages and it is about a topic
</I>&gt;<i> they are interested enough in.
</I>
Maybe the laziness you witness is yet another symptom of the broken
electoral system.  Maybe it is apathy.  It is hard to care deeply
about politics when one lacks the freedom to participate.  With
freedom restored, apathy is likely to vanish.  People like to talk,
especially when they see others talking, and no talk is more enjoyable
than political talk, *provided* one is free to participate.  Prior to
the collapse of the electoral system about 150 years ago, in the
period 1770 to 1870, when at least a minority of people could
participate (no slaves, very few poor, often no women), the #1 topic
was politics.  It was the most exciting period of history since
classical times.  Today we live in the world those people created,
which is the modern world.

What I mean to suggest is that people, lazy or otherwise, are not
likely to be indifferent to the changes occuring around them, changes
of their own making.
