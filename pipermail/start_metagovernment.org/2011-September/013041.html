<PRE>There are many messages on this list I would like to reply to, but at  
this time, I have to focus on the thread about Mixdemocracy. To sum up  
various peoples' statements:

On Sep 19, 2011, at 1:59 AM, Paul Nollen wrote:

I understand this idea, and I also understand that referenda and  
ballot initiatives count as forms of direct democracy. But I see a  
possibility for harm in trying to promote mixdemocracy as a step in  
the right direction, toward real and universal citizen control of  
governance. I have thought about running for office under such a  
platform, and I can't make it work in my mind. If you can help change  
my mind, I may be willing to run in some 2012 election in the U.S.

The ballot initiatives in California (and other places) are routinely  
criticized, and justifiably so, in my opinion. First, they are forced  
on everyone with the power of law even if they get 50.001% of the  
vote. Second they are pre-written with one form of language and nobody  
can re-write them without making a completely separate proposal,  
but... third, they require tens or even hundreds of thousands of  
signatures to get onto the ballot. This means that only the most  
popular and/or high-profile issues have a chance of getting voted on.  
And since they are written by an organization that can afford the  
effort to get thousands of signatures, they usually are colored by the  
interests of that organization.

I have similar but different fears about mixdemocracy (and again, I  
hope you all will take this as I mean it, which is constructive and  
hoping that you can prove me wrong). When I think about what it would  
be like for me to run under such a platform, these are the sorts of  
questions that stop me:

1. What software could I use? Is there anything that is really ready  
for primetime? Politics in the U.S. are very combative these days, and  
any software which is less than rock-solid is going to get severely  
abused by malicious interests.

2. Who would participate in the software that would tell me what to  
do? If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may violate the  
laws of the locality: or at least very much aggravate the local  
people, since everything else about the status quo is set up with  
rigid jurisdictional systems (unlike collaborative governance, which  
is much more fluid). If I restrict it to just people in the locality  
that I represent, then, well... what software can support that  
restriction today?

3. If any of those above malicious interests play with the inputs or  
if anything else goes wrong, it can make a very bad name for our  
entire movement. What if I find that the website ends up having me  
support the legalization of rape and murder? That could be easily  
accomplished by people deliberately getting together to make me look  
bad. What is to stop that? Or what if the software just doesn't work  
right: then what am I supposed to do in the legislature (or whatever  
body I am in)? Just abstain until a new version of the software comes  
out? How would that look?

4. Even if everything goes right, our movement could still get a bad  
reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid ideas (of which there are  
plenty in the U.S.). Collaborative governance works on the principle  
that consensus decision-making only allows the best decisions to pass.  
But in a less complex system, what is there besides majority rule?  
Super-majority rule? That's still nothing like real consensus-through- 
synthesis.

5. Technically, how does it work in something like a city council.  
There is usually a docket of topics for a city council, so if I were a  
council member, I could ask the website what people want me to vote on  
those. But how do I vote when someone raises a new issue within a  
council meeting? Or a motion? Do I always have to abstain until I  
consult the website? What about committees? Can I participate in a  
committee? Those do a lot of their work without making any votes, and  
then vote at the end: how do I draw the populace into that?

To me, direct democracy and representative democracy are enormously  
different. I have yet to be convinced of how or why they should be  
forced together in some weird hybrid when we have a means to start  
implementing collaborative governance as a ground-up replacement.
