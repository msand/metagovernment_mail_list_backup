<PRE>Hi,

 

may be I must tell you some more of myself.

I am a collaborator of Participedia <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/</A> and therefore browsing the internet.

Not only that but I am also looking for common ground between organisations in particular for those who have in their objectives some kind of involvement of the citizens in the broad terms of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.

I myself am a member of &quot;democracy International&quot; <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democracy_International">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democracy_International</A> and E2D <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/E2D_International</A> on participedia and a local organisation for more democracy <A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democratie_nu">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Democratie_nu</A> in Belgium, where I live.

E2D is a combination of &quot;referendum democracy&quot; and &quot;fluid democracy&quot; in the sense that initiatives are possible and direct voting or by representatives is also possible. We presenteted our project (politics without politicians) at the ENA conference  <A HREF="http://www.e2d-i.net/">http://www.e2d-i.net/</A>  and as a result we are invited at the ATTAC conference in Paris in oct 2011 . At this moment, and since 2002 only DEMOEX in Sweden has a succeeded to put it in practice and their experiences are for us at great value.

My objective is to bring together as much organisations as possible with the same goal in a broad sense, decisive involvement of the citizens in what is their own community. 

 

Paul

    Hello,

    I am only a guest here ;-)
    Do you are talking about some form of &quot;Fluid Democracy&quot; ?

    Regards

    Paul

      Hello, Francis, and welcome!

      On Sep 16, 2011, at 2:45 PM, Francis Regan wrote:


        No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the  available options for political participation. I plan to set up a  collaborative drafting site, probably using Votorola, and to invite  people back home to participate (I live in California now, but I  still identify politically with Cleveland, Ohio). I see this process  as the 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a petition.  I would hope to crank out something simple, non-controversial, to  campaign to push through a local legislature. I haven't thought this  through past that, yet.


      I'd like to caution on the distinction between setting up something  that can work on one piece of legislation and something which can work  on all legislation.

      When people get focused into one issue, that issue tends to polarize  into camps and the issue tends to grow into something larger than it  really should be. California is a great example of how this can go  wrong, as you see referenda taking on the force of huge campaigns,  when their focus is really a tiny fraction of the important issues in  the state.

      The idea behind collaborative governance (at least as I see it) is to enable individuals to participate in every decision. That  fundamentally changes the nature of their participation. Because  instead of everyone getting emotional and frenzied about one simple  issue, people scatter into the issues that really matter to them. That  is, instead of millions of people raging at each other about whether  or not to tighten immigration, you may instead see a few hundred  people working on how farmers can better take in their crops without  promoting immigration problems while another few hundred might be  working on a way to make public healthcare for immigrants work for the  social good without being a direct contributor to increasing  immigration. (Just entirely made up examples, mind you.)

      Allowing people to contribute to one piece of legislation lets them  into the process, but only in that one little way. Those who actually  feel empowered by this access would probably be inclined to leverage  this little bit of power as much as they can, and the end legislation  may suffer from the results.

      So what I am suggesting is that you keep your expectations small in  terms of community. It is good that you are focusing on a local  legislature. I would suggest you go as micro-local as you can: such as  one department in one township, or even smaller to something like a  home owners' association. In such small communities, you then have the  opportunity to really open up all the decision-making, since the  overall number of decisions and issues are manageable in number. If  collaborative governance can prove itself in these small domains, it  can then begin scaling up as it gains acceptance and the tools mature.
