Hi Mike
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Tool development needs the help of (1) ..&quot;-&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have to be very sincere on this. I did not understand much of what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you are saying. Who are the &quot;activist users&quot; you are talking here?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you know many of them? What are the &quot;political projects&quot; in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> practice?
</I>
&gt;<i>You refer to the GUEPO plan:&gt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004272.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/004272.html</A>
</I>
&gt;<i>The activist users are the users for whom the crossforum extension and
</I>&gt;<i>vote mirroring tools (3, 4) are designed.&#160; They are political
</I>&gt;<i>campaigners with an adventurous streak, mostly end candidates and
</I>&gt;<i>delegates, who cut across the turf of competing technical and
</I>&gt;<i>political projects in their endeavours to attract (and liberate) the
</I>&gt;<i>captive voters.&#160; These activist users do not exist as of yet, because
</I>&gt;<i>they lack the necessary tools for this kind of activism.
</I>&gt;<i>Political projects (2) include Metagov here, Paul Nollen's E2D
</I>&gt;<i>International, and Jonas Liljegren's Aktiv Demokrati - to mention a
</I>&gt;<i>few that have been discussed in recent threads.
</I>Good if we can involve more and more people in the project, I am not sure if all the people from E2D International and Aktiv Democrati have understood more than I do and are ready to use Votorola soon. But in any case I am very happy that things are moving forward!(by the way, I am have introduced Votorola to the people of Agora 2.0)
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;I get the impression you guys want lots of users, but we can't do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&#160; anything with lots of users yet. &quot;-&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And when do you expect to get this high number of users? How many
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> users are currently using Votorola after so many months of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development? How many users are understanding in detail how Votorola
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> works? 2? 3? 5? 10? In the mean time, a simple post on a blog has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drawn more than 50000 (!)&#160; users to vote on a simple list of yes/no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> questions. Link:&#160;<A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html">http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html</A>
</I>
&gt;<i>A misunderstanding (sorry).&#160; We do not want lots of users at this
</I>&gt;<i>time.&#160; We want only (1) a few core alpha users, and/or (2) a few core
</I>&gt;<i>projects, and we want them working with each other.&#160; The RAC tools (3,
</I>&gt;<i>4) would bring them, I think.
</I>&gt;<i>However, I'm now thinking that an essay about the broken electoral
</I>&gt;<i>system and its consequent effects in society might be a better way to
</I>&gt;<i>bring the necessary users or projects together.&#160; To be sure, we'd
</I>&gt;<i>still need the RAC tools ASAP, but I think the essay would provide a
</I>&gt;<i>faster and more effective impetus to working together, and it might
</I>&gt;<i>bring other needed resources as well.&#160; By &quot;we&quot; and &quot;us&quot;, I mean all
</I>&gt;<i>e-democracy projects that aren't closed to some degree of
</I>&gt;<i>technical/political cooperation among projects.
</I>&gt;<i>Pointing to the broken electoral system (dumb machine) might help us
</I>&gt;<i>in other ways.&#160; Society overall is a complex and adaptive system.&#160; A
</I>&gt;<i>break in one crucial part can easily cause symptoms of failure to
</I>&gt;<i>appear here, there and everywhere.&#160; These symptoms are difficult to
</I>&gt;<i>trace, of course, so people are apt to point in the wrong places, or
</I>&gt;<i>at each other, or society, or even at human nature.&#160; It might help us
</I>&gt;<i>to know that it was never anything more than a technical failure.
</I>Frankly speaking, the reason of my comment is that I have the impression (but maybe it is only MY problem) that Votorola is evolving into a system quite difficult to understand and use for the final user. But maybe this is just a wrong impression from me and I am still the only one with this impression here.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;But it won't work that way, because that's not possible in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; this strange domain we're working in.&quot;-&gt;
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> What are you actually talking about when you say &quot;it won' t work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that way&quot; and, if you are talking about a more direct approach to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democracy as I was talking about before, why are you so sure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will not work (please read the more than 50000 replies above)?
</I>
&gt;<i>I was talking about the preceding sentence, which you did not include
</I>&gt;<i>in the quote.&#160; It referred to the strategy of a project &quot;putting all
</I>&gt;<i>its energy into getting users (or members) in the hopes of attaining a
</I>&gt;<i>critical mass and assuring itself of success.&quot;&#160; I'm saying there are
</I>&gt;<i>no grounds for such a hope, because no stable monopoly nor monopoly
</I>&gt;<i>sustaining network effects (nor therefore critical mass) can exist at
</I>&gt;<i>the core of a democracy of free individuals.&#160; It's not possible.
</I>I am not saying that the only strategy should be &quot;getting as many users as possible&quot;.I am saying that I am seeing two roads to get this system to work:a) &#160; &#160; the strategy of Votorola of giving power to the users to amend and edit lawsb) &#160; &#160; the strategy of Beppe Grillo of not giving such power to usersA simpler system of the b) kind would allow a small group of users (3, 5, 10, 20 people) to discuss internally some laws and look for support for their proposals and, when they reach a minimum number of supporters for their law, allow such proposal of law to be voted without allowing further amendments(there may be 2, 3, 4, 10 different proposals of law for the same issue to be voted in two-step votings, after the first step the 2 proposals which get the more number of votes on first step).I am unsure which approach a) or b) is better.
&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;If we had (1) a few core alpha users, then we could get busy with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that.&#160; We already have the tools for it, &gt; all we'd need is to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; make them more usable.&#160; We like that kind of &gt; work more than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; anything, so we're not trying to avoid it.&#160;&#160;&#160;And &gt; users will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; bring developers&quot;-&gt;
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i> My feeling is that most users (and I mean, 99% of them) will not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> understand and will not use a system that requires co-drafting of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> laws (see my reply to Pietro below)
</I>
&gt;<i>Drafting should not be required of anyone.&#160; Your guess of 1% drafters
</I>&gt;<i>might easily be accurate, but the other 99% would not thereby be
</I>&gt;<i>excluded from participation.&#160; If all they did was to vote and join in
</I>&gt;<i>discussions, then that would be sufficient.&#160; They would gain roughly
</I>&gt;<i>99% influence over the drafted content.&#160; All they would lose is the
</I>&gt;<i>ability to express themselves with the utmost of precision by drafting
</I>&gt;<i>exactly what they wished to see and offering, &quot;Please do it thus, or
</I>&gt;<i>you will lose my vote.&quot;
</I>If only 1% of the people will participate in drafting, what would prevent Microsoft from paying 10000 drafters and draft a law that says that the only OS to be legally sold in the US is Windows?If instead you are saying that 1% people will actually propose the drafts but 99% will still participate in supporting one or the other draft, this mean that 99% of the other people will have to understand how the system works, study it and use it in a good way.I think most of the people will not have the time to do so, but maybe I am wrong.This is the central point of my perplexities about Votorola
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ...&#160; 95%,99% of the people are lazy and can only be involved in the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> voting if the whole process is super-easy, does not involve any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> drafting, involves reading one or two pages and it is about a topic
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> they are interested enough in.
</I>
&gt;&gt;<i>Maybe the laziness you witness is yet another symptom of the broken
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>electoral system.&#160; Maybe it is apathy.&#160; It is hard to care deeply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>about politics when one lacks the freedom to participate.&#160; With
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>freedom restored, apathy is likely to vanish.&#160; People like to talk,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>especially when they see others talking, and no talk is more enjoyable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>than political talk, *provided* one is free to participate.&#160; Prior to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>the collapse of the electoral system about 150 years ago, in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>period 1770 to 1870, when at least a minority of people could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>participate (no slaves, very few poor, often no women), the #1 topic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>was politics.&#160; It was the most exciting period of history since
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>classical times.&#160; Today we live in the world those people created,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>which is the modern world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>What I mean to suggest is that people, lazy or otherwise, are not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>likely to be indifferent to the changes occuring around them, changes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>of their own making.
</I>This is a good hopeful thought and I really hope that many people will wake up and use one system or the other.Just looking at what happens around, with maybe 0.00001% of the people of the world currently interested in actively participate in projects of direct democracy, I still think we have a looooong way to go before we involve at least 1% of the masses.But I agree with you that we should work in this direction!
