<PRE>Michael and conseo: I requested you cross-post this because I am still  
hopeful that others on the metagov list will be interested in helping  
you out. The problem is that Votorola is still pretty developer- 
oriented and I am not sure that the average person approaching it can  
find a way to offer you assistance (in terms of users or reaching  
out). Is there a way that can be done, and if so, could you detail it?  
Or do we need Thomas for that. :)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chat client this applies to it as well, as I guess that it supports

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Myself, I use <A HREF="http://www.postfix.org/local.8.html">http://www.postfix.org/local.8.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since this is a prerequisite for my planned usage and tests with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools I think it would be best to help you with anything being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> necessary to make the resource management work as quickly as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible. I dive in today and you might point me to a part I could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> take care of. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far, I've identified two parts.  You're welcome to take either of
</I>&gt;<i> these, or to suggest something else.  I can provide more details if
</I>&gt;<i> you're interested:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  1. Resources track stack.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It sits just under the toolbar, either in the votespace map or in
</I>&gt;<i>     embedded views: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox">http://zelea.com/y/vw/xf/#c=DV&amp;s=G!p!sandbox</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Its purpose is described here: (Resources slice stack)
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-June/004075.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-June/004075.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     That actually describes the tracks (formerly &quot;slices&quot;) for
</I>&gt;<i>     crossforum extent.  But you'd just code the track stack itself,
</I>&gt;<i>     which is an empty container, plus the component tracks for vote
</I>&gt;<i>     and quantitative summation accounts.  Other developers would add
</I>&gt;<i>     their own tracks later, as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  2. Client cache of server requests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Its purpose is to prevent redundant requests from hitting the
</I>&gt;<i>     server, especially from separate browser windows that display
</I>&gt;<i>     similar views.  We'll use the HTML 5 client store to cache server
</I>&gt;<i>     requests for the life of the session.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The need is not specific to resources, but it comes up now
</I>&gt;<i>     because the embedded view in the difference bridge is going to be
</I>&gt;<i>     hitting the server, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My own rationale (briefly) for working on this stuff is: (a) we need
</I>&gt;<i> users, which for us means voters; (b) the people to get voters are
</I>&gt;<i> politicians broadly speaking, or candidates; (c) the places to find
</I>&gt;<i> voters are vote-servers and discussion forums; (d) the extent of a
</I>&gt;<i> vote-getting campaign across multiple servers and forums is therefore
</I>&gt;<i> a useful resource for the participants; (e) tools are needed therefore
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;cultivate and harvest&quot; cross-server and crossforum extent.  So I'm
</I>&gt;<i> making a beeline for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My development strategy has been to start at the two ends of the I/O
</I>&gt;<i> pipe: the input end in the pollwiki where the resource information is
</I>&gt;<i> entered by the users; and the output end in crossforum theatre where
</I>&gt;<i> it is viewed.  The middle bits, which mostly involve the count engine,
</I>&gt;<i> will be coded last.  Meantime the server spits out simulated data for
</I>&gt;<i> testing of the theatre UI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... Btw. do you have a method to mirror resources? It would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really handy to mirror stuff like <A HREF="http://www.kickstarter.com/">http://www.kickstarter.com/</A> as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> raising then happens in forums. Anyway you have something similiar
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the crossforum extent in mind, so I think we share a common
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interest here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I haven't pursued the idea.  Till I see a few alpha users, I'm
</I>&gt;<i> focusing mostly on candidates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You already have pointed parts out to me, so maybe we can skype
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> around 18:00 GMT today to figure it out more closely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You have also talked about bringing the resource view to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> difference bridge, which is interesting, since we might want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> visualize the difference here differently, not in the semantic wiki
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> markup style.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm coding that now.  It's exactly the same difference bridge as
</I>&gt;<i> before (Wicket), but with a resources view embedded at top (GWT).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have talked on #opensourceecology btw. and they have told me to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> write a proposal about using our software on their Wiki. I can write
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it up and draft it together with you if you like. Can we use a draft
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointer to a text in any MediaWiki atm. or do they have to support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, all they require is a recent version of MW with the write API
</I>&gt;<i> enabled.  It's enabled by default.  But I wouldn't put serious time
</I>&gt;<i> into it unless they had an immediate need we could fill.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have fixed the outstanding glitches in the diff feed. The rest of  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the night
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have thought about my interests and how to best continue on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional to the diff feed. My development setup runs here:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://whiletaker.homeip.net:8080/voff/xf/#c=DDum">http://whiletaker.homeip.net:8080/voff/xf/#c=DDum</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. DiffFeed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you use procmail? We could use it to setup the scraper instead  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of cron for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the mailing list. Since you use irssi to log and run your chat

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Further involvement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to use our software. As I have joined this project for  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reasons mainly, I am interested to use the tools to bridge forums  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and bring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discussion together. Especially now that I have seen the diff- 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patching in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> action. But to make it interesting I need the resource management  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stuff
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> roughly working. I can then setup account types and draft positions  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organisations or forums and start posting there about common plans  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and ways to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organize available resources. So I'd like to become an activist  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> myself a bit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This will also give me a clearer understanding on the further  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the difference feed, I hope.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since this is a prerequisite for my planned usage and tests with  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tools I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think it would be best to help you with anything being necessary to  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resource management work as quickly as possible. I dive in today  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and you might
