<PRE>Hi Ed,

for starters nobody is telling that &quot;direct democracy&quot; (initiative and 
referendum)  is a perfect system. But in my opinion it has proven to be 
better than representative democracy. But it needs to be worked on. Direct 
democracy in a state like California (some 30 milion people) is not 
comparable with direct Democracy in switserland (some 8 milion people) that 
is furthemore divided in very autonomous canton's. Even between those 
cantons there is a &quot;cultural&quot; difference with French speaking canton's more 
relying on Representative democracy then German speaking kantons who are 
very much deciding themselves with direct demiocracy. Altough all Swiss 
people could have the same system if they wanted. I isn't.

The rest in between

Paul

&gt;<i> There are many messages on this list I would like to reply to, but at 
</I>&gt;<i> this time, I have to focus on the thread about Mixdemocracy. To sum up 
</I>&gt;<i> various peoples' statements:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is for the people to decide what way to go.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I understand this idea, and I also understand that referenda and  ballot 
</I>&gt;<i> initiatives count as forms of direct democracy. But I see a  possibility 
</I>&gt;<i> for harm in trying to promote mixdemocracy as a step in  the right 
</I>&gt;<i> direction, toward real and universal citizen control of  governance. I 
</I>&gt;<i> have thought about running for office under such a  platform, and I can't 
</I>&gt;<i> make it work in my mind. If you can help change  my mind, I may be willing 
</I>&gt;<i> to run in some 2012 election in the U.S.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I can't say anything about the US situation.


&gt;<i> The ballot initiatives in California (and other places) are routinely 
</I>&gt;<i> criticized, and justifiably so, in my opinion. First, they are forced  on 
</I>&gt;<i> everyone with the power of law even if they get 50.001% of the  vote. 
</I>&gt;<i> Second they are pre-written with one form of language and nobody  can 
</I>&gt;<i> re-write them without making a completely separate proposal,  but... 
</I>&gt;<i> third, they require tens or even hundreds of thousands of  signatures to 
</I>&gt;<i> get onto the ballot. This means that only the most  popular and/or 
</I>&gt;<i> high-profile issues have a chance of getting voted on.  And since they are 
</I>&gt;<i> written by an organization that can afford the  effort to get thousands of 
</I>&gt;<i> signatures, they usually are colored by the  interests of that 
</I>&gt;<i> organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have similar but different fears about mixdemocracy (and again, I  hope 
</I>&gt;<i> you all will take this as I mean it, which is constructive and  hoping 
</I>&gt;<i> that you can prove me wrong). When I think about what it would  be like 
</I>&gt;<i> for me to run under such a platform, these are the sorts of  questions 
</I>&gt;<i> that stop me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. What software could I use? Is there anything that is really ready  for 
</I>&gt;<i> primetime? Politics in the U.S. are very combative these days, and  any 
</I>&gt;<i> software which is less than rock-solid is going to get severely  abused by 
</I>&gt;<i> malicious interests.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Who would participate in the software that would tell me what to  do? 
</I>&gt;<i> If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may violate the  laws of 
</I>&gt;<i> the locality: or at least very much aggravate the local  people, since 
</I>&gt;<i> everything else about the status quo is set up with  rigid jurisdictional 
</I>&gt;<i> systems (unlike collaborative governance, which  is much more fluid). If I 
</I>&gt;<i> restrict it to just people in the locality  that I represent, then, 
</I>&gt;<i> well... what software can support that  restriction today?
</I>
We, in Belgium, propose to have several rounds
1. a proposal of law
2. anyone can propose and discuss amendments but the person(s) who submitted 
the proposal stay in charge of the proposal
3. a first round of voting give an idea of the social support and has to 
reach a threshold (2%) comparable with the signature gathering
4. if the threshold is reached a vote can be launched for all citizens 
concerned (in Belgium, like in Spain ,... we have all an electronic identity 
card like a bank card)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If any of those above malicious interests play with the inputs or  if 
</I>&gt;<i> anything else goes wrong, it can make a very bad name for our  entire 
</I>&gt;<i> movement. What if I find that the website ends up having me  support the 
</I>&gt;<i> legalization of rape and murder? That could be easily  accomplished by 
</I>&gt;<i> people deliberately getting together to make me look  bad. What is to stop 
</I>&gt;<i> that? Or what if the software just doesn't work  right: then what am I 
</I>&gt;<i> supposed to do in the legislature (or whatever  body I am in)? Just 
</I>&gt;<i> abstain until a new version of the software comes  out? How would that 
</I>&gt;<i> look?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That are all assumptions that do not materialise. If you don't trust people 
(in great numbers) democracy is not possible.
Our example in sweden (demoex) shows that it did not happen. And initiatives 
in direct democracy are also proving that it is not happening.

&gt;<i> 4. Even if everything goes right, our movement could still get a bad 
</I>&gt;<i> reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid ideas (of which there are 
</I>&gt;<i> plenty in the U.S.). Collaborative governance works on the principle  that 
</I>&gt;<i> consensus decision-making only allows the best decisions to pass.  But in 
</I>&gt;<i> a less complex system, what is there besides majority rule? 
</I>&gt;<i> Super-majority rule? That's still nothing like real consensus-through- 
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>consensus has to be reached if possible and it is more often possible then 
we might think. But thinking that it is always possible is an illusion in my 
view.

&gt;<i> 5. Technically, how does it work in something like a city council.  There 
</I>&gt;<i> is usually a docket of topics for a city council, so if I were a  council 
</I>&gt;<i> member, I could ask the website what people want me to vote on  those. But 
</I>&gt;<i> how do I vote when someone raises a new issue within a  council meeting? 
</I>&gt;<i> Or a motion? Do I always have to abstain until I  consult the website? 
</I>&gt;<i> What about committees? Can I participate in a  committee? Those do a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of their work without making any votes, and  then vote at the end: how do 
</I>&gt;<i> I draw the populace into that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
demoex works there (Vallentuna near stockholm) since 2002.  Talk to Per 
Norback, he is doiing it.

&gt;<i> To me, direct democracy and representative democracy are enormously 
</I>&gt;<i> different. I have yet to be convinced of how or why they should be  forced 
</I>&gt;<i> together in some weird hybrid when we have a means to start  implementing 
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance as a ground-up replacement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, but if we wait until politicians allow us to make our own decisions it 
will take decades.
