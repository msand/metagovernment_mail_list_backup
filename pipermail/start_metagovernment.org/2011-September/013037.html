<PRE>I'm still thinking what it needs for people to adapt the tools is a
simple-few-clicks-setup (like creating a facebook account) or alternatively
a one-click-download + few-clicks-installer to host a server (maybe in a p2p
fashion, maybe even on mobile Operating systems) for others to do the
simple-few-click-facebooklike-setup to participate.

People will stumble upon these simple-to-use-tools and they will use them
with friends, with others so soon there will be a lot of micro communities
about a variety of topics.
now all these micro-communities will have a core community or core person
that few-clicks-hosted the service for their micro community.

Through a tool-builtin-broadcasting-updates-functionality (like the ones
that come with operating systems e.g. winows, linux...) its possible to
gather information from all these micro communities and make them avalable
through plugins (like cross-forum-theater) ..so every micro-community that
will host the cross-forum-theater will see all the other communities and
every member of the micro-communy might search for topics and connect one
micro community to another micro community.
....
the simple-(by-few-clicks)-hostable-server-software could be one of the
tools available tools, but on the developer side should only descrive
certain standards.
These standards should be communicated through metagoverment.org and
discussed with all the projects out there, so everyone could make their
software stick to the defined standards.
And it should be made sure, that every software that sticks to the standards
will be able to connect to the &quot;democracy network&quot; that will built itself
through the micro communities that use the simple-few-clicks-installers and
plugins like cross-forum-theater to connect to other communities and their
issues.

We dont know what will happen if its possible for micro communities to
connect to each other or what might hold them back to do so, but if we dont
give people the option in the first place, they never will.
