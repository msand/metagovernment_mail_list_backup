<PRE>Matteo, it is possible for you to reply with standardized e-mail  
software? When you post with a new subject, a new thread is started in  
the archives, and it breaks the consistency of the discussion for  
anyone wanting to review it later:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/thread.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/thread.html</A>
It would help to at least preserve the same subject line, if you are  
willing to do so.

There is no natural requirement that all governance must be tyrannical  
or oppressive. Democracy does not have to be majority-based. That is  
simply how it has usually been done.

It is in fact possible for people to come to consensus, if they work  
hard, have the right tools, and want it enough. Collaborative  
governance offers people only two options: find consensus on a new  
law, or do not pass a law. I think either one is better than passing a  
law that is oppressive.

</I>&gt;<i> revolutionary system almost from scratch while I think that a more  
</I>&gt;<i> pragmatical approach has more chances to success.
</I>
I agree with the difference, but not the conclusion. Mixdemocracy is  
pragmatic, but I think it is not possible to do it well. I believe  
that if it starts to gain enough success that it begins to scare the  
powerful elite, they will turn their attention to it, and it will be  
overwhelmed by malicious vandals, outrageous news stories (even if  
they are not true: that never stops these people), and other attacks.

Collaborative governance is &quot;revolutionary&quot; in that it is an entirely  
new way of doing things, but it is not an attempt to usurp the current  
power structures. Rather, the plan is for it to take hold in small  
decision-making environments, prove itself and adapt to larger and  
larger ones. As people get used to it, they will start to use the  
tools of the status quo to replace those tools with ours.

That last step is very much a good place for mixdemocracy to come in:  
E2D &quot;politicians&quot; can be the actors of converting systems to  
collaborative governance. This is a great opportunity for the two  
initiatives to work together (among others, since our software is  
similar). But I don't know if the timing will be right if E2D groups  
are already taking office while collaborative governance software is  
all still pretty much in alpha or pre-alpha.
