<PRE>@Mike:&quot;Tool development needs the help of (1) ..&quot;-&gt; I have to be very sincere on this. I did not understand much of what you are saying. Who are the &quot;activist users&quot; you are talking here? Do you know many of them? What are the &quot;political projects&quot; in practice?&#160;&quot;I get the impression you guys want lots of users, but we can't doanything with lots of users yet. &quot;-&gt; And when do you expect to get this high number of users? How many users are currently using Votorola after so many months of development? How many users are understanding in detail how Votorola works? 2? 3? 5? 10? In the mean time, a simple post on a blog has drawn more than 50000 (!) users to vote on a simple list of yes/no questions. Link:&#160;<A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html">http://www.beppegrillo.it/risultati.html</A>&quot;But it won't work that way, because that's not possible in thisstrange domain we're working in.&quot;-&gt; What are you actually talking about when you say &quot;it won' t work that way&quot; and, if you are talking about a more direct
 approach to direct democracy as I was talking about before, why are you so sure it will not work (please read the more than 50000 replies above)?&quot;If we had (1) a few core alpha users, then we could get busy with
that.&#160; We already have the tools for it, all we'd need is to make them
more usable.&#160; We like that kind of work more than anything, so we're
not trying to avoid it.&#160; And users will bring developers&quot;-&gt; My feeling is that most users (and I mean, 99% of them) will not understand and will not use a system that requires co-drafting of laws (see my reply to Pietro below)
@Pietro&quot;I think the base on which metagovernment works is that there are multiplepossible positions. When you reduce a discussion into a yes and no vote,
then of course you generate a tyranny of the majority.&quot;-&gt; Not necessarily if you offer 3 or 4 alternative positions to which you can choose from, where each alternative is brought forward by some association or even spontaneous group of people&quot;A different situation&#160;is when people are allowed to express their needs, co-draft the law, and&#160;chose among several different versions of the same vote (for example with&#160;approval voting).&quot;
-&gt; For the drafting method to be successful and meaningful you have to have a large amount of people involved in the drafting and voting of each part of the law. Maybe in a dream world this may happen, but in the real world this will not happen. The vast majority of the people will probably not even be interested enough to vote between three or four different proposals of laws, let alone work on drafting and modifying existing ones. 95%,99% of the people are lazy and can only be involved in the voting if the whole process is super-easy, does not involve any drafting, involves reading one or two pages and it is about a topic they are interested enough in.&quot;and in all he&#160;could voice his opinions, needs (which are more important) and suggestions.&quot;-&gt; My guess is that 1% of the Italian (or European, or American) public will be interested in working in drafting a law. The remaining 99% may be only drawn in the process if you present them few alternatives easy
 to understand and vote. And if the drafting of the law involves only few people, it can be left out of the voting system, and just given to do to associations of people like GreenPeace or others who can then propose laws for people to vote
