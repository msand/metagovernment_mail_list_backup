<PRE>Hi Paul,

Thanks for replying.  Thanks also to Ed for starting this thread.  I'm
hopeful we can recognize a common cause here, despite our differences
in methodology.

&gt;<i> Living in a community means acceptance of some rules. Call it a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;social contract&quot;. If democracy (in the real sence) starts in rather
</I>&gt;<i> small communities who are free to accept associations (right of free
</I>&gt;<i> association), and also te right to leave them if they want (right of
</I>&gt;<i> secession), there should be choice enough for most of us who are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to pay the price of living in a community.
</I>
I agree, that would be nearly ideal.  Competition would then do the
work of ensuring that societies in general were respectful of freedoms
and other human rights, since each individual could easily vote with
his/her feet, as they say.  Even better would be to remain in the
society we find ourselves in, to speak with one's fellows and work
together to solve the problems we confront.  Then one could truly say,
&quot;This is my society.&quot;  - and, on looking around at the others and
recognizing that each is equally responsible, &quot;This is our society.&quot;
Maybe that would be the fullest expression of political freedom.

&gt;<i> That is probably one of the reasons that the direct democracy in
</I>&gt;<i> Switserland is very differenciated between the canton's and is
</I>&gt;<i> working totally different compared to California who is probably the
</I>&gt;<i> greatest (in numbers) &quot;direct democracy&quot; in the world. Comparing all
</I>&gt;<i> those &quot;democratic evolutions&quot; is very interesting (one of us
</I>&gt;<i> attended the &quot;2010 Global Forum on Modern Direct Democracy&quot;)
</I>
I have several questions.  I'm less familiar with plebiscite systems,
or referenda, or petitions, since we don't use them here.  I know they
are meant to provide a means to participate in a legislative process
that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.  So, for instance,
when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I have no effective
means of influencing its content, or amendments, or likelihood of
passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection of law makers
who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey the law if
they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to that law,
but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.

My questions concern the case of a plebiscite system:

  1. When a plebiscite is prepared and presented, what effective means
     do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
     likelihood of passage?

  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
     case of ordinary legislation?

  3. How therefore does the plebiscite offer me an opportunity of
     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
     oppression?
