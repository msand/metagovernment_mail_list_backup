Yes of course, you see it clearly.  Funding is crucial for them, and
so is (I would add) a party nomination.  A candidate with both of
these has a 50% chance, where otherwise his (or her) prospects would
be slim.

&gt;<i> ... Of course, this kind of citizen group would also have its own
</I>&gt;<i> carrots and sticks to offer. Is this a topic that is ever explored
</I>&gt;<i> on MG?
</I>
Not much (and never enough!).  I can't think of a thread that ever
addressed the topic head on.  Some thoughts on carrots and sticks:

The citizen would already have a stick in the form of a vote if only
she (or he) could get a grip on it.  Currently that &quot;electoral stick&quot;
is in the hands of the party system, which in Anglo-America means the
2-3 dominant parties at the top.  The mechanisms by which they
accomplish this are instructive, because they may provide examples we
can follow.  ALEC is one I never knew of before (a primary legislative
system), but I would also point to the primary electoral system.

The carrot equivalent of funding might therefore be the promise of a
vote - a special kind of primary vote - cast well before the general
election, and in public.  That might be a sweeter carrot than money
because it's more direct.  It allows the politician to bypass a whole
layer of middlemen whose job it is to take money and deliver votes at
some future date.  Instead he gets to hold the votes in his own hand,
so to speak, and his job is then to retain them.

&gt;<i> No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the
</I>&gt;<i> available options for political participation. I plan to set up a
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative drafting site, probably using Votorola, and to invite
</I>&gt;<i> people back home to participate (I live in California now, but I
</I>&gt;<i> still identify politically with Cleveland, Ohio). I see this process
</I>&gt;<i> as the 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a
</I>&gt;<i> petition. I would hope to crank out something simple,
</I>&gt;<i> non-controversial, to campaign to push through a local
</I>&gt;<i> legislature. I haven't thought this through past that, yet.
</I>
If you need help, please count me in.  I think it only takes a few
people to get this kind of thing started.  Legislation has attractions
too, because it's something we always hear about and never get to
touch.  People will be curious just to see a bill, and hold it in
their hands, so to speak. (I never thought of it this way before, but
it seems like a fair exchange for one's vote. :-)

On the technical side, we currently support only MediaWiki for
drafting.  A standard installation is usually OK (we require no
extensions or special configuration ) but it helps to have admin
access to the server.  Alternatively, you're welcome to use our
reference pollwiki to get started and &quot;export&quot; the page histories to
your own wiki, later.

On the negative side, a vote-server is more difficult to set up (at
least Votorola).  That would be a stage 2 deployment:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/dep.xht#mul</A>
We don't have good support for that yet (and none for stage 3),
because we're still in prototype.  If you're strong in technical admin
skills, then it's probably OK (and we'd appreciate the feedback), but
otherwise I would recommend using the reference server for now.
