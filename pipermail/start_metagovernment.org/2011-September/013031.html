Demoex and E2D are a stepping stone towards the vision of 
Metagovernment. It's a way to gradually start a transition towards it by 
the way of an unpolitical party. The elected representatives of the 
national E2D party has all promised to completely follow the result of 
the online democracy and voting systems.

The liquid democracy concept works int the way you describe for 
votorola. We uses the party to make all the processes transparent and 
make everybody involved in all the stages of the decision making process.

The E2D represents a clever way to transform the existing government 
into a metagovernment from the ground up.

The vision is that the size of the party will grow over time to the 
point there we can completely leave the old system.

I'm working for Aktiv Demokrati, that is an E2D party in Sweden.
