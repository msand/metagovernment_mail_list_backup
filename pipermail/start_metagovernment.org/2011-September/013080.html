<PRE>@David
&quot;Not sure how you concluded that, I did not say that all people should spend hours writing and amending laws.&quot;
-&gt; The discussion we are doing here and my reply to Ed which is at the beginning of this thread is in regard to Votorola which requires (allows) people to actively work on amending and drafting laws. This is what the discussion is about. I am not sure which system you personally are proposing, since I read through your posts and I could not find an exact description of how direct democracy should work in your opinion, not even in this site&#160;<A HREF="http://gov.e2d.se/about/&#160;or">http://gov.e2d.se/about/&#160;or</A> this site&#160;<A HREF="http://val.aktivdemokrati.se/manifesto/.">http://val.aktivdemokrati.se/manifesto/.</A> At least, not in English. I am not sure whether you defined your idea of DD in other posts. However, as I said before, the thread is about Votorola, not about your idea of DD.
&quot;Yes Votorola looks great, particularly the concept of allowing people to delegate their vote to someone they know and trust.? In which case the influence of the elites might be greatly diminished.&quot;-&gt; I am definitely in favour of delegation, but I believe this is not the silver bullet which solves the problem. My point of perplexity about Votorola is that requires a continuous process of drafting of texts that is too complicated for usual people to join.
&quot;Again, not sure where this is coming from, I did not say that all people should spend hours writing and amending laws.&quot;-&gt; We are talking about Votorola
&quot;And if you were to claim that a large majority of voters all take the time to fully understand all the issues and could not benefit from the help of better tools to make understanding the issues easier, you would only be fooling yourself.&quot;-&gt; &#160;How would a system that allows people to draft laws make people better understand isssues?Better understanding of issues comes through discussion with other people, once the discussion is over, you can start to write a law.You can not write a law before you understand all the issues involved through a discussion and an analysis that 99.9% of the people will not have the time and/or the competency to do. At least, IMHO.
&quot;Again, not sure where these comments are coming from, and to be honest, your logic in this paragraph makes no sense:? (1) You are implying that the large majority of voters do understand all the issues, which from history is clearly not always true, &quot;-&gt; Absolutely not. I have never thought this
&quot;(2) You are pretending that making things easier for voters to understand issues would have no benefit, &quot;-&gt; Absolutely not. I am definitely in favour of discussions BEFORE drafting a law. I think this is of the utmost importance
&quot;(3) Your asking the question of who will do this job is irrelevant, and does not relate to any of my previous comments, &quot;-&gt; I am talking about Votorola and I am asking who will do this once the system Votorola will be released. Not about any other system.
&quot;(4) You say something about &quot;If you assume only few people will take part in the process&quot; which again is irrelevant - I never said anything relating to how many people would take part, and &quot;-&gt; See above
&quot;(5) you make another similar statement in your last question which &quot;begs the question&quot; (a logical fallacy), and which has nothing to do with anything I said.&quot;-&gt; See above
&quot;Thus I can only conclude that you seem to have greatly misinterpreted my posts, at seemingly every level, and your responses seem to be simply an attempt to create confusion through the use of a number of logical fallacies, rather than to clearly and succinctly respond to any specific things I actually said.&quot;-&gt; It is not polite to accuse others of &quot;attempt to create confusion&quot;. Especially when you apparently have just joined the list few days ago (your first post looks to be of the day before yesterday) and the person you are accusing is here since March.As for the things you &quot;clearly said&quot;, they are not so clear to me, infact, reading your posts I did not understand anything about your proposed system, in case you are actually proposing one, a part form some random thoughts about &quot;complexity management&quot;.Not that your tone of conversation makes me feel an urgent need to know better..
