<PRE>Hi David,

Your posts are thoughtful and I'd wanted to respond earlier.  I try to
make up for lost time:

David Gleason wrote:
&gt;<i>  A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software,
</I>&gt;<i> which manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes
</I>&gt;<i> (resources, people, groups, organizations) and dynamic
</I>&gt;<i> relationships.  In other words it has to model the real world. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Kind of like object-oriented programming, but without the emphasis
</I>&gt;<i> on programming, without the limitations of typical OO structures,
</I>&gt;<i> and with an equal emphasis on the dynamic relationships between
</I>&gt;<i> objects.)  If a system does not accurately capture existing reality,
</I>&gt;<i> most people will not be able to understand the existing reality,
</I>&gt;<i> what changes or optimizations are therefore appropriate, or what
</I>&gt;<i> effects those changes would have.
</I>
Our formal models (a) take information from the real world; (b) chug,
chug... generate something useful from it; and (c) contribute it back
to the world.  OK.

&gt;<i> (I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing
</I>&gt;<i> a web information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to
</I>&gt;<i> construct and share any type of data structures and relations to
</I>&gt;<i> model those kinds of things.  It's probably many ~6 months away from
</I>&gt;<i> being useful however.)
</I>
With &quot;this&quot; referring to (a)?  At first blush, I would say no, the
initial design effort must focus almost exclusively on (c).  Design
questions to ask are: what precisely to give back (detailed use case);
why is it needed in the real world (theory); and how to deliver it
(practice, tooling).

&gt;<i> I think the biggest barrier to collaborative governance of any sort
</I>&gt;<i> is complexity management.  If a framework does not exist that allows
</I>&gt;<i> reality to be accurately visualized and understood by average
</I>&gt;<i> (non-technical) people, for potential changes to be simulated, and
</I>&gt;<i> for users to provide input on a granular basis, then runaway
</I>&gt;<i> complexity and chaos quickly results.  Which I believe is the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest reason we have the political systems we have today.  98% of
</I>&gt;<i> people don't understand the subtle details of how things really work
</I>&gt;<i> with complex government-related systems, and thus emotion is all
</I>&gt;<i> they are left with for a decision framework.
</I>
I take it &quot;collaborative governance&quot; means the participation of
ordinary folks in politics.  An interesting perspective to consider is
that the disorganized population of ordinary folks (lifeworld) is
perhaps the most complex social thing on the planet.  The stuff of the
lifeworld isn't neatly ordered, but it has plently of internal and
external interrelations that are multiplied across the expanse of the
population.  This means complexity, and this complexity becomes the
natural environment in which the ordinary person lives and breathes.
(But this is just one perspective.)

&gt;<i> One of the biggest deceptions of law is to introduce a faux brand of
</I>&gt;<i> complexity into affairs such that only lawyers and politicians are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;qualified&quot; to administer things, and the rest of the people are
</I>&gt;<i> left with no sufficiently powerful logical framework from which to
</I>&gt;<i> counter.  Only when science and technology are able to rise to the
</I>&gt;<i> occasion, surmount their own complexities, and provide an inarguably
</I>&gt;<i> solid framework, will we be able to replace the old system.
</I>
The other side of that perspective coin is that the administrative
machinery of the government is overtaxed in attempting to grapple with
the complexity of the lifeworld.  Stuff ordinary folks deal with in
their sleep, so to speak, has the government stretched beyond its
limits and growing bigger daily in an attempt to cope with it.

&gt;<i> I have lots of other ideas too but just thought I'd throw those out
</I>&gt;<i> there for now as I see the information system part of the equation
</I>&gt;<i> as key.  The web as it is today is in many ways just an extension of
</I>&gt;<i> the concepts of print media which came before it and I think there
</I>&gt;<i> needs to be a radical shift in that.  Email chains, blogs, articles,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. 99% of the time just contribute to long blobs of static
</I>&gt;<i> information that quickly become unmanageable, unbounded, and
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete.  I think that with a dynamic, interlinked view of
</I>&gt;<i> information, an appropriate framework could enable information to be
</I>&gt;<i> built, maintained, and refined as a cohesive interlinked structure.
</I>
Dangers with starting at (a) are you model the wrong aspects of the
real world, and have to backtrack later; or you overmodel it and end
up with an expensive simulation of something that doesn't need
simulating.

David Gleason wrote in reply to Matteo Martini:
&gt;<i> I maybe alluded to this in another thread but figured it might be
</I>&gt;<i> good to restate, I think that most of the time when voters make a
</I>&gt;<i> bad decision in how they vote, probably 90% of the time it is
</I>&gt;<i> because they didn't fully understand the issues and the details of
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal (or in the case of a candidate, the details of his/her
</I>&gt;<i> platform and real intentions).  The modern political system (in the
</I>&gt;<i> US at least) has perfected the art of portraying something one way
</I>&gt;<i> when in fact it does completely the opposite (Orwellian doublespeak
</I>&gt;<i> at it's finest).  And this is easy to do because very few have the
</I>&gt;<i> individual financial motivation to invest the time to properly
</I>&gt;<i> document what the issues are and make a clear case to voters, but
</I>&gt;<i> those who stand to profit have vastly more incentive and resources
</I>&gt;<i> to devote to presenting their proposal to the public in whatever way
</I>&gt;<i> they want.  So the system gets abused very easily and the incentives
</I>&gt;<i> for disinformation are much higher than those for truth.
</I>
You observe a failure in the system (it made a poor decision) and
attempt to trace the cause.  Along the way, you depend on an
assumption that the decision was made by the voters.  But there is
good reason to suppose otherwise.  Please see the analysis in the
second post of the &quot;Freedom&quot; thread. [1]

Mind you, when the voters *do* start making decisions for themselves,
they may very well welcome the assistance of reasoning tools, such as
you propose.

&gt;<i> Everyone on this mailing list is probably well aware of these
</I>&gt;<i> things, but in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the
</I>&gt;<i> public to understand what the complex reality is behind issues, and
</I>&gt;<i> what the subtleties and side effects may be, and provide features
</I>&gt;<i> that allow the community to document issues/platforms in a clear and
</I>&gt;<i> formal way (i.e. with references, and with a mechanism to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> objectivity, e.g. allowing subjective statements to be flagged, like
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia articles).
</I>
This comes down now to your delivery side, again (c).  It would be
helpful to know what other tooling exists there, because likely you
must integrate with it.  Unfortunately, no such tooling is mature,
yet.  You may be working a little ahead of your time.  If so, I hope
you find a useful surrogate application that's not too unlike the (as
yet unknown) real McCoy.

&gt;<i> Maybe I'm asking too much of a collaborative governance system, and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe most would see that as a separate concern, but would not a
</I>&gt;<i> c.g. system be better off as a secondary layer on top of that type
</I>&gt;<i> of information / content management system, rather than being a
</I>&gt;<i> separate system?   You can have the best voting system in the world,
</I>&gt;<i> but if the users are not properly informed about the complex details
</I>&gt;<i> of what they're voting on and the government /administrative systems
</I>&gt;<i> affected by that, then you will still get the wrong outputs from the
</I>&gt;<i> voting system, and it may be no more effective against corruption
</I>&gt;<i> and monied influences than the representative systems we have
</I>&gt;<i> today.  Looking forward to hear anyone's feedback on this idea,
</I>
You already *do* expect tight integration... but perhaps you give your
own tools too foundational a role.  There is theory that the
rationality of public decisions cannot be cognitive-instrumental
alone.  The objective world is not the only world involved in the
decision space, but that space also includes the social and subjective
worlds, which require moral-practical and aesthetic-practical forms of
reasoning [2 p.238].  All three forms of reasoning must be employed
simultaneously by persons oriented to mutual understanding and
agreement as a means of deciding what to do.  This combination of
rationalities is called (I think) commmunicative reason and the
overall decision + execution process, &quot;communicative action&quot;.
Fortunately it all happens more-or-less naturally when people are
engaged in frank discussion with their peers.  This is not to say that
they won't be needing reason-tools, but it does suggest that and
objective orientation and cognitive-instrumental rationality cannot be
foundational, as the rational foundation is necessarily tri-partite.
All of this might figure into the design task (c).

David Gleason wrote in reply to Matteo Martini:
&gt;<i> p.s. - This email chain is a good example of what I referred to as
</I>&gt;<i> runaway complexity in an earlier post. To rewind a bit, this
</I>&gt;<i> following paragraph is from my original post in this thread, and
</I>&gt;<i> kind of sums everything up:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the public to
</I>&gt;<i> understand what the complex reality is behind issues, and what the

</I>&gt;<i> &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia articles).&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's all there was to it.  (And to clarify, when I say community
</I>&gt;<i> above, that just means those in the community (or their delegates)
</I>&gt;<i> who wish to be involved.)  I apologize if I was unclear about that,
</I>&gt;<i> and for the several follow on emails which turned 1 paragraph into
</I>&gt;<i> 20.  But for the purposes of clarity I maintain that the first issue
</I>&gt;<i> we're facing is complexity.  And the establishment knows all too
</I>&gt;<i> well how to leverage that to their advantage.  And this is a verrry
</I>&gt;<i> subtle thing - if you take complexity as a given, and do nothing to
</I>&gt;<i> minimize it within a social information system such as the types we
</I>&gt;<i> are all interested in, then - in my opinion - you'll have a much
</I>&gt;<i> harder time achieving larger scale adoption of any such system.
</I>
There *is* a gaping hole in the current structure of society, but it
seems not so much a complexity-handling deficit *in the first
instance*.  The fact is not generally known yet, but I believe it is a
fact that a fault (or breakage) exists between these two structural
elements of society:

    * individual person
    * individual vote

The individual person matters greatly in a modern society (subject of
human rights), while the individual vote matters not at all.  It
matters not at all because the course and outcome of the election are
absolutely unaffected by it.  The individual person (as a voter) is
thus disengaged from the electoral system, which is his/her only
formal connection to politics.  Politics is about power.  The vote is
the only power granted to the individual, and hence the only means of
exercising power.  There are many voters in society, and the sum of
their disengagement therefore amounts to a massive power vacuum.  This
power vacuum cannot be filled by the individual voters as such owing
to the fault in the electoral system; but a vacuum is not too picky
about what fills it, so something other than the individual voters
rushes in and does the job. [1]

I mention all this in order to suggest that, because the ordinary
individual *as such* has been exluded from participation in politics,
we may safely conclude that the lifeworld has also been excluded.
This may well account for the deficit in complexity handling that you
diagnose.
