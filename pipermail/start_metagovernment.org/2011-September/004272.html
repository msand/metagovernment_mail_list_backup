<PRE>In reply to Matteo and Alex concerning development priorities.  Thanks
for raising the issue, it gave me a chance to think more carefully
about it.  Here's the rationale for the current plan, as I now see it:


      Need                  Problem              Solution
      --------------------------------------------------------------
      2-3 core alpha        Cannot sustain       Deliberate
 (1)  users working   ----- discussion for ---&gt;  pursuit of      (3)
      together              long enough in       crossforum
                            single forum         extent by
                                                 activist users

      2-3 core techni-      Unknown, none        Agressive vote
 (2)  cal or political  --- are responsive ---&gt;  mirroring and   (4)
      projects working      to the idea          cross-project
      together                                   campaigning by
                                                 activist users
                                               =====================
                                                 RAC resource    (5)
                                                 accounting
      --------------------------------------------------------------
     (walk softly)                              (carry big stick)


Tool development needs the help of (1) a core group of users who are
embedded in a practice that actually requires the use of those tools.
Tool developers need the help of (2) a core group of technical and
political projects that understand they have (in this domain, which is
unlike any other) a mutual dependency.  Neither of these needs can be
met at present because of problems that might broadly be characterized
as a &quot;failure to communicate&quot;.  We propose to overcome this failure by
forcing open the the lines of communication with tools and practices
for (3) crossforum ranging and extension, and (4) the aggressive use
of Thomas's vote mirroring.  Both solutions depend on (5) the RAC, a
framework for resource accounting that C and I are currently
developing.

I get the impression you guys want lots of users, but we can't do
anything with lots of users yet.  At the same time, every *other*
project is putting all its energy into getting users (or members) in
the hopes of attaining a critical mass and assuring itself of success.
But it won't work that way, because that's not possible in this
strange domain we're working in.  It's not like any other.  We gotta
walk softly here; and until the other projects realize it, we gotta
carry a big stick.

Matteo and Alex,

Yes, primary legislation (or primary planning, or policy making) as we
we might call it.  That's a good approach, I think.

&gt;<i> I have tried to read the specs of Votorola under the chapter
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Theory&quot; quite a few times and I have to admit that I could not
</I>&gt;<i> understand few main points of what is written there.
</I>
It's mostly saying what you're saying, but in highly abstract terms.
Most people won't need to read the theory, and most discussions won't
need to refer to it.

&gt;<i> I think Votorola is bound to be a very flexible system, but will it
</I>&gt;<i> be simple enough to be used by the average user?  Please believe
</I>&gt;<i> that I am not willing to criticize the excellent work done by Mike
</I>&gt;<i> Allen and Conseo so far (and Thomas), I believe you are excellent
</I>&gt;<i> people and you are working hard to create a good tool that many
</I>&gt;<i> people in the world need to use.  But sometimes I wonder if people
</I>&gt;<i> should not instead start to use a much simpler tool, without many
</I>&gt;<i> functionalities, that just allows them to vote between three or four
</I>&gt;<i> different proposals of law and send this proposal to the local mayor
</I>&gt;<i> or senator.
</I>
If we had (1) a few core alpha users, then we could get busy with
that.  We already have the tools for it, all we'd need is to make them
more usable.  We like that kind of work more than anything, so we're
not trying to avoid it.  And users will bring developers,

But we ain't goin' beggin' for those users no more, because our plans
no longer require that approach.  Let the other projects accumulate
users in convenient concentrations, and we'll go after 'em.

</I>
I agree that cross-project stuff is crucial, but we need (2) at least
two projects before we can speak of that stuff in any definitive way.
*De jure* standards won't fly at this stage, they must be *de facto*
and developed between peer projects that are in a position to put them
into effect immediately.
