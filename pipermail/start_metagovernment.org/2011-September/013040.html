<PRE>Matteo,

While the Votorola theory document may seem complex, almost all of the
underlying principles (unless I'm missing something) are astonishingly
simple.
I believe an animated (&quot;infographic&quot;) version of the same document could be
quite concise, and something even a child could grasp intuitively.
I will try to sketch something out one of these days although my programming
chops might not be up to the task.

&gt;<i> Just few words about Electronic Direct Democracy or Internet democracy (as
</I>I call it).
&gt;<i> There are quite a lot of initiatives about direct democracy around the
</I>world, still the global movement for direct democracy (if we can call it so,
since there is not official &quot;one&quot; movement) fails to pick up.
&gt;<i> Fails to pick up means that most of the current political decisions are
</I>still taken by the conventional political system and that in no country the
direct democracy system is out there working.
&gt;<i> My idea about why this is happening is that big changes start from small
</I>things.
&gt;<i> This is true especially in the realm of internet.
</I>&gt;<i> Big successful sites like Facebook started as simple sites to exchange
</I>pictures among friends.
&gt;<i> Internet democracy needs to grow in the same way.
</I>&gt;<i> We need to start looking at who needs this tool first, and help such
</I>people use the tool of internet democracy.
&gt;<i> At first, I believe, Internet Democracy should start by targeting groups
</I>like GreenPeace, Sea Shepard down to the local group of people that want to
protect their children from the pollution of the local power plant.
&gt;<i> When targeting such groups of people, it is possible to offer them a
</I>software that allows them to get connected together and create a joint
document to be sent to the local mayor or senator.
&gt;<i> This is where we should start from, I believe.
</I>&gt;<i> The potential users are already out there.
</I>&gt;<i> All the big things start from the small, and we can not think to
</I>immediately start a country or world government from the start.
&gt;<i> I believe we may need a simple tool to offer to people and invite them to
</I>use it for what they really need it.
&gt;<i> If the system works out, then it would be easier to implement the system
</I>at wider and wider scale.
&gt;<i> I have received the mailing list of Votorola since few months ago now, and
</I>I believe that Votorola can potentially become a very powerful system.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But my point is that the power of Votorola can be its main weakness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have tried to read the specs of Votorola under the chapter &quot;Theory&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> quite a few times and I have to admit that I could not understand few
</I>&gt;<i> main points of what is written there.
</I>&gt;<i> I think Votorola is bound to be a very flexible system, but will it be
</I>simple enough to be used by the average user?
&gt;<i> Please believe that I am not willing to criticize the excellent work done
</I>by Mike Allen and Conseo so far (and Thomas), I believe you are excellent
people and you are working hard to create a good tool that many people in
the world need to use.
&gt;<i> But sometimes I wonder if people should not instead start to use a much
</I>simpler tool, without many functionalities, that just allows them to vote
between three or four different proposals of law and send this proposal to
the local mayor or senator.
