<PRE>p.s. - This email chain is a good example of what I referred to as runaway complexity in an earlier post. To rewind a bit, this following paragraph is from my original post in this thread, and kind of sums everything up:


&quot;in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of 
collaborative governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the 
public to understand what the complex reality is behind issues, and what the subtleties and side effects may be, and provide features that allow the community to document issues/platforms in a clear and formal way 
(i.e. with references, and with a mechanism to ensure objectivity, e.g. 
allowing subjective statements to be flagged, like the &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia articles).&quot;

That's all there was to it.&#160; (And to clarify, when I say community above, that just means those in the community (or their delegates) who wish to be involved.)&#160; I apologize if I was unclear about that, and for the several follow on emails which turned 1 paragraph into 20.&#160; But for the purposes of clarity I maintain that the first issue we're facing is complexity.&#160; And the establishment knows all too well how to leverage that to their advantage.&#160; And this is a verrry subtle thing - if you take complexity as a given, and do nothing to minimize it within a social information system such as the types we are all interested in, then - in my opinion - you'll have a much harder time achieving larger scale adoption of any such system. 


Thanks,
David

My comments below (indented and in italics):


&quot;Matteo, I think you misunderstood me. Maybe in your country the laws are simple and everyone understands them very easily, but often in the US and in&#160;California&#160;(where I live), the proposed laws and initiatives are often intentionally written to be complex - and even smart and well educated people often do not take the time to read the many pages of complicated legal language, or fully understand the implementation implications or alternatives. Therefore voters will often rely on the opinions they see in the media to make their judgements.&quot;


-&gt; Got that. So what shall we do? You are claiming that people are influenced by the media and uncapable to understand the technicalities of the laws they should be voting for but then you ask them do spend hours of their time in writing and amending packages of laws.


Not sure how you concluded that, I did not say that all people should spend hours writing and amending laws.


-&gt; I think the principle of Votorola has high possibilities of not becoming successful for the following reasons:
1) any effort to have a system like Votorola become successful would require a good part of the population to take part in the law-building process. If only few individuals take part in the law-building process then for the powerful elites it will be easier to hire 2000-20000 persons and drift the whole process away but..

Yes Votorola looks great, particularly the concept of allowing people to delegate their vote to someone they know and trust.&#160; In which case the influence of the elites might be greatly diminished.


2) any effort to have many many people (millions?) participate in the law-drafting process would be undoable as the process would become too confused (can you imagine having a million people each one with his different vision discuss about issues) and people do not have ten hours of time per day to dedicate in writing laws.


Again, not sure where this is coming from, I did not say that all people should spend hours writing and amending laws.

Maybe if you re-read my earlier posts, and keep in mind that I was never suggesting that all people be involved in writing/amending laws, they might make more sense to you?


Anyhow, whether it is 100 or 100,000 people participating in writing and amending laws, I don't think a voting system alone is not sufficient to meet the aims of collaborative governance.&#160; I think there should be a new type of information management system as a layer underneath - as I described in earlier posts (and which I can understand that not everyone will understand as it's a bit of a subtle concept) - to support the interaction of those people, and the complexities of the proposals being collaborated on.


&quot;And if you were to claim that a large majority of voters all take the time to fully understand all the issues and could not benefit from the help of better tools to make understanding the issues easier, you would only be fooling yourself.&quot;

-&gt; If you think the large
 majority of the voters will not understand the issues how do you think they will spend hours in reading and amending each law? Who will actually do this job? If you assume only few people will take part in the process, then who will block big companies to hire ten thousands of people to rewrite the law as they want to?&#160;
If you assume a large part of the population will take part in the process, do you really think you can manage one or ten million people all trying to write-rewrite and amend each single law?


Again, not sure where these comments are coming from, and to be honest, your logic in this paragraph makes no sense:&#160; (1) You are implying that the large majority of voters do understand all the issues, which from history is clearly not always true, (2) You are pretending that making things easier for voters to understand issues would have no benefit, (3) Your asking the question of who will do this job is irrelevant, and does not relate to any of my previous comments, (4) You say something about &quot;If you assume only few people will take part in the process&quot; which again is irrelevant - I never said anything relating to how many people would take part, and (5) you make another similar statement in your last question which &quot;begs the question&quot; (a logical fallacy), and which has nothing to do with anything I said.

Thus I can only conclude that you seem to have greatly misinterpreted my posts, at seemingly every level, and your responses seem to be simply an attempt to create confusion through the use of a number of logical fallacies, rather than to clearly and succinctly respond to any specific things I actually said.


Thanks,
David
