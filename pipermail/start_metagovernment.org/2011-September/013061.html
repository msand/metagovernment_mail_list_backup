<PRE>Sounds like a plan ;)

So, creating an autoupdate-mechanism requires all tools or
tooldevelopers to stick to some technical standards, which will be
decided upon by the tools and their developers who have grown to a
state where it makes sense to go for a defacto standard that might be
changed later on when more tool grow mature?
On the other hand, its onlye deployment infrastructure, that will
enable people to choose a tool and set it up to create a new
community, and it will benefit tool developers, because they get new
users without much effort. These new communities might be auto-updated
with the newest version of the tool automatically.
I think this deployment infrastructure is a service that might be
offered by metagovernment and every tool that thinks it might use it
does so.
[Goal: cross plattform deployment infrastructure for a variety of tools]

So, if this infrastructure is in place, it might make it much easier
later on to implement vote-mirroring-mechanisms or
vote-translation-mechanisms which might be decided by the
tool-developers and theory experts, ...but which might optionally
offer to let users decide who are interested.

I think, beside the technical standard, there will be always users or
voters who are interested in the translation mechanics and will try to
think about them to give feedback for improvement. So why shouldnt it
be offered?
If these interested candidates can work on a nice translation and
communicate it to there followers so that they vote for it, it will
more likely be accepted instead of attacked.
People who may not be favoured from the imperfect translation will
attack it if the translation is not open for debate and all you could
do about it is to vote with your feet.
