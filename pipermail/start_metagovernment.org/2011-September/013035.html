<PRE>Hi Michael,

Living in a community means acceptance of some rules. Call it a &quot;social 
contract&quot;. If democracy  (in the real sence) starts in rather small 
communities who are free to accept associations (right of free association) 
, and also te right to leave them if they want (right of secession), there 
should be choice enough for most of us who are willing to pay the price of 
living in a community.
That is probably one of the reasons that the direct democracy in Switserland 
is very differenciated between the canton's and is working totally different 
compared to California who is probably the greatest (in numbers) &quot;direct 
democracy&quot; in the world. Comparing all those &quot;democratic evolutions&quot; is very 
interesting (one of us attended the &quot;2010 Global Forum on Modern Direct 
Democracy&quot;)

Paul

</I>&gt;<i> They would be pushed apart, however, by any promotion of collaborative

</I>&gt;<i> include direct democratic parties, non-party primaries, primary
</I>&gt;<i> legislation, and the various technical projects.  We have no knowledge
</I>&gt;<i> of which methods are likely to succeed, or in what combination.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we transcend partisanship, then all that is left is the common
</I>&gt;<i> goal.  Your movie script brought to mind my past attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> communicate the moral argument of freedom.  Those attempts always
</I>&gt;<i> failed because I failed to put my finger on the precise point of
</I>&gt;<i> injustice in the status quo.  That point was somehow hidden from view,
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't know if anyone ever noticed it till now.  Here is how I
</I>&gt;<i> see it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   I used to believe that I was free because I lived in a democracy
</I>&gt;<i>   and had a vote; but the truth is, I have no political freedom at
</I>&gt;<i>   all.  Whether I vote or not, and regardless of who I vote for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) the candidates are chosen ahead of time, and I have no
</I>&gt;<i>         influence over the choice;
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) the course of the election is unaffected by my vote;
</I>&gt;<i>     (c) the outcome is the same, regardless;
</I>&gt;<i>     (d) state power is unaffected; and
</I>&gt;<i>     (e) the laws are unaffected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   If I disobey (d) state power or (e) the laws, then I am brought
</I>&gt;<i>   into submission by force.  The powers that affect me are unaffected
</I>&gt;<i>   by any comparable power of mine.  In regard to my political
</I>&gt;<i>   freedom, I might as well live in China or Saudi Arabia.
</I>&gt;<i>   Disobedience is my only freedom, and yet the cost of exercising it
</I>&gt;<i>   is physical confinement or worse.  In this regard, it follows that
</I>&gt;<i>   I am a slave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is almost impossible to swallow.  At the same time, it is true.
</I>&gt;<i> Please point out flaws in the argument (anyone).  There is a corollary
</I>&gt;<i> as well, which is somewhat dangerous:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   By a corollary, state power has no moral authority or legitimacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Something must give here, becayse there is too much tension wound up
</I>&gt;<i> in it.  We cannot really blame anyone because nobody ever noticed it
</I>&gt;<i> before.  But now that we notice it ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ... I wish Thomas were able to contribute, as he has proven to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one of the best at this.  Have you heard anything from him recently?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can start drafting a charter, but would rather he took a shot at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it if he is available to do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He might be back any day now, or it might be longer.  He left a fairly
</I>&gt;<i> wide window.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Michael, does that make sense?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for suggesting this, Ed.  It might not meet the technical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; requirements, but maybe we can strengthen it.  The group, or effort,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; or organization (whatever the form) would be more attractive if its:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  1. Goal is clear and transparent.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  2. Existing resources are applied vigorously in pursuit of the goal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  3. New resources (people, money) are sought on the basis of past
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     accomplishments in respect of the goal.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I would especially emphasize the first two.  The script you floated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; last month had its heart in the right place (I liked it) but it lacked
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; clarity and force.  In the plainest of terms, what is the goal?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The overarching goal of metagov is well defined in the Mission and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vision:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Writing a charter would help better clarify this. I wish Thomas were

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For what it is worth, though much of it is now out of date, the
