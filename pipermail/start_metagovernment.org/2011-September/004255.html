I have not clear what you are exactly talking about 
&quot;simple-to-use-tools &quot;, &quot;tool-builtin-broadcasting-updates-functionality&#160;&quot;&#160;it 
looks to me like a very general idea about a tool, but do you have clear what 
this tool should do and how it should work? If not, you should write down at 
least a specification paper on how the functioanlity of the system should work.&#160; 

If you do not have a specification paper to discuss what 
you want to do, it is difficult to even talk about this topic.&#160; 

I have represented my idea here: www.idemocrazia.it still I have not 
prepared any specification paper, as I was looking if anything like what I had 
in mind is already out there.
I think that, if you do not have a specification paper 
you can not do anything.

In all the states of the US (including California and 
Oregon), all the main decisions of politics are taken by the local government, 
that same of which happens in Austria, Germany and Nepal.&#160; 
I am not aware of any democracy tool via internet that is 
widely used by the majority of the people of country or one state to promote 
democracy by-passing the democracy system.&#160; 
I do not think such system exists.&#160; 
When you speak about &quot;delivering something&quot;, I am not 
sure what you mean.
Please be precise with your words, otherwise other 
people will not understand what you are saying.
If you can deliver a proposal of law voted by 10000 
people to the local senator and you tell him that if he does not follow he will 
not be voted anymore, this is already something that can be 
done.
Just look at this idea here:

I may agree that the principles of Votorola may be 
simple, but this is not the point, in my opinion.&#160; 
The point is that most of the people need a software 
which is simple to use and everybody can understand.
I have read many times the theory behind Votorola, I do 
not think I am a stupid, but I have still to understand many 
points.
I am scared that it will end up with a very powerful 
software that many people will not want to learn as it is too complicated to 
use.&#160; 
Also, I have the impression that much much time and 
effort is spent to make the software with any functionalities, when people 
instead may want a simple softare to be used right now.
Also, there are already many people working on complex 
systems, and they are many years in the working and never get completed.&#160; 

I have the fear that the same may happen to Votorola, 
already in development phase since much time ago.&#160; 
Maybe the revolution will instead come from a simpler, 
Facebook-style, direct democracy software that just allows people to write a 
proposal of law and ask other people to vote it.&#160; 
As you can see from the link here: <A HREF="http://www.beppegrillo.it/2011/09/scaricare_ogni/index.html,">http://www.beppegrillo.it/2011/09/scaricare_ogni/index.html,</A> 
what we need is just maybe a software that allows to click on a proposal of law. 
Simple like that.
