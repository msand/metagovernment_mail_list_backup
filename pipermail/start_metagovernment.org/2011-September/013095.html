&gt;<i> [much is broken in the system, belief otherwise is wishful thinking
</I>&gt;<i>  and not objective analysis]
</I>
Except that the break appears at a single point.  I took care in
responding to [the subscriber's] defense of the system that the voter
not reply as an offended victim of that system, but rather as a
passive aspect that insists on nothing but its own existence.  I now
take it as a structural fault (a break) and these are its two broken
ends:

    * individual person

    * individual vote

The individual person matters greatly in a modern society; while the
individual vote matters not at all.  The structure has failed at this
precise point, between the two.  My first impression of the immediate
cause and effect:

   A. The electoral system's model of society is wrong.  The formal
      aggregate of votes in the count engine does not correspond to an
      actual aggregate of voters in society.  The individual votes are
      brought together to make a result, but the individual voters are
      not brought together *as such* to make a decision; therefore no
      valid decision can be extracted from the result.

   B. The breakage is total, but the failure is non-catastrophic.  The
      electoral system has collapsed onto an external party system
      that is now carrying the full load.  The electoral system has
      been bypassed.  The result that was supposed to be a decision of
      the voters is actually a decision of the parties.

I lack experience in this kind of system analysis, and this is only a
preliminary assessment in any case, but I think the cause and effect
(A, B) are palpable in the narrative.  [The subscriber's] defence is
an attempt to hold the structure up, but the fault manifests itself
everywhere, and the structure cannot stand as it was supposed to.

Can anyone see a flaw in this analysis?  Please critique freely,
