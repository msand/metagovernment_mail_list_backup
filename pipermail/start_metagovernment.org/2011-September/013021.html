<PRE>Welcome Francis,

&gt;<i> I am a complete stranger to the concepts of collaborative governance.
</I>&gt;<i> I apologize if I ask here about some things that have already been
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly discussed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This morning, I started searching online for a wiki framework for
</I>&gt;<i> drafting legislation. I imagine an open-source, collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> alternative to what the American Legislative Exchange Council offers
</I>&gt;<i> to our lawmakers.
</I>
I tried to find a description of ALEC's drafting tools.  All I found
was &quot;model legislation&quot;, and lots of it: <A HREF="http://alecexposed.org/">http://alecexposed.org/</A>

&gt;<i> Layers of discussion pages could help make between-the-lines
</I>&gt;<i> reading/writing more accessible. Allowing multiple versions of
</I>&gt;<i> controversial sections, developed in parallel, might help to
</I>&gt;<i> illuminate (instead of obscure) sources of disagreement. These two
</I>&gt;<i> considerations probably barely scratch the surface of the challenges
</I>&gt;<i> involved.
</I>
But they top the list: 1) a tight connection between drafting and
discussion, and 2) the full exposure of dissenting positions.  Those
are the crucial problems for the design of the toolset proper.

&gt;<i> The bottom line for me is that individually, most citizens are
</I>&gt;<i> unable to recognize or articulate their own interests in terms of
</I>&gt;<i> actual policy. Collectively, however, I believe the story can be
</I>&gt;<i> different.
</I>
We might argue that the &quot;collective&quot; gets a full workout in modern
society (by means such as ALEC), but that the individual has no
influence in it.  To correct for that omission, then, would be the
purpose of the drafting/discussion tools.

&gt;<i> Am I barking up a good tree here? What are the projects out there
</I>&gt;<i> that I need to be aware of?
</I>
Votorola has a parallel drafting medium (recombinant text) that fully
exposes dissent, with no possibility of suppression.  It was maybe the
first to meet that criterion, and MixedInk was maybe the second.  (I'm
a Votorola developer, myself.)

Votorola's &quot;difference bridge&quot; implements a strong connector between
drafting and discussion.  I don't know of anything close to it, but
it's only a prototype.

Whatever works will be copied of course, and hopefully improved on.
This raises a third problem, in that network effects are going to
force everyone onto a single toolset and (once again) threaten
individual freedom in its relation to collective power.  But Thomas
von der Elbe's &quot;vote mirroring&quot; is probably the solution for that.

&gt;<i> Thanks for any responses and also for what you all are doing for
</I>&gt;<i> governance, FR
</I>
What motivated you to search for drafting tools?  Do you have a
particular legislative project in mind?
