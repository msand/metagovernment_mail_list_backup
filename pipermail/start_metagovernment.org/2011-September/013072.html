<PRE>Consensus may not always be possible. Ignoring in the absence of consensus
may not be prudent.

Would proportionate representation be the solution? People should have the
right to choose or not to choose - they may agree, disagree or ignore any
matter.

A proportionate decision would consider the majority of (agree + ignore) or
(disagree + ignore). The proportionate choice is presented to the people for
a final decision. They would have the right to change their stand before the
final decision .

Does this make sense or is it more confusing?

</I>&gt;<i> political system (in the US at least) has perfected the art of portraying
</I>&gt;<i> something one way when in fact it does completely the opposite (Orwellian
</I>&gt;<i> doublespeak at it's finest).  And this is easy to do because very few have
</I>&gt;<i> the individual financial motivation to invest the time to properly document
</I>&gt;<i> what the issues are and make a clear case to voters, but those who stand to
</I>&gt;<i> profit have vastly more incentive and resources to devote to presenting
</I>&gt;<i> their proposal to the public in whatever way they want.  So the system gets
</I>&gt;<i> abused very easily and the incentives for disinformation are much higher
</I>&gt;<i> than those for truth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Everyone on this mailing list is probably well aware of these things, but
</I>&gt;<i> in my opinion, perhaps the first goal of any kind of collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance / eDemocracy system should be to enable the public to understand
</I>&gt;<i> what the complex reality is behind issues, and what the subtleties and side
</I>&gt;<i> effects may be, and provide features that allow the community to document
</I>&gt;<i> issues/platforms in a clear and formal way (i.e. with references, and with a
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism to ensure objectivity, e.g. allowing subjective statements to be
</I>&gt;<i> flagged, like the &quot;citation needed&quot; flags that exist in many wikipedia
</I>&gt;<i> articles).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe I'm asking too much of a collaborative governance system, and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> most would see that as a separate concern, but would not a c.g. system be
</I>&gt;<i> better off as a secondary layer on top of that type of information / content
</I>&gt;<i> management system, rather than being a separate system?   You can have the
</I>&gt;<i> best voting system in the world, but if the users are not properly informed
</I>&gt;<i> about the complex details of what they're voting on and the government
</I>&gt;<i> /administrative systems affected by that, then you will still get the wrong
</I>&gt;<i> outputs from the voting system, and it may be no more effective against
</I>&gt;<i> corruption and monied influences than the representative systems we have
</I>&gt;<i> today.  Looking forward to hear anyone's feedback on this idea,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Matteo, it is possible for you to reply with standardized e-mail software?
</I>&gt;<i> When you post with a new subject, a new thread is started in the archives,
</I>&gt;<i> and it breaks the consistency of the discussion for anyone wanting to review
</I>&gt;<i> it later:

</I>&gt;<i> It would help to at least preserve the same subject line, if you are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to do so.

</I>&gt;<i> Reply: Tyranny of the majority IS what democracy is all about. There is no

</I>&gt;<i> propose? Tyranny of the minority? There is no way to get around this. Even
</I>&gt;<i> if you propose a law, allow people to discuss this law a thousand of times

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no natural requirement that all governance must be tyrannical or
</I>&gt;<i> oppressive. Democracy does not have to be majority-based. That is simply how
</I>&gt;<i> it has usually been done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is in fact possible for people to come to consensus, if they work hard,
</I>&gt;<i> have the right tools, and want it enough. Collaborative governance offers
</I>&gt;<i> people only two options: find consensus on a new law, or do not pass a law.
</I>&gt;<i> I think either one is better than passing a law that is oppressive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In conclusion, I think the main difference between your approach and my
</I>&gt;<i> ideas is that you are working to create a potentially revolutionary system
</I>&gt;<i> almost from scratch while I think that a more pragmatical approach has more
</I>&gt;<i> chances to success.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with the difference, but not the conclusion. Mixdemocracy is
</I>&gt;<i> pragmatic, but I think it is not possible to do it well. I believe that if
</I>&gt;<i> it starts to gain enough success that it begins to scare the powerful elite,
</I>&gt;<i> they will turn their attention to it, and it will be overwhelmed by
</I>&gt;<i> malicious vandals, outrageous news stories (even if they are not true: that
</I>&gt;<i> never stops these people), and other attacks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative governance is &quot;revolutionary&quot; in that it is an entirely new
</I>&gt;<i> way of doing things, but it is not an attempt to usurp the current power
</I>&gt;<i> structures. Rather, the plan is for it to take hold in small decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> environments, prove itself and adapt to larger and larger ones. As people
</I>&gt;<i> get used to it, they will start to use the tools of the status quo to
</I>&gt;<i> replace those tools with ours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That last step is very much a good place for mixdemocracy to come in: E2D
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;politicians&quot; can be the actors of converting systems to collaborative
</I>&gt;<i> governance. This is a great opportunity for the two initiatives to work
</I>&gt;<i> together (among others, since our software is similar). But I don't know if
</I>&gt;<i> the timing will be right if E2D groups are already taking office while
</I>&gt;<i> collaborative governance software is all still pretty much in alpha or
</I>&gt;<i> pre-alpha.
