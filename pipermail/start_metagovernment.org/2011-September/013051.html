<PRE>hey, are you into visual analytics?

2011/9/21 David Gleason &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">chc_media at yahoo.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> A few random thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - I agree that collaborative governance has to start from the bottom up.
</I>&gt;<i> - c.g. has to be based on open source software, and must be provable as
</I>&gt;<i> mathematically correct, i.e. as simple as possible (see some of Alan Kay's
</I>&gt;<i> recent work e.g. <A HREF="http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/">http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/</A>), and
</I>&gt;<i> inherently bug-free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - The system must deal with sets of simple issues at a granular level, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> things that can be resolved to a single change in a process or resource
</I>&gt;<i> allocation.&#160; These could be grouped into larger things but the granularity
</I>&gt;<i> has to be there to allow the full extent of any proposal to be completely
</I>&gt;<i> clear, with references/sources provided, etc.&#160; That way people can refine
</I>&gt;<i> and comment on individual things as needed, but it won't turn into a huge
</I>&gt;<i> blob of text and subjective interpretations.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software, which
</I>&gt;<i> manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes (resources,
</I>&gt;<i> people, groups, organizations) and dynamic relationships.&#160; In other words it
</I>&gt;<i> has to model the real world.&#160; (Kind of like object-oriented programming, but
</I>&gt;<i> without the emphasis on programming, without the limitations of typical OO
</I>&gt;<i> structures, and with an equal emphasis on the dynamic relationships between
</I>&gt;<i> objects.)&#160; If a system does not accurately capture existing reality, most
</I>&gt;<i> people will not be able to understand the existing reality, what changes or
</I>&gt;<i> optimizations are therefore appropriate, or what effects those changes would
</I>&gt;<i> have.
</I>&gt;<i> (I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing a web
</I>&gt;<i> information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to construct and
</I>&gt;<i> share any type of data structures and relations to model those kinds of
</I>&gt;<i> things.&#160; It's probably many ~6 months away from being useful however.)
</I>&gt;<i> - I think the biggest barrier to collaborative governance of any sort is
</I>&gt;<i> complexity management.&#160; If a framework does not exist that allows reality to
</I>&gt;<i> be accurately visualized and understood by average (non-technical) people,
</I>&gt;<i> for potential changes to be simulated, and for users to provide input on a
</I>&gt;<i> granular basis, then runaway complexity and chaos quickly results.&#160; Which I
</I>&gt;<i> believe is the biggest reason we have the political systems we have today.
</I>&gt;<i> 98% of people don't understand the subtle details of how things really work
</I>&gt;<i> with complex government-related systems, and thus emotion is all they are
</I>&gt;<i> left with for a decision framework.
</I>&gt;<i> One of the biggest deceptions of law is to introduce a faux brand of
</I>&gt;<i> complexity into affairs such that only lawyers and politicians are
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;qualified&quot; to administer things, and the rest of the people are left with
</I>&gt;<i> no sufficiently powerful logical framework from which to counter.&#160; Only when
</I>&gt;<i> science and technology are able to rise to the occasion, surmount their own
</I>&gt;<i> complexities, and provide an inarguably solid framework, will we be able to
</I>&gt;<i> replace the old system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have lots of other ideas too but just thought I'd throw those out there
</I>&gt;<i> for now as I see the information system part of the equation as key.&#160; The
</I>&gt;<i> web as it is today is in many ways just an extension of the concepts of
</I>&gt;<i> print media which came before it and I think there needs to be a radical
</I>&gt;<i> shift in that.&#160; Email chains, blogs, articles, etc. 99% of the time just
</I>&gt;<i> contribute to long blobs of static information that quickly become
</I>&gt;<i> unmanageable, unbounded, and obsolete.&#160; I think that with a dynamic,
</I>&gt;<i> interlinked view of information, an appropriate framework could enable
</I>&gt;<i> information to be built, maintained, and refined as a cohesive interlinked
</I>&gt;<i> structure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example in science or in formal logic, the processes for expanding
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge are set up so you start with known conditions, and add to existing
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge incrementally, i.e. in quantum steps, which over time creates a
</I>&gt;<i> network topology of tightly coupled information.&#160; Which is why science is so
</I>&gt;<i> powerful, because it's all one interlinked set of concepts and information
</I>&gt;<i> which essentially create solid matter out of billions of quantum information
</I>&gt;<i> particles - and in that way mirror reality and the structure of the
</I>&gt;<i> universe.&#160; So far there has been no real way to represent this data in it's
</I>&gt;<i> natural form - it has been forced into the serialized constructs of human
</I>&gt;<i> language such as books, pictures, tables, etc., which results in a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> overspecialization and inefficiency in the sciences.&#160; Anyhow these
</I>&gt;<i> limitations and 'impedance mismatches' between reality and its digital
</I>&gt;<i> representation also extend to most other areas - i.e. politics and
</I>&gt;<i> economics, and thus a huge set of separate pseudo-scientific views result,
</I>&gt;<i> none of which have the depth or continuity to be adopted on a wider scale.
</I>&gt;<i> It's easy to take the current ways of the world for granted and not see the
</I>&gt;<i> significance of aligning information systems&#160;with reality, but I see it as
</I>&gt;<i> being no less significant than the invention of&#160; computers themselves.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyhow just wanted to mention these things and hopefully I'll have some more
</I>&gt;<i> concrete contributions over the next few months :)
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Re: [MG] Mixdemocracy and Collaborative Governance
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm replying to Paul and Matteo in one mailing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Politics in the U.S. are very combative these days, and any software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which is less than rock-solid is going to get severely abused by malicious
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interests.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> M: -&gt;&#160; &#160; This is a point to go for a simpler system. It much easier to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make a simple system &quot;rock-solid&quot; than a complicated one
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Representative democracy is even simpler: just vote once and let the
</I>&gt;<i> politicians take care of the rest. I disagree that simple is a value in
</I>&gt;<i> designing a good system of governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how a simple system would work. Like an open wiki? At least in
</I>&gt;<i> the U.S., that would be a disaster. More below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Who would participate in the software that would tell me what to&#160; do?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may violate the&#160; laws of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the locality: or at least very much aggravate the local&#160; people, since
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> everything else about the status quo is set up with&#160; rigid jurisdictional
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> systems (unlike collaborative governance, which&#160; is much more fluid). If I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> restrict it to just people in the locality&#160; that I represent, then, well...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> what software can support that&#160; restriction today?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P: We, in Belgium, propose to have several rounds
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. a proposal of law
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. anyone can propose and discuss amendments but the person(s) who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> submitted the proposal stay in charge of the proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3. a first round of voting give an idea of the social support and has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reach a threshold (2%) comparable with the signature gathering
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. if the threshold is reached a vote can be launched for all citizens
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concerned (in Belgium, like in Spain ,... we have all an electronic identity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> card like a bank card)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just don't see how I could effect this in the U.S. as a political
</I>&gt;<i> candidate. If I get into office, there will be publicity around it, and
</I>&gt;<i> people here will make it a point to abuse my website. What is to stop that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> M: -&gt; You can set up a system with reciprocal recognition of user
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locality. I invite a friend as new user and I guarantee his location.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instant messaging on mobile phone also work this way. There are some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical methods to do that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where is this system? Michael has devised something like this, but I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think it is ready to go live. How could I do this today?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3. If any of those above malicious interests play with the inputs or&#160; if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> anything else goes wrong, it can make a very bad name for our&#160; entire
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> movement. What if I find that the website ends up having me&#160; support the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> legalization of rape and murder? That could be easily&#160; accomplished by
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> people deliberately getting together to make me look&#160; bad. What is to stop
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that? Or what if the software just doesn't work&#160; right: then what am I
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> supposed to do in the legislature (or whatever&#160; body I am in)? Just abstain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> until a new version of the software comes&#160; out? How would that look?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That are all assumptions that do not materialise. If you don't trust
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people (in great numbers) democracy is not possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Our example in sweden (demoex) shows that it did not happen. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initiatives in direct democracy are also proving that it is not happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe your political process is more friendly. I do trust the people in
</I>&gt;<i> general, but I do not trust all the people all the time. Here in the U.S.,
</I>&gt;<i> there are extremely villainous political elements. They will stop at nothing
</I>&gt;<i> to win an election, to smear an opponent, or to get their way. I cannot see
</I>&gt;<i> how they could restrain themselves from trying to destroy a mixdemocracy
</I>&gt;<i> candidate, when that candidate clearly is a threat to the source of their
</I>&gt;<i> power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> M: -&gt; No, this will not be possible for the reason you stated above, as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people will require to get tens of thousands of people sign a law allowing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rape and murder and this will not happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's in a California referendum. If I run for my local city council, it
</I>&gt;<i> would only take a few people to tell me what to do on my website, would it
</I>&gt;<i> not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Even if everything goes right, our movement could still get a bad
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid ideas (of which there are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> plenty in the U.S.). Collaborative governance works on the principle&#160; that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus decision-making only allows the best decisions to pass.&#160; But in a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> less complex system, what is there besides majority rule? Super-majority
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> rule? That's still nothing like real consensus-through- synthesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P: consensus has to be reached if possible and it is more often possible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then we might think. But thinking that it is always possible is an illusion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in my view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it is always possible, but it is always necessary. When it is
</I>&gt;<i> not possible, then why should there be a law? Why force laws on an unwilling
</I>&gt;<i> populace? Governance without consent of the people is not democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> M: -&gt; If you do not trust people to be able to write good laws, and you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think they may vote for stupid law in mass, so you are against the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> principle of direct democracy, in my opinion.&#160; Laws that look intelligent to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you will look stupid to other people, and viceversa.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe in democracy, but no I do not trust mob rule. Just letting the mob
</I>&gt;<i> decide anything on a whim is a proven disaster. It is open to demagoguery,
</I>&gt;<i> which is where they can be swayed by rhetoric into doing stupid things. A
</I>&gt;<i> prime example: George W Bush was able to leverage the 9/11 attacks into
</I>&gt;<i> massive support for invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. A consensus system
</I>&gt;<i> would not have allowed that, because 10-20% of the American populace was
</I>&gt;<i> vehemently opposed to those invasions. But since a large majority was worked
</I>&gt;<i> into a frenzy by political rhetoric, it happened. That's the failure of
</I>&gt;<i> allowing the mob to rule without some sort of check. It is not democracy, it
</I>&gt;<i> is more like anarchy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Technically, how does it work in something like a city council.&#160; There
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> is usually a docket of topics for a city council, so if I were a&#160; council
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> member, I could ask the website what people want me to vote on&#160; those. But
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> how do I vote when someone raises a new issue within a&#160; council meeting? Or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> a motion? Do I always have to abstain until I&#160; consult the website? What
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> about committees? Can I participate in a&#160; committee? Those do a lot of their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> work without making any votes, and&#160; then vote at the end: how do I draw the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> populace into that?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P: demoex works there (Vallentuna near stockholm) since 2002.&#160; Talk to Per
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Norback, he is doiing it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to contact Demoex without success before. I guess I'll try again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> To me, direct democracy and representative democracy are enormously
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different. I have yet to be convinced of how or why they should be&#160; forced
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> together in some weird hybrid when we have a means to start&#160; implementing
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> collaborative governance as a ground-up replacement.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> P: yes, but if we wait until politicians allow us to make our own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions it will take decades.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative governance is an alternate system, designed to rise up from
</I>&gt;<i> the roots without any support, help, or acceptance by politicians.
