Another point concerning ties: the fact that decisions are sometimes  
decided by a single vote is not really an argument in favor of the  
system. It means that sweeping power was given to one person in the  
midst of a strongly divided populace. It is the true 50%+1 tyranny of  
the majority. Or much more often, it is really the tyranny of the  
minority, since 1. often there are more than just two candidates and  
2. rarely do even half the people vote.

Michael, that's simply brilliant.

If you have the time, I'd suggest you encode some of what you've said  
in this thread into the Metagov site. Perhaps here?
