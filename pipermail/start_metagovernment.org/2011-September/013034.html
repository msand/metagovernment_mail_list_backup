They would be pushed apart, however, by any promotion of collaborative
governance.  Collaborative governance is just a method.  Other methods
include direct democratic parties, non-party primaries, primary
legislation, and the various technical projects.  We have no knowledge
of which methods are likely to succeed, or in what combination.

If we transcend partisanship, then all that is left is the common
goal.  Your movie script brought to mind my past attempts to
communicate the moral argument of freedom.  Those attempts always
failed because I failed to put my finger on the precise point of
injustice in the status quo.  That point was somehow hidden from view,
and I don't know if anyone ever noticed it till now.  Here is how I
see it:

   I used to believe that I was free because I lived in a democracy
   and had a vote; but the truth is, I have no political freedom at
   all.  Whether I vote or not, and regardless of who I vote for:

     (a) the candidates are chosen ahead of time, and I have no
         influence over the choice;
     (b) the course of the election is unaffected by my vote;
     (c) the outcome is the same, regardless;
     (d) state power is unaffected; and
     (e) the laws are unaffected.

   If I disobey (d) state power or (e) the laws, then I am brought
   into submission by force.  The powers that affect me are unaffected
   by any comparable power of mine.  In regard to my political
   freedom, I might as well live in China or Saudi Arabia.
   Disobedience is my only freedom, and yet the cost of exercising it
   is physical confinement or worse.  In this regard, it follows that
   I am a slave.

This is almost impossible to swallow.  At the same time, it is true.
Please point out flaws in the argument (anyone).  There is a corollary
as well, which is somewhat dangerous:

   By a corollary, state power has no moral authority or legitimacy.

Something must give here, becayse there is too much tension wound up
in it.  We cannot really blame anyone because nobody ever noticed it
before.  But now that we notice it ...

&gt;<i> ... I wish Thomas were able to contribute, as he has proven to be
</I>&gt;<i> one of the best at this.  Have you heard anything from him recently?
</I>&gt;<i> I can start drafting a charter, but would rather he took a shot at
</I>&gt;<i> it if he is available to do so.
</I>
He might be back any day now, or it might be longer.  He left a fairly
wide window.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  3. New resources (people, money) are sought on the basis of past
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     accomplishments in respect of the goal.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I would especially emphasize the first two.  The script you floated
