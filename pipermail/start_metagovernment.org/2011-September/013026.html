I'd like to caution on the distinction between setting up something  
that can work on one piece of legislation and something which can work  
on all legislation.

When people get focused into one issue, that issue tends to polarize  
into camps and the issue tends to grow into something larger than it  
really should be. California is a great example of how this can go  
wrong, as you see referenda taking on the force of huge campaigns,  
when their focus is really a tiny fraction of the important issues in  
the state.

The idea behind collaborative governance (at least as I see it) is to  
enable individuals to participate in every decision. That  
fundamentally changes the nature of their participation. Because  
instead of everyone getting emotional and frenzied about one simple  
issue, people scatter into the issues that really matter to them. That  
is, instead of millions of people raging at each other about whether  
or not to tighten immigration, you may instead see a few hundred  
people working on how farmers can better take in their crops without  
promoting immigration problems while another few hundred might be  
working on a way to make public healthcare for immigrants work for the  
social good without being a direct contributor to increasing  
immigration. (Just entirely made up examples, mind you.)

Allowing people to contribute to one piece of legislation lets them  
into the process, but only in that one little way. Those who actually  
feel empowered by this access would probably be inclined to leverage  
this little bit of power as much as they can, and the end legislation  
may suffer from the results.

So what I am suggesting is that you keep your expectations small in  
terms of community. It is good that you are focusing on a local  
legislature. I would suggest you go as micro-local as you can: such as  
one department in one township, or even smaller to something like a  
home owners' association. In such small communities, you then have the  
opportunity to really open up all the decision-making, since the  
overall number of decisions and issues are manageable in number. If  
collaborative governance can prove itself in these small domains, it  
can then begin scaling up as it gains acceptance and the tools mature.
