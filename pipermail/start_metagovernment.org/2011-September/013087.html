It's okay, it's not so much a reading topic, because we're still
talking about it. :-)

Anyway, I call those &quot;solutions&quot;.  It's been dawning on me that we
need *first* to speak of the problem.  I was hoping this would be a
constructive point to raise in this thread.  In the movie script (to
explain), you gave &quot;the problem&quot; a starring role.  I think that's what
we need to do in reality, too.  We need to speak of the problem
*without regard* to any solution.  Only then can it be a guide for
societal engineering.  This is crucial.  The rationalization of
society is the structural embodiment of reason, and all our work of
restructuring (and communicating) must be in reference to that reason,
which begins with a concrete and immediate problem.

See how that reason explains even the rhetorical power of the first
person narrative - &quot;I used to believe that I was free...&quot;?  No
abstractions in that, it's all factual, sincere and above the table.

Moreover, what reason cannot explain, reason hits like a hammer.

&gt;<i> Michael, if I want to start writing a charter, how do I do so within  
</I>&gt;<i> the Votorola and/or Outcast framework? I really don't know how to  
</I>&gt;<i> start. In working on the &quot;Draft Rules&quot; collaboration, Thomas started  
</I>&gt;<i> out by drafting in his userspace in the Metagov wiki. Is that what I  
</I>&gt;<i> would do? Make something like /User:Ed_Pastore/Charter ?
</I>
I guess there's no wrong way to get started.  I prefer to begin with a
single sentence in the mailing list before going further, just to see
if people can agree, or even want to talk about it.  (All the time we
see monster documents that nobody wants, not even the author.)

&gt;<i> Then what? I am being deliberately dull here. I think I could figure  
</I>&gt;<i> out a lot of it by backtracing that process (which is how I  
</I>&gt;<i> participated in it), but if you state it here, then you've documented  
</I>&gt;<i> it, right? Or is it already documented?
</I>
Dumb user ... ;-)
You could cross those bridges when you come to them.  There's really
no wrong way to proceed.  You could migrate to a wiki later, or
whatever, when you needed to.
