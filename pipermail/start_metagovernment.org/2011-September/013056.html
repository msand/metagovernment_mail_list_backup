Thank you Paul, I'll have a look.

&gt;<i> sorry, plebiscites don't belong to the tools of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.

Not at all, my mistake.  You were referring to direct democracy in
California and Switzerland so maybe the correct word is &quot;initiative&quot;.
I restate my questions (I hope) in correct form:

I'm not familiar with [initiative] systems, since we don't use them
here.  I know they are meant to provide a means to participate in a
legislative process that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.
So, for instance, when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I
have no effective means of influencing its content, or amendments, or
likelihood of passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection
of law makers who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey
the law if they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to
that law, but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.

My questions concern the case of an [initiative] system as it operates
in California, Switzerland and other direct democracies (as you say):

  1. When an [initiative] is prepared and presented, what effective
     means do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
     likelihood of passage?

  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
     case of ordinary legislation?

  3. How therefore does the initiative offer me an opportunity of
     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
     oppression?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Paul,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for replying.  Thanks also to Ed for starting this thread.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hopeful we can recognize a common cause here, despite our differences
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in methodology.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Living in a community means acceptance of some rules. Call it a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &quot;social contract&quot;. If democracy (in the real sence) starts in rather
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; small communities who are free to accept associations (right of free
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; association), and also te right to leave them if they want (right of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; secession), there should be choice enough for most of us who are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; willing to pay the price of living in a community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I agree, that would be nearly ideal.  Competition would then do the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; work of ensuring that societies in general were respectful of freedoms
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and other human rights, since each individual could easily vote with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; his/her feet, as they say.  Even better would be to remain in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; society we find ourselves in, to speak with one's fellows and work
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together to solve the problems we confront.  Then one could truly say,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;This is my society.&quot;  - and, on looking around at the others and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; recognizing that each is equally responsible, &quot;This is our society.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe that would be the fullest expression of political freedom.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; That is probably one of the reasons that the direct democracy in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Switserland is very differenciated between the canton's and is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; working totally different compared to California who is probably the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; greatest (in numbers) &quot;direct democracy&quot; in the world. Comparing all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; those &quot;democratic evolutions&quot; is very interesting (one of us
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; attended the &quot;2010 Global Forum on Modern Direct Democracy&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> you have to make a distinction between &quot;plebiscite&quot; who is a referendum on 
</I>&gt;<i> government  initiative and the citizens initiated &quot;initiatives and 
</I>&gt;<i> referendum&quot;. Plebiscites are prohibited in Switzerland.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I have several questions.  I'm less familiar with plebiscite systems,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or referenda, or petitions, since we don't use them here.  I know they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are meant to provide a means to participate in a legislative process
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.  So, for instance,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I have no effective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; means of influencing its content, or amendments, or likelihood of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection of law makers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey the law if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to that law,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  1. When a plebiscite is prepared and presented, what effective means
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     likelihood of passage?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     oppression?
