I agree, it's a concern.  But provided vote mirroring works as
planned, the user will have a maximum of freedom in choosing his/her
own voting facilities, including the mirroring service:

So this is maybe a case where it's better to vote with your feet than
to spend lots of time negotiating settlements.  In extremity, you can
always set up your own mirror and do the translations as you like.
Openness to such innovation is one of the purposes of vote mirroring,
and it applies recursively to the mirroring system, as well.
