<PRE>@David&quot;Matteo, I think you misunderstood me. Maybe in your country the laws are simple and everyone understands them very easily, but often in the US and in&#160;California&#160;(where I live), the proposed laws and initiatives are often intentionally written to be complex - and even smart and well educated people often do not take the time to read the many pages of complicated legal language, or fully understand the implementation implications or alternatives. Therefore voters will often rely on the opinions they see in the media to make their judgements.&quot;
-&gt; Got that. So what shall we do? You are claiming that people are influenced by the media and uncapable to understand the technicalities of the laws they should be voting for but then you ask them do spend hours of their time in writing and amending packages of laws.I think the principle of Votorola has high possibilities of not becoming successful for the following reasons:1) any effort to have a system like Votorola become successful would require a good part of the population to take part in the law-building process. If only few individuals take part in the law-building process then for the powerful elites it will be easier to hire 2000-20000 persons and drift the whole process away but..2) any effort to have many many people (millions?) participate in the law-drafting process would be undoable as the process would become too confused (can you imagine having a million people each one with his different vision discuss about issues) and people do not
 have ten hours of time per day to dedicate in writing laws.
&quot;And if you were to claim that a large majority of voters all take the time to fully understand all the issues and could not benefit from the help of better tools to make understanding the issues easier, you would only be fooling yourself.&quot;
-&gt; If you think the large majority of the voters will not understand the issues how do you think they will spend hours in reading and amending each law? Who will actually do this job? If you assume only few people will take part in the process, then who will block big companies to hire ten thousands of people to rewrite the law as they want to?&#160;If you assume a large part of the population will take part in the process, do you really think you can manage one or ten million people all trying to write-rewrite and amend each single law?
