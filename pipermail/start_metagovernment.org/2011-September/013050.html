<PRE>A few random thoughts:


- I agree that collaborative governance has to start from the bottom up.

- c.g. has to be based on open source software,and must be provable as mathematically correct, i.e. as simple as possible (see some of Alan Kay's recent work e.g. <A HREF="http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/">http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/</A>), and inherently bug-free.


- The system must deal with sets of simple issues at a granular level, i.e. things that can be resolved to a single change in a process or resource allocation.&#160; These could be grouped into larger things but the granularity has to be there to allow the full extent of any proposal to be completely clear, with references/sources provided, etc.&#160; That way people can refine and comment on individual things as needed, but it won't turn into a huge blob of text and subjective interpretations.


- A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software, which manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes (resources, people, groups, organizations) and dynamic relationships.&#160; In other words it has to model the real world.&#160; (Kind of like object-oriented programming, but without the emphasis on programming, without the limitations of typical OO structures, and with an equal emphasis on the dynamic relationships between objects.)&#160; If a system does not accurately capture existing reality, most people will not be able to understand the existing reality, what changes or optimizations are therefore appropriate, or what effects those changes would have.

(I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing a web information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to construct and share any type of data structures and relations to model those kinds of things.&#160; It's probably many ~6 months away from being useful however.)

- I think the biggest barrier to collaborative governance of any sort is complexity management.&#160; If a framework does not exist that allows reality to be accurately visualized and understood by average (non-technical) people, for potential changes to be simulated, and for users to provide input on a granular basis, then runaway complexity and chaos quickly results.&#160; Which I believe is the biggest reason we have the political systems we have today.&#160; 98% of people don't understand the subtle details of how things really work with complex government-related systems, and thus emotion is all they are left with for a decision framework.

One of the biggest deceptions of law is to introduce a faux brand of complexity into affairs such that only lawyers and politicians are &quot;qualified&quot; to administer things, and the rest of the people are left with no sufficiently powerful logical framework from which to counter.&#160; Only when science and technology are able to rise to the occasion, surmount their own complexities, and provide an inarguably solid framework, will we be able to replace the old system.


I have lots of other ideas too but just thought I'd throw those out there for now as I see the information system part of the equation as key.&#160; The web as it is today is
 in many ways just an extension of the concepts of print media which came before it and I think there needs to be a radical shift in that.&#160; Email chains, blogs, articles, etc. 99% of the time just contribute to long blobs of static information that quickly become unmanageable, unbounded, and obsolete.&#160; I think that with a dynamic, interlinked view of information, an appropriate framework could enable information to be built, maintained, and refined as a cohesive interlinked structure.

For example in science or in formal logic, the processes for expanding knowledge are set up so you 
start with known conditions, and add to existing knowledge incrementally, i.e. in quantum steps, which over time creates a network topology of tightly coupled information.&#160; Which is 
why science is so powerful, because it's 
all one interlinked set of concepts and information which essentially create solid matter out of billions of quantum 
information particles - and in that way mirror reality and the structure of the universe.&#160; So far there has been no real 
way to represent this data in it's natural form - it has been 
forced into the serialized constructs of human language such as books, pictures, tables, etc., which results in a lot of overspecialization and inefficiency in the sciences.&#160; Anyhow these limitations and 'impedance mismatches' between reality and its digital representation also 
extend to most other areas - i.e. politics and economics, and thus a 
huge set of separate pseudo-scientific views result, none of which have the depth or continuity to be adopted on a wider scale.&#160; It's easy to take the 
current ways of the world for granted and not see the significance of 
aligning information systems&#160;with reality, but I see it as being no 
less significant than the invention of&#160; 
computers themselves.&#160; Anyhow just wanted to mention these things and hopefully I'll have some more concrete contributions over the next few months :)


-David

Subject: Re: [MG] Mixdemocracy and Collaborative Governance

I'm replying to Paul and Matteo in one
 mailing:


&gt;<i> &quot;Politics in the U.S. are very combative these days, and any software which is less than rock-solid is
</I> going to get severely abused by malicious interests.&quot;
&gt;<i> M: -&gt;&#160; &#160; This is a point to go for a simpler system. It much easier to make a simple system &quot;rock-solid&quot; than a complicated one
</I>

Representative democracy is even simpler: just vote once and let the politicians take care of the rest. I disagree that simple is a value in designing a good system of governance.

I don't see how a simple system would work. Like an open wiki? At least in the U.S., that would be a disaster. More below.

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Who would participate in the software that would tell me what to&#160; do? If I allow everyone in the world, that very well may violate the&#160; laws of the locality: or at least very much aggravate the local&#160; people, since everything else about the status quo is set up with&#160; rigid jurisdictional systems (unlike collaborative governance, which&#160; is much more fluid). If I restrict it to just people in the
</I> locality&#160; that I represent, then, well... what software can support that&#160; restriction today?
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P: We, in Belgium, propose to have several rounds
</I>&gt;<i> 1. a proposal of law
</I>&gt;<i> 2. anyone can propose and discuss amendments but the person(s) who submitted the proposal stay in charge of the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> 3. a first round of voting give an idea of the social support and has to reach a threshold (2%) comparable with the signature gathering
</I>&gt;<i> 4. if the threshold is reached a vote can be launched for all citizens concerned (in Belgium, like in Spain ,... we have all an electronic identity card like a bank card)
</I>
I just don't see how I could effect this in the U.S. as a political candidate. If I get into office, there will be publicity around it, and people here will make it a point to abuse my website. What is to stop that?

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; You can set up a system with reciprocal recognition of user locality. I
</I> invite a friend as new user and I guarantee his location. Instant messaging on mobile phone also work this way. There are some technical methods to do that.

Where is this system? Michael has devised something like this, but I don't think it is ready to go live. How could I do this today?

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. If any of those above malicious interests play with the inputs or&#160; if anything else goes wrong, it can make a very bad name for our&#160; entire movement. What if I find that the website ends up having me&#160; support the legalization of rape and murder? That could be easily&#160; accomplished by people deliberately getting together to make me look&#160; bad. What is to stop that? Or what if the software just doesn't work&#160; right: then what am I supposed to do in the legislature (or whatever&#160; body I am in)? Just abstain until a new version of the software comes&#160; out? How would that look?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That are all
</I> assumptions that do not materialise. If you don't trust people (in great numbers) democracy is not possible.
&gt;<i> Our example in sweden (demoex) shows that it did not happen. And initiatives in direct democracy are also proving that it is not happening.
</I>
Maybe your political process is more friendly. I do trust the people in general, but I do not trust all the people all the time. Here in the U.S., there are extremely villainous political elements. They will stop at nothing to win an election, to smear an opponent, or to get their way. I cannot see how they could restrain themselves from trying to destroy a mixdemocracy candidate, when that candidate clearly is a threat to the source of their power.

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; No, this will not be possible for the reason you stated above, as people will require to get tens of thousands of people sign a law allowing rape and murder and this will not happen.
</I>
That's in a California referendum. If
 I run for my local city council, it would only take a few people to tell me what to do on my website, would it not?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Even if everything goes right, our movement could still get a bad reputation for promoting populist-but-stupid ideas (of which there are plenty in the U.S.). Collaborative governance works on the principle&#160; that consensus decision-making only allows the best decisions to pass.&#160; But in a less complex system, what is there besides majority rule? Super-majority rule? That's still nothing like real consensus-through- synthesis.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P: consensus has to be reached if possible and it is more often possible then we might think. But thinking that it is always possible is an illusion in my view.
</I>
I don't think it is always possible, but it is always necessary. When it is not possible, then why should there be a law? Why force laws on an unwilling populace? Governance without consent of the
 people is not democracy.

&gt;<i> M: -&gt; If you do not trust people to be able to write good laws, and you think they may vote for stupid law in mass, so you are against the very principle of direct democracy, in my opinion.&#160; Laws that look intelligent to you will look stupid to other people, and viceversa.
</I>

I believe in democracy, but no I do not trust mob rule. Just letting the mob decide anything on a whim is a proven disaster. It is open to demagoguery, which is where they can be swayed by rhetoric into doing stupid things. A prime example: George W Bush was able to leverage the 9/11 attacks into massive support for invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. A consensus system would not have allowed that, because 10-20% of the American populace was vehemently opposed to those invasions. But since a large majority was worked into a frenzy by political rhetoric, it happened. That's the failure of allowing the mob to rule without some sort
 of check. It is not democracy, it is more like anarchy.

&gt;&gt;<i> 5. Technically, how does it work in something like a city council.&#160; There is usually a docket of topics for a city council, so if I were a&#160; council member, I could ask the website what people want me to vote on&#160; those. But how do I vote when someone raises a new issue within a&#160; council meeting? Or a motion? Do I always have to abstain until I&#160; consult the website? What about committees? Can I participate in a&#160; committee? Those do a lot of their work without making any votes, and&#160; then vote at the end: how do I draw the populace into that?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P: demoex works there (Vallentuna near stockholm) since 2002.&#160; Talk to Per Norback, he is doiing it.
</I>
I've tried to contact Demoex without success before. I guess I'll try again.

&gt;&gt;<i> To me, direct democracy and representative democracy are enormously different. I have yet to
</I> be convinced of how or why they should be&#160; forced together in some weird hybrid when we have a means to start&#160; implementing collaborative governance as a ground-up replacement.
&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> P: yes, but if we wait until politicians allow us to make our own decisions it will take decades.
</I>
Collaborative governance is an alternate system, designed to rise up from the roots without any support, help, or acceptance by politicians.
