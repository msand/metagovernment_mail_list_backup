<PRE>Hi Allan,

your remarks are correct and I experience them daily in a kayak club of who 
I am a member. If you can resolve your remarks for a small club or community 
we can work it out for a bigger community also.
Members who are only &quot;users&quot; and don't participate in the internal working 
of the club whatsoever are facing the results of internal decision making 
processes without any means of influencing the working of the club. They 
only can make remarks about the the things that goes wrong afterwards.
But they always have the possibility to take their kayak and paddle on their 
own.

Paul

Subject: [MG] Initiatives


&gt;<i> Hi Paul, thank you for answering.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  1. When an [initiative] is prepared and presented, what effective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     means do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     likelihood of passage?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Paul Nollen wrote:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An itinitiative is prepared by a citizen, a group of citizens or an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing organisation. They can launch a call to help to prepare the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initiative. The more help , debate and critisism while developing an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initiative the more chanche that it will appeal to a great number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people and that most critics are already met.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is why we hope to incorporate this developing stadium in our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That makes sense, as far as it goes.  If the initiative has little
</I>&gt;<i> support as yet, then the initial supporters will have considerable
</I>&gt;<i> leverage with which to negotiate amendments in return for their
</I>&gt;<i> support.  So far, so good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, by the time the initiative comes to my own attention, it will
</I>&gt;<i> be a take-it-or-leave it affair.  Even if I had time to spend, my
</I>&gt;<i> personal efforts at negotiation and revision would be unlikely to make
</I>&gt;<i> any head-way against the dead weight those who already support it.  My
</I>&gt;<i> effective means of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;<i> likelihood of passage, would therefore be nil.  I feel you must
</I>&gt;<i> address this problem, if you wish to use terms like &quot;direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     case of ordinary legislation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is a citizens initiative and the citizens decide how they develop
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the initiative. They have only to gain if they prepare it well with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the broadest consensus possible because once launched it can't be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> altered anymore.  Therfore surveys must give the proposal a great
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> majority (70% for example) before it starts because opposition has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to start yet. If you start with 70% without organised opposition it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is maybe possible to get the 50% needed.  Ordinary legislation need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> only a very small majority to agree (some tens of people?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To me (the citizen) this appears to be no different than ordinary
</I>&gt;<i> legislation.  I have no influence over it.  Regardless of what I
</I>&gt;<i> happen to think, and regardless of any reasonable effort of mine to
</I>&gt;<i> voice objections and request amendments, the initiative will be
</I>&gt;<i> imposed upon me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  3. How therefore does the initiative offer me an opportunity of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     of oppression?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is a continuous development to a more acceptable society. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> question is &quot;what is better if I compare system A (representative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy) with system B (direct democracy)&quot;. Is system B better,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fine I accept it with the freedom of the possibility of developping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a system C. Even that is only possible in system C in our case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And for me the citizen, how is this better?  I already live in a
</I>&gt;<i> democracy and I am unable to participate as an equal citizen in
</I>&gt;<i> political affairs.  Now they will give me direct democracy and again I
</I>&gt;<i> will be unable to participate.  In this regard, the name &quot;direct
</I>&gt;<i> democracy&quot; merely adds insult to the original injury.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the stakes were anything less crucial than political freedom, then
</I>&gt;<i> it would be easier to accept an incremental improvement as a side
</I>&gt;<i> benefit.  But the only credible way to make up for the broken promise
</I>&gt;<i> of democracy is to redeem that promise.  Before we can redeem it with
</I>&gt;<i> technology, however, we must know exactly what the promise was, and
</I>&gt;<i> how (in a technical sense) it got broken.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will post my own thoughts in the &quot;Freedom&quot; thread, please critique
</I>&gt;<i> freely.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Thank you Paul, I'll have a look.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; sorry, plebiscites don't belong to the tools of &quot;direct democracy&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Not at all, my mistake.  You were referring to direct democracy in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; California and Switzerland so maybe the correct word is &quot;initiative&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I restate my questions (I hope) in correct form:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The initiative is a law proposal on citizens initiative and the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> referendum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is a submission to vote on a law that is proposed by the government.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> About the &quot;50% majority&quot; , also this is no &quot;natural law&quot;. The Swiss
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> developed the &quot;double majority&quot; system for federal referendum. (50 % of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> swiss + 50% in half of the cantons, that way inserting some kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> geografic consent also)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not familiar with [initiative] systems, since we don't use them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; here.  I know they are meant to provide a means to participate in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; legislative process that is ordinarily off limits to me as a citizen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; So, for instance, when a conventional bill is prepared in committee, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; have no effective means of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; likelihood of passage.  Nor do I have any influence in the selection
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of law makers who sit in the assembly and vote on it.  Yet I must obey
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the law if they pass it.  Consequently, I have no freedom in regard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; that law, but rather (it follows) I am in bondage to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; My questions concern the case of an [initiative] system as it operates
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; in California, Switzerland and other direct democracies (as you say):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  1. When an [initiative] is prepared and presented, what effective
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     means do I have of influencing its content, or amendments, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     likelihood of passage?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> An itinitiative is prepared by a citizen, a group of citizens or an 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> existing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> organisation. They can launch a call to help to prepare the initiative. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more help , debate and critisism while developing an initiative the more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> chanche that it will appeal to a great number of people and that most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critics are already met.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is why we hope to incorporate this developing stadium in our website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;  2. How do these means differ in effect from those provided in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     case of ordinary legislation?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It is a citizens initiative and the citizens decide how they develop the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initiative. They have only to gain if they prepare it well with the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> broadest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus possible because once launched it can't be altered anymore.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> example)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     political freedom, as opposed to a threat (as I might take it) of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;     oppression?
