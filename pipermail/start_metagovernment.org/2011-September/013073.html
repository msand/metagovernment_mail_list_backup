<PRE>-&gt; Matteo, it is possible for you to reply with standardized e-mail software? When you post with a new subject, a new thread is started in the archives, and it breaks the consistency of the discussion for anyone wanting to review it later:<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/thread.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011-September/thread.html</A>
It would help to at least preserve the same subject line, if you are&#160;willing to do so.

Reply: Hi, sorry for all the confusion I am making with the mails, but it is already a few weeks that I am trying to understand how to get the
 system Pipermail to see my comments as &quot;replies&quot; to previous comments, failing to do so. Do I just need to use the same subject I get as Subject of the new mail? I will try to do so and see what happens. Again, sorry for the problems. Also, sometimes in my comments I get some strange characters when they appear on the board, maybe due to the fact that I am using a Japanese keyboard, I dunno.

-&gt;&#160;There is no natural requirement that all governance must be tyrannical&#160;or oppressive. Democracy does not have to be majority-based. That is&#160;simply how it has usually been done.Reply: most of the people may not see the current government form as oppressive already today, so, &quot;tyrannical&quot; and &quot;oppressive&quot; are subjective terms. As for being or not &quot;democracy-based&quot; I do not see any alternative to that, not a better one at least. At the end, no matter how much you discuss and work to amend the law, there will always be
 people in favour and against it. You have to have a voting at the end, and you have to leave some people unhappy. The system Votorola proposes is a potentially more flexible system that allows to mitigate slightly the problem by allowing people trying to minimize their difference, but at the end the problem will still be there. The problem that I see is that, making the system more flexible, you are assuming that many people will take advantage of this flexibility and will take time to learn how to use it. I fear this assumption may be very wrong.
-&gt; It is in fact possible for people to come to consensus, if they work&#160;hard, have the right tools, and want it enough. Collaborative&#160;governance offers people only two options: find consensus on a new&#160;law, or do not pass a law. I think either one is better than passing a&#160;law that is oppressive.Reply: I do not agree that it is possible to come to
 consensus all the times, not even most of the times. Look at issues like abortion, gay marriage and tell me if you really think you can have a law that makes happy both sides. Impossible, in my opinion. In any case, in my opinion, the main problem is another one. Most people will NOT work hard on any system to draft the law. This is the point and you can already understand this form how politics work in any country. You will have a very small number of people (in percentage) that will work hard to learn how to use the system and draft a law. The vast majority of the people will probably vote sometimes, or not even bother to vote at all, let alone spend hours of time in order to understand how to amend a law. This is the main point, it is not a technical issue, but a practical one. And if the number of people who work hard to draft a law is small, you do not need a new systemfor them, they can just discuss the details in a forum and prepare a law using
 any software or no software at all.
-&gt; I agree with the difference, but not the conclusion. Mixdemocracy is pragmatic, but I think it is not possible to do it well. I believe&#160;that if it starts to gain enough success that it begins to scare the&#160;powerful elite, they will turn their attention to it, and it will be&#160;overwhelmed by malicious vandals, outrageous news stories (even if&#160;they are not true: that never stops these people), and other attacks.Reply: I do not think that the powerful elite is so powerful to overthrow a system which works. You are probably overestimating them. Gaddafi was very powerful a year ago, now he is gone, thanks to Facebook and Twitter as well. Same for Mubarak. They could not stop the people when they are together. They would not turn down mobile phones and computers, the same will happen here. Who cares if someone speaks bad about the founder of FB or Twitter? Nobody
 cares as the system works. They can write all the new stories they want, but if people feel that the system works fine, they will use it no matter what. All the issue is about making a system that people use, not care about how the powerful elite will react.
-&gt;&#160;Collaborative governance is &quot;revolutionary&quot; in that it is an entirely&#160;new way of doing things, but it is not an attempt to usurp the current&#160;power structures. Rather, the plan is for it to take hold in small&#160;decision-making environments, prove itself and adapt to larger and&#160;larger ones. As people get used to it, they will start to use the tools of the status quo to replace those tools with ours.Reply: history shows that revolutionary changes often(always?) start with small steps in the right direction. Nobody developed the whole internet from scratch, it was just few Universities doing some experiment of connection using DARPA at the beginning, Facebook was a simple tool to exchange photos among friends.&#160;
-&gt;&#160;But I don't know if the timing will be right if E2D groups&#160;are already taking office while collaborative governance software is&#160;all still pretty much in alpha or pre-alpha.Reply: As I said, I really wish Votorola success, I would be very happy if the system works and gets wide adoption, but I do not see this happening. I really would be happy to be proven wrong. In the mean time, a comedian posted some easy questions on his blog and got 50000+ replies. Something to think about I fear.
