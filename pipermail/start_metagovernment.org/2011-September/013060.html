&gt;<i> A few random thoughts:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - I agree that collaborative governance has to start from the bottom up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - c.g. has to be based on open source software,and must be provable as
</I>&gt;<i> mathematically correct, i.e. as simple as possible (see some of Alan
</I>&gt;<i> Kay's recent work e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/">http://www.tele-task.de/de/archive/video/flash/14029/</A>), and inherently
</I>&gt;<i> bug-free.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The system must deal with sets of simple issues at a granular level,
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. things that can be resolved to a single change in a process or
</I>&gt;<i> resource allocation.  These could be grouped into larger things but the
</I>&gt;<i> granularity has to be there to allow the full extent of any proposal to
</I>&gt;<i> be completely clear, with references/sources provided, etc.  That way
</I>&gt;<i> people can refine and comment on individual things as needed, but it
</I>&gt;<i> won't turn into a huge blob of text and subjective interpretations.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - A network-oriented architecture must be taken in the software, which
</I>&gt;<i> manages complexity by modeling things as networks of nodes (resources,
</I>&gt;<i> people, groups, organizations) and dynamic relationships.  In other
</I>&gt;<i> words it has to model the real world.  (Kind of like object-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> programming, but without the emphasis on programming, without the
</I>&gt;<i> limitations of typical OO structures, and with an equal emphasis on the
</I>&gt;<i> dynamic relationships between objects.)  If a system does not accurately
</I>&gt;<i> capture existing reality, most people will not be able to understand the
</I>&gt;<i> existing reality, what changes or optimizations are therefore
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate, or what effects those changes would have.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (I see this above point as the biggest issue, and am now developing a
</I>&gt;<i> web information system that makes it easy for non-programmers to
</I>&gt;<i> construct and share any type of data structures and relations to model
</I>&gt;<i> those kinds of things.  It's probably many ~6 months away from being
</I>&gt;<i> useful however.)

Hi! I'm also has a lot of id&#233;as about how to model the world with all
the types of relations.

I'm building <A HREF="http://gov.e2d.se/">http://gov.e2d.se/</A> on top of an application framework I
developed, inspired by RDF and the semantic web. It's uses a realy
powerful and flexible nodal network database.

It's just a prototype. Lots of things to do. But it's built to be
actually useful for voting on internal issues in the Aktiv Demokrati
party. It includes condorcet priority voting, delegated voting and a
couple of other things. See example here:
