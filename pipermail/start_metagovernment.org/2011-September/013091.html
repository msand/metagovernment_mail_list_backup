<PRE>&quot;This is, like, poli-sci 101.&#160; The issue above is why we have a *republic*
and the US is not a strict democracy -- we elect representatives who vote
for us, given (presumably) better understanding and expertise.&quot;
-&gt; &#160;They surely have better understanding and expertise, but they use this expertise and power from position in many cases in favor of themselves, not of the people.This is natural and understandable.
&quot;No, this is not and should not be a problem.&#160; It is unrealistic foreveryone to be expertised in every area of human endeavors, nor is it any
shame.&#160; Specialization complements the &quot;Generalists&quot;.&#160; The body itself, it
should be noted, has extremely specialized areas, and it would no
ill-advised for the liver to say what the heart should do.&quot;
-&gt; I agree with you that specialization is needed, this is why I was proposing a system with two levels of delegation (www.idemocrazia.it). However, if, with the excuse of specialization, you leave four/five years of time to any government/administration to do what more or less they like, at least on issues that do not catch the attention of the 90% of the population, they will use this power for their own benefit.If they want to put sanctions on a third world country and try to strangle them, they can do it and get reelected as 99% of the voters will ever know about this.
