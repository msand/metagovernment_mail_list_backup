<PRE>
-&gt; I call that tyranny of 
the majority. Having rule by 50%+1 of the voting populace is a great 
prescription for oppression of minorities.It is playing out here in the 
U.S. now with oppressive anti- immigration laws.Reply: Tyranny of the 
majority IS what democracy is all about. There is no better system than the 
tyranny of the majority. What other system do you propose? Tyranny of the 
minority? There is no way to get around this. Even if you propose a law, allow 
people to discuss this law a thousand of times and amend it a thousand times, 
there will always be a majority that will like it one way and a minority taht 
likes it the other way.&#160;

-&gt;&#160; But forcing people to 
vote yes/no on a law that is written in such a way that they do not really 
support or oppose it is bad governance. &#160;Very frequently, people support 
the idea of a law but not the way it is worded. But they can only vote for it or 
against it.
Reply: yes, it is bad 
governance but it is still better than leaving all the decisions to the 
lobby-feeded senator or representative. It is a step torwards citizen 
involvment. Before citizens could not vote for/against one law, now they can. It 
is a step forward. And if citizens really find a big flaw in one otherwise good 
law, nobody prevents citizens to propose a new law and ask for sign to move it 
forwards. Also, we can propose a system where citizens can choose between three 
or four different proposals of law for the same issue.&#160;

-&gt;&#160; No, starting at the top and trying to work down is, I 
believe, doomed to failure. You said it yourself in another post: the peoper 
place to start is in very small 
communities.
Reply: I am not 
talking about starting from top or bottom here, I am saying that, at first, 
people will likely be moved to vote for laws that they feeling are more 
important to get their attention. It is a natural thing. Then, with time, people 
may also feel compelled to go to vote for more secondary issues.&#160; But, again, 
this point is not central for the discussion we are doing now.&#160;
-&gt;&#160; You assume these groups 
are necessarily good. Many people do not agree with you, particularly about 
Greenpeace. The people should be able to&#160;promote those interests 
themselves, not have to rely on organizations. There are a lot more monied 
organizations out there which do not have the good of all people at 
heart.
Reply: What is good? 
What is bad? What can be good for you may be bad for me and viceversa. And who 
has 100% other people at hearth and never thinks about his own personal 
interests at times? Nobody, maybe. If people can get together and propose a law 
by passing big organizations, this is very good, but maybe time is needed for 
this and at the beginning we have to work with activists that are already doing 
something.&#160;In conclusion, I think 
the main difference between your approach and my ideas is that you are working 
to create a potentially revolutionary system almost from scratch while I think 
that a more pragmatical approach has more chances to 
success.
