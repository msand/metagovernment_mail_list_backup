<PRE>Welcome, Paul!

Metagovernment is also an umbrella, but primarily of tools (as opposed  
to parties) for direct democracy. It is also for any individuals  
interested in furthering the goal of citizen-lead governance.

My understanding (and please correct me if I am wrong) of Demoex and  
Democracy International is that both are focused on incorporating  
direct citizen involvement into existing systems of representative  
democracy. This is done by making the representatives accountable to  
decisions made by online tools (of which several our member projects  
are happy to provide). I think Demoex refers to this as Mixdemocracy.

What I and various others in this group are aiming for is the  
replacement of the representation system entirely, and a move toward a  
much more direct form of democracy. Some of our systems, such as  
Votorola, allow for representation by means of delegated voting, where  
one can delegate decision-making to another. But these delegations are  
always transient and at-will. That is, at any moment, anyone can  
remove their delegation and act directly on one's own behalf or  
delegate to someone else.

I do very much like the idea of Mixdemocracy, but in the end I think  
it is going to run into a lot of problems because it still relies on  
the goodwill of the representatives and it still requires legislation  
to be run through the filter of a few individuals instead of opening  
it up to everyone all the time. Our conception of collaborative  
governance implies that citizens will undergo a transformation in how  
they view their responsibility to governance when they realize that  
they are truly in control of everything:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Collaborative_governance#Transforms_citizenship</A>

Again, please feel free to correct any misconceptions I may have about  
DI or the general idea of Mixdemocracy. And regardless, I do think  
there are great opportunities for collaboration here. Our goals and  
ideals are the same, it is only our approaches which differ in some  
details. There are many opportunities for overlap, and it is probable  
that the more we work together, the more likely it is that we will all  
succeed.

P.S. Wow. It looks like the Participedia article on Metagov has grown  
quite a lot since I last looked at it:
<A HREF="http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment">http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Metagovernment</A>
However, it appears that many of our member projects (which are not  
subservient to Metagov at all, but merely voluntary collaborators in  
the umbrella) do not have pages there.

</I>&gt;<i> No particular project in mind, only a dissatisfaction with the

</I>&gt;<i> people back home to participate (I live in California now, but I

</I>&gt;<i> process  as the 21st-century version of collecting signatures for a  
</I>&gt;<i> petition.  I would hope to crank out something simple, non- 
</I>&gt;<i> controversial, to  campaign to push through a local legislature. I  
</I>&gt;<i> haven't thought this  through past that, yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to caution on the distinction between setting up something   
</I>&gt;<i> that can work on one piece of legislation and something which can  
</I>&gt;<i> work  on all legislation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When people get focused into one issue, that issue tends to  
</I>&gt;<i> polarize  into camps and the issue tends to grow into something  
</I>&gt;<i> larger than it  really should be. California is a great example of  
</I>&gt;<i> how this can go  wrong, as you see referenda taking on the force of  
</I>&gt;<i> huge campaigns,  when their focus is really a tiny fraction of the  
</I>&gt;<i> important issues in  the state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea behind collaborative governance (at least as I see it) is  
</I>&gt;<i> to enable individuals to participate in every decision. That   
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally changes the nature of their participation. Because   
</I>&gt;<i> instead of everyone getting emotional and frenzied about one simple   
</I>&gt;<i> issue, people scatter into the issues that really matter to them.  
</I>&gt;<i> That  is, instead of millions of people raging at each other about  
</I>&gt;<i> whether  or not to tighten immigration, you may instead see a few  
</I>&gt;<i> hundred  people working on how farmers can better take in their  
</I>&gt;<i> crops without  promoting immigration problems while another few  
</I>&gt;<i> hundred might be  working on a way to make public healthcare for  
</I>&gt;<i> immigrants work for the  social good without being a direct  
</I>&gt;<i> contributor to increasing  immigration. (Just entirely made up  
</I>&gt;<i> examples, mind you.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Allowing people to contribute to one piece of legislation lets them   
</I>&gt;<i> into the process, but only in that one little way. Those who  
</I>&gt;<i> actually  feel empowered by this access would probably be inclined  
</I>&gt;<i> to leverage  this little bit of power as much as they can, and the  
</I>&gt;<i> end legislation  may suffer from the results.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what I am suggesting is that you keep your expectations small in   
</I>&gt;<i> terms of community. It is good that you are focusing on a local   
</I>&gt;<i> legislature. I would suggest you go as micro-local as you can: such  
</I>&gt;<i> as  one department in one township, or even smaller to something  
</I>&gt;<i> like a  home owners' association. In such small communities, you  
</I>&gt;<i> then have the  opportunity to really open up all the decision- 
</I>&gt;<i> making, since the  overall number of decisions and issues are  
</I>&gt;<i> manageable in number. If  collaborative governance can prove itself  
</I>&gt;<i> in these small domains, it  can then begin scaling up as it gains  
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance and the tools mature.
