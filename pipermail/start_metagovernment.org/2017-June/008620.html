<PRE>I've added MG list to this post.

Agreed, but then this is sort of Teo's point: No talk means no work is
being done ;-)

Maybe I'm just pessimistic, but I see signs that what's really
happened here is burnout: People on this list have just given up. And
not just here, but the Pirate Party (liquid democracy, etc.) lists,
the Reddit groups on DD, and many of the other DD sites I'd bookmarked
in the past are either gone or even less active than this list. Pol.is
and Loomio both survive on niches (Taiwan for Pol.is, and Spain for
Loomio) where the old governments are using them for opinion finding
(albeit not for actual decisionmaking). How do I know this? Surveying
the &quot;competition&quot; is part of the marketing plan for proxyfor.me, and
that's what I'm primarily working on now (when RL doesn't keep me away
from it).

But you don't have to worry about proxyfor.me going away: It's
actually costing me $0 the next 9 months (AWS free tier) and the costs
will be nominal after that. I've got a long to-do list and
historically (based on how long it took me to burn out on MetaCard and
academics (i.e., getting a PhD)) I've still got a good 7 or 8 years to
go on this project. I mostly remain inspired because I have yet to
hear a coherent argument about why DeMP (Democracy by Matched Proxy)
and the current instantiation of it in <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A> won't
work. Which means unlike all those other systems which IMHO have
fundamental design flaws, what I've got at this point is mostly just a
marketing problem. Granted it's probably worse than the marketing
problem Pol.is and Loomio and represent.me have: Unlike them
proxyfor.me is designed to *replace* existing governments rather than
being satisfied to be just a minor extension helping to prop them
up...

What is that site?
