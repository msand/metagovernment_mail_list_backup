Coincidentally I had just started on this today, too. I'm probably not
the best reviewer (I'm competition, but also probably know a lot more
about the issues than any of the actual judges), but think I can offer
a reasonable simulation of a devil's advocate.

(snip)

&gt;<i> The main challenge in a Direct Democracy is to allow everyone a voice but to
</I>&gt;<i> have those voices organized in productive dialogue. The internet, more
</I>&gt;<i> specifically a fully threaded forum on the internet is a great tool to
</I>&gt;<i> organize discussions. An internet forum paired with a categorizing system
</I>&gt;<i> for any changes within the governing body makes a comprehensive system of
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy where ideas can be brought up, discussed, voted and
</I>&gt;<i> implemented all in one area.
</I>
My perception of the general conception is that the problem with DD is
that people are idiots and you can't trust them to make good
decisions. This of course is not the real problem, which is that DD
with low participation rates is exactly the same as misrepresentative
democracy because the same types of people (the SDAPs) end up making
the decisions. Still, I think you ought to address the popular
perception right here in the first paragraph.

&gt;<i> Ensuring everyone an equal voice means one account per individual, identity
</I>&gt;<i> association between the user of the site and the physical person posting
</I>&gt;<i> under that user. The forum's posting rules become enforceable with
</I>&gt;<i> authentication and can ensure discussions are productive. A core tenant to
</I>&gt;<i> posting on the forum is that any post is an amendment to the post it's
</I>&gt;<i> replying to. Unless starting a new topic, a post is always an attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> correct the post above. Any general agreement to a post can be expressed
</I>&gt;<i> through a prop (upvote), props help posts gain visibility and legitimacy.
</I>&gt;<i> Failure to follow established forum rules can result in a temporary
</I>&gt;<i> suspension from posting.
</I>
Here you'd also have to address the moderation issues that all other
open forums have, and why the vast majority of them have already been
shut down: How is this system any different from any of them? The only
exceptions I note continue to function exactly because they're not
open, either by design or as a result of having a very narrow scope
(FB's &quot;unfriending&quot; system, and Reddit and Slashdot topics are
generally very esoteric, although Reddit relies heavily on censorship
and banning people to keep the peace, options we don't have in a DD
system).

&gt;<i> The identity of users, as well as other sensitive information, can be
</I>&gt;<i> hidden, still available, but difficult to access without also raising flags
</I>&gt;<i> on your own profile. In a true direct democracy, all information is
</I>&gt;<i> accessible and verifiable, this is achievable with current computing power,
</I>&gt;<i> the challenge is organizing it properly. Possible to have a physical
</I>&gt;<i> building, a section in existing libraries, where users can log in to look up
</I>&gt;<i> sensitive information, monitored and secured should be enough to deter
</I>&gt;<i> people with malicious motives.
</I>
Interesting but it seems to me impractical: We're barely managing to
keep public libraries open at all, let alone assigning them an
entirely new (unfunded?) mandate. I plan to ignore this issue under
the assumption that if no one person is given unusually large amounts
of power, no individual is likely to become a target. People already
trust the system to verify identities (voter rolls) without anyone
being expected to be able to knock on doors to verify the existence of
every person listed in the system...

&gt;<i> Another aspect of a direct democracy is in its ability for everyone to have
</I>&gt;<i> their vote counted. Even if they don't directly vote it's important that
</I>&gt;<i> every user gets represented so as to not allow extremists to control things.
</I>&gt;<i> With a proxy voting system that's run through a matching mechanism, everyone
</I>&gt;<i> will have a vote counted for them based on their perceived preference.
</I>&gt;<i> Unless they cast a direct vote, their vote will be an average of the 5
</I>&gt;<i> closest matched users that did cast a direct vote. The matching will be done
</I>&gt;<i> through a variety of questions designed to predict voting patterns. This way
</I>&gt;<i> if only 15% of the population cast votes, 100% will still be represented,
</I>&gt;<i> offsetting the extremists.
</I>
I think you'd need to expand on how the matching would be done here.
And note that I'm not going to discourage adoption of this because
it's somehow &quot;mine&quot; or that I fear the competition. In fact, I think
it's just a great idea and the more people that submit proposals
including this feature the more mainstream all of us will appear to
be. Given what we saw in the &quot;Next System&quot; competition it seems to me
that our real competition is handwavers who just rehash old ideas:
Because they seem familiar the judges will be far more likely to
choose them. The trick to winning I think is getting the balance
between being progressive enough to appear to have a shot at making a
real difference while still feeling familiar enough that
non-visionaries will be able to see how it could work. This of course
IMHO means that the winner is most likely doomed to fail to achieve
its goal (i.e., competitions like this are the exact wrong way to go
about making significant changes in how things are done unless you're
sure your judges are true visionaries and not just experts in public
policy or some other irrelevant (or even backward) field).

(snip, a level of specificity that probably isn't required in the abstract)

&gt;<i> There will be employees responsible for helping in drafting proposals before
</I>&gt;<i> and after the discussion process. The finished version of a proposal will be
</I>&gt;<i> a concise breakdown of exactly what the proposal is proposing so as to
</I>&gt;<i> encourage as many votes as possible. There may be a number of iterations
</I>&gt;<i> before one is chosen by approval from users who have adopted posts in the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal as well as the original proposal creator, it then goes to a general
</I>&gt;<i> vote.
</I>
Well at least you have some idea how the $5 million will be spent ;-)
This is actually something I'm struggling with and can't decide
whether or not to disclose this as a problem: I'm guessing that
proposing to drop millions on marketing (or perhaps even just
advertising) is not going to be attractive to the judges. For my part
I'll consider my project a failure if I have to hire an army of
moderators or system administrators to keep the trolls from ruining
it. And of course you already see this in the design of proxyfor.me
(e.g., you only get one post on a proposal, you have to choose sides,
and there is no way to directly interact with other participants).

(snip, more details that probably belong in the body)

I note that you didn't deal with the main point, which is
*international* relations. I plan to deal with that by simply saying
that looking at the problem this way is just going to result in a
system that can't function: The problem with international relations
is exactly the same problem with local, state, and national
governments: Bad decisions get made because the wrong people are
making them. The only reason to even *have* national government (let
alone the supernational system this competition seems to be calling
for) is to enforce the ability for people to have democracy at a local
level. Not sure this is going to be convincing to the judges who
probably will have a &quot;new &amp; improved&quot; UN in mind, but, again, the more
of us who call them out on this misconception the better each of our
odds is.

    Scott
