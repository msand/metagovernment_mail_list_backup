<PRE>Forwarding this for Teo who's apparently having his posts lost/blocked
again. I noticed that the list archives are being updated again,
though, so the list itself definitely isn't quite dead yet...

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i> I forecasted the death of Airesis, Votorola and Vilfredo and LQFB
</I>&gt;<i> I admit I never forecasted the death of Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this is what is happening
</I>

I'd call it a coma, not death, and it happened years ago: I was the
last one to make any substantial upgrades to the wiki and that was
over two years ago. There is very little &quot;collaboration&quot; going on of
late, which is what Ed I believe set as the primary goal of the group
(case in point, the vast majority of people on this list haven't
signed up to even *try* proxyfor.me and so are not even in a position
to even participate in any discussion of it).

But the heart (this mailing list) still beats...

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Too bad people follow only their egos and are not capable of
</I>&gt;<i> understanding the needs of the people
</I>

Yeah, we're still waiting for clarifications on *your* &quot;understanding
of &quot;the needs of The People&quot;, or even any substantive claims that
anyone else's understanding is somehow flawed. Oh, but that would
require you to put aside *your* ego and at least attempt to understand
our proposals or our (particularly my) criticisms of yours...
  Regards,
    Scott
