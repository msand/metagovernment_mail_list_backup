<PRE>Haha you're writing for this too eh? Have you been able to figure out
anything about who's actually reading these things? I feel like it'd be
pretty good to know a few things about the target audience... I especially
wonder what they're asked to look for, and if they'll automatically see all
net gov proposals as the same.

I think you have a lot of strong lines in this piece, like the beginning of
the second paragraph, although I suspect you might wanna try running this
paper by someone who doesn't already believe in direct democracy, I'm not
sure it establishes an imperative for the UN to embrace DD before
explaining what it is, or how it'd help the UN.

&gt;<i> Not sure how many of you are attempting to enter this thing but I figured
</I>&gt;<i> I'd put up my first draft of the abstract to gauge reaction. Any comment is
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated. This is what my entry is supposed to cover-
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.globalchallenges.org/en/the-prize/criteria">https://www.globalchallenges.org/en/the-prize/criteria</A>
</I>&gt;<i> *1. Abstract *(no more than 1000 words)
</I>&gt;<i> The abstract must summarize the design of the model, including the
</I>&gt;<i> institutions, regulations, decision-making paths and control mechanisms it
</I>&gt;<i> involves, as well as how key individuals and other decision-making bodies
</I>&gt;<i> are to be appointed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My model is verifiable direct democracy powered by the internet. Any
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making system of the future needs to utilize our capabilities for
</I>&gt;<i> connected communication between the general public and the mechanisms used
</I>&gt;<i> in creating decisions. The necessity for the public to be able to trust in
</I>&gt;<i> their ability to influence changes in their society has many advantages and
</I>&gt;<i> challenges, this paper will attempt to address the significant areas of
</I>&gt;<i> this outcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The main challenge in a Direct Democracy is to allow everyone a voice but
</I>&gt;<i> to have those voices organized in productive dialogue. The internet, more
</I>&gt;<i> specifically a fully threaded forum on the internet is a great tool to
</I>&gt;<i> organize discussions. An internet forum paired with a categorizing system
</I>&gt;<i> for any changes within the governing body makes a comprehensive system of
</I>&gt;<i> direct democracy where ideas can be brought up, discussed, voted and
</I>&gt;<i> implemented all in one area.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ensuring everyone an equal voice means one account per individual,
</I>&gt;<i> identity association between the user of the site and the physical person
</I>&gt;<i> posting under that user. The forum's posting rules become enforceable with
</I>&gt;<i> authentication and can ensure discussions are productive. A core tenant to
</I>&gt;<i> posting on the forum is that any post is an amendment to the post it's
</I>&gt;<i> replying to. Unless starting a new topic, a post is always an attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> correct the post above. Any general agreement to a post can be expressed
</I>&gt;<i> through a prop (upvote), props help posts gain visibility and legitimacy.
</I>&gt;<i> Failure to follow established forum rules can result in a temporary
</I>&gt;<i> suspension from posting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The identity of users, as well as other sensitive information, can be
</I>&gt;<i> hidden, still available, but difficult to access without also raising flags
</I>&gt;<i> on your own profile. In a true direct democracy, all information is
</I>&gt;<i> accessible and verifiable, this is achievable with current computing power,
</I>&gt;<i> the challenge is organizing it properly. Possible to have a physical
</I>&gt;<i> building, a section in existing libraries, where users can log in to look
</I>&gt;<i> up sensitive information, monitored and secured should be enough to deter
</I>&gt;<i> people with malicious motives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another aspect of a direct democracy is in its ability for everyone to
</I>&gt;<i> have their vote counted. Even if they don't directly vote it's important
</I>&gt;<i> that every user gets represented so as to not allow extremists to control
</I>&gt;<i> things. With a proxy voting system that's run through a matching mechanism,
</I>&gt;<i> everyone will have a vote counted for them based on their perceived
</I>&gt;<i> preference. Unless they cast a direct vote, their vote will be an average
</I>&gt;<i> of the 5 closest matched users that did cast a direct vote. The matching
</I>&gt;<i> will be done through a variety of questions designed to predict voting
</I>&gt;<i> patterns. This way if only 15% of the population cast votes, 100% will
</I>&gt;<i> still be represented, offsetting the extremists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Starting a new topic on this fully threaded forum is to create a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> for a change in government, whether it be a policy, priority, hiring or
</I>&gt;<i> budgeting change. Proposals are able to be created by anyone but like the
</I>&gt;<i> discussions, there are certain rules to posting. Each proposal needs to
</I>&gt;<i> fill out structured criteria, sections to help organize and place their
</I>&gt;<i> idea for change. This gives familiarity to all new topics so other users
</I>&gt;<i> can easily navigate what's being proposed. Associated forms and links can
</I>&gt;<i> be attached by computer algorithms or employees in order to legitimize a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. Every section of a proposal, as well as the proposal as a whole,
</I>&gt;<i> is able to be discussed in a dedicated thread, further keeping discussion
</I>&gt;<i> organized and on track.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposals will fall into categories that the submitter can choose.
</I>&gt;<i> Location, from any individual neighborhood to a global scope. Sections such
</I>&gt;<i> as housing, transportation, healthcare, etc are also selected. From there
</I>&gt;<i> sub-section categories can be chosen, bicycle law for instance in the
</I>&gt;<i> transportation section. Proposals may fall into many sections and can be
</I>&gt;<i> chosen and searchable through keywords, concentrating the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> interested parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Proposals and posts can not be edited mid-discussion to keep exchanges
</I>&gt;<i> authentic. However, the original proposer may amend the proposal through
</I>&gt;<i> adoption. If a post from another user makes a legitimate reply to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal and it's widely accepted by other users through propping, it is a
</I>&gt;<i> good indication that the original proposer should adopt that post in order
</I>&gt;<i> to gain acceptance from voters when that time comes. This adoption is done
</I>&gt;<i> through a simple check mark beside the post from the proposal creator, this
</I>&gt;<i> post will now be included in the final version of a proposal to be voted
</I>&gt;<i> on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There will be employees responsible for helping in drafting proposals
</I>&gt;<i> before and after the discussion process. The finished version of a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> will be a concise breakdown of exactly what the proposal is proposing so as
</I>&gt;<i> to encourage as many votes as possible. There may be a number of iterations
</I>&gt;<i> before one is chosen by approval from users who have adopted posts in the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal as well as the original proposal creator, it then goes to a
</I>&gt;<i> general vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current departments used in the government stay functioning. The
</I>&gt;<i> public, however, will now have the ability to direct the functioning of
</I>&gt;<i> them, with respect to replacing heads and setting annual budgets. All
</I>&gt;<i> changes and expenses by the department will be categorized for the public.
</I>&gt;<i> This limits the amount of micromanaging needed from the public, without
</I>&gt;<i> jeopardizing integrity. Department heads will have criteria they need to
</I>&gt;<i> meet before being considered for the position, these criteria may also be
</I>&gt;<i> established by the people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Computing efficiency will continue to improve, helping users utilize the
</I>&gt;<i> system and familiarity with processes will encourage activity. Using
</I>&gt;<i> technology follows the global trend in reducing the man hours required to
</I>&gt;<i> run a functional system. Political bureaucracies are the hardest to adapt
</I>&gt;<i> to global shifts because they are their own governing body. That's why this
</I>&gt;<i> competition is so important, we need to reel in the excessiveness of
</I>&gt;<i> government and make it more efficient, stifling corruption in the process.
