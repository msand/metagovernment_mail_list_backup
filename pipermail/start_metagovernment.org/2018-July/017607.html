</I>Ned&gt; Scott, I was responding to the version that your link in the 
original email of this thread pointed to. Not sure what gave you the 
idea that I was responding to an older version.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My suggestion is that having The Proxies respond to the items of your purely abstract list would not usefully reveal &quot;what we want&quot;. There would still be no valid way to judge the quality of the management. The items of the list are too abstract, vague, and overlapped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, as opposed to what? If your claim is that by having *everyone*
</I>&gt;<i> fill out this list we learn exactly zero, then you're just being a
</I>&gt;<i> troll. I'd go so far as to predict that by taking this simple step
</I>&gt;<i> we'd learn more than *everything* we get from polls plus voting
</I>&gt;<i> records plus protests in the streets plus every other source of
</I>&gt;<i> information we have on the Will Of The People now. What information do
</I>&gt;<i> you think we need, and how would you propose to *practically* gather
</I>&gt;<i> it?
</I>Category headings are not themselves targets for resource allocation. 
Each category heading should be a &quot;drill-down&quot; link that enables me to 
navigate (through sub-categories if necessary) to each and every 
resource-allocation-target (policy, plan, program, project) that you 
have put into the category. When I visit a particular resource target, I 
should find all pertinent information concerning that target concisely 
presented. At that point you can appropriately ask me appraisal and 
preference questions concerning that particular resource target.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whether responses to the list could be used for proxy matching purposes is an empirical question. (Given that I myself would not be able to respond to the list as directed because absolutely crucial information is missing from the proposal, I doubt that it would be.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, what would you propose instead? Require *everyone* to write a
</I>&gt;<i> dissertation on their preferred outcome before they can get quality
</I>&gt;<i> representation? I also think you overestimate the difficulty of this
</I>&gt;<i> task, noting that it's generally about &quot;resources&quot; (attention, time,
</I>&gt;<i> money, etc), not just about budget items. Which why IMHO this is a
</I>&gt;<i> better assessment tool than even having everyone do a budget, which of
</I>&gt;<i> course would be impractical anyway because of how long it would take
</I>&gt;<i> them (quantity being far more important than quality when assessing
</I>&gt;<i> TWOTP IMHO).
</I>Asking me resource allocation questions about category headings, without 
giving me any information at all about the actual allocation targets 
that you have put into each category, is just dumb. You should follow 
your own stated policy: whenever I am asked a question, all the 
information I need (in order to provide an informed response) should be 
available to me, concisely presented. (The question is not whether 
google is my friend, but whether *you* are my friend.)
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Whether managers would find the information useful when creating new policy proposals and budget items would depend on what the managers were trying to accomplish. Again, given how abstract, vague, and overlapped the items of the list are, the information would probably be mainly useful as material to be used in political speechifying.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I think you're just being cynical, a classic case of the good
</I>&gt;<i> being the enemy of the great. Large discrepancies in responses to this
</I>&gt;<i> list would be hugely informative as to what the Will Of The People
</I>&gt;<i> really is, and I'm sure we'll all be very surprised by the outcome.
</I>Any large discrepancies would more likely be attributable to widely 
varying guesses among individuals regarding what sorts of resource 
targets have been put into each category. &quot;Garbage In =&gt; Garbage Out&quot;. 
(So much for being interested in the &quot;correct vote&quot;.)

But hey, the proposal is harmless. So go for it.
&gt;<i> As
</I>&gt;<i> for using this for demagoguery, again, I'd recommend reading the
</I>&gt;<i> section on Managers: There's no need (or provision) for this in the
</I>&gt;<i> executive branch selection system I've proposed.
</I>I have read (and now re-read) the section on Managers. You frame the 
problems that we have as being personnel problems (rather than societal 
arrangements problems), which then leads you to seek to set up a 
selection process that will reliably put saints and not sinners into the 
positions of great power in your design.

You claim that The People are not competent to select saints rather than 
sinners. At the same time, you appear to claim that The People *are* 
competent to de-select sinners that they have previously put in office.

But wait! -- You claim that, actually, The People will not do the 
selecting in practice, The Proxies will do the selecting. (The People 
will just watch, as spectators.) Then you claim that, although The 
People are not competent to select saints, The Proxies *are* competent 
to select saints, and are competent to de-select sinners.

These are all empirical claims. They need to be tested, harmlessly.

An alternative theory regarding how the tests will go is expressed in 
the &quot;Rules For Rulers&quot; video: Managers that keep their (minimized) keys 
happy will remain in office. Those happy keys will thereby become 
progressively wealthier, and more powerful, and better able to control 
the pipeline of prospective Managers.(Controlling that pipeline will be 
the primary objective of the power puppeteers.)

Under this alternative theory, our problems are not usefully framed as 
personnel problems.&#160; To be solved, the problems must be framed as 
societal arrangements problems. We need to not have (at all) positions 
of great power. Which means (among other things) no hierarchies.
&gt;<i>   And I also think that
</I>&gt;<i> it'd be useful information for objectively assessing Managers: If
</I>&gt;<i> someone's been in that office for a year and there has been no shift
</I>&gt;<i> in the Will Of The People, that's clear and convincing evidence of
</I>&gt;<i> incompetence.
</I>If *you* don't know what the actual resource targets are in each of your 
33 categories, then it is a pretty sure bet that nobody else will 
either. Alternatively, if you *do* know what the resource targets are in 
each category, then you should share that information with the rest of 
us. To the extent that we know what the resource targets are, and to the 
extent that the performance of the resource targets is objectively 
measured and reported, we can indeed use that knowledge to objectively 
assess the performance of the executive branches.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip, references to obsolete versions.
</I>I was providing examples of &quot;harmless&quot; proposals. Here it is again:
&gt;<i> &quot;Harmless&quot; in this context means &quot;not interfering with the substantive
</I>&gt;<i> plots and plans and profits of the puppeteers&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The proposal at hand (having The Proxies respond to the list below) is a
</I>&gt;<i> great example of a harmless proposal. The original dozen proposals on
</I>&gt;<i> proxyfor.me provide other great examples of harmless proposals: deciding
</I>&gt;<i> whether to extend legal personhood to chimpanzees, deciding whether to
</I>&gt;<i> shut down SETI, deciding whether to mandate &quot;Idaho Stop&quot; ordinances
</I>&gt;<i> globally, etc. It only takes four harmless proposals per week to
</I>&gt;<i> entirely neutralize The Proxies as a political force in global governance.
</I>And, you are right. In addition to giving &quot;Shut down SETI&quot; as an example 
of a harmless proposal, I could also have given &quot;Ban broadcasting into 
outer space&quot; as an example of a harmless proposal. The point was to help 
the reader understand what I mean by &quot;harmless&quot; proposal. The point had 
nothing to do with any differences between old and new versions of the 
Matchism Manifesto. Harmless proposals are just as problematic for the 
new version as for the older versions.
&gt;<i>   Oh, and you also misunderstood
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal in the last beta test of proxyfor.me: It didn't have
</I>&gt;<i> anything to do with SETI: It was about *broadcast*, not reception).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It sure sounds like you didn't watch the second half of the video.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ideology does not pay the bills. You are being distracted by all of the political speechifying.
</I>&gt;<i> Actually I did watch it all, and appreciated the reference to HOAs,
</I>&gt;<i> because that's how I got involved in this social engineering project
</I>&gt;<i> in the first place. And yet my experience is exactly the opposite of
</I>&gt;<i> what that video described which doesn't even mention personality as a
</I>&gt;<i> factor in who rules and how. And yet my experience was almost exactly
</I>&gt;<i> what Altemeyer found in his Global Change Game experiment, which, not
</I>&gt;<i> to be too fine a point on it, I consider to be *the* prerequisite
</I>&gt;<i> reading to doing anything in this field:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>
</I>Altemeyer's findings are certainly valid, but they do not frame the 
problem-space in a helpful way. (Actually, Altemeyer's findings are not 
doing the framing -- you are.) You are &quot;betting your farm&quot; on the 
ability of The Proxies to select saints rather than sinners for the 
positions of great power in your design. And then you are further 
betting that when saints are selected, said saints will not be governed 
by the Rules For Rulers. Good luck with those bets.
&gt;<i> I still consider ideology (Communist, Libertarian, US Democrat vs
</I>&gt;<i> Republican, etc.) to be the primary driver of executive branch
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking, but personality (e.g., the SDAP classification) is a
</I>&gt;<i> close second.
</I>So long as our societal arrangements are such that they vest particular 
individuals (plutocrats, Managers) with great power to make 
public-matter decisions for their own personal benefit, we (the rest of 
us: humanity, nature, future generations) will continue to suffer the 
consequences of those decisions. We can fix that problem by switching to 
societal arrangements that do *not* vest any particular individuals with 
great power to make public-matter decisions for personal benefit.This 
solution does not rely on our (non-existent) ability to alter the 
ideologies and/or personalities of those vested individuals, nor does it 
rely on our (non-existent) ability to select only incorruptible saints 
to fill those empowered roles..
&gt;<i> And this is what my experience with that dysfunctional
</I>&gt;<i> HOA showed: It was run by a SD President (although additionally he was
</I>&gt;<i> a psychopath) with the rest of the board being authoritarian, exactly
</I>&gt;<i> like the SD + A condition in Altemeyer's experiment. And the outcome
</I>&gt;<i> was the same: The HOA was completely mismanaged and was a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> million dollars behind in their maintenance. And yet none of the board
</I>&gt;<i> members were getting paid, nor was there even any overt corruption
</I>&gt;<i> (just like in Altemeyer's experiment: Put an SD or P in charge of a
</I>&gt;<i> bunch of As and corruption actually *decreases*).
</I>You have experienced the problems, but you have not yet experienced any 
societal arrangement solutions to those problems. You have placed your 
bets, but the &quot;solutions races&quot; that will demonstrate which solutions 
work and which do not, have not even started yet.
&gt;<i> So, again, IMHO that
</I>&gt;<i> video has completely missed the point that the two most powerful
</I>&gt;<i> forces in hierarchical government have nothing to do with money or
</I>&gt;<i> other resources. For SDAPs, wielding power is its own reward.
</I>You are conflating motivation with means.

For SDAPs, wielding power (and gaining ever more power) is its own 
reward. That provides their motivation.

The Rules For Rulers provide the means -- they are all about how to 
acquire, retain, and increase that power.

SDAPs obey the Rules For Rulers, and so do non-SDAPs that arrive in 
seats of power (if, for whatever reasons, they wish to remain in power).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> None of the arrangements discussed on the Managers page, and none of the arrangements discussed on The System page, do anything to significantly restrict the power of the executive branch. Individual Managers will come and go, but the power of the executive branch is entirely unrestrained. You are conflating &quot;the executive branch&quot; with &quot;the Manager&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Being able to replace the Manager with only a month's delay is IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> the only power we really need.
</I>This is the bet you are placing, that this arrangement will be enough. 
You have no Plan B, no hedge, no &quot;checks and balances&quot;.
&gt;<i> Nevertheless, I am considering the idea
</I>&gt;<i> of requiring putting any &quot;executive orders&quot; into The System and
</I>&gt;<i> subject them to a simple approval process. For example, if the
</I>&gt;<i> positive rating of an order drops below 25%, it is automatically
</I>&gt;<i> rendered null and void. The trick here is to allow The People to stop
</I>&gt;<i> a policy without having to replace the manager, yet also produce
</I>&gt;<i> something robust enough that it's not subject to attempts to game the
</I>&gt;<i> system (brigading, for-pay petition drives, etc.).
</I>Here again we run into the &quot;harmless proposals&quot; problem. If the Manager 
floods the democratic voting process with executive orders (4 per week 
or whatever), he uses up all the available democratic decisionmaking -- 
The Proxies are effectively neutralized as a force in global governance.
