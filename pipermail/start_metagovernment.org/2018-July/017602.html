<PRE>Been busy restructuring the Matchism Manifesto (www.matchism.org) to
reflect what I've figured out from trying to implement the
decisionmaking system (proxyfor.me). The biggest change is a shift
away from having a &quot;Goals&quot; section to something more general that can
be used both for the proxy matching system and for the proposal
writers to gain some insight as to what The People consider to be the
domains that need more work, and in which direction. I'm calling it an
assessment of The Will Of The People. I used to call it &quot;ideology&quot;
until I realized that what we need is a more general concept than
that. I'm also starting to realize that there is considerable overlap
between this and the budgeting process, but haven't yet figured out
how to (or even whether to try to) combine these things.

Here's the list so far. Have I left anything important out?
  Regards,
    Scott

Please share your perception of how their current government manages
the resources (time, money, attention) it expends on these items, on a
scale of 1 to 7, with 1 being &quot;Way too little&quot;, through &quot;About right&quot;,
to 7 being &quot;Way too much&quot;:

Minimizing degree of economic inequality
Education
Crime and loss prevention (via police and criminal courts)
