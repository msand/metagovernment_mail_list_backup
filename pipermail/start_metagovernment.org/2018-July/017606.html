<PRE>On Sun, Jul 22, 2018 at 11:46 PM Ned Conner &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">npconner at earthlink.net</A>&gt; wrote:

I got about half way through this response when it became clear that
one big problem is that Ned and I are talking about different versions
of the Matchism architecture. The major changes in the more recent
versions (that he's apparently not read), and which you all need to
read to have any hope of having a productive conversation about, are
available as:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/will/">http://www.matchism.org/will/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/system/">http://www.matchism.org/system/</A>
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/managers/">http://www.matchism.org/managers/</A>

&gt;<i> My suggestion is that having The Proxies respond to the items of your purely abstract list would not usefully reveal &quot;what we want&quot;. There would still be no valid way to judge the quality of the management. The items of the list are too abstract, vague, and overlapped.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, as opposed to what? If your claim is that by having *everyone*
fill out this list we learn exactly zero, then you're just being a
troll. I'd go so far as to predict that by taking this simple step
we'd learn more than *everything* we get from polls plus voting
records plus protests in the streets plus every other source of
information we have on the Will Of The People now. What information do
you think we need, and how would you propose to *practically* gather
it?

&gt;<i> Whether responses to the list could be used for proxy matching purposes is an empirical question. (Given that I myself would not be able to respond to the list as directed because absolutely crucial information is missing from the proposal, I doubt that it would be.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, what would you propose instead? Require *everyone* to write a
dissertation on their preferred outcome before they can get quality
representation? I also think you overestimate the difficulty of this
task, noting that it's generally about &quot;resources&quot; (attention, time,
money, etc), not just about budget items. Which why IMHO this is a
better assessment tool than even having everyone do a budget, which of
course would be impractical anyway because of how long it would take
them (quantity being far more important than quality when assessing
TWOTP IMHO).

&gt;<i> Whether managers would find the information useful when creating new policy proposals and budget items would depend on what the managers were trying to accomplish. Again, given how abstract, vague, and overlapped the items of the list are, the information would probably be mainly useful as material to be used in political speechifying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
And I think you're just being cynical, a classic case of the good
being the enemy of the great. Large discrepancies in responses to this
list would be hugely informative as to what the Will Of The People
really is, and I'm sure we'll all be very surprised by the outcome. As
for using this for demagoguery, again, I'd recommend reading the
section on Managers: There's no need (or provision) for this in the
executive branch selection system I've proposed. And I also think that
it'd be useful information for objectively assessing Managers: If
someone's been in that office for a year and there has been no shift
in the Will Of The People, that's clear and convincing evidence of
incompetence.

(snip, references to obsolete versions. Oh, and you also misunderstood
the proposal in the last beta test of proxyfor.me: It didn't have
anything to do with SETI: It was about *broadcast*, not reception).

&gt;<i> It sure sounds like you didn't watch the second half of the video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ideology does not pay the bills. You are being distracted by all of the political speechifying.
</I>
Actually I did watch it all, and appreciated the reference to HOAs,
because that's how I got involved in this social engineering project
in the first place. And yet my experience is exactly the opposite of
what that video described which doesn't even mention personality as a
factor in who rules and how. And yet my experience was almost exactly
what Altemeyer found in his Global Change Game experiment, which, not
to be too fine a point on it, I consider to be *the* prerequisite
reading to doing anything in this field:
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>

I still consider ideology (Communist, Libertarian, US Democrat vs
Republican, etc.) to be the primary driver of executive branch
decisionmaking, but personality (e.g., the SDAP classification) is a
close second. And this is what my experience with that dysfunctional
HOA showed: It was run by a SD President (although additionally he was
a psychopath) with the rest of the board being authoritarian, exactly
like the SD + A condition in Altemeyer's experiment. And the outcome
was the same: The HOA was completely mismanaged and was a couple of
million dollars behind in their maintenance. And yet none of the board
members were getting paid, nor was there even any overt corruption
(just like in Altemeyer's experiment: Put an SD or P in charge of a
bunch of As and corruption actually *decreases*). So, again, IMHO that
video has completely missed the point that the two most powerful
forces in hierarchical government have nothing to do with money or
other resources. For SDAPs, wielding power is its own reward.

&gt;<i> None of the arrangements discussed on the Managers page, and none of the arrangements discussed on The System page, do anything to significantly restrict the power of the executive branch. Individual Managers will come and go, but the power of the executive branch is entirely unrestrained. You are conflating &quot;the executive branch&quot; with &quot;the Manager&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Being able to replace the Manager with only a month's delay is IMHO
the only power we really need. Nevertheless, I am considering the idea
of requiring putting any &quot;executive orders&quot; into The System and
subject them to a simple approval process. For example, if the
positive rating of an order drops below 25%, it is automatically
rendered null and void. The trick here is to allow The People to stop
a policy without having to replace the manager, yet also produce
something robust enough that it's not subject to attempts to game the
system (brigading, for-pay petition drives, etc.).
