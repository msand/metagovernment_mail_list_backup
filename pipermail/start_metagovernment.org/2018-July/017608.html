&gt;<i> Ned&gt; Scott, I was responding to the version that your link in the
</I>&gt;<i> original email of this thread pointed to. Not sure what gave you the
</I>&gt;<i> idea that I was responding to an older version.
</I>
Because of the misunderstandings evident in your post:
1) There is only 1 vote per week, not 4 as you implied. In the final
implementation there might be 2 (one local, one global), but it may be
sufficient to do something like alternate weeks instead.

2) The manager-replacement process is completely separate from the
proposal queue: Stuffing the queue would have no impact on the ability
to remove a manager. Indeed, it would only accelerate their
replacement because people would quickly recognize this attempt to
manipulate them.

3) Proposal stuffing wouldn't work anyway because the queue is sorted
automatically by vote count, not by the manager (i.e., you could still
fire a manager by proposal if enough people vote for it). There will
probably be some need for an &quot;emergency vote&quot; over-ride to give the
manager the option of moving a vote on something time-sensitive
(disaster response, declaration of war, etc.) to the top of the queue,
but of course if they tried to move up a non-substantive proposal
using this method it would be a big red flag that they're trying to
game the system and so need to be replaced...

I'd also like to take the opportunity to correct the misrepresentation
that the proposals in the last beta test were non-substantive. You may
wish to classify them as such, but this would only expose your naivety
about what our existing governments are actually doing now: *Most* of
the stuff they vote on is far less substantive than *any* of the
proposals in that queue, including renaming buildings, recognizing
&quot;national carrot week&quot; or whatever, creating unfunded mandates, or
voting on things they know aren't ever going to be made law (like the
Republicans in the US congress voting over 60 times to repeal
Obamacare).

&gt;<i> Category headings are not themselves targets for resource allocation.
</I>
They're not a budget, sure. But that's not what they're being used for here...

&gt;<i> Each category heading should be a &quot;drill-down&quot; link that enables me to
</I>&gt;<i> navigate (through sub-categories if necessary) to each and every
</I>&gt;<i> resource-allocation-target (policy, plan, program, project) that you
</I>&gt;<i> have put into the category. When I visit a particular resource target, I
</I>&gt;<i> should find all pertinent information concerning that target concisely
</I>&gt;<i> presented. At that point you can appropriately ask me appraisal and
</I>&gt;<i> preference questions concerning that particular resource target.
</I>
No, that's a &quot;budget&quot; which is a completely different animal, and one
that only &quot;activerts&quot; will be willing to fill out (i.e., it's a recipe
for reproducing our existing governments). I've been told that even
the 30+ items on the list now is way too many and that I'll be lucky
to get people to fill out the mini-match (3 items from the personality
assessment, 3 from the &quot;will&quot; list). Again, the main goal here is to
identify people who would vote like you would, with secondary goals of
gaining some insight as to what people (as a whole!) are dissatisfied
with and possibly being able to use shifts in that to evaluate the
quality of the executive branch.

&gt;<i> Any large discrepancies would more likely be attributable to widely
</I>&gt;<i> varying guesses among individuals regarding what sorts of resource
</I>&gt;<i> targets have been put into each category. &quot;Garbage In =&gt; Garbage Out&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> (So much for being interested in the &quot;correct vote&quot;.)
</I>
Again, this isn't a budget, it's a matching tool. Trying to dismiss it
by claiming irrationality or low information you have it exactly
backwards: Those are the important things to match on! Both of those
issues should be dealt with at the proposal-voting architecture, not
trying to change people by requiring them to have fully-informed
general perceptions about how society is working.

&gt;<i> I have read (and now re-read) the section on Managers. You frame the
</I>&gt;<i> problems that we have as being personnel problems (rather than societal
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements problems), which then leads you to seek to set up a
</I>&gt;<i> selection process that will reliably put saints and not sinners into the
</I>&gt;<i> positions of great power in your design.
</I>
Obviously you didn't understand it, then. I'm only proposing to put
competent people in executive decisionmaking roles. They will still
most commonly be SDAP (i.e., not &quot;saints&quot;), but will at least be
competent. The biggest problem with Donald Trump isn't that he's a
psychopath, it's that he's incompetent. The same was true of Stalin
and Mao, but notably not of Hitler. I'm with John Gill on this one
(<A HREF="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/John_Gill">http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/John_Gill</A>): The problem with
Hitler wasn't that he was a SDAP, it was the fact that he was actually
competent but The People had no way to direct him away from war and
persecution and keep him focused on keeping the trains running on
time.

&gt;<i> You claim that The People are not competent to select saints rather than
</I>&gt;<i> sinners. At the same time, you appear to claim that The People *are*
</I>&gt;<i> competent to de-select sinners that they have previously put in office.
</I>
I suppose this proposal runs the risk that some people will base their
approval on moral or character grounds (an inappropriate criteria
IMHO), but I think Donald Trump is a very good counterexample for that
argument: People voted for him because they (mistakenly, as it turns
out) thought that he was competent and incorruptible enough to &quot;fix&quot;
the broken system and they seemed to not care at all about the fact
that he was by pretty much everyone's definition a &quot;sinner&quot;. But if
you just look at the way approval ratings works in the real world,
Trump never would have been installed as Manager under my system, and
would be quickly replaced if he had somehow managed to stumble into
it. Instead we'd now have Charlie Baker (governor of Massachusetts,
and the governor who has the highest approval rating in the country).
It's true that I don't believe people are competent to choose a
leader, but I do believe that they are capable of recognizing whether
they've got a good or bad one.

&gt;<i> But wait! -- You claim that, actually, The People will not do the
</I>&gt;<i> selecting in practice, The Proxies will do the selecting. (The People
</I>&gt;<i> will just watch, as spectators.)
</I>
No, everyone gets a say in Managers (it'll be a form with a top level
menu link to it). Proxies don't apply here because there's no need:
It's not too burdensome to express an opinion on a few people at each
level of government.

&gt;<i> These are all empirical claims. They need to be tested, harmlessly.
</I>
Agreed, although I think there's not too much worry about the
&quot;harmlessly&quot; part because this system can run in parallel with our
existing system indefinitely. You worry too much: Our current system
is so screwed up that unless you propose a dictatorship (or a
government that is so incompetent that it quickly devolves into one)
we could hardly do any worse.

&gt;<i> An alternative theory regarding how the tests will go is expressed in
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Rules For Rulers&quot; video: Managers that keep their (minimized) keys
</I>&gt;<i> happy will remain in office. Those happy keys will thereby become
</I>&gt;<i> progressively wealthier, and more powerful, and better able to control
</I>&gt;<i> the pipeline of prospective Managers.(Controlling that pipeline will be
</I>&gt;<i> the primary objective of the power puppeteers.)
</I>
How can they do that, though? Anyone can submit their name to the
candidate queue. Really the only risk I see is that people or groups
will *campaign* for one of the names on the list (either the current
manager or some replacement that would be suitable to the oligarchs).
This should be made explicitly illegal, but I'd also expect that a
social/cultural shift will occur as part of that (i.e., if you see any
advertising or other propaganda for a candidate it's your civic duty
to change your rating of them to &quot;disapprove&quot;).

&gt;<i> Under this alternative theory, our problems are not usefully framed as
</I>&gt;<i> personnel problems.  To be solved, the problems must be framed as
</I>&gt;<i> societal arrangements problems. We need to not have (at all) positions
</I>&gt;<i> of great power. Which means (among other things) no hierarchies.
</I>
Good luck with that. Matchism is designed to be implementable. Any
system that proposes eliminating hierarchies I'm quite sure is not.
It'd also be amateur social engineering: Supporting hierarchies is as
natural to humans as talking and breathing. Remember: The goal is not
to change humans, it's to design a system that fits them *as they
are*.

(big snip, all dealt with above, and are mostly the result of not
understanding the *current* proposal)

&gt;<i> So long as our societal arrangements are such that they vest particular
</I>&gt;<i> individuals (plutocrats, Managers) with great power to make
</I>&gt;<i> public-matter decisions for their own personal benefit, we (the rest of
</I>&gt;<i> us: humanity, nature, future generations) will continue to suffer the
</I>&gt;<i> consequences of those decisions.
</I>
So you've never heard of a competent and non-corrupt manager at any
level of government nor as head of a corporation nor even for
management of an HOA? I have, many times. Even Charlie Baker I think
is doing reasonably well, as is Colorado's governor Hickenlooper,
though unfortunately people say he could never be elected president
because apparently he's too geeky. Which means the problem isn't with
the concept of hierarchy (which IMHO is clearly a requirement to have
a functioning executive branch), its with our inability to select the
right people into those roles (and, when necessary, to select someone
to replace them).

To get some idea of what the list would look like, I highly recommend
this article:
<A HREF="https://morningconsult.com/2018/04/12/americas-most-and-least-popular-governors/">https://morningconsult.com/2018/04/12/americas-most-and-least-popular-governors/</A>

&gt;<i> We can fix that problem by switching to
</I>&gt;<i> societal arrangements that do *not* vest any particular individuals with
</I>&gt;<i> great power to make public-matter decisions for personal benefit.This
</I>&gt;<i> solution does not rely on our (non-existent) ability to alter the
</I>&gt;<i> ideologies and/or personalities of those vested individuals, nor does it
</I>&gt;<i> rely on our (non-existent) ability to select only incorruptible saints
</I>&gt;<i> to fill those empowered roles..
</I>
Right, all it requires is massive quantities of unicorn farts to drug
*all* people into behaving completely different from their current
natures (i.e., apparently you plan to change them all into communists
who will rearrange their lives so that decisionmaking can be done via
soviets). Unlike you, I'm actually *not* proposing to change anyone or
even expecting them to make more than a trivial effort to change the
system. It's just to apply simple filters to keep the incompetent
people out of the executive branch and to boost participation rates
(by automating them) to prevent the elites from running the
legislative branch primarily to benefit themselves like they do now.

&gt;<i> You have experienced the problems, but you have not yet experienced any
</I>&gt;<i> societal arrangement solutions to those problems.
</I>
Right, because there aren't any, and even if there were, it'd be
impractical to implement them because changing &quot;societal arrangements&quot;
is a classic Catch-22: You can't change them without a functioning
decisionmaking system, and yet you can't change the decisionmaking
system because the current arrangements don't allow for this. IMHO
we've got to go outside the current system to change the
decisionmaking system (i.e., cause a technology disruption) after
which, if the right new system is in place, we won't *need* to change
any &quot;societal arrangements&quot;. Whereas going outside to change the
&quot;arrangements&quot; first is a prescription for anarchy from which only a
dictatorship (the natural state of a mob) can emerge.

&gt;<i> You have placed your
</I>&gt;<i> bets, but the &quot;solutions races&quot; that will demonstrate which solutions
</I>&gt;<i> work and which do not, have not even started yet.
</I>
Right: Although at present I seem to have this entire domain to myself
because, excepting a few work-within-the-system types exactly *no one*
seems to be working on anything beyond handwaving proposals about
collecting and repurposing unicorn farts (and I don't even count
Liquid Democracy and the Rousseau systems because those have already
been clearly (and scientifically) shown to not work, so they're not
even &quot;proposals&quot; at this point, just ways of wasting time and effort).

&gt;<i> For SDAPs, wielding power (and gaining ever more power) is its own
</I>&gt;<i> reward. That provides their motivation.
</I>
Agreed. Most of them would do what they do for a living wage without
even the promise they'd get rich off it.

&gt;<i> The Rules For Rulers provide the means -- they are all about how to
</I>&gt;<i> acquire, retain, and increase that power.
</I>
No, that's not about power in the general sense, it's only about money
(a very limited source of power).

&gt;<i> SDAPs obey the Rules For Rulers, and so do non-SDAPs that arrive in
</I>&gt;<i> seats of power (if, for whatever reasons, they wish to remain in power).
</I>
Again, does that video explain Hitler or Mao or Stalin? Or even Trump?
 Most of the kleptocrats have already been driven out of the Trump
administration, and even Ivanka has now closed up her business. I
don't even think money is Trump's main motivation: He's a psychopath
and does it more for the kicks than the money. He's not even promising
his supporters more money, and this whole tariff thing is about
jerking people around rather than funding his &quot;keys&quot;. They support him
because they'd rather see everyone's suffering match their own than
ordinary competence from the executive branch.

&gt;<i> &gt; Being able to replace the Manager with only a month's delay is IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the only power we really need.
</I>&gt;<i> This is the bet you are placing, that this arrangement will be enough.
</I>&gt;<i> You have no Plan B, no hedge, no &quot;checks and balances&quot;.
</I>
If you can't replace the Manager, it's not an issue of &quot;checks and
balances&quot;, what you've got is a &quot;failed state&quot;. Like what the US is
now IMHO because even though just about everyone (and probably *all*
senators and congressmen) realizes we need a different president,
there's nothing they can do about it because there is no practical way
to remove him.

    Scott
