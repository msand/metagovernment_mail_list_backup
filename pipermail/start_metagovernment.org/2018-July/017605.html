</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This approach to enabling/empowering democracy seems to me to be too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;purely abstract&quot; to be effective, for a combination of two reasons:
</I>&gt;<i> As opposed to what we have now, where not only does the executive
</I>&gt;<i> branch not know what we want, but*we*  don't even know what we
</I>&gt;<i> (collectively) want and so there's no way to even judge the quality of
</I>&gt;<i> the management?
</I>My suggestion is that having The Proxies respond to the items of your 
purely abstract list would not usefully reveal &quot;what we want&quot;. There 
would still be no valid way to judge the quality of the management. The 
items of the list are too abstract, vague, and overlapped.

Whether responses to the list could be used for proxy matching purposes 
is an empirical question. (Given that I myself would not be able to 
respond to the list as directed because absolutely crucial information 
is missing from the proposal, I doubt that it would be.)

Whether managers would find the information useful when creating new 
policy proposals and budget items would depend on what the managers were 
trying to accomplish. Again, given how abstract, vague, and overlapped 
the items of the list are, the information would probably be mainly 
useful as material to be used in political speechifying.

&gt;&gt;<i> 1. When a proposal is &quot;purely abstract&quot; (as all of the line-items are),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it is left to the executive to decide (undemocratically) what the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concrete manifestations of the abstractions will be.
</I>&gt;<i> Not exactly: Individual proposals still have to voted on by The
</I>&gt;<i> People. Again, the main purposes of this list are to find proxy
</I>&gt;<i> matches and so that the managers can use this information when
</I>&gt;<i> creating new policy proposals and budget items.
</I>In keeping with rule #2 of the Rules for Rulers, the power puppeteers 
behind the &quot;public face&quot; political elite (consisting of the Globality 
Manager together with the Locality Managers) can effectively eliminate 
The Proxies as one of its keys by presenting a steady stream (four per 
week) of &quot;harmless&quot; proposals to The Proxies, thereby keeping them fully 
occupied doing nothing.

&quot;Harmless&quot; in this context means &quot;not interfering with the substantive 
plots and plans and profits of the puppeteers&quot;.

The proposal at hand (having The Proxies respond to the list below) is a 
great example of a harmless proposal. The original dozen proposals on 
proxyfor.me provide other great examples of harmless proposals: deciding 
whether to extend legal personhood to chimpanzees, deciding whether to 
shut down SETI, deciding whether to mandate &quot;Idaho Stop&quot; ordinances 
globally, etc. It only takes four harmless proposals per week to 
entirely neutralize The Proxies as a political force in global governance.

(From the perspective of the power puppeteers, firing Managers is 
another class of harmless proposals, since the puppeteers can easily 
have full control of who gets into the replacement pools. It would work 
just fine for the puppeteers for The Proxies to fire four Managers per 
week, forever. That would use up all the democratic decisionmaking, 
harmlessly.)

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Those executives will be operating under to the Rules For Rulers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (beyond any concretely effective vote-driven democratic control).

</I>&gt;<i> It's a nice story, but unfortunately really only describes the most
</I>&gt;<i> simplistic and primitive form of power, kleptocracy, which is seen
</I>&gt;<i> only in the very poorest and least developed places like Venezuela and
</I>&gt;<i> North Korea, notably excluding Russia which is a special case because
</I>&gt;<i> of the unique one-time ability for Putin to distribute massive wealth
</I>&gt;<i> in state assets to his cronies (or people willing to become his
</I>&gt;<i> cronies). Far more powerful, and far more common, is rule based on
</I>&gt;<i> ideology which that video didn't address*at all*: Hitler, Stalin,
</I>&gt;<i> Mao, Castro, and even wannabe dictators like Trump and Erdogan  didn't
</I>&gt;<i> rely primarily on any sort of monetary compensation for themselves or
</I>&gt;<i> their &quot;keys&quot; to achieve their goals, but gained and maintained power
</I>&gt;<i> by exploiting ideology in their &quot;keys&quot; and in The People (particularly
</I>&gt;<i> nationalism, but also including happy talk about
</I>&gt;<i> communism/fascism/some religion or other/etc.) The solution, of
</I>&gt;<i> course, is not to hope for benevolent dictators, but instead to
</I>&gt;<i> severely restrict the power of the executive branch, including having
</I>&gt;<i> a very simple way to remove them (such as when their popularity drops
</I>&gt;<i> below that of some obvious replacement candidate, as described in
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/managers/">http://www.matchism.org/managers/</A>)
</I>It sure sounds like you didn't watch the second half of the video.

Ideology does not pay the bills. You are being distracted by all of the 
political speechifying.

None of the arrangements discussed on the Managers page, and none of the 
arrangements discussed on The System page, do anything to significantly 
restrict the power of the executive branch. Individual Managers will 
come and go, but the power of the executive branch is entirely 
unrestrained. You are conflating &quot;the executive branch&quot; with &quot;the Manager&quot;.
