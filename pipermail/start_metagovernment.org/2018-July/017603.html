<PRE>Quick general comments (just for the record):

This approach to enabling/empowering democracy seems to me to be too 
&quot;purely abstract&quot; to be effective, for a combination of two reasons:

1. When a proposal is &quot;purely abstract&quot; (as all of the line-items are), 
it is left to the executive to decide (undemocratically) what the 
concrete manifestations of the abstractions will be.

2. Those executives will be operating under to the Rules For Rulers 
(beyond any concretely effective vote-driven democratic control).

<A HREF="https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs">https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs</A>

A further problem is that the concrete projections of the purely 
abstract categories will hopelessly overlap the abstract categories, 
which will exponentially increase the &quot;wiggle room&quot; that the executives 
will have.

And, in voting such a list, I cannot decide how much budget to allocate 
to each item without knowing exactly in detail *how* the money will be 
spent.

 &#160;&#160;&#160; For example, if money allotted to Education is going to be spent in 
support of the factory-school classroom teacher model that is currently 
dominant, then I will vote that zero money be directed to Education. But 
if the money will be spent on developing and making freely available a 
really good online curriculum (that will have a near-zero marginal cost 
per student), that has a &quot;Tutoring On-Line On-Call&quot; system available to 
deal with potholes in the curriculum, then I will want to vote big bucks 
to Education.

I look forward to reading the newly revised Matchism Manifesto (when I 
can get to it), and am very happy to see that your project continues to 
progress.
