As opposed to what we have now, where not only does the executive

(collectively) want and so there's no way to even judge the quality of
the management?

&gt;<i> 1. When a proposal is &quot;purely abstract&quot; (as all of the line-items are),

</I>
Not exactly: Individual proposals still have to voted on by The
People. Again, the main purposes of this list are to find proxy
matches and so that the managers can use this information when
creating new policy proposals and budget items.

&gt;<i> 2. Those executives will be operating under to the Rules For Rulers
</I>&gt;<i> (beyond any concretely effective vote-driven democratic control).

It's a nice story, but unfortunately really only describes the most
simplistic and primitive form of power, kleptocracy, which is seen
only in the very poorest and least developed places like Venezuela and
North Korea, notably excluding Russia which is a special case because
of the unique one-time ability for Putin to distribute massive wealth
in state assets to his cronies (or people willing to become his
cronies). Far more powerful, and far more common, is rule based on
ideology which that video didn't address *at all*: Hitler, Stalin,
Mao, Castro, and even wannabe dictators like Trump and Erdogan  didn't
rely primarily on any sort of monetary compensation for themselves or
their &quot;keys&quot; to achieve their goals, but gained and maintained power
by exploiting ideology in their &quot;keys&quot; and in The People (particularly
nationalism, but also including happy talk about
communism/fascism/some religion or other/etc.) The solution, of
course, is not to hope for benevolent dictators, but instead to
severely restrict the power of the executive branch, including having
a very simple way to remove them (such as when their popularity drops
below that of some obvious replacement candidate, as described in
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/managers/">http://www.matchism.org/managers/</A>)

&gt;<i> And, in voting such a list, I cannot decide how much budget to allocate
</I>&gt;<i> to each item without knowing exactly in detail *how* the money will be
</I>&gt;<i> spent.
</I>
Right, which is why I'm inclined *not* to try to build the budgeting
system on top of this assessment. Besides the relative size issue you
mention, there is also a big problem with the lack of a one to one
mapping of items in the two domains. For example under the &quot;minimizing
inequality&quot; heading one would have to include a wide range of budget
items from job training to wage and housing subsidies to tax rates and
even what is taxed. While it'd be nice to have simplistic items like
these at least as category headings, it may have to suffice to have
the high-level overview of the budgeting system mirror something like
the organizational structure of the executive branch.

&gt;<i>      For example, if money allotted to Education is going to be spent in
</I>&gt;<i> support of the factory-school classroom teacher model that is currently
</I>&gt;<i> dominant, then I will vote that zero money be directed to Education. But
</I>&gt;<i> if the money will be spent on developing and making freely available a
</I>&gt;<i> really good online curriculum (that will have a near-zero marginal cost
</I>&gt;<i> per student), that has a &quot;Tutoring On-Line On-Call&quot; system available to
</I>&gt;<i> deal with potholes in the curriculum, then I will want to vote big bucks
</I>&gt;<i> to Education.
</I>
Right: This is a job for proposals and maybe budgeting, not for a
simple &quot;will of the people&quot; assessment. But maybe this also means that
this particular line item should be tweaked, perhaps like I did with
that other big-budget/high-conflict item, health care:
Improving health care access, quality, and efficiency

&gt;<i> I look forward to reading the newly revised Matchism Manifesto (when I
</I>&gt;<i> can get to it), and am very happy to see that your project continues to
</I>&gt;<i> progress.
</I>
Next up is beta 3 for proxyfor.me. This run is going to be based on
local proposals (from cities in Colorado), and will include
authentication, at least for voters in Colorado: I've ordered the
state-wide voter database and the state has an on-line form where you
can look up your your ID and so we can use that for validation rather
than having to deal with sending out postcards to every voter. This
should work well for testing purposes, although I know it's going to
be tough to extend this design to other localities, at least until The
People start demanding some transparency: In some states (notably
Texas) there is no statewide database and so basically no one actually
knows what things like participation rates and party affiliation are.
Instead you have to contact and pay a fee to *each county* to build up
the database yourself which near as I can tell no one has done. My
guess as to why it's like that is that this design facilitates
gerrymandering because it makes it practically impossible for any
outsider to run their own analysis on where the district boundary
lines are (Texas, perhaps not coincidentally, being one of the most
gerrymandered states in the country). In other states the buying
database is prohibitively expensive (it's $50 in Colorado, but $500 in
Oregon, for example) or there are other restrictions on getting it.

     Scott
