<PRE>Hi Pietro,

It's good to hear that Vilfredo is doing well.

&gt;<i> ... two italian MP have suggested that eventually we might use
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo for the Italian Parliamentary committee. ...
</I>
I think so, though you don't document that use case.  Apparently
Silvio Berlusconi could have benefited from it yesterday. :-)
<A HREF="http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/03/silvio-berlusconi-senate-pictures">http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/oct/03/silvio-berlusconi-senate-pictures</A>

&gt;<i> Regarding the documentation, it is unfortunately correct that the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation around is incomplete. Especially the English one (the
</I>&gt;<i> Italian one is a bit better with a series of 4 ten minutes video
</I>&gt;<i> that explain pretty much all). I have started gathering all the
</I>&gt;<i> information at the github wiki page
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki">https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki</A>&gt;.
</I>
Thank you.  That page didn't show up in my searches.  I'll put that
down as your home page.

I'm gathering data for a comparative survey.  Vilfredo comes out
looking pretty good.  I hope to share it in a day or two.

&gt;<i> ... For now there are three videos in English. And yes, we should
</I>&gt;<i> add a page to it on the front page.
</I>
What I wanted to suggest concerns the About link on this page, which
is your top Google page: <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php</A>

The About link should probably be visible to everyone, even when they
are not logged in.  Currently it's only visible to logged in users.

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for looking into Vilfredo. Thanks for taking the time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo is progressing a lot recently. We had some funding from an italian
</I>&gt;<i> government foundation and we are re-writing the code. The new one will is
</I>&gt;<i> being written in Python with a framework and a complete division front end
</I>&gt;<i> backend. This was one of the main problems that kept it from developing in
</I>&gt;<i> the past.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We also awakened the google
</I>&gt;<i> group&lt;<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vilfredo-develops-in-athens">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vilfredo-develops-in-athens</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> and invited any person who was interested in it to come and join us. You
</I>&gt;<i> are of course welcome to join in, as anyone else who is in the
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the documentation, it is unfortunately correct that the
</I>&gt;<i> documentation around is incomplete. Especially the English one (the Italian
</I>&gt;<i> one is a bit better with a series of 4 ten minutes video that explain
</I>&gt;<i> pretty much all). I have started gathering all the information at the github
</I>&gt;<i> wiki page &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki">https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki</A>&gt;. For now there
</I>&gt;<i> are three videos in English. And yes, we should add a page to it on the
</I>&gt;<i> front page.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Having now worked on Vilfredo for 4 years I learned many things. One of
</I>&gt;<i> them is that it works well, in fact very well as a tool for small groups
</I>&gt;<i> (5-25 people) to build consensus. And it only works for some kind of
</I>&gt;<i> questions. The one that I generally call the &quot;how&quot; questions. So I do not
</I>&gt;<i> present it anymore as an eDemocracy tool, but as a consensus building tool.
</I>&gt;<i> This might seem like a big limit, but actually it is VERY common that when
</I>&gt;<i> you go to the nitty gritty work on trying to write a text, or taking a
</I>&gt;<i> decision, you always have less than 15 people. There are even people who
</I>&gt;<i> claim that you cannot be productive if you have more than 12 people
</I>&gt;<i> discussing on a topic. If Vilfredo could double this limit from 12 to 24 it
</I>&gt;<i> would have made a huge improvement. And not just for the government.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As part of our involvement with the foundation we got in touch with several
</I>&gt;<i> people working for the parliament, or for various parties. Right now some
</I>&gt;<i> people of the Italian Pirate Party have started using Vilfredo as a side
</I>&gt;<i> tool to their liquid feedback to develop proposal that they then insert in
</I>&gt;<i> liquid feedback. On the other hand two italian MP have suggested that
</I>&gt;<i> eventually we might use Vilfredo for the Italian Parliamentary committee.
</I>&gt;<i> Those are the committee that decides the actual laws, before they are voted
</I>&gt;<i> by the parliament. This is of course a long term dream, but at least you
</I>&gt;<i> can see what is that we are aiming for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo itself has changed a lot. From the simple system we use to have,
</I>&gt;<i> it now have much more feedback loops, and integrations. When you vote
</I>&gt;<i> against a proposal you are expected to explain what's wrong with it. After
</I>&gt;<i> you have voted you can see how others have voted, and change your vote, to
</I>&gt;<i> get the best Pareto Front you can get.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me I keep on presenting it here and there. I develop the theory.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What really Vilfredo would need are people working in the user interface.
</I>&gt;<i> But the foundation I am working with makes some really good user interface.
</I>&gt;<i> You can see here &lt;<A HREF="http://partecipa.civici.civiclinks.it/">http://partecipa.civici.civiclinks.it/</A>&gt; a tool we just
</I>&gt;<i> developed together which is now being used by the government to ask for
</I>&gt;<i> ideas on how to change the constitution. The triangles of votes are my idea
</I>&gt;<i> (with a Russian colleague) from a paper we presented at ePart of a couple
</I>&gt;<i> of years ago.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, yes, Vilfredo is progressing nice and steadily. I haven't checked in
</I>&gt;<i> with Metagovernment lately. Mostly because I felt the group has moved on so
</I>&gt;<i> much I would have to explain everything about it, and I just did not have
</I>&gt;<i> the time. If I think Metagovernment was the first group to actively use and
</I>&gt;<i> test Vilfredo :-).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, yes, I also started making videos. Sometimes from my talks, but not
</I>&gt;<i> always. Here &lt;<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI</A>&gt; is for example a
</I>&gt;<i> very nice (IMNSHO) video in which I explain the graphs. Something which is
</I>&gt;<i> slowly becoming one of the main features in Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for giving me the occasion to tell all this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
