<PRE>Hi Max,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; How might we give everyone who wishes a sense of agency in
    public policy making?

Ned&gt; I would wish our public decision system to give everyone, equally, 
agency (not just a sense of agency, whatever that is), and (equally 
important, arguably even more important) to reliably produce &quot;good&quot; 
decisions (from the perspective of outcomes produced by the decisions).

I have not yet encountered any transitive representative system design 
that (in my estimation) would be more likely to better satisfy these two 
criteria than the Blinap design.

The Blinap design does not have representatives, and does not feature 
transitivity.

If you have a transitive representative system design that you think 
would be more likely to better satisfy these two criteria than the 
Blinap design, I would very much like to see it.
