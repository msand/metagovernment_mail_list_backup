<PRE>Max! I greatly appreciate the &quot;setup&quot; that your response gave me. Here 
we go ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; I suspect what you are looking for with these criteria from a
    software selection perspective is an RFP document, perhaps with an
    agreed weighing of the criteria therein.

    Is this a fair statement?

Ned&gt; Actually, no. It is not a fair statement -- in fact, not even 
close. You are thinking like a bureaucrat, not like a systems designer. 
(And, you are projecting your own bureaucratic thinking onto me ...)

I will now attempt to explain what I have just said.

    * THE DESIGN PROCESS: AN INTROSPECTION
    * FACILITATING THE DESIGN PROCESS

------------------------------------------------------------------------


      THE DESIGN PROCESS: AN INTROSPECTION

What follows is my &quot;watching myself&quot; report of the systems design 
process that I have been living for the past many years. In brief, here 
is the process flowchart:

   1. Formulate The Question
   2. Live The Question
   3. The Popcorn Process
   4. Translate The &quot;Understandings&quot;
   5. Break The New Design
   6. LOOP: Formulate The Next Question

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Formulate The Question

We need an example, and since this is an introspective report, we'll use 
my first question.

My purposeful social systems design work began on February 22, 1996. I 
was in the middle of reading a book by Paul Hawken (The Ecology of 
Commerce), and experienced one of them thar epiphanies:

   1. In the book, Mr. Hawken was suggesting tweaks to our existing
      social systems that he expected would make them better. I
      understood that the tweaks he was suggesting were some of the best
      tweaks that I had encountered up to that point.
   2. I understood that what he was suggesting would not work (that the
      tweaks would not make our existing social systems significantly
      better).
   3. I understood that my seeing that his ideas would not work &quot;put the
      ball in my court&quot;: If this won't work, what will? That was the
      original question for all of the work that I have done since.

Since that original [meta]question, there have been thousands of 
questions formulated, right down to the question presently at hand: &quot;How 
am I going to help Max understand the difference between a bureaucrat 
and a systems designer?&quot;

The design process is intensely recursive. &quot;Formulate the question&quot; is 
the first step of the process, and is at the same a project in its own 
right, to which the entire process may apply: &quot;How shall I formulate 
this question?&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Live The Question

Once formulated, the question must then be &quot;activated&quot;, which includes 
both &quot;grokking the question in fullness&quot; and energizing it (caring about 
finding answers). For me, this is not an active process. It has more to 
do with becoming quiet and balanced and open. Things like meditation can 
help. The step has to do with clarifying intention, not with trying to 
figure out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        The Popcorn Process

To use an analogy, living the question heats the oil that the popcorn is 
sitting in. As the heat becomes sufficient, at first one-by-one, and 
then perhaps in a flood, answers to the question will start &quot;popping 
in&quot;. Their popping in does not involve any direct effort on my part, and 
in fact is more likely when I am not making mental effort, while 
showering or cutting vegetables or whatever.

I have no idea where the answers pop in &quot;from&quot;, nor do I have any 
introspective insight into the processes that produce the answers. Maybe 
all of the processing occurs in my physical brain, or maybe the answers 
are telepathically communicated from the Galactic Logos -- I don't know. 
(Those are not necessarily the only two possibilities ...)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Translate The &quot;Understandings&quot;

Sometimes answers arrive in &quot;ready to use&quot; form: sentences, pictures, 
design drawings, etc. But, for me, much more often they arrive as 
&quot;wordless understandings&quot;, that must then be translated into words and 
design elements and such. The translating can be hard work, and can 
introduce distortions, so that the answer-as-translated may wind up 
being significantly different that the answer-as-received. This is 
particularly true when the original is very abstract and then must be 
applied concretely.

 From the perspective of the adage: &quot;creativity is 10% inspiration and 
90% perspiration&quot;, the Popcorn Process is the 10% inspiration, and the 
translation process is the 90% perspiration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        Break The New Design

Applying the answers received results in a new or modified design. If 
one is a real designer (and not just a bureaucrat or a politician 
pretending), the work (and play!) then becomes to find as many ways as 
possible to break the new design. Thought experiments, simulations, 
bench-testing, laboratory experiments, field tests -- the sincere 
whole-hearted aim is to find ways to break the design.

In the beginning, breaking the design is easy -- just looking at it hard 
may break it. As the design progresses through iterations of the 
process, finding ways to break it becomes harder - in fact, that is one 
of the main ways that progress can be measured.

Again the design process is intensely recursive: answering &quot;How can I 
break this design?&quot; is a project in its own right, to which the entire 
process may apply.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


        LOOP: Formulate The Next Question

Whenever a way is found to break the design, it leads to the next 
iteration of the design process: &quot;How can the design be modified to 
survive that way of breaking?&quot;.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------


      FACILITATING THE DESIGN PROCESS

So now that we have a sketch of the design process in hand, we can ask 
what might be done to help the process along.

The first answer to that question that jumps right out is that we can 
collaborate and share, with respect to each step of the process (with 
the possible exception of the &quot;Live The Question&quot; step).

One example of the sort of thing that we could share, and collaborate in 
compiling, would be a list of criteria that could be used to evaluate 
and compare different decision system designs. This list might 
potentially and particularly be useful (to us systems designers) with 
respect to Step 1 (&quot;Formulate the Question&quot;), Step 3 (The Popcorn 
Process), Step 4 (&quot;Translate&quot;), and Step 5 (&quot;Break the New Design&quot;).

We systems designers &quot;don't do RFPs&quot;, so it would not be useful to us 
for that. We CREATE systems; RFPs are for SELECTING among systems that 
others have created. (Bureaucrats don't create; they select.)

Bentley recently undertook a project of this sort: he examined all of 
the discussion tools he could find, and compiled a spreadsheet of design 
elements and patterns that they manifested. He then went through and 
asked, with respect to each element and pattern: &quot;Is there a way to make 
AllAngles better by incorporating this feature into its design?&quot; (At 
least that is what my ouija board is telling me he did -- we would have 
to ask Bentley to know for sure ...)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I heartily agree with your assessment: I have been working
</I>&gt;<i>     (for years) to make that better, but still (as you say) have a
</I>&gt;<i>     long way to go. Working out the design took years, and now trying
</I>&gt;<i>     to learn/understand how to present the design looks like it will
</I>&gt;<i>     take at least as long again. (The current state of the
</I>&gt;<i>     presentation is a good example of a &quot;partial incremental solution&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Given your talents and interests (and the current abysmal state of
</I>&gt;<i>     the presentation), I would suggest that we not start there.
</I>&gt;<i>     Instead (since we already have), we might start by trying to
</I>&gt;<i>     develop a [comprehensive] set of criteria that could be used to
</I>&gt;<i>     evaluate and compare different decision system designs. That would
</I>&gt;<i>     be potentially of considerable value across all of the projects of
</I>&gt;<i>     the Metagovernment community. (Pietro and Bentley and Mike among
</I>&gt;<i>     others have already been doing that sort of work recently, so that
</I>&gt;<i>     our efforts would add to theirs.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I am genuinely interested to hear what your objections are to the
</I>&gt;<i>     two criteria that were introduced earlier in this thread:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         (C#1) The decision system design must give everyone, equally,
</I>&gt;<i>         opportunity to participate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         (C#2) The decision system design must reliably produce &quot;good&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>         decisions (from the perspective of outcomes produced by the
</I>&gt;<i>         decisions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (This seems enough for one email; we can tackle the proxy issue,
</I>&gt;<i>     the interdependence issue, and the transitivity issue in other
</I>&gt;<i>     emails. In fact, at your discretion, you might address each of
</I>&gt;<i>     these two criteria in its own email, or even its own thread.)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     was part of the original vision Ed had.  So I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             probably
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     misremember, so I selected that as the question to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     discussed in this thread.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     I will rephrase:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     How might we give everyone who wishes a sense of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             agency in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     public policy making?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     I supposed this is &quot;packed&quot; also.  So the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             responses might best
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     be proposed restatements of the question.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     Even better, since we are being reductionist on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             this list, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     can start with your understanding of sense of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             agency, with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     cites.  Since the meaning varies with domain,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that will be fun.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>                     Max
