<PRE>Hi Max,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; I did back in the day look at blinap. I have problems with it
    and I thank you for those two criteria, because I now understand
    that I do not support your criteria, which helps me focus on the
    nature of the problem i had with blinap.

Ned&gt; Excellent! I am now looking forward to reading your critique ...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; As far as &quot;sense&quot; of agency, somewhere I did observe that this
    list is very anti-cartesian. And as at that occasion I refuse to
    rise to the bait here. But again &quot;google is your friend&quot;.

Ned&gt; I actually was not asking what &quot;sense of agency&quot; means. Rather, I 
was &quot;refusing to rise to the bait&quot;, your invitation that I discuss the 
meaning with you (with cites).

As for your view that I am and/or the community is anti-cartesian, 
certainly you are free to think whatever you think about that (and 
hopefully your views will not lead you into any /ad hominem/ 
argumentation errors).

(I might be interested in reading your account of why you view myself 
and/or the community as anti-cartesian, but I am actually not sure -- 
generally pop philosophy doesn't really grab me the way that good social 
system design does. As a spiritual being enjoying a physical existence, 
I like playing the physical games as presented, with gusto and without 
much navel-staring ...)

(If you have any sincere interest in what I think I think about 
philosophy of mind questions, check out &quot;The Ra Material&quot; (Google is 
your friend ...). That material presents (to me) the best story I have 
encountered so far regarding such matters. And also, I hold the view 
that I can be wrong about anything, so to me the material is just a good 
story, not gospel.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; I will not bother you more for a time.

Ned&gt; Feel free to bother me any time -- it's no bother!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Max&gt; How might we give everyone who wishes a sense of agency in
</I>&gt;<i>        public policy making?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I would wish our public decision system to give everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>     equally, agency (not just a sense of agency, whatever that is),
</I>&gt;<i>     and (equally important, arguably even more important) to reliably
</I>&gt;<i>     produce &quot;good&quot; decisions (from the perspective of outcomes
</I>&gt;<i>     produced by the decisions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I have not yet encountered any transitive representative system
</I>&gt;<i>     design that (in my estimation) would be more likely to better
</I>&gt;<i>     satisfy these two criteria than the Blinap design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The Blinap design does not have representatives, and does not
</I>&gt;<i>     feature transitivity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you have a transitive representative system design that you
</I>&gt;<i>     think would be more likely to better satisfy these two criteria
</I>&gt;<i>     than the Blinap design, I would very much like to see it.

</I>&gt;<i>         I commented on money in a share discussion.  I mentioned
</I>&gt;<i>         transitive democracy.  Ned suggested I start a new thread on
</I>&gt;<i>         each item I mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i>         That would be overload for us all.  But I thought the
</I>&gt;<i>         transitive democracy was not a big item since as I recall this
</I>&gt;<i>         was part of the original vision Ed had.  So I probably
</I>&gt;<i>         misremember, so I selected that as the question to be
</I>&gt;<i>         discussed in this thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I will rephrase:

</I>&gt;<i>         How might we give everyone who wishes a sense of agency in
</I>&gt;<i>         public policy making?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I supposed this is &quot;packed&quot; also.  So the responses might best
</I>&gt;<i>         be proposed restatements of the question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Even better, since we are being reductionist on this list, we
</I>&gt;<i>         can start with your understanding of sense of agency, with
</I>&gt;<i>         cites.  Since the meaning varies with domain, that will be fun.
