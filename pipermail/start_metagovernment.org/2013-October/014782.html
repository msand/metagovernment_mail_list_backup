The thing is, as i've already mentioned, i don't see what problem you are
trying to solve.
It's too abstract for me to see. I cannot imagine a situation that will
manifest once the process started and is keeping itself alive.
Whats the benefit?
Do we profit from it? In what way? What will the mirror front tell us in a
way thats better than what we have now?

Maybe if there is 2 communities, metagovernment and another community,
talking about the same stuff, then we will learn about each other.... but
then again, before the technology we are using is used by the other
community in order to be visible in the same mirror front we have already
learned about each other and we might have joined their mailinglist or they
might have joined ours.
Its easier to use GOOGLE to search from time to time in order to find
those, or maybe we follow our personal areas of interest, maybe even on
twitter or something similar and discover others there...

Which PAIN you are trying to resolve with that &quot;mirror front technique&quot;?
I tried to use it and we discussed in here.... not even did i not feel any
pain that i was relieved of, it actually caused additional &quot;pain&quot;, because
i spent time and could still not see, not even IMAGINE a relieve of any
kind of pain...
...so probably you are doing it wrong, that means, you are approaching a
problem you might be able to see, from the wrong direction.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And regardless of whether it has or has not, have you learned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything as a result?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess I was thinking out loud about what comes next for Votorola now
</I>&gt;<i> that the design is complete.  Or maybe just tossing the question in
</I>&gt;<i> the air to see how it lands.  Sorry to make so much noise about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I came to the conclusion that the next job is to describe the
</I>&gt;<i> technology.  So I'm off doing that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Actually,what you are trying to do is EDUCATING people :-) ...to see a
solution to a problem.
Could you write down the problem you are trying to solve?
...or at least ONE ASPECT of the problem, to which ONE ASPECT of your
solution might actually fit? :-)

btw... in order for something to be a solution, it has to respect
&quot;usability issues&quot; too.
1. If something is easy to use, it educates people about a solution
2. If something is easy to use, it changes the path of least resistance, so
people will naturally follow it :-)

A theoretical solution might be so hard to use, that it doesnt work in
practice.
&quot;Nuclear Fusion&quot; in theory is awesome... but in practice, all the
&quot;solutions&quot; in existance are so bad, that they actually cannot provide the
benefits which the theory promises... (at least not yet)
