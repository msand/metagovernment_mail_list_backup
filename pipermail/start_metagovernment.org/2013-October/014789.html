<PRE>Alex,

You said earlier you googled and found nothing.  I google and do a few
pastes just to show you there is something that is googlable.

I claim that all you did is read the pastes that I made and did not bother
to google!  True?

Now I do not care but my intention is to make the voting system impossible
for you to do that AND comment on my posts.  Or mod me down or up.

Still, if you were to cite to the tractatus I would not want to bother
either.

Let me emphasize that my formal interests on MG is just to finish up a
small project.  Your amusement with the string of words is though I think
correct.

&quot;
The formation in geological time of the human body by the laws of physics
(or any other laws of similar nature), starting from a random distribution
of elementary particles and the field is as unlikely as the separation of
the atmosphere into its components. The complexity of the living things has
to be present within the material [from which they are derived] or in the
laws [governing their formation].&quot;
