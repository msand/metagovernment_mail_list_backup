&gt;<i> So where are we on this topic? I had to be absent for a while, but
</I>&gt;<i> it looks like the discussion sort of fizzled in late September.
</I>
Yes, it's gone dormant.

&gt;<i> Separately, what is going on here? I can follow the words, and
</I>&gt;<i> follow some of the concept, but I am not sure I see this initiative
</I>&gt;<i> taking form by its own bootstraps. Is it? ...
</I>
Not while it's dormant, of course.  But yes, it could fly if we wanted
it to.  There's no urgent need, however, so I shouldn't have urged it.
Thanks all the same to Alex and you, and to others who tried to help.

&gt;<i> And regardless of whether it has or has not, have you learned
</I>&gt;<i> anything as a result?
</I>
I guess I was thinking out loud about what comes next for Votorola now
that the design is complete.  Or maybe just tossing the question in
the air to see how it lands.  Sorry to make so much noise about it.

Anyway, I came to the conclusion that the next job is to describe the
technology.  So I'm off doing that.

Mike
