<PRE>Ned,

Curious.  I believe I was not advocating the RFP appoach.  But perhaps I
was accusing you of being a bureacrat.  But my expectation was to go then
to propose a modular design.  Still, I suppose I was not so much accusing
as inquiring.

I suppose my next &quot;accusation&quot; is that you are playing a von neuman system
analysis game.  I am in fact thinking you are spooky enough so that this
labelitis is unuseful.  But the implied question might be such that we will
both enjoy your response.

Curiously I was taught to be sad about von neumann and so on.  Looking more
closely, I am bemused.

Having said I would do something with Bentley's spreadsheets is why I hang
around.

Blessings,

Max

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will now attempt to explain what I have just said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - THE DESIGN PROCESS: AN INTROSPECTION
</I>&gt;<i>    - FACILITATING THE DESIGN PROCESS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> THE DESIGN PROCESS: AN INTROSPECTION
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What follows is my &quot;watching myself&quot; report of the systems design process
</I>&gt;<i> that I have been living for the past many years. In brief, here is the
</I>&gt;<i> process flowchart:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. Formulate The Question
</I>&gt;<i>    2. Live The Question
</I>&gt;<i>    3. The Popcorn Process
</I>&gt;<i>    4. Translate The &quot;Understandings&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>    5. Break The New Design
</I>&gt;<i>    6. LOOP: Formulate The Next Question
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Formulate The Question
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need an example, and since this is an introspective report, we'll use
</I>&gt;<i> my first question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My purposeful social systems design work began on February 22, 1996. I was
</I>&gt;<i> in the middle of reading a book by Paul Hawken (The Ecology of Commerce),
</I>&gt;<i> and experienced one of them thar epiphanies:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1. In the book, Mr. Hawken was suggesting tweaks to our existing
</I>&gt;<i>    social systems that he expected would make them better. I understood that
</I>&gt;<i>    the tweaks he was suggesting were some of the best tweaks that I had
</I>&gt;<i>    encountered up to that point.
</I>&gt;<i>    2. I understood that what he was suggesting would not work (that the
</I>&gt;<i>    tweaks would not make our existing social systems significantly better).
</I>&gt;<i>    3. I understood that my seeing that his ideas would not work &quot;put the
</I>&gt;<i>    ball in my court&quot;: If this won't work, what will? That was the original
</I>&gt;<i>    question for all of the work that I have done since.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Since that original [meta]question, there have been thousands of
</I>&gt;<i> questions formulated, right down to the question presently at hand: &quot;How am
</I>&gt;<i> I going to help Max understand the difference between a bureaucrat and a
</I>&gt;<i> systems designer?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The design process is intensely recursive. &quot;Formulate the question&quot; is the
</I>&gt;<i> first step of the process, and is at the same a project in its own right,
</I>&gt;<i> to which the entire process may apply: &quot;How shall I formulate this
</I>&gt;<i> question?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Live The Question
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once formulated, the question must then be &quot;activated&quot;, which includes
</I>&gt;<i> both &quot;grokking the question in fullness&quot; and energizing it (caring about
</I>&gt;<i> finding answers). For me, this is not an active process. It has more to do
</I>&gt;<i> with becoming quiet and balanced and open. Things like meditation can help.
</I>&gt;<i> The step has to do with clarifying intention, not with trying to figure out.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> The Popcorn Process
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To use an analogy, living the question heats the oil that the popcorn is
</I>&gt;<i> sitting in. As the heat becomes sufficient, at first one-by-one, and then
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps in a flood, answers to the question will start &quot;popping in&quot;. Their
</I>&gt;<i> popping in does not involve any direct effort on my part, and in fact is
</I>&gt;<i> more likely when I am not making mental effort, while showering or cutting
</I>&gt;<i> vegetables or whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have no idea where the answers pop in &quot;from&quot;, nor do I have any
</I>&gt;<i> introspective insight into the processes that produce the answers. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> all of the processing occurs in my physical brain, or maybe the answers are
</I>&gt;<i> telepathically communicated from the Galactic Logos -- I don't know. (Those
</I>&gt;<i> are not necessarily the only two possibilities ...)
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Translate The &quot;Understandings&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes answers arrive in &quot;ready to use&quot; form: sentences, pictures,
</I>&gt;<i> design drawings, etc. But, for me, much more often they arrive as &quot;wordless
</I>&gt;<i> understandings&quot;, that must then be translated into words and design
</I>&gt;<i> elements and such. The translating can be hard work, and can introduce
</I>&gt;<i> distortions, so that the answer-as-translated may wind up being
</I>&gt;<i> significantly different that the answer-as-received. This is particularly
</I>&gt;<i> true when the original is very abstract and then must be applied concretely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the perspective of the adage: &quot;creativity is 10% inspiration and 90%
</I>&gt;<i> perspiration&quot;, the Popcorn Process is the 10% inspiration, and the
</I>&gt;<i> translation process is the 90% perspiration.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> Break The New Design
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Applying the answers received results in a new or modified design. If one
</I>&gt;<i> is a real designer (and not just a bureaucrat or a politician pretending),
</I>&gt;<i> the work (and play!) then becomes to find as many ways as possible to break
</I>&gt;<i> the new design. Thought experiments, simulations, bench-testing, laboratory
</I>&gt;<i> experiments, field tests -- the sincere whole-hearted aim is to find ways
</I>&gt;<i> to break the design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the beginning, breaking the design is easy -- just looking at it hard
</I>&gt;<i> may break it. As the design progresses through iterations of the process,
</I>&gt;<i> finding ways to break it becomes harder - in fact, that is one of the main
</I>&gt;<i> ways that progress can be measured.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again the design process is intensely recursive: answering &quot;How can I
</I>&gt;<i> break this design?&quot; is a project in its own right, to which the entire
</I>&gt;<i> process may apply.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> LOOP: Formulate The Next Question
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whenever a way is found to break the design, it leads to the next
</I>&gt;<i> iteration of the design process: &quot;How can the design be modified to survive
</I>&gt;<i> that way of breaking?&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> ------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i> FACILITATING THE DESIGN PROCESS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So now that we have a sketch of the design process in hand, we can ask
</I>&gt;<i> what might be done to help the process along.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The first answer to that question that jumps right out is that we can
</I>&gt;<i> collaborate and share, with respect to each step of the process (with the
</I>&gt;<i> possible exception of the &quot;Live The Question&quot; step).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One example of the sort of thing that we could share, and collaborate in
</I>&gt;<i> compiling, would be a list of criteria that could be used to evaluate and
</I>&gt;<i> compare different decision system designs. This list might potentially and
</I>&gt;<i> particularly be useful (to us systems designers) with respect to Step 1
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;Formulate the Question&quot;), Step 3 (The Popcorn Process), Step 4
</I>&gt;<i> (&quot;Translate&quot;), and Step 5 (&quot;Break the New Design&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We systems designers &quot;don't do RFPs&quot;, so it would not be useful to us for
</I>&gt;<i> that. We CREATE systems; RFPs are for SELECTING among systems that others
</I>&gt;<i> have created. (Bureaucrats don't create; they select.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bentley recently undertook a project of this sort: he examined all of the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion tools he could find, and compiled a spreadsheet of design
</I>&gt;<i> elements and patterns that they manifested. He then went through and asked,
</I>&gt;<i> with respect to each element and pattern: &quot;Is there a way to make AllAngles
</I>&gt;<i> better by incorporating this feature into its design?&quot; (At least that is
</I>&gt;<i> what my ouija board is telling me he did -- we would have to ask Bentley to
</I>&gt;<i> know for sure ...)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  Ned&gt; I heartily agree with your assessment: I have been working (for

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Working out the design took years, and now trying to learn/understand how

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Given your talents and interests (and the current abysmal state of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presentation), I would suggest that we not start there. Instead (since we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already have), we might start by trying to develop a [comprehensive] set of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system designs. That would be potentially of considerable value across all

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mike among others have already been doing that sort of work recently, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that our efforts would add to theirs.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am genuinely interested to hear what your objections are to the two

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (C#1) The decision system design must give everyone, equally, opportunity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to participate.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (C#2) The decision system design must reliably produce &quot;good&quot; decisions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (from the perspective of outcomes produced by the decisions).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  ------------------------------
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (This seems enough for one email; we can tackle the proxy issue, the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at your discretion, you might address each of these two criteria in its own

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         Even better, since we are being reductionist on this list, we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>         can start with your understanding of sense of agency, with
