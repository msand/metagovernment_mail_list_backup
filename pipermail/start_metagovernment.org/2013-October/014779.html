<PRE>Max! I am delighted that you are choosing to continue this!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; Blinap structure is difficult to understand. Good for wonks,
    maybe big not for a techno idiot.

Ned&gt; I heartily agree with your assessment: I have been working (for 
years) to make that better, but still (as you say) have a long way to 
go. Working out the design took years, and now trying to 
learn/understand how to present the design looks like it will take at 
least as long again. (The current state of the presentation is a good 
example of a &quot;partial incremental solution&quot; ...)

Given your talents and interests (and the current abysmal state of the 
presentation), I would suggest that we not start there. Instead (since 
we already have), we might start by trying to develop a [comprehensive] 
set of criteria that could be used to evaluate and compare different 
decision system designs. That would be potentially of considerable value 
across all of the projects of the Metagovernment community. (Pietro and 
Bentley and Mike among others have already been doing that sort of work 
recently, so that our efforts would add to theirs.)

I am genuinely interested to hear what your objections are to the two 
criteria that were introduced earlier in this thread:

    (C#1) The decision system design must give everyone, equally,
    opportunity to participate.

    (C#2) The decision system design must reliably produce &quot;good&quot;
    decisions (from the perspective of outcomes produced by the decisions).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(This seems enough for one email; we can tackle the proxy issue, the 
interdependence issue, and the transitivity issue in other emails. In 
fact, at your discretion, you might address each of these two criteria 
in its own email, or even its own thread.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Excellent! I am now looking forward to reading your critique ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Max&gt; As far as &quot;sense&quot; of agency, somewhere I did observe that this
</I>&gt;<i>        list is very anti-cartesian. And as at that occasion I refuse to
</I>&gt;<i>        rise to the bait here. But again &quot;google is your friend&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; I actually was not asking what &quot;sense of agency&quot; means.
</I>&gt;<i>     Rather, I was &quot;refusing to rise to the bait&quot;, your invitation that
</I>&gt;<i>     I discuss the meaning with you (with cites).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     As for your view that I am and/or the community is anti-cartesian,
</I>&gt;<i>     certainly you are free to think whatever you think about that (and
</I>&gt;<i>     hopefully your views will not lead you into any /ad hominem/
</I>&gt;<i>     argumentation errors).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (I might be interested in reading your account of why you view
</I>&gt;<i>     myself and/or the community as anti-cartesian, but I am actually
</I>&gt;<i>     not sure -- generally pop philosophy doesn't really grab me the
</I>&gt;<i>     way that good social system design does. As a spiritual being
</I>&gt;<i>     enjoying a physical existence, I like playing the physical games
</I>&gt;<i>     as presented, with gusto and without much navel-staring ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (If you have any sincere interest in what I think I think about
</I>&gt;<i>     philosophy of mind questions, check out &quot;The Ra Material&quot; (Google
</I>&gt;<i>     is your friend ...). That material presents (to me) the best story
</I>&gt;<i>     I have encountered so far regarding such matters. And also, I hold
</I>&gt;<i>     the view that I can be wrong about anything, so to me the material
</I>&gt;<i>     is just a good story, not gospel.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        Max&gt; I will not bother you more for a time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Feel free to bother me any time -- it's no bother!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Ned&gt; I would wish our public decision system to give everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>             equally, agency (not just a sense of agency, whatever that
</I>&gt;<i>         is),
</I>&gt;<i>             and (equally important, arguably even more important) to
</I>&gt;<i>         reliably

</I>&gt;<i>             produced by the decisions).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I have not yet encountered any transitive representative
</I>&gt;<i>         system
</I>&gt;<i>             design that (in my estimation) would be more likely to better
</I>&gt;<i>             satisfy these two criteria than the Blinap design.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             The Blinap design does not have representatives, and does not
</I>&gt;<i>             feature transitivity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             If you have a transitive representative system design that you
</I>&gt;<i>             think would be more likely to better satisfy these two
</I>&gt;<i>         criteria
</I>&gt;<i>             than the Blinap design, I would very much like to see it.
