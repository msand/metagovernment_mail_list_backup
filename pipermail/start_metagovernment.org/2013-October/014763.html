<PRE>Hi Michael,
thanks for looking into Vilfredo. Thanks for taking the time.

Vilfredo is progressing a lot recently. We had some funding from an italian
government foundation and we are re-writing the code. The new one will is
being written in Python with a framework and a complete division front end
backend. This was one of the main problems that kept it from developing in
the past.

We also awakened the google
group&lt;<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vilfredo-develops-in-athens">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/vilfredo-develops-in-athens</A>&gt;,
and invited any person who was interested in it to come and join us. You
are of course welcome to join in, as anyone else who is in the
metagovernment group.

Regarding the documentation, it is unfortunately correct that the
documentation around is incomplete. Especially the English one (the Italian
one is a bit better with a series of 4 ten minutes video that explain
pretty much all). I have started gathering all the information at the github
wiki page &lt;<A HREF="https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki">https://github.com/pietrosperoni/Vilfredo/wiki</A>&gt;. For now there
are three videos in English. And yes, we should add a page to it on the
front page.

Having now worked on Vilfredo for 4 years I learned many things. One of
them is that it works well, in fact very well as a tool for small groups
(5-25 people) to build consensus. And it only works for some kind of
questions. The one that I generally call the &quot;how&quot; questions. So I do not
present it anymore as an eDemocracy tool, but as a consensus building tool.
This might seem like a big limit, but actually it is VERY common that when
you go to the nitty gritty work on trying to write a text, or taking a
decision, you always have less than 15 people. There are even people who
claim that you cannot be productive if you have more than 12 people
discussing on a topic. If Vilfredo could double this limit from 12 to 24 it
would have made a huge improvement. And not just for the government.

As part of our involvement with the foundation we got in touch with several
people working for the parliament, or for various parties. Right now some
people of the Italian Pirate Party have started using Vilfredo as a side
tool to their liquid feedback to develop proposal that they then insert in
liquid feedback. On the other hand two italian MP have suggested that
eventually we might use Vilfredo for the Italian Parliamentary committee.
Those are the committee that decides the actual laws, before they are voted
by the parliament. This is of course a long term dream, but at least you
can see what is that we are aiming for.

Vilfredo itself has changed a lot. From the simple system we use to have,
it now have much more feedback loops, and integrations. When you vote
against a proposal you are expected to explain what's wrong with it. After
you have voted you can see how others have voted, and change your vote, to
get the best Pareto Front you can get.

For me I keep on presenting it here and there. I develop the theory.

What really Vilfredo would need are people working in the user interface.
But the foundation I am working with makes some really good user interface.
You can see here &lt;<A HREF="http://partecipa.civici.civiclinks.it/">http://partecipa.civici.civiclinks.it/</A>&gt; a tool we just
developed together which is now being used by the government to ask for
ideas on how to change the constitution. The triangles of votes are my idea
(with a Russian colleague) from a paper we presented at ePart of a couple
of years ago.

So, yes, Vilfredo is progressing nice and steadily. I haven't checked in
with Metagovernment lately. Mostly because I felt the group has moved on so
much I would have to explain everything about it, and I just did not have
the time. If I think Metagovernment was the first group to actively use and
test Vilfredo :-).

Oh, yes, I also started making videos. Sometimes from my talks, but not
always. Here &lt;<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cQuz9kAybI</A>&gt; is for example a
very nice (IMNSHO) video in which I explain the graphs. Something which is
slowly becoming one of the main features in Vilfredo.


Thanks again for giving me the occasion to tell all this.

Cheers,
Pietro
