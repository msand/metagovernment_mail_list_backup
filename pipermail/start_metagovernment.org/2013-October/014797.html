<PRE>Michael,

    I am not sure why your project needs vetting. Leaving that aside,  I
think you have a conceptual model and then a partition of the problem space
that is almost easy to understand.  Then there is a wikibased collaborative
document that has a mapping from the partitioning.  Is this a little
correct so far?

Blessings,

Max

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; it looks like the discussion sort of fizzled in late September.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Yes, it's gone dormant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Separately, what is going on here? I can follow the words, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; follow some of the concept, but I am not sure I see this initiative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; taking form by its own bootstraps. Is it? ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Not while it's dormant, of course.  But yes, it could fly if we wanted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it to.  There's no urgent need, however, so I shouldn't have urged it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thanks all the same to Alex and you, and to others who tried to help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The thing is, as i've already mentioned, i don't see what problem you are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trying to solve.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's too abstract for me to see. I cannot imagine a situation that will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; manifest once the process started and is keeping itself alive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Whats the benefit?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do we profit from it? In what way? What will the mirror front tell us in
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way thats better than what we have now?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe if there is 2 communities, metagovernment and another community,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; talking about the same stuff, then we will learn about each other.... but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; then again, before the technology we are using is used by the other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; community in order to be visible in the same mirror front we have already
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; learned about each other and we might have joined their mailinglist or
</I>&gt;<i> they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might have joined ours.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Its easier to use GOOGLE to search from time to time in order to find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; those, or maybe we follow our personal areas of interest, maybe even on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; twitter or something similar and discover others there...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Which PAIN you are trying to resolve with that &quot;mirror front technique&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I tried to use it and we discussed in here.... not even did i not feel
</I>&gt;<i> any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pain that i was relieved of, it actually caused additional &quot;pain&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> because
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; i spent time and could still not see, not even IMAGINE a relieve of any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; kind of pain...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...so probably you are doing it wrong, that means, you are approaching a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem you might be able to see, from the wrong direction.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; And regardless of whether it has or has not, have you learned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; anything as a result?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I guess I was thinking out loud about what comes next for Votorola now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; that the design is complete.  Or maybe just tossing the question in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the air to see how it lands.  Sorry to make so much noise about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Anyway, I came to the conclusion that the next job is to describe the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; technology.  So I'm off doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Actually,what you are trying to do is EDUCATING people :-) ...to see a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution to a problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Could you write down the problem you are trying to solve?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...or at least ONE ASPECT of the problem, to which ONE ASPECT of your
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; solution might actually fit? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; btw... in order for something to be a solution, it has to respect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;usability issues&quot; too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. If something is easy to use, it educates people about a solution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. If something is easy to use, it changes the path of least resistance,
</I>&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people will naturally follow it :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A theoretical solution might be so hard to use, that it doesnt work in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;Nuclear Fusion&quot; in theory is awesome... but in practice, all the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;solutions&quot; in existance are so bad, that they actually cannot provide
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; benefits which the theory promises... (at least not yet)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
