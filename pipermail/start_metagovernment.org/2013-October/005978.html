<PRE>The thing to understand is, the data aren't encoded in the comparison
page itself: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Designs_for_primary_guidance">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Designs_for_primary_guidance</A>
Instead they're automatically hoovered in from across the wiki.  That
means other comparison pages can do their own hoovering and re-employ
the same data (or parts thereof) in different kinds of comparisons.
You could create your own comparison tables if you like.

The other thing is, the comparison is universal and equal.  Nothing
gets left out and nothing gets special treatment.  Or nothing is
*supposed* to.  It's like modern society that way; it has big ideals
and it never tires of waiting for them to be realized.  All total
reflectors are like that.

  (a) Public mirrors
  (b) Encyclopedic indeces
  (c) Encyclopedias
     - many others -

(a) We've been slowly crawling into a public mirror in another thread.
(b) An example of an encyclopedic index is the comparison page above.
(c) A suitable encyclopedia might be something like Wikipedia.

All of these are waiting patiently, Cinderella-like, to be empowered
by governance or metagovernance (aka primary guidance).  By &quot;empower&quot;,
I mean they could be pushing their weight around politically.  (More
like Catherine that way than Cinderella.)  By &quot;patient&quot;, I mean they
could be governed/metagoverned immediately; or left for a rainy day;
or left for others to deal with.  There's no hurry.  It might even be
better to wait.

We could open a decision thread on the issue (do it, or leave it).
Again, there's no hurry, but if anyone still wants to learn the answer
to the question, &quot;Can we govern ourselves?&quot; - that might be a way.
