</I>
I might need educating myself, first.  The job of &quot;description&quot; that I
mentioned to Ed will have to cover the technology as a whole.  I'd try
to answer your questions about public imaging in that broader context,
which I don't have yet.  When I do, the answers should appear mostly
in the lambda column (&#955;) here: <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p</A>

Assuming that scheme survives, that is.  In any case, it'll have to
get more abstract before it can get concrete.  There's conceptual work
to do and it needs vetting by experts.  So, if I'm unable to do a good
enough job of the research to have it published in journals, then I
probably *will* end up back in school learning how to do it properly.

In the meantime, I'm not much good for anything else in this field.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, it's gone dormant.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Separately, what is going on here? I can follow the words, and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; follow some of the concept, but I am not sure I see this initiative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; taking form by its own bootstraps. Is it? ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not while it's dormant, of course.  But yes, it could fly if we wanted
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it to.  There's no urgent need, however, so I shouldn't have urged it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks all the same to Alex and you, and to others who tried to help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The thing is, as i've already mentioned, i don't see what problem you are
</I>&gt;<i> trying to solve.
</I>&gt;<i> It's too abstract for me to see. I cannot imagine a situation that will
</I>&gt;<i> manifest once the process started and is keeping itself alive.
</I>&gt;<i> Whats the benefit?
</I>&gt;<i> Do we profit from it? In what way? What will the mirror front tell us in a
</I>&gt;<i> way thats better than what we have now?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe if there is 2 communities, metagovernment and another community,
</I>&gt;<i> talking about the same stuff, then we will learn about each other.... but
</I>&gt;<i> then again, before the technology we are using is used by the other
</I>&gt;<i> community in order to be visible in the same mirror front we have already
</I>&gt;<i> learned about each other and we might have joined their mailinglist or they
</I>&gt;<i> might have joined ours.
</I>&gt;<i> Its easier to use GOOGLE to search from time to time in order to find
</I>&gt;<i> those, or maybe we follow our personal areas of interest, maybe even on
</I>&gt;<i> twitter or something similar and discover others there...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Which PAIN you are trying to resolve with that &quot;mirror front technique&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> I tried to use it and we discussed in here.... not even did i not feel any
</I>&gt;<i> pain that i was relieved of, it actually caused additional &quot;pain&quot;, because
</I>&gt;<i> i spent time and could still not see, not even IMAGINE a relieve of any
</I>&gt;<i> kind of pain...
</I>&gt;<i> ...so probably you are doing it wrong, that means, you are approaching a
</I>&gt;<i> problem you might be able to see, from the wrong direction.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; And regardless of whether it has or has not, have you learned
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; anything as a result?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess I was thinking out loud about what comes next for Votorola now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that the design is complete.  Or maybe just tossing the question in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the air to see how it lands.  Sorry to make so much noise about it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyway, I came to the conclusion that the next job is to describe the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technology.  So I'm off doing that.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Actually,what you are trying to do is EDUCATING people :-) ...to see a

</I>&gt;<i> ...or at least ONE ASPECT of the problem, to which ONE ASPECT of your

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> btw... in order for something to be a solution, it has to respect
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;usability issues&quot; too.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If something is easy to use, it educates people about a solution
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If something is easy to use, it changes the path of least resistance, so
</I>&gt;<i> people will naturally follow it :-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A theoretical solution might be so hard to use, that it doesnt work in
</I>&gt;<i> practice.
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Nuclear Fusion&quot; in theory is awesome... but in practice, all the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;solutions&quot; in existance are so bad, that they actually cannot provide the
</I>&gt;<i> benefits which the theory promises... (at least not yet)
</I>&gt;<i>
