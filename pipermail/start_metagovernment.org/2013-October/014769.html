<PRE>Hi all,

a small remark about &#8220;democratic methods&#8221;. Democracy is about the legislative rights of citizens. Using some tools who can be about &#8220;participation&#8221;,  having a say&#8221; , &#8220;decision making&#8221; or even voting and voting systems in any other proces has nothing to do with democracy and serves only them who wishes to hold on to legislation by interest groups. 

Kind Regards

Paul

1. those who own shares own part of the subject which the share represents, so they become owners and therefor can decide about everything related to the subject. Because normally,there are many owners sharing a subject, they need some tools and democratic methods to decide about the subject.
2. There will be revenue in some form (probably USD or EUR, but maybe Bitcoins or even something completely different). The shares will waste away with the average rate of depreciation and replacement investments have to be made in order to get new shares. BUT the current amount of shares each individual holds at any moment, divided by the total amount of shares in circulation, will decide how much revenue each individual gets. So the shares will be a source of income.

A share is a token which generates monetary income if u own it. The token will depreciate and the rate of depreciation will depend on the subject to which the &quot;token&quot; (which is the share), refers to and how that subject will evolve or be developed...

So i guess, the value of a share for someone who might BUY it, stems from the fact, that it generates income and grants &quot;decision rights&quot; when it comes to the subject it represents and those &quot;decision rights&quot; might be of value to someone who thinks, that he can influence the subject in a way, so that the income stream generated by the token will increase :-)

  Maybe I'm missing something, but what's the value of a share other than that it can be sold? That is, there's an incentive to sell, but what is anyone's incentive to buy a share?

      So basically the shares are the currency?


    Not necessarily.
    Sure, &quot;within&quot; a purpose group or project group or how u would like to call that which people can hold shares of, ...it can be a currency, but:
    I would like to make the process of receiving payment an indirect one, which means:
    1. If you do work for such a group, you are NEVER paid directly, you always get shares which depreciate
    2. At every moment, you get paid if you own shares (which u do own if u worked for the group)
    3. The amount X you get paid equals the amount of shares S you own, divided by the total amount of shares T which exist multiplied by the current revenue R, thus: X = R * S/T
    (You can be paid in real time)
    4. If you dont want those shares, you can immediately sell them, which in practice will give you the amount of money u are used to for doing work (it will be &quot;wage like&quot;)

        1. New shares will only exist when todos/tasks are done by people.
        2. If people are willing to SELL their shares, then thats ok, so be it. If ALL people are willing to SELL their shares, then thats ok, so be it.
        3. All shares which are bought will deprecate, so even if people have sold all their shares and start earning new shares by finishing new tasks or todos, the one who bought all the shares previously will constantly use shares with the average rate of depreciation. The only way to get new shares it so buy new shares (if people are still willing to sell them) or to accomplish todos/tasks, so that new shares are created.

        I do not see a problem here.

          Alex, I think that what Mark is saying is that the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and the other rich people will step in and buy all of the shares, and wind up owning everything (as they pretty much do now). And, I think Mark is right. If we don't design how the power will be distributed, it will wind up being concentrated. That is one of the main lessons that history teaches us, as Mark says.

            All that i feel to be of importance is, that shares deprecate with the average rate of depreciation of progress.
            Existing shares can be sold, but there is only one way to create NEW SHARES and that is the fullfilment of todos/tasks.
            Every time a task has been accomplished by someone, that someone gets shares for completing it.
            Those shares will then be subject to the average rate of depreciation of the whole.
            Everyone is free to buy or sell shares as they wish.

                    Hello Mark,

                    it's not about direct payment, it's about &quot;shares&quot;.
                    Everything people do is not a &quot;one time task&quot;, but it has a
                    purpose, thus, its transformational and not transactional.
                    Therefore the task should not be paid for directly, but
                    instead it should be paid in shares, so the one who did the
                    task is in part &quot;owner of the purpose (or project)&quot;.
                    The sum of &quot;shares&quot; for every purpose decide how actual
                    payment is distributed amongst those &quot;shareholders&quot;.

                    How many shares there are at every moment and so on... should
                    be transparent.
                    Planning Poker (a wideband delphi based method) can be run
                    time after time again to decide how much shares should be
                    offered to people who accomplish certain tasks.
                    In addition there can be constant review to correct those
                    initial guesses again and again.

                    So its not a &quot;bank check&quot;, but instead its a process where the
                    amount of shares everyone under a common purpose has is
                    evaluated time and time again.
                    You can never know how much &quot;revenue&quot; you create, but the
                    revenue is just distributed amongst the &quot;shareholders&quot;. There
                    is no employees and no wage, only shares for every task.

                    The question is, how to refine this &quot;planning poker process&quot; ? :-)

                        I think before deciding how payment should he made .
                        We need to make sure we are not writing a blank check.

                                Hi Alex,

                                   Ned&gt; Once we have the money in hand, my
                                proposal is that

                                   compensation for Metagovernance work be
                                determined democratically,
                                   through proposing and agreeing/deciding.

                                   Alex&gt; I feel that there has to be a predictable
                                mechanism which

                                   prevents dictatorship of majority. It should be
                                about process and
                                   tasks and not about people. I'm not sure how to
                                do it, but its
                                   important to put a lot of thought into this.

                                Alex, I could not agree more. YES!

                                And also, should I take your response as a &quot;yes&quot;
                                to the proposal that (in principle) compensation
                                for Metagovernance work be determined democratically?

                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   Alex&gt; Do you know &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; or
                                the &quot;Wideband Delphi

                                   Estimation Method&quot;? What do you think of this
                                approach?

                                Scrum's planning poker can be useful in planning
                                and prioritizing and such. But it seems to me that
                                the best basis for determining COMPENSATION for
                                people is measuring and appraising what has
                                happened in the past (work accomplished). It would
                                be better to base compensation on what has
                                happened, not upon guesses about what may happen.
                                For example, when predictions turn out to be bad,
                                the compensation to the predictors should reflect
                                that. Yes? (Maybe I am not understanding how you
                                wish to apply scrum's poker to determining
                                compensation?)



                            Sounds good. How would u do it?
                            Maybe the approach can be combined.
                            One tries to guess the future, but then does a review
                            as soon as the future becomes the present and then
                            again when it becomes the past... and then again when
                            it becomes even more &quot;the past&quot; ....
                            And because its a process, because there will be a
                            continuous stream of new tasks, that review process
                            has to be &quot;baked into&quot; the whole.
                            How would u do it?


                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                   Alex&gt; And last but probably not least,
                                principal-agent-conflicts

                                   should be avoided, so people do not try assign
                                points to tasks for
                                   other political reasons ...

                                Again, I could not agree more. These are the sorts
                                of problems that our direct democratic decision
                                system design must forestall and mitigate.
                                Designing good systems is hard work.



                            If u answer the question above, how to extend
                            &quot;wideband delphi&quot; or &quot;scrum's planning poker&quot; with a
                            review process, we can use that as a basis to think
                            about potential &quot;principal-agent-conflicts&quot; :-)


                                ------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                        Hi Alex (and anyone else interested),

                                        Metagovernance work is not like the work
                                    of growing zucchinis, or
                                        the work of writing code. The &quot;products&quot;
                                    of metagovernance work
                                        (proposals, and agreements/decisions
                                    concerning proposals) are not
                                        generally amenable to free market pricing.


                                    Proposals as such are not and if it were
                                    possible one shouldnt do it, because otherwise
                                    nobody would use them.
                                    But a proposal is only a proposal and it will
                                    only come to life if there is software
                                    implementing the proposal.


                                        At this point, the Metagovernment entity
                                    has no national currency
                                        income to distribute, just as startups,
                                    generally, have no income
                                        at the outset.


                                    Yes, but that does not prevent metagovernment
                                    from creating its own &quot;artificial currency&quot;.
                                    Metagovernment could make it transparent what
                                    it is that people work on and reward people
                                    for doing people, by adding points to their
                                    account. Those points could be &quot;shares&quot; and
                                    those shares could depreciate too. If there
                                    will be &quot;income&quot; at some point in time, those
                                    &quot;points&quot; could be used to distribute it among
                                    those who have &quot;points&quot;.



                                        Until we have an income (from donations,
                                    from individuals choosing
                                        to &quot;invest&quot; in a better future for the
                                    planet), we can do what
                                        startups often do. We can create our own
                                    &quot;stock-option green
                                        stamps&quot; out of thin air, and distribute
                                    them for work done, with
                                        the possibility that at some future time
                                    the green stamps can be
                                        traded in for &quot;real&quot; currencies (from the
                                    future donation income).


                                    yes :-)


                                        If we do this, it puts us immediately in
                                    the position of having
                                        money to handle.



                                    yeah ;-)
                                    But if we do so, this will be challenging.
                                    There needs to be transparency and a machenism
                                    to assess the work that is done by people.
                                    &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; comes to mind:
                                    <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEOd5G_p_1Y</A>
                                    (afaik a variation of the Wideband Delphi
                                    estimation method)



                                        Once we have the money in hand, my
                                    proposal is that compensation
                                        for Metagovernance work be determined
                                    democratically, through
                                        proposing and agreeing/deciding.


                                    I feel that there has to be a predictable
                                    mechanism which prevents dictatorship of
                                    majority. It should be about process and tasks
                                    and not about people. I'm not sure how to do
                                    it, but its important to put a lot of thought
                                    into this.

                                        (I have written out detailed
                                    specifications for one way that this
                                        might be accomplished over on the wiser
                                    website. But in this
                                        thread, we are only considering whether or
                                    not, in principle, to
                                        determine compensation democratically.
                                    After we have agreed in
                                        principle, then we can get into deciding
                                    the details of how to do it.)


                                    Do you know &quot;Scrum's Planning Poker&quot; or the
                                    &quot;Wideband Delphi Estimation Method&quot;?
                                    What do you think of this approach? The
                                    average business day involves lots of tasks
                                    which are not easily measured and some of
                                    those tasks cannot be measured at all, because
                                    during the time you would like to measure it,
                                    its not even clear that a specific tasks must
                                    be accomplished in order to fullfill some
                                    other task.
                                    Such a mechanism should not prevent people
                                    from doing some work which is necessary, but
                                    not rewarded with points (so maybe the
                                    software should include an option to create
                                    new tasks on the fly and have them be
                                    estimated in &quot;points&quot;, or maybe there has to
                                    be a review/retrospective process) ....it may
                                    not be a beaurocratic nightmare too....
                                    And last bot probably not least,
                                    principal-agent-conflicts should be avoided,
                                    so people do not try assign points to tasks
                                    for other political reasons...

        DISCLAIMER:
        Everything I have written above is my personal experience/opinion on things, no matter what kinds of words i did use
        (e.g. &quot;always&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;impossible&quot;, &quot;waste of time&quot;, ....).

        Such extreme words only do indicate, that my experience/opinion on something is very strong and i currently cannot imagine that there are other possibilities until new arguments/insights/whatever open my eyes that there are alternative perspectives too :-)
        Please do not feel discouraged to challenge my opinion if you have a different one.
