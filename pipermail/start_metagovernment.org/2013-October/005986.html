<PRE>People,

I commented on money in a share discussion.  I mentioned transitive
democracy.  Ned suggested I start a new thread on each item I mentioned.
That would be overload for us all.  But I thought the transitive democracy
was not a big item since as I recall this was part of the original vision
Ed had.  So I probably misremember, so I selected that as the question to
be discussed in this thread.

I will rephrase:

How might we give everyone who wishes a sense of agency in public policy
making?

I supposed this is &quot;packed&quot; also.  So the responses might best be proposed
restatements of the question.

Even better, since we are being reductionist on this list, we can start
with your understanding of sense of agency, with cites.  Since the meaning
varies with domain, that will be fun.

Max
