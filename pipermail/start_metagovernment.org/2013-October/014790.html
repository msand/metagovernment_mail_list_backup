<PRE>...still have no clue what &quot;anti-cartesian&quot; is supposed to mean.
Could you just choose a random topic and make some statements a &quot;Cartesian
Person&quot; would make and then make some statements an &quot;Anti Cartesian Person&quot;
would make.

I consider &quot;Anti Cartesian&quot; to be just some kind of random whatever word
thats supposed to de-value the work thats done here. It's just a
combination of 13 to 14 characters (if u include the space), which you or
someone paired with &quot;spiritually dangerous&quot; to induce &quot;fear&quot; or whatever
un-reflected move that was supposed to be.

Now i asked you a couple of times what that word's definition would be and
you didnt give a precise definition, because i do not believe such a thing
exists. Probably you cant even give a vague definition through examples of
how a cartesian person would argue as opposed to an anti cartesian person
when it comes to whatever kind of random topic.

*DISCLAIMER:*
*Everything I have written above is my personal experience/opinion on
things, no matter what kinds of words i did use
(e.g. &quot;always&quot;, &quot;never&quot;, &quot;impossible&quot;, &quot;waste of time&quot;, ....).
*
*Such extreme words only do indicate, that my experience/opinion on
something is very strong and i currently cannot imagine that there are
other possibilities until new arguments/insights/whatever open my eyes that
there are alternative perspectives too :-)
Please do not feel discouraged to challenge my opinion if you have a
different one.*
