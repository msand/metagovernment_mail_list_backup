<PRE>&gt;<i>This is very interesting, Nicolas. From how you describe it, it seems very
</I>inline with other projects here.

Thanks, there are indeed interesting projects going on here !
I met Pietro and i'm pretty well informed about his work and approach to
the matter, he advised me to share with you. I took some time to look at
the wiki and which subjects were talked about in the list, and it looks
like we are talking about the same thing.

&gt;<i>Where are you in development? In other words, what features are now
</I>working, and what features/aspects are you still struggling to get to work?

I've stopped development a few months ago because i don't have enough
technical knowledge to continue it.

Actually, the platform is a mix of drupal modules and many of them are not
integrated or adapted.
I wrote about it on Edgeryders platform two months ago :
<A HREF="http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-open-government/mission_case/d%C3%A9mopolitique-crowdsolving-tool">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/spotlight-open-government/mission_case/d%C3%A9mopolitique-crowdsolving-tool</A>
There are a lot of informations and links and technically, the only thing
that has evolved since is that a translation tool has been partly
integrated.

More briefly, the CMS is set to allow an adaptative and flexible database
of discussions with the use of folksonomy. I'd like to integrate
AlchemyAPI&lt;<A HREF="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">http://www.alchemyapi.com/</A>&gt;,
a semantic analysis tool, but only to suggest connections to users.
This allows to link content by context and may avoid duplicate discussions.

I have not yet established an up-to-date list of features and aspects i'd
like to develop.
One of the latest tools i've started to design is a serious game described
in this doc :
<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLzyVmNhwAU3E9-TSt7zFiUARSDh3pOetugUc7hFQ0w/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLzyVmNhwAU3E9-TSt7zFiUARSDh3pOetugUc7hFQ0w/edit</A>
Its goal would be to facilitate a moneyless system where the &quot;currency&quot;
would be individual fullfilment.

Finally, i didn't really presented myself. :)
If you want to know more about me, i wrote my &quot;ryde&quot; on Edgeryders platform
:<i> <A HREF="http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/write-or-die">http://edgeryders.ppa.coe.int/share-your-ryde/mission_case/write-or-die</A>
</I>
I'm also working on creating a kind of utopian place we designed with
friends and used to call &quot;open source university&quot; (the doc is in french ) :
