<PRE>Hello Paul,

thanks for sharing. Very interesting and I think I have some answers. 
But first I have to translate my concept or otherwise I will be 
explaining it bit by bit in this conversation. (4400 word to go).

Best regards
Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en

</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> when I started out with my concept 10 years ago, the nucleus of my 
</I>&gt;<i> thoughts was, that we need to get more people to participate in the 
</I>&gt;<i> political process, independent from the solution. And to get Joe 
</I>&gt;<i> Sixpack and John Dough on the boat requires three things from the 
</I>&gt;<i> solution:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It must be simple
</I>&gt;<i> It must be transparent and
</I>&gt;<i> It must be rewarding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, sorry guys, as much as I admire the intellectual beauty of your 
</I>&gt;<i> concepts: for Joe and John most of your concepts are too brainy, they 
</I>&gt;<i> will not understand and therefore they will stay away. But not only 
</I>&gt;<i> will they refuse to participate, they will not note give their votes 
</I>&gt;<i> to a party they don't understand. And this is not only true for Joe 
</I>&gt;<i> and John, I've spoken to some people that do have the intellectual 
</I>&gt;<i> capacities to understand all these concepts and still refuse to 
</I>&gt;<i> participate and that is because they shy away from anything 
</I>&gt;<i> experimental. They want to see it actually work, before they 
</I>&gt;<i> participate. All this ends up in an endless loop where the concepts 
</I>&gt;<i> never proof their righteousness because no-one participates, because 
</I>&gt;<i> the concepts never proof their righteousness ... .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, as a result, so far none of your efforts will bear fruits, because 
</I>&gt;<i> democracy is about majorities and in Germany that means to get 33 
</I>&gt;<i> million people to support you!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you don't believe me and my perception of our comrade citizens, 
</I>&gt;<i> there's a simple test: try to convince your next door neighbour with 
</I>&gt;<i> your concept, or, even better, your grandmother. I did it, it was a 
</I>&gt;<i> very frustrating lesson, but I can claim that I know what I am talking 
</I>&gt;<i> about. And, by the way: I also participated in a conventional party 
</I>&gt;<i> and from that experience I can say: in some points you are drastically 
</I>&gt;<i> underestimating the complexity of the political process, be it 
</I>&gt;<i> grassroots or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is why I came to the conclusion to try to correct the current 
</I>&gt;<i> system rather than to replace it. The advantage: by recognizing 
</I>&gt;<i> familiar structures people are more willing to accept the new.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The path I can sees is: once we managed to get more and more people to 
</I>&gt;<i> participate in what is their very own belonging: their community and 
</I>&gt;<i> education has become so much better, that even John and Joe are ready 
</I>&gt;<i> to understand even more complex concepts, then comes the time for 
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola and all the other, nice concepts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me the goal is to get these 33 millions on board, no matter what 
</I>&gt;<i> the solution looks like. If any one has some thoughts on how to get 
</I>&gt;<i> there, please share!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are interested: I got some ideas!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> @fragro: very interesting, but to brainy for grandma!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know people who fit into both categories as well as those that have

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People like grandmother and the working class are the demographics

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This allows people to both take part in the process as a direct 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> contributor to the online forum, as well as people to select 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> representatives to contribute for them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Of course this has its own downsides and the implementation is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> significantly more difficult and open to malicious behavior, it 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> satisfies the problems brought forward in this thread. On the other 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hand there is also a very important and distinct advantage. DDD 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transitions our political discussion and activity from mass-media and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> political parties into our communities of friends and family.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Rather than fight the existing political structures and mass media we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> simply cut it away and render it useless. When you can elect people 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you know and trust as representatives whenever you want, the election 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cycle disappears. So it has all of the advantages of both direct and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct democratic processes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Hello Alex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not visionary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and it was never meant to be.  I'm an old man (51) and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         don't want to spend the rest of my life within a lousy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         political system, while dreaming of a better world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         applied tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I made so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         far with conventional parties. It is the attempt to correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the existing concepts for the better, it's an evolution, not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a revolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         people are willing to participate in the political process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         This is not the case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I don't think that this is true. There is no political apathy of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     people, there is only an apathy when it comes to politicians.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     People have jobs and lives and they dont have the time nor are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     they willing to learn about all these complicated political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     processes that do exist and that you have to comply with in order
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to get your point through.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If political participation becomes as easy as using twitter or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     writing an email or sharing something on facebook, then that will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     change the game.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in political parties in Germany.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Because that's not the way to go. Parties are an outdated model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Only big parties matter (&gt;5% of votes) and they already have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     established structure and opinions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If you have a different opinion, you have to really work your ass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of and fight for you opinion if you join a party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     You have to attend physically and in the end, normally you adapt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to their opinion in order to progress in you political carreer or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you wont stand a chance...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...its just an exhausting undertaking...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And even among those 5 million only a minority is actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         actively involved in the political process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     yeah guess what. this is the case, because the structure of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     whole thing doesnt permit anything else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     FORM creates FUNCTION :-)  ...It's the wrong form, so it doesnt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     fullfill the function that it's supposed to fullfill.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Instead, it creates a different function. We might call it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;representative democracy&quot;, but daily routine and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     results define what it is, and it's not something most people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     would wish it were.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I therefore come to the conclusion that the majority of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         voters are not willing to contribute the required effort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         time and energy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This conclusion isnt incorrect. But maybe its possible to reduce
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the required effort of time and energy by serveral orders of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     magnitude.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to participate in the political process. But if only a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         minority is driving the political process, a system like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship of the active,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So, i dont think that this will ever happen. And even if you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     correct, than it is no change for the worse compared with our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     active system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Because what you fear is what currently is already established.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     You think people are not interested in politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I dont share this fundamental assumption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I think the time and effort needed to participate is very high
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and the chances to change something are very low.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It's the process as such that prevents people from participating
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and people are only frustrated with this and the politicians, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not with politics itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Politics are very important and most people have opinions about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If they were not interested, they wouldnt have any opinions in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the first place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         just like we currently have with our conventional parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         (The concept of VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         flaws, which I will not explain here).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I think votorola may not be perfect, but i dont know of any other
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system concept that is superior to the votorola concept.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thats not to say that votorola shouldnt be improved and when it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     comes to &quot;user interface&quot; there is still a lot that can be done,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     but speaking about the concept behind votorola, it really is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     pretty neat :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It's a bit sad that you dont want to elaborate on your thoughts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about votorola.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         This is also the key to the understanding of my concept: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         voters are not dissatisfied with the political system as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     HA! Oh my gosh... and how they are :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     They are totally dissatisfied with the political system as it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There is only political partys and vote once every couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     years....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They are in principal content with the concept of &quot;politics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     No they are not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It's true, that not everyone could participate in every kind of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     politics, but for every kind of politics there are enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     non-politician-experts that could say something about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Politicians are experts in NOTHING! Without Lobbyists they were
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     unable to decide anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The Lobbyists are the EXPERTS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The problem ist, that our current system is not open for any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     expert, but only for those lobbyists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So it depends on the political issue, but for every issue there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will be experts from all walks of life that could say something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about it and find good solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The only thing that might be needed is &quot;public administration as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     a service&quot; ...but you dont need &quot;politics as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     With &quot;public administration as a service&quot; its the same as with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     every company. The chairmen could not decide everything, thats
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     why you give the &quot;public administration&quot; some leeway in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     decision-making. Where this starts and stops should be decided by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the grass roots democratic process and can be adapted as needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The voters are discontent with the outcome of our politics in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         detail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     YES!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and that again is due to the lack of communication between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         politician and voters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     YES! :-) But this problem is much more fundamental than you might
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     think.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It cannot be fixed by minor changes to the current system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I don't thin it succeeds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The problem is, that technological and ecnomical change moves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     faster than politicians are able to adapt to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I dont believe its possible to govern this thing in a top down
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     top down is too slow and by the time it has reached a decision,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     its already outdated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     LOOK and THINK about what is currently happening all over europe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and all over the world!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The establishment realizes that it is TOO SLOW and thats why they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     remove democracy step after step, because thats one method to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     able to make decisions faster. ...not necessarily better, but at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     least faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I believe the only alternative is a system like votorola or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system with similar concepts, that will use the bottom up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     approach, but will be at least as fast as the dictatorship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     approach, ...probably even faster and with way better decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Let me comment some of your statements:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;It's about parties, not about grass roots democracy ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Yes, concept speaks of a party and that is for a simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         reason: German laws allows us to organize ourselves in any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         fashion WITHIN a party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     yes and no. The pirate party faces some serious problems with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     establishing a permanent party conference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     You dont have to change our current political system at all if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you use this kind of argument, because ...all you need is a party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to get an absolute majority of votes and then organize that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     partys internals in a grass roots democratic fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Establishing grass roots democracy on the level of our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         constitution requires a 60% majority in parliament, that's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         long way to go and, like I said, I would preferably see
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         things happen in my lifetime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I bet you will see these major changes within your lifetime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The technological singularity is currently predicted for the year
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2045 :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     But beside that, as the global financial cirsis continues, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     pirate parties world wide will grow like crazy :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     And as soon as systems like votorola and the like are ready for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     battle, they will be adopted and they will generate outstanding
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     results, which will lead to further grows of the pirate party and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     will eventually make all the other parties adopt these grass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     roots concepts in order to survive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I also do not see the need for parties any more, in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         concept you will find a section where I speak of the party,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         that is founded to overcome all parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     That is the pirate party, because the only reason the pirate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     party as such exists is to HACK our current political system in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     order to inject grass roots democracy into the kernel of our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     political system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;... not about grass roots democracy , but that's what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         metagovernment is all about.&quot; I do hope that this forum is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         not dogmatic, but open to any idea, that helps to improve our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         democracies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     its not dogmatic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     And I think other people on this mailinglist might have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     different opinion from mine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I think that your concept is very nice compared with what current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     reality looks like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If it is able to convince people who know of nothing better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     what we currently have, it can accomplish a lot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     But comared to thoughts i've learned about through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;, it sounds a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     underdeveloped ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I do claim, that my concept is in fact about grass roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         democracy. But it's not about straight forward grass roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         democracy, it's a hybrid of conventional politics and grass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         roots democracy. The compromise is solely made to make it work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Once your concept is established, how does it evolve? Did you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     bake in a mechanism to enable your concept to evolve into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     something even more grass roots?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I feel that it lacks such a mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;I dont know where to start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         it has a board, why do you need a board?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         What kind of board? A board of elected politicians? Do you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         really think it's them who write the laws today?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Do you really think that the crowd is not able to do that by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         itself?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It has staffs and staff managers? WTF?!? :-)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         themselves, I think that the majority just don't WANT to make
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Depends on how big the effort is. Even though it's a major effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     compared to a simple mouseclick oder a short email, people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     sometimes move.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (see Stuttgart21, ACTA, noisy Airports, ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There might be many more smaller movements that you dont learn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     about because they are to small and &quot;divided and conquered&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Often they dont know each other, and if they would, could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     otherwise join together....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     People also take the time to watch the news or tv shows like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     &quot;Anne Will&quot; and the like, where politicians discuss. They also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     listen to the radio during traffic hour and again, its about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     politics. They also read the newspaper... so if you combine ALL
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     THIS, people spend a lot of time with politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     They know whats going on, they just are not able to give feedback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     during that time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So imagine they could give intelligent feedback in ways that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     would allow intelligent opinion forming...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The majority of voters prefer politics as a service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     No, they dont. They are very unhappy with politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     They would like to change it, they just cannot imagine how to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And I'm not sure if you have an idea of the huge amount of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         work we are talking about. A Swedish Anarchist from the 1920s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         described her utopia as follows &quot;people go to work in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         factories for four hours. After the lunch break, they go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         work in parliament for another four hours&quot;. That is, I think,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a realistic scenario of a grass root democracy. Are you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         willing to spend 4 hours a day on politics?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     NO! ..but like i said... combine tv, newspaper, radio, talking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with other people about issues, and the like...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     People in fact DO INVEST time to learn about politics and to form
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     opinions about it. They are just not able to give feedback in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     constructive way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Luckily we dont live in the 1920s anymore. We have the internet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thats why there is hope, that the economic crisis will not lead
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     to war and thats why it is possible to imagine grass roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     politics without massive time investment by people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         job for me,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you do, others might not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     maybe you will change your mind, once you've seen what is possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     but i think you should be able to delegate and do as you please.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     on the other hand i think you should allow people who want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     participate on their own to also do as they please.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         just like I do not fix my car by myself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     some people can and like to fix their car by themself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Luckily politics cannot be compared to cars, because politics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     depend on topics and topics in politics are as diverse as life
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So probably there is at least one kind of topic for everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     where one would like or at least could say something that could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     be considered professional.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...thats because everyone probably has a profession and a daily
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     routine that give him or her insights into some topics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         But I want more and better control over what he does and I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         want more and better communication with him.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     yes, i think its vital to have good control and good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     communication with someone you delegate to.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The way a &quot;delegation mechanism&quot; is implemented is very vital and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     its not a trivial task to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If you do it the wrong way, you end up with serious problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Thats a problem the german pirate party currently faces with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     their LIQUID FEEDBACK SYSTEM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;light&quot; stands for &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;It has a &quot;party mass&quot;, but shouldn't that be a private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         thing? Everyone should do as he pleases, and if people want
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to meet, they could...&quot; (I'm not sure what you are referring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to as &quot;party mass&quot;). Of course everyone can do as he pleases,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         have their own private meetings and attend whatever event
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         they want to (see &quot;Individual Level of Participation&quot;). The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         concept only speaks of the services that I think the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         organization should offer, to improve communication. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         concept of the party fair is, by the way , a counter proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         to the German &quot;Parteitag&quot;, a very undemocratic event, that is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         mandatory for German parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     yes, but pirates seem to have found a way to HACK it :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you should not &quot;close&quot; the parteitag and therefor it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     continue and become something thats permanent. You then need a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     system that enables pirates to participate in this permanent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     parteitag. Lets see what else is possible :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;... it should develop and host the EIPW, but as its such an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         important tool, it should be open source and not bound to a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         comittee to foster development.&quot; As the concepts states, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         tool is, in fact, open source, and it is owned by an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         independent organisation, the eipw.org &lt;<A HREF="http://eipw.org">http://eipw.org</A>&gt;. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         you ever worked in an Open Source project, then you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         experienced, that there always is some dirty work, no-one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         likes to do. Besides taking care of that, changing the EIPW
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         must be a democratic process and that process in turn has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         be managed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Yeah... depends... have you ever heard of bitcoin? or what about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     p2p-sharing.plattforms. They are decentralized.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The same is true for votorola. Everyone could host their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     streetwiki.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Streetwikis could connect to each other.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     In the end it's all about trust and a concept that builds on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     centrality will always have a single point of failure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;Compared to what is reality today, your proposal is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         visionary, but even compared to the internal processes of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         pirate party and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0&quot;-system, i'm not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         sure if you could still call EIPW visionary.&quot; When I started
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         thinking about my concept the pirate party and their &quot;liquid
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         feedback 2.0 was not visible to me. By the time they emerged
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         into my sight I found a couple of flaws and shortcomings in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         their concept. Otherwise I would have trashed my concept and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         joined them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Liquid Feedback, also its a light house project, is not state of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the art and has some serious shortcomings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     The pirate party has just established &quot;Liquid Feedback 2.0&quot;. It's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     still not perfect, but it has learned from the initial project
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and tries to improve on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     There are 3 &quot;AG's&quot; that think very hard about how to evolve the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     grass roots democracy that should become internal to the pirate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1. AG B&#252;rgerbeteiligung (=&gt; Information Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2. AG Meinungsfindung (=&gt; Discussion Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     3. AG Liquid Democracy (=&gt; Decision Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I see the pirates party's approach, beside my concept,  so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         far as the only serious attempt in Germany to really change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the political process. But, unfortunately, for me the gaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         their concept is leaving are too big for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Currently they have 3 mechanisms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     1. Parteitag that every pirate is allowed to attend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     2. An open wiki +etherpads and open AG's and mailinglists and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     mumble sessions that even non-pirates may join to work on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     partys manifesto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     3. Liquid Feedback to create a picture of whats opinions exist
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and how much support they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     So its pretty open to anyone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Pirates from all over europe join the political discussions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This is not perfect, but its the best you can currently find out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Beside that, the pirates know about all the shortcomings and they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     work hard to improve on them, thats why they have several working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     groups that are again open to anyone (even non-pirates) to work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     on the concepts for better grass roots democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;I think your goals are not ambitious enough and some of your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         goals cannot be reached with such a conservative approach as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         you layed out.&quot; Like I said before, I am aiming to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         evolutionary, not revolutionary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I miss the element in your concept that describes how you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     establish a continuuous improvement process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         That's one of the major flaws of the pirate party: they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         leaving people like my grandmother behind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     you grandmother will die out before real change happens. your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     grandmother, and mine too, dont know whats going on in this world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     They live in yesterdays world, and thats fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     everything that can be done without the internet was done in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     past.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the only way to improve democracy is through the internet, there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is no alternative (there might be one if scientists discover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     telepathy or something like that)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...i dont think your grandma wouldnt be able to use the internet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     it all depends on the &quot;user interface&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...it can be used through TV, telephone, computers, cellphones,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ...even robots.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Put a robot inside of your grandmas house. Its her personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     politician. She might ask him stuff and tell him what she wants
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and he will use the internet to do as she pleases. These robots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     develop. There is already programs like &quot;SIRI&quot; on iPhone and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     other similar &quot;personal agents&quot; that you could command through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     voice, that might be also used for such use cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It will take time, but it will develop. Sure, people who grow up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     with a technology always have a headstart, but so did your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     grandma while you and me were young.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     She had there time and she voted for people that brought the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     world to its current state ...we live in a fundamental financial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     crisis and now its not her turn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     She will not be left behind, and there will be a lot of effort to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     help her in using the new ways, but she has to help on her part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     by being open minded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     If she rejects the ways of the younger generations, then the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     younger generation can not do anything about her.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They are also voters, that need to be included in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         democratic process. Should my concept ever be applied, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         expect it to evolve further. I do not expect it to be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         final answer, but rather a piece of the path that leads into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         This conversation started with the proposal to use the EIPW
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         instead of buying out Facebook. You could just do that and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ignore the rest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Personally, i dont believe that its possible to &quot;buy out facebook&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     It would be just a waste of time to try to do that, but everyone
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     here has a different perspective.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         But if you think about the political process as whole, if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         think &quot;once we have this result, what comes next?&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         especially when you think of something, that is meant to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         realistic enough to actually materialise in the real world I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         am sure you will come to similar conclusions as I did, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         maybe an even better solution!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     hopefully a less conservative approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I think the pirate party progresses in a nice way.
