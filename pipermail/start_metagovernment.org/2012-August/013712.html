<PRE>Hi Ed,
have you done a back of the envelope calculations to see how much
money you would need to raise at current market conditions?

The higher this number is the more probable is that it will not
succeed and all you generate is a bubble.

And maybe compare that money needed with other general requests for
money that suceeded.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Pietro. I think you are assuming normal market conditions, where this certainly would be true. Interest in a stock means people are attributing more value to it, thus demand is up and by simple supply-demand economics, the price goes up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, in Thomas' scenario (please correct me if I'm getting this wrong, Thomas), a large number of people are showing interest in severely devaluing the company in the future. They would only buy on condition that they could gain a majority stake, and with that stake, they would stop selling peoples' data to companies, thus making Facebook worthless as a commercial enterprise.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus their interest, instead of adding value to the stock, removes value. So while they are showing demand, they are not subject to traditional supply-demand economics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When potential stock-buyers see that there is a large threat to the future profitability of the stock, why would they want to buy that stock? They would be more inclined to sell that stock and move their money somewhere more safe. And each sale would be at a lower price as more people flee and fewer are willing to buy from them at the latest price.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, I really have no idea if this would work. I can see it working your way or my way. I think at first, it very well might work both ways, with some people buying in and some selling off. But over time, as more people pledge, I suspect it very well might work. I think it's worth trying and seeing what happens. All it would cost any of us is a pledge of ~$10.
