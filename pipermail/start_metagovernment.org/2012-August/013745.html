<PRE>Hello Alex,

it's funny how close we are in our thoughts and still so far apart. I do 
not have the time to dig into the entire conversation, but there's a few 
things I would like to say:

First of all, if you could loosen on your aggression attitude you could 
use my thoughts as a source to either gain new insights and find new 
solutions or prove the rightness of your thoughts. And we could help 
each other to improve our knowledge.

I am not interested in any intellectual duel for the same reason why I 
shy away from working in workshops: too much energy wasted in fighting 
each other instead of making use of that energy for fruitful, 
constructive work.

Fruitful, constructive work comes in questioning. And the answers to 
these questions either reveal the mistake that has been made or proves 
the rightness of the concept. If there's anything that raises your 
curiosity I am more than willing to explain, but I'm not spending my 
time on any fruitless discussion on who is right.

So let me state my question: do you think this discussion will lead to 
any result that is worth the energy for you and me or the audience?

Best regards

Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en

Ronald D. Grindle

</I>&gt;<i>     Hello Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not visionary and it
</I>&gt;<i>     was never meant to be.  I'm an old man (51) and I don't want to
</I>&gt;<i>     spend the rest of my life within a lousy political system, while
</I>&gt;<i>     dreaming of a better world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can be
</I>&gt;<i>     applied tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I made so far
</I>&gt;<i>     with conventional parties. It is the attempt to correct the
</I>&gt;<i>     existing concepts for the better, it's an evolution, not a revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that people
</I>&gt;<i>     are willing to participate in the political process. This is not
</I>&gt;<i>     the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that this is true. There is no political apathy of 
</I>&gt;<i> people, there is only an apathy when it comes to politicians.
</I>&gt;<i> People have jobs and lives and they dont have the time nor are they 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to learn about all these complicated political processes that 
</I>&gt;<i> do exist and that you have to comply with in order to get your point 
</I>&gt;<i> through.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If political participation becomes as easy as using twitter or writing 
</I>&gt;<i> an email or sharing something on facebook, then that will change the game.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized in
</I>&gt;<i>     political parties in Germany.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Because that's not the way to go. Parties are an outdated model.
</I>&gt;<i> Only big parties matter (&gt;5% of votes) and they already have 
</I>&gt;<i> established structure and opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have a different opinion, you have to really work your ass of 
</I>&gt;<i> and fight for you opinion if you join a party.
</I>&gt;<i> You have to attend physically and in the end, normally you adapt to 
</I>&gt;<i> their opinion in order to progress in you political carreer or you 
</I>&gt;<i> wont stand a chance...
</I>&gt;<i> ...its just an exhausting undertaking...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And even among those 5 million only a minority is actually
</I>&gt;<i>     actively involved in the political process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yeah guess what. this is the case, because the structure of the whole 
</I>&gt;<i> thing doesnt permit anything else.
</I>&gt;<i> FORM creates FUNCTION :-)  ...It's the wrong form, so it doesnt 
</I>&gt;<i> fullfill the function that it's supposed to fullfill.
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, it creates a different function. We might call it &quot;democracy&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;representative democracy&quot;, but daily routine and results define 
</I>&gt;<i> what it is, and it's not something most people would wish it were.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I therefore come to the conclusion that the majority of voters are
</I>&gt;<i>     not willing to contribute the required effort of time and energy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This conclusion isnt incorrect. But maybe its possible to reduce the 
</I>&gt;<i> required effort of time and energy by serveral orders of magnitude.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     to participate in the political process. But if only a minority is
</I>&gt;<i>     driving the political process, a system like VOTOROLA only leads
</I>&gt;<i>     to a dictatorship of the active,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, i dont think that this will ever happen. And even if you are 
</I>&gt;<i> correct, than it is no change for the worse compared with our active 
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i> Because what you fear is what currently is already established.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You think people are not interested in politics.
</I>&gt;<i> I dont share this fundamental assumption.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the time and effort needed to participate is very high and the 
</I>&gt;<i> chances to change something are very low.
</I>&gt;<i> It's the process as such that prevents people from participating and 
</I>&gt;<i> people are only frustrated with this and the politicians, but not with 
</I>&gt;<i> politics itself.
</I>&gt;<i> Politics are very important and most people have opinions about it.
</I>&gt;<i> If they were not interested, they wouldnt have any opinions in the 
</I>&gt;<i> first place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     just like we currently have with our conventional parties. (The
</I>&gt;<i>     concept of VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more flaws, which
</I>&gt;<i>     I will not explain here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think votorola may not be perfect, but i dont know of any other 
</I>&gt;<i> system concept that is superior to the votorola concept.
</I>&gt;<i> Thats not to say that votorola shouldnt be improved and when it comes 
</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;user interface&quot; there is still a lot that can be done, but 
</I>&gt;<i> speaking about the concept behind votorola, it really is pretty neat :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bit sad that you dont want to elaborate on your thoughts about 
</I>&gt;<i> votorola.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This is also the key to the understanding of my concept: the
</I>&gt;<i>     voters are not dissatisfied with the political system as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> HA! Oh my gosh... and how they are :-)
</I>&gt;<i> They are totally dissatisfied with the political system as it is today.
</I>&gt;<i> There is only political partys and vote once every couple of years....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     They are in principal content with the concept of &quot;politics as a
</I>&gt;<i>     service&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No they are not.
</I>&gt;<i> It's true, that not everyone could participate in every kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> politics, but for every kind of politics there are enough 
</I>&gt;<i> non-politician-experts that could say something about it.
</I>&gt;<i> Politicians are experts in NOTHING! Without Lobbyists they were unable 
</I>&gt;<i> to decide anything.
</I>&gt;<i> The Lobbyists are the EXPERTS.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem ist, that our current system is not open for any expert, 
</I>&gt;<i> but only for those lobbyists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So it depends on the political issue, but for every issue there will 
</I>&gt;<i> be experts from all walks of life that could say something about it 
</I>&gt;<i> and find good solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only thing that might be needed is &quot;public administration as a 
</I>&gt;<i> service&quot; ...but you dont need &quot;politics as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With &quot;public administration as a service&quot; its the same as with every 
</I>&gt;<i> company. The chairmen could not decide everything, thats why you give 
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;public administration&quot; some leeway in decision-making. Where this 
</I>&gt;<i> starts and stops should be decided by the grass roots democratic 
</I>&gt;<i> process and can be adapted as needed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The voters are discontent with the outcome of our politics in detail
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     and that again is due to the lack of communication between
</I>&gt;<i>     politician and voters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> YES! :-) But this problem is much more fundamental than you might think.
</I>&gt;<i> It cannot be fixed by minor changes to the current system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't thin it succeeds.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is, that technological and ecnomical change moves faster 
</I>&gt;<i> than politicians are able to adapt to it.
</I>&gt;<i> I dont believe its possible to govern this thing in a top down fashion.
</I>&gt;<i> top down is too slow and by the time it has reached a decision, its 
</I>&gt;<i> already outdated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> LOOK and THINK about what is currently happening all over europe and 
</I>&gt;<i> all over the world!
</I>&gt;<i> The establishment realizes that it is TOO SLOW and thats why they 
</I>&gt;<i> remove democracy step after step, because thats one method to be able 
</I>&gt;<i> to make decisions faster. ...not necessarily better, but at least faster.
</I>&gt;<i> I believe the only alternative is a system like votorola or a system 
</I>&gt;<i> with similar concepts, that will use the bottom up approach, but will 
</I>&gt;<i> be at least as fast as the dictatorship approach, ...probably even 
</I>&gt;<i> faster and with way better decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Let me comment some of your statements:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;It's about parties, not about grass roots democracy ...&quot; Yes,
</I>&gt;<i>     concept speaks of a party and that is for a simple reason: German
</I>&gt;<i>     laws allows us to organize ourselves in any fashion WITHIN a party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes and no. The pirate party faces some serious problems with 
</I>&gt;<i> establishing a permanent party conference.
</I>&gt;<i> You dont have to change our current political system at all if you use 
</I>&gt;<i> this kind of argument, because ...all you need is a party to get an 
</I>&gt;<i> absolute majority of votes and then organize that partys internals in 
</I>&gt;<i> a grass roots democratic fashion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Establishing grass roots democracy on the level of our
</I>&gt;<i>     constitution requires a 60% majority in parliament, that's a long
</I>&gt;<i>     way to go and, like I said, I would preferably see things happen
</I>&gt;<i>     in my lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I bet you will see these major changes within your lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i> The technological singularity is currently predicted for the year 2045 :-)
</I>&gt;<i> But beside that, as the global financial cirsis continues, the pirate 
</I>&gt;<i> parties world wide will grow like crazy :-)
</I>&gt;<i> And as soon as systems like votorola and the like are ready for 
</I>&gt;<i> battle, they will be adopted and they will generate outstanding 
</I>&gt;<i> results, which will lead to further grows of the pirate party and will 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually make all the other parties adopt these grass roots concepts 
</I>&gt;<i> in order to survive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I also do not see the need for parties any more, in my concept you
</I>&gt;<i>     will find a section where I speak of the party, that is founded to
</I>&gt;<i>     overcome all parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is the pirate party, because the only reason the pirate party as 
</I>&gt;<i> such exists is to HACK our current political system in order to inject 
</I>&gt;<i> grass roots democracy into the kernel of our political system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;... not about grass roots democracy , but that's what
</I>&gt;<i>     metagovernment is all about.&quot; I do hope that this forum is not
</I>&gt;<i>     dogmatic, but open to any idea, that helps to improve our democracies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> its not dogmatic.
</I>&gt;<i> And I think other people on this mailinglist might have a different 
</I>&gt;<i> opinion from mine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that your concept is very nice compared with what current 
</I>&gt;<i> reality looks like.
</I>&gt;<i> If it is able to convince people who know of nothing better than what 
</I>&gt;<i> we currently have, it can accomplish a lot.
</I>&gt;<i> But comared to thoughts i've learned about through metagovernment.org 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;, it sounds a bit underdeveloped ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I do claim, that my concept is in fact about grass roots
</I>&gt;<i>     democracy. But it's not about straight forward grass roots
</I>&gt;<i>     democracy, it's a hybrid of conventional politics and grass roots
</I>&gt;<i>     democracy. The compromise is solely made to make it work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once your concept is established, how does it evolve? Did you bake in 
</I>&gt;<i> a mechanism to enable your concept to evolve into something even more 
</I>&gt;<i> grass roots?
</I>&gt;<i> I feel that it lacks such a mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;I dont know where to start.
</I>&gt;<i>     it has a board, why do you need a board?
</I>&gt;<i>     What kind of board? A board of elected politicians? Do you really
</I>&gt;<i>     think it's them who write the laws today?
</I>&gt;<i>     Do you really think that the crowd is not able to do that by itself?
</I>&gt;<i>     It has staffs and staff managers? WTF?!? :-)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by themselves, I
</I>&gt;<i>     think that the majority just don't WANT to make the effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Depends on how big the effort is. Even though it's a major effort 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to a simple mouseclick oder a short email, people sometimes move.
</I>&gt;<i> (see Stuttgart21, ACTA, noisy Airports, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> There might be many more smaller movements that you dont learn about 
</I>&gt;<i> because they are to small and &quot;divided and conquered&quot;. Often they dont 
</I>&gt;<i> know each other, and if they would, could otherwise join together....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People also take the time to watch the news or tv shows like &quot;Anne 
</I>&gt;<i> Will&quot; and the like, where politicians discuss. They also listen to the 
</I>&gt;<i> radio during traffic hour and again, its about politics. They also 
</I>&gt;<i> read the newspaper... so if you combine ALL THIS, people spend a lot 
</I>&gt;<i> of time with politics.
</I>&gt;<i> They know whats going on, they just are not able to give feedback 
</I>&gt;<i> during that time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So imagine they could give intelligent feedback in ways that would 
</I>&gt;<i> allow intelligent opinion forming...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The majority of voters prefer politics as a service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, they dont. They are very unhappy with politics.
</I>&gt;<i> They would like to change it, they just cannot imagine how to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And I'm not sure if you have an idea of the huge amount of work we
</I>&gt;<i>     are talking about. A Swedish Anarchist from the 1920s described
</I>&gt;<i>     her utopia as follows &quot;people go to work in the factories for four
</I>&gt;<i>     hours. After the lunch break, they go to work in parliament for
</I>&gt;<i>     another four hours&quot;. That is, I think, a realistic scenario of a
</I>&gt;<i>     grass root democracy. Are you willing to spend 4 hours a day on
</I>&gt;<i>     politics?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO! ..but like i said... combine tv, newspaper, radio, talking with 
</I>&gt;<i> other people about issues, and the like...
</I>&gt;<i> People in fact DO INVEST time to learn about politics and to form 
</I>&gt;<i> opinions about it. They are just not able to give feedback in a 
</I>&gt;<i> constructive way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily we dont live in the 1920s anymore. We have the internet. Thats 
</I>&gt;<i> why there is hope, that the economic crisis will not lead to war and 
</I>&gt;<i> thats why it is possible to imagine grass roots politics without 
</I>&gt;<i> massive time investment by people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does the job for me,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you do, others might not.
</I>&gt;<i> maybe you will change your mind, once you've seen what is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> but i think you should be able to delegate and do as you please.
</I>&gt;<i> on the other hand i think you should allow people who want to 
</I>&gt;<i> participate on their own to also do as they please.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     just like I do not fix my car by myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> some people can and like to fix their car by themself.
</I>&gt;<i> Luckily politics cannot be compared to cars, because politics depend 
</I>&gt;<i> on topics and topics in politics are as diverse as life itself.
</I>&gt;<i> So probably there is at least one kind of topic for everyone, where 
</I>&gt;<i> one would like or at least could say something that could be 
</I>&gt;<i> considered professional.
</I>&gt;<i> ...thats because everyone probably has a profession and a daily 
</I>&gt;<i> routine that give him or her insights into some topics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But I want more and better control over what he does and I want
</I>&gt;<i>     more and better communication with him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, i think its vital to have good control and good communication 
</I>&gt;<i> with someone you delegate to.
</I>&gt;<i> The way a &quot;delegation mechanism&quot; is implemented is very vital and its 
</I>&gt;<i> not a trivial task to do.
</I>&gt;<i> If you do it the wrong way, you end up with serious problems. Thats a 
</I>&gt;<i> problem the german pirate party currently faces with their LIQUID 
</I>&gt;<i> FEEDBACK SYSTEM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where &quot;light&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>     stands for &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;It has a &quot;party mass&quot;, but shouldn't that be a private thing?
</I>&gt;<i>     Everyone should do as he pleases, and if people want to meet, they
</I>&gt;<i>     could...&quot; (I'm not sure what you are referring to as &quot;party
</I>&gt;<i>     mass&quot;). Of course everyone can do as he pleases, have their own
</I>&gt;<i>     private meetings and attend whatever event they want to (see
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Individual Level of Participation&quot;). The concept only speaks of
</I>&gt;<i>     the services that I think the organization should offer, to
</I>&gt;<i>     improve communication. The concept of the party fair is, by the
</I>&gt;<i>     way , a counter proposal to the German &quot;Parteitag&quot;, a very
</I>&gt;<i>     undemocratic event, that is mandatory for German parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, but pirates seem to have found a way to HACK it :-)
</I>&gt;<i> you should not &quot;close&quot; the parteitag and therefor it will continue and 
</I>&gt;<i> become something thats permanent. You then need a system that enables 
</I>&gt;<i> pirates to participate in this permanent parteitag. Lets see what else 
</I>&gt;<i> is possible :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;... it should develop and host the EIPW, but as its such an
</I>&gt;<i>     important tool, it should be open source and not bound to a
</I>&gt;<i>     comittee to foster development.&quot; As the concepts states, the tool
</I>&gt;<i>     is, in fact, open source, and it is owned by an independent
</I>&gt;<i>     organisation, the eipw.org &lt;<A HREF="http://eipw.org">http://eipw.org</A>&gt;. If you ever worked
</I>&gt;<i>     in an Open Source project, then you have experienced, that there
</I>&gt;<i>     always is some dirty work, no-one likes to do. Besides taking care
</I>&gt;<i>     of that, changing the EIPW must be a democratic process and that
</I>&gt;<i>     process in turn has to be managed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah... depends... have you ever heard of bitcoin? or what about 
</I>&gt;<i> p2p-sharing.plattforms. They are decentralized.
</I>&gt;<i> The same is true for votorola. Everyone could host their own streetwiki.
</I>&gt;<i> Streetwikis could connect to each other.
</I>&gt;<i> In the end it's all about trust and a concept that builds on 
</I>&gt;<i> centrality will always have a single point of failure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Compared to what is reality today, your proposal is visionary,
</I>&gt;<i>     but even compared to the internal processes of the pirate party
</I>&gt;<i>     and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0&quot;-system, i'm not sure if you could
</I>&gt;<i>     still call EIPW visionary.&quot; When I started thinking about my
</I>&gt;<i>     concept the pirate party and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0 was not
</I>&gt;<i>     visible to me. By the time they emerged into my sight I found a
</I>&gt;<i>     couple of flaws and shortcomings in their concept. Otherwise I
</I>&gt;<i>     would have trashed my concept and joined them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Liquid Feedback, also its a light house project, is not state of the 
</I>&gt;<i> art and has some serious shortcomings.
</I>&gt;<i> The pirate party has just established &quot;Liquid Feedback 2.0&quot;. It's 
</I>&gt;<i> still not perfect, but it has learned from the initial project and 
</I>&gt;<i> tries to improve on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are 3 &quot;AG's&quot; that think very hard about how to evolve the grass 
</I>&gt;<i> roots democracy that should become internal to the pirate party.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. AG B&#252;rgerbeteiligung (=&gt; Information Tool)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. AG Meinungsfindung (=&gt; Discussion Tool)
</I>&gt;<i> 3. AG Liquid Democracy (=&gt; Decision Tool)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I see the pirates party's approach, beside my concept,  so far as
</I>&gt;<i>     the only serious attempt in Germany to really change the political
</I>&gt;<i>     process. But, unfortunately, for me the gaps their concept is
</I>&gt;<i>     leaving are too big for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently they have 3 mechanisms.
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Parteitag that every pirate is allowed to attend
</I>&gt;<i> 2. An open wiki +etherpads and open AG's and mailinglists and mumble 
</I>&gt;<i> sessions that even non-pirates may join to work on the partys manifesto
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Liquid Feedback to create a picture of whats opinions exist and how 
</I>&gt;<i> much support they have
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So its pretty open to anyone.
</I>&gt;<i> Pirates from all over europe join the political discussions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not perfect, but its the best you can currently find out there.
</I>&gt;<i> Beside that, the pirates know about all the shortcomings and they work 
</I>&gt;<i> hard to improve on them, thats why they have several working groups 
</I>&gt;<i> that are again open to anyone (even non-pirates) to work on the 
</I>&gt;<i> concepts for better grass roots democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;I think your goals are not ambitious enough and some of your
</I>&gt;<i>     goals cannot be reached with such a conservative approach as you
</I>&gt;<i>     layed out.&quot; Like I said before, I am aiming to be evolutionary,
</I>&gt;<i>     not revolutionary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I miss the element in your concept that describes how you establish a 
</I>&gt;<i> continuuous improvement process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     That's one of the major flaws of the pirate party: they are
</I>&gt;<i>     leaving people like my grandmother behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you grandmother will die out before real change happens. your 
</I>&gt;<i> grandmother, and mine too, dont know whats going on in this world.
</I>&gt;<i> They live in yesterdays world, and thats fine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> everything that can be done without the internet was done in the past.
</I>&gt;<i> the only way to improve democracy is through the internet, there is no 
</I>&gt;<i> alternative (there might be one if scientists discover telepathy or 
</I>&gt;<i> something like that)
</I>&gt;<i> ...i dont think your grandma wouldnt be able to use the internet, it 
</I>&gt;<i> all depends on the &quot;user interface&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ...it can be used through TV, telephone, computers, cellphones, 
</I>&gt;<i> ...even robots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Put a robot inside of your grandmas house. Its her personal 
</I>&gt;<i> politician. She might ask him stuff and tell him what she wants and he 
</I>&gt;<i> will use the internet to do as she pleases. These robots develop. 
</I>&gt;<i> There is already programs like &quot;SIRI&quot; on iPhone and other similar 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;personal agents&quot; that you could command through voice, that might be 
</I>&gt;<i> also used for such use cases.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It will take time, but it will develop. Sure, people who grow up with 
</I>&gt;<i> a technology always have a headstart, but so did your grandma while 
</I>&gt;<i> you and me were young.
</I>&gt;<i> She had there time and she voted for people that brought the world to 
</I>&gt;<i> its current state ...we live in a fundamental financial crisis and now 
</I>&gt;<i> its not her turn.
</I>&gt;<i> She will not be left behind, and there will be a lot of effort to help 
</I>&gt;<i> her in using the new ways, but she has to help on her part by being 
</I>&gt;<i> open minded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If she rejects the ways of the younger generations, then the younger 
</I>&gt;<i> generation can not do anything about her.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     They are also voters, that need to be included in the democratic
</I>&gt;<i>     process. Should my concept ever be applied, I expect it to evolve
</I>&gt;<i>     further. I do not expect it to be the final answer, but rather a
</I>&gt;<i>     piece of the path that leads into the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This conversation started with the proposal to use the EIPW
</I>&gt;<i>     instead of buying out Facebook. You could just do that and ignore
</I>&gt;<i>     the rest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Personally, i dont believe that its possible to &quot;buy out facebook&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be just a waste of time to try to do that, but everyone here 
</I>&gt;<i> has a different perspective.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But if you think about the political process as whole, if you
</I>&gt;<i>     think &quot;once we have this result, what comes next?&quot; and especially
</I>&gt;<i>     when you think of something, that is meant to be realistic enough
</I>&gt;<i>     to actually materialise in the real world I am sure you will come
</I>&gt;<i>     to similar conclusions as I did, or maybe an even better solution!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully a less conservative approach.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the pirate party progresses in a nice way.
