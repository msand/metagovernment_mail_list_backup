&gt;<i>  Hello Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not visionary and it was
</I>&gt;<i> never meant to be.  I'm an old man (51) and I don't want to spend the rest
</I>&gt;<i> of my life within a lousy political system, while dreaming of a better
</I>&gt;<i> world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can be applied
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I made so far with conventional
</I>&gt;<i> parties. It is the attempt to correct the existing concepts for the better,
</I>&gt;<i> it's an evolution, not a revolution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that people are
</I>&gt;<i> willing to participate in the political process. This is not the case.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't think that this is true. There is no political apathy of people,
there is only an apathy when it comes to politicians.
People have jobs and lives and they dont have the time nor are they willing
to learn about all these complicated political processes that do exist and
that you have to comply with in order to get your point through.

If political participation becomes as easy as using twitter or writing an
email or sharing something on facebook, then that will change the game.



&gt;<i> Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized in political
</I>&gt;<i> parties in Germany.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Because that's not the way to go. Parties are an outdated model.
Only big parties matter (&gt;5% of votes) and they already have established
structure and opinions.
If you have a different opinion, you have to really work your ass of and
fight for you opinion if you join a party.
You have to attend physically and in the end, normally you adapt to their
opinion in order to progress in you political carreer or you wont stand a
chance...
...its just an exhausting undertaking...


&gt;<i> And even among those 5 million only a minority is actually actively
</I>&gt;<i> involved in the political process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yeah guess what. this is the case, because the structure of the whole thing
doesnt permit anything else.
FORM creates FUNCTION :-)  ...It's the wrong form, so it doesnt fullfill
the function that it's supposed to fullfill.
Instead, it creates a different function. We might call it &quot;democracy&quot; or
&quot;representative democracy&quot;, but daily routine and results define what it
is, and it's not something most people would wish it were.



&gt;<i> I therefore come to the conclusion that the majority of voters are not
</I>&gt;<i> willing to contribute the required effort of time and energy,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This conclusion isnt incorrect. But maybe its possible to reduce the
required effort of time and energy by serveral orders of magnitude.



&gt;<i> to participate in the political process. But if only a minority is driving
</I>&gt;<i> the political process, a system like VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship
</I>&gt;<i> of the active,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So, i dont think that this will ever happen. And even if you are correct,
than it is no change for the worse compared with our active system.
Because what you fear is what currently is already established.

You think people are not interested in politics.
I dont share this fundamental assumption.
I think the time and effort needed to participate is very high and the
chances to change something are very low.
It's the process as such that prevents people from participating and people
are only frustrated with this and the politicians, but not with politics
itself.
Politics are very important and most people have opinions about it.
If they were not interested, they wouldnt have any opinions in the first
place.



&gt;<i> just like we currently have with our conventional parties. (The concept of
</I>&gt;<i> VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more flaws, which I will not explain
</I>&gt;<i> here).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think votorola may not be perfect, but i dont know of any other system
concept that is superior to the votorola concept.
Thats not to say that votorola shouldnt be improved and when it comes to
&quot;user interface&quot; there is still a lot that can be done, but speaking about
the concept behind votorola, it really is pretty neat :-)

It's a bit sad that you dont want to elaborate on your thoughts about
votorola.



&gt;<i> This is also the key to the understanding of my concept: the voters are
</I>&gt;<i> not dissatisfied with the political system as a whole.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
HA! Oh my gosh... and how they are :-)
They are totally dissatisfied with the political system as it is today.
There is only political partys and vote once every couple of years....




&gt;<i> They are in principal content with the concept of &quot;politics as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No they are not.
It's true, that not everyone could participate in every kind of politics,
but for every kind of politics there are enough non-politician-experts that
could say something about it.
Politicians are experts in NOTHING! Without Lobbyists they were unable to
decide anything.
The Lobbyists are the EXPERTS.
The problem ist, that our current system is not open for any expert, but
only for those lobbyists.

So it depends on the political issue, but for every issue there will be
experts from all walks of life that could say something about it and find
good solutions.

The only thing that might be needed is &quot;public administration as a service&quot;
...but you dont need &quot;politics as a service&quot;.

With &quot;public administration as a service&quot; its the same as with every
company. The chairmen could not decide everything, thats why you give the
&quot;public administration&quot; some leeway in decision-making. Where this starts
and stops should be decided by the grass roots democratic process and can
be adapted as needed.



&gt;<i> The voters are discontent with the outcome of our politics in detail
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
YES!


&gt;<i> and that again is due to the lack of communication between politician and
</I>&gt;<i> voters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
YES! :-) But this problem is much more fundamental than you might think.
It cannot be fixed by minor changes to the current system.



&gt;<i> My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't thin it succeeds.
The problem is, that technological and ecnomical change moves faster than
politicians are able to adapt to it.
I dont believe its possible to govern this thing in a top down fashion.
top down is too slow and by the time it has reached a decision, its already
outdated.

LOOK and THINK about what is currently happening all over europe and all
over the world!
The establishment realizes that it is TOO SLOW and thats why they remove
democracy step after step, because thats one method to be able to make
decisions faster. ...not necessarily better, but at least faster.
I believe the only alternative is a system like votorola or a system with
similar concepts, that will use the bottom up approach, but will be at
least as fast as the dictatorship approach, ...probably even faster and
with way better decisions.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me comment some of your statements:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It's about parties, not about grass roots democracy ...&quot; Yes, concept
</I>&gt;<i> speaks of a party and that is for a simple reason: German laws allows us to
</I>&gt;<i> organize ourselves in any fashion WITHIN a party.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes and no. The pirate party faces some serious problems with establishing
a permanent party conference.
You dont have to change our current political system at all if you use this
kind of argument, because ...all you need is a party to get an absolute
majority of votes and then organize that partys internals in a grass roots
democratic fashion.



&gt;<i> Establishing grass roots democracy on the level of our constitution
</I>&gt;<i> requires a 60% majority in parliament, that's a long way to go and, like I
</I>&gt;<i> said, I would preferably see things happen in my lifetime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I bet you will see these major changes within your lifetime.
The technological singularity is currently predicted for the year 2045 :-)
But beside that, as the global financial cirsis continues, the pirate
parties world wide will grow like crazy :-)
And as soon as systems like votorola and the like are ready for battle,
they will be adopted and they will generate outstanding results, which will
lead to further grows of the pirate party and will eventually make all the
other parties adopt these grass roots concepts in order to survive.



I also do not see the need for parties any more, in my concept you will
&gt;<i> find a section where I speak of the party, that is founded to overcome all
</I>&gt;<i> parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That is the pirate party, because the only reason the pirate party as such
exists is to HACK our current political system in order to inject grass
roots democracy into the kernel of our political system.


&quot;... not about grass roots democracy , but that's what metagovernment is
&gt;<i> all about.&quot; I do hope that this forum is not dogmatic, but open to any
</I>&gt;<i> idea, that helps to improve our democracies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
its not dogmatic.
And I think other people on this mailinglist might have a different opinion
from mine.

I think that your concept is very nice compared with what current reality
looks like.
If it is able to convince people who know of nothing better than what we
currently have, it can accomplish a lot.
But comared to thoughts i've learned about through metagovernment.org, it
sounds a bit underdeveloped ;-)



I do claim, that my concept is in fact about grass roots democracy. But
&gt;<i> it's not about straight forward grass roots democracy, it's a hybrid of
</I>&gt;<i> conventional politics and grass roots democracy. The compromise is solely
</I>&gt;<i> made to make it work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Once your concept is established, how does it evolve? Did you bake in a
mechanism to enable your concept to evolve into something even more grass
roots?
I feel that it lacks such a mechanism.



&gt;<i> &quot;I dont know where to start.
</I>&gt;<i> it has a board, why do you need a board?
</I>&gt;<i> What kind of board? A board of elected politicians? Do you really think
</I>&gt;<i> it's them who write the laws today?
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really think that the crowd is not able to do that by itself?
</I>&gt;<i> It has staffs and staff managers? WTF?!? :-)&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by themselves, I think
</I>&gt;<i> that the majority just don't WANT to make the effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Depends on how big the effort is. Even though it's a major effort compared
to a simple mouseclick oder a short email, people sometimes move.
(see Stuttgart21, ACTA, noisy Airports, ...)
There might be many more smaller movements that you dont learn about
because they are to small and &quot;divided and conquered&quot;. Often they dont know
each other, and if they would, could otherwise join together....

People also take the time to watch the news or tv shows like &quot;Anne Will&quot;
and the like, where politicians discuss. They also listen to the radio
during traffic hour and again, its about politics. They also read the
newspaper... so if you combine ALL THIS, people spend a lot of time with
politics.
They know whats going on, they just are not able to give feedback during
that time.

So imagine they could give intelligent feedback in ways that would allow
intelligent opinion forming...




&gt;<i> The majority of voters prefer politics as a service.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
No, they dont. They are very unhappy with politics.
They would like to change it, they just cannot imagine how to do it.


&gt;<i> And I'm not sure if you have an idea of the huge amount of work we are
</I>&gt;<i> talking about. A Swedish Anarchist from the 1920s described her utopia as
</I>&gt;<i> follows &quot;people go to work in the factories for four hours. After the lunch
</I>&gt;<i> break, they go to work in parliament for another four hours&quot;. That is, I
</I>&gt;<i> think, a realistic scenario of a grass root democracy. Are you willing to
</I>&gt;<i> spend 4 hours a day on politics?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
NO! ..but like i said... combine tv, newspaper, radio, talking with other
people about issues, and the like...
People in fact DO INVEST time to learn about politics and to form opinions
about it. They are just not able to give feedback in a constructive way.

Luckily we dont live in the 1920s anymore. We have the internet. Thats why
there is hope, that the economic crisis will not lead to war and thats why
it is possible to imagine grass roots politics without massive time
investment by people.



&gt;<i> I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does the job for me,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
you do, others might not.
maybe you will change your mind, once you've seen what is possible.
but i think you should be able to delegate and do as you please.
on the other hand i think you should allow people who want to participate
on their own to also do as they please.



&gt;<i> just like I do not fix my car by myself.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
some people can and like to fix their car by themself.
Luckily politics cannot be compared to cars, because politics depend on
topics and topics in politics are as diverse as life itself.
So probably there is at least one kind of topic for everyone, where one
would like or at least could say something that could be considered
professional.
...thats because everyone probably has a profession and a daily routine
that give him or her insights into some topics.



&gt;<i> But I want more and better control over what he does and I want more and
</I>&gt;<i> better communication with him.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, i think its vital to have good control and good communication with
someone you delegate to.
The way a &quot;delegation mechanism&quot; is implemented is very vital and its not a
trivial task to do.
If you do it the wrong way, you end up with serious problems. Thats a
problem the german pirate party currently faces with their LIQUID FEEDBACK
SYSTEM.



&gt;<i> That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where &quot;light&quot; stands for
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;It has a &quot;party mass&quot;, but shouldn't that be a private thing? Everyone
</I>&gt;<i> should do as he pleases, and if people want to meet, they could...&quot; (I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure what you are referring to as &quot;party mass&quot;). Of course everyone can
</I>&gt;<i> do as he pleases, have their own private meetings and attend whatever event
</I>&gt;<i> they want to (see &quot;Individual Level of Participation&quot;). The concept only
</I>&gt;<i> speaks of the services that I think the organization should offer, to
</I>&gt;<i> improve communication. The concept of the party fair is, by the way , a
</I>&gt;<i> counter proposal to the German &quot;Parteitag&quot;, a very undemocratic event, that
</I>&gt;<i> is mandatory for German parties.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, but pirates seem to have found a way to HACK it :-)
you should not &quot;close&quot; the parteitag and therefor it will continue and
become something thats permanent. You then need a system that enables
pirates to participate in this permanent parteitag. Lets see what else is
possible :-)



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;... it should develop and host the EIPW, but as its such an important
</I>&gt;<i> tool, it should be open source and not bound to a comittee to foster
</I>&gt;<i> development.&quot; As the concepts states, the tool is, in fact, open source,
</I>&gt;<i> and it is owned by an independent organisation, the eipw.org. If you ever
</I>&gt;<i> worked in an Open Source project, then you have experienced, that there
</I>&gt;<i> always is some dirty work, no-one likes to do. Besides taking care of that,
</I>&gt;<i> changing the EIPW must be a democratic process and that process in turn has
</I>&gt;<i> to be managed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yeah... depends... have you ever heard of bitcoin? or what about
p2p-sharing.plattforms. They are decentralized.
The same is true for votorola. Everyone could host their own streetwiki.
Streetwikis could connect to each other.
In the end it's all about trust and a concept that builds on centrality
will always have a single point of failure.




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Compared to what is reality today, your proposal is visionary, but even
</I>&gt;<i> compared to the internal processes of the pirate party and their &quot;liquid
</I>&gt;<i> feedback 2.0&quot;-system, i'm not sure if you could still call EIPW visionary.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> When I started thinking about my concept the pirate party and their &quot;liquid
</I>&gt;<i> feedback 2.0 was not visible to me. By the time they emerged into my sight
</I>&gt;<i> I found a couple of flaws and shortcomings in their concept. Otherwise I
</I>&gt;<i> would have trashed my concept and joined them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Liquid Feedback, also its a light house project, is not state of the art
and has some serious shortcomings.
The pirate party has just established &quot;Liquid Feedback 2.0&quot;. It's still not
perfect, but it has learned from the initial project and tries to improve
on it.

There are 3 &quot;AG's&quot; that think very hard about how to evolve the grass roots
democracy that should become internal to the pirate party.
1. AG B&#252;rgerbeteiligung (=&gt; Information Tool)
2. AG Meinungsfindung (=&gt; Discussion Tool)
3. AG Liquid Democracy (=&gt; Decision Tool)




&gt;<i> I see the pirates party's approach, beside my concept,  so far as the only
</I>&gt;<i> serious attempt in Germany to really change the political process. But,
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately, for me the gaps their concept is leaving are too big for me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Currently they have 3 mechanisms.
1. Parteitag that every pirate is allowed to attend
2. An open wiki +etherpads and open AG's and mailinglists and mumble
sessions that even non-pirates may join to work on the partys manifesto
3. Liquid Feedback to create a picture of whats opinions exist and how much
support they have

So its pretty open to anyone.
Pirates from all over europe join the political discussions.

This is not perfect, but its the best you can currently find out there.
Beside that, the pirates know about all the shortcomings and they work hard
to improve on them, thats why they have several working groups that are
again open to anyone (even non-pirates) to work on the concepts for better
grass roots democracy.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I think your goals are not ambitious enough and some of your goals cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be reached with such a conservative approach as you layed out.&quot; Like I said
</I>&gt;<i> before, I am aiming to be evolutionary, not revolutionary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I miss the element in your concept that describes how you establish a
continuuous improvement process.



&gt;<i> That's one of the major flaws of the pirate party: they are leaving people
</I>&gt;<i> like my grandmother behind.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
you grandmother will die out before real change happens. your grandmother,
and mine too, dont know whats going on in this world.
They live in yesterdays world, and thats fine.

everything that can be done without the internet was done in the past.
the only way to improve democracy is through the internet, there is no
alternative (there might be one if scientists discover telepathy or
something like that)
...i dont think your grandma wouldnt be able to use the internet, it all
depends on the &quot;user interface&quot;
...it can be used through TV, telephone, computers, cellphones, ...even
robots.

Put a robot inside of your grandmas house. Its her personal politician. She
might ask him stuff and tell him what she wants and he will use the
internet to do as she pleases. These robots develop. There is already
programs like &quot;SIRI&quot; on iPhone and other similar &quot;personal agents&quot; that you
could command through voice, that might be also used for such use cases.

It will take time, but it will develop. Sure, people who grow up with a
technology always have a headstart, but so did your grandma while you and
me were young.
She had there time and she voted for people that brought the world to its
current state ...we live in a fundamental financial crisis and now its not
her turn.
She will not be left behind, and there will be a lot of effort to help her
in using the new ways, but she has to help on her part by being open minded.

If she rejects the ways of the younger generations, then the younger
generation can not do anything about her.




&gt;<i> They are also voters, that need to be included in the democratic process.
</I>&gt;<i> Should my concept ever be applied, I expect it to evolve further. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> expect it to be the final answer, but rather a piece of the path that leads
</I>&gt;<i> into the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This conversation started with the proposal to use the EIPW instead of
</I>&gt;<i> buying out Facebook. You could just do that and ignore the rest.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Personally, i dont believe that its possible to &quot;buy out facebook&quot;.
It would be just a waste of time to try to do that, but everyone here has a
different perspective.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you think about the political process as whole, if you think &quot;once
</I>&gt;<i> we have this result, what comes next?&quot; and especially when you think of
</I>&gt;<i> something, that is meant to be realistic enough to actually materialise in
</I>&gt;<i> the real world I am sure you will come to similar conclusions as I did, or
</I>&gt;<i> maybe an even better solution!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
hopefully a less conservative approach.
I think the pirate party progresses in a nice way.
