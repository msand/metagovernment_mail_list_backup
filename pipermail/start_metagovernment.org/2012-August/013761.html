<PRE>Hi, Ronald. I'll answer some of your questions from the perspective of Metagovernment, because I think many of us agree on the same basic approach. These answers probably will work especially well for Votorola, but they are not unique to it.

&gt;<i> Who is supposed to work with Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: is Votorola simple enough for the common man to understand?
</I>&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: in how far is the use of Votorola rewarding?
</I>&gt;<i> How does Votorola provide transparency on how the results came about?
</I>&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: is that report simple enough for the common man to understand?
</I>
Collaborative governance software is by its very nature for all people. Whether or not it is accessible is an issue of design and implementation. For the most part, we're just not at that stage yet. (Concerning transparency, Votorola uses public voting, as opposed to secret. So it is very easy to know if your position is properly registered: you can see it and call foul if it is not.)

&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who can't handle a computer?
</I>&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who refuse to put their trust in a computerized solution?
</I>
In part this segues with the above questions, because governance software does not have to be an end in itself. It does not need to be the functional equivalent of a leader-ruler. In some conceptions, particularly that of Votorola, it is an overlay on a community.

There is nothing incompatible with collaborative governance software being augmented by (or augmenting) a physical community meeting. People will deliberate as they wish; we are only trying to enhance and facilitate those natural processes. If someone verbally informs their community that they do not consent with something agreed on via computer, then the community does not have consensus and still has work to do.

&gt;<i> How does Votorola fit into the existing political process? 
</I>&gt;<i> What changes to the existing political process are required to introduce Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i> Does Votorola require legal changes (changing the constitution)?
</I>
Our projects are, for the most part, not aimed at fitting onto the existing political process as much as gradually, gently pushing it out of the way. As an integral part of this answer, they also are not aimed at fitting into existing political divisions, such as nation-states. The current system is basically an adaptation of feudal politics. We have kings and lords. We call them by other names, and they come and go by election, but the way they wield power is not substantively different. Our system cannot break out of that mold, because feudalism is its very bones.

We're not looking to overthrow the existing system, simply to provide people with a better way of making decisions. As they use this better way to work out small community issues, over time they can scale upward and gently shrug off the constraints of power-centric governance.

&gt;<i> And the most important questions:
</I>&gt;<i> What does the roadmap for introducing Votorola look like?
</I>&gt;<i> How do you want to attract citizens and politicians towards Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i> Which are the mile stones from starting to universal acceptance?
</I>&gt;<i> How does the time line look like?
</I>
I think my last paragraph above begins to answer these. The rest will be answered as we learn more. This is an organic process. The more rigidly we plan it, the more we set ourselves up to fail. 

</PRE>
