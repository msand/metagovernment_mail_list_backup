</I>&gt;<i>     Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     when I started out with my concept 10 years ago, the nucleus of my
</I>&gt;<i>     thoughts was, that we need to get more people to participate in
</I>&gt;<i>     the political process, independent from the solution. And to get
</I>&gt;<i>     Joe Sixpack and John Dough on the boat requires three things from
</I>&gt;<i>     the solution:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It must be simple
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It must be transparent and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It must be rewarding
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, sorry guys, as much as I admire the intellectual beauty of
</I>&gt;<i>     your concepts: for Joe and John most of your concepts are too
</I>&gt;<i>     brainy, they will not understand and therefore they will stay away.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i agree with that in context of the user interface of votorola.
</I>&gt;<i> ...but i believe, that votorola can be made dead simple.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure if the developers of votorola choose the right way, there 
</I>&gt;<i> might be a better way, but at least they are working on a &quot;mini beta&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> to get users on board, and thats a step in the right direction (at 
</I>&gt;<i> least thats what i think)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Think about FACEBOOK.
</I>&gt;<i> FACEBOOK is the one software tool, that has nearly 1 billion users 
</I>&gt;<i> (Eine Milliarde) and compared to others, 50% of those use it DAILY.
</I>&gt;<i> Now think about all the options that facebook offers and all the apps 
</I>&gt;<i> and plugins that are developed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, FACEBOOK is fairly COMPLEX when it comes to functionality, 
</I>&gt;<i> but the same time, JOHN and JOE can use it.
</I>&gt;<i> So, for me, the same is true for votorola. It all depends on the 
</I>&gt;<i> genius of &quot;user interface design&quot; that's needed in order to make it 
</I>&gt;<i> REWARDING, TRANSPARENT and DEAD SIMPLE without loosing needed 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...its a longt way to go, but i think its possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But not only will they refuse to participate, they will not note
</I>&gt;<i>     give their votes to a party they don't understand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sure, so it's important to make things understandable and make it as 
</I>&gt;<i> attractive as facebook, so they will participate.
</I>&gt;<i> I dont see something in the concept of votorola itself that will 
</I>&gt;<i> prevent that from happening.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     And this is not only true for Joe and John, I've spoken to some
</I>&gt;<i>     people that do have the intellectual capacities to understand all
</I>&gt;<i>     these concepts and still refuse to participate and that is because
</I>&gt;<i>     they shy away from anything experimental.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. everything starts out experimentally at some point in time.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. i dont think people understand the concepts behind BITCOINS in 
</I>&gt;<i> detail and they also dont understand the technical concepts behind 
</I>&gt;<i> ONLINE BANKING... they dont understand the technical concept behind 
</I>&gt;<i> EBAY or AMAZON nor do they intellectually grasp how GOOGLE SEARCH works...
</I>&gt;<i> ...but they use it and they trust it and there are a lot of experts 
</I>&gt;<i> who understand it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bitcoin and P2P Filesharing is a good example. There is only a 
</I>&gt;<i> minority that understand the exact crypto techniques that make 
</I>&gt;<i> bitcoins possible, but nevertheless, there is a growing market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question is, how do you create and preserve TRUST?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most people do not understand how WINDOWS works and they do not 
</I>&gt;<i> understand how LINUX works, but they use it and they TRUST it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who knows how traditional ballots work? How many people have attended 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;vote counting&quot; and how many people look into how votes are accumulated?
</I>&gt;<i> MOST PEOPLE TRUST that there will be some experts that will observe it 
</I>&gt;<i> and will bring it to public attention in one way or another, so that 
</I>&gt;<i> people learn about fraud if it happend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     They want to see it actually work, before they participate. All
</I>&gt;<i>     this ends up in an endless loop where the concepts never proof
</I>&gt;<i>     their righteousness because no-one participates, because the
</I>&gt;<i>     concepts never proof their righteousness ... .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yes, but there are tools that are used in practice, e.g. ADHOCRACY, 
</I>&gt;<i> LIQUID FEEDBACK, ....
</I>&gt;<i> ...votorola will be tested too, but it takes time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, as a result, so far none of your efforts will bear fruits,
</I>&gt;<i>     because democracy is about majorities and in Germany that means to
</I>&gt;<i>     get 33 million people to support you!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> sure, it takes time...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you don't believe me and my perception of our comrade citizens,
</I>&gt;<i>     there's a simple test: try to convince your next door neighbour
</I>&gt;<i>     with your concept, or, even better, your grandmother.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the time for this has not arrived yet. ...but it will.
</I>&gt;<i> There are not many visionary people.
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to convince normal people, you have to show them and let 
</I>&gt;<i> them try it out.
</I>&gt;<i> twenty years ago, nobody could have imagined google.
</I>&gt;<i> ten years ago, nobody could have imagined facebook.
</I>&gt;<i> ...think about wikipedia? ...theres so many things in this world that 
</I>&gt;<i> nobody would have believed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some time ago, it was impossible to convince anyone, that something 
</I>&gt;<i> like WIKIPEDIA would work, but it did and it continues to do so...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I did it, it was a very frustrating lesson, but I can claim that I
</I>&gt;<i>     know what I am talking about. And, by the way: I also participated
</I>&gt;<i>     in a conventional party and from that experience I can say: in
</I>&gt;<i>     some points you are drastically underestimating the complexity of
</I>&gt;<i>     the political process, be it grassroots or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NO!
</I>&gt;<i> I dont think there is much complexity, its only complicated.
</I>&gt;<i> The way political partys work is very complicated. That has to do with 
</I>&gt;<i> some random growth... often things evolve randomly...
</I>&gt;<i> ...and it has to do with the hierarchical concepts that make things 
</I>&gt;<i> more and more COMPLICATED the bigger they grow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want things to work in a grass roots way, you have to think 
</I>&gt;<i> about it in different ways.
</I>&gt;<i> ...like simple mechanisms for each participant, that will create 
</I>&gt;<i> complex patterns and results.
</I>&gt;<i> ...maybe you have to try to think about the problem like it were a 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fractal&quot; :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ..yeah, i know thats a pretty abstract statement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This is why I came to the conclusion to try to correct the current
</I>&gt;<i>     system rather than to replace it. The advantage: by recognizing
</I>&gt;<i>     familiar structures people are more willing to accept the new.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> computer replaced typewriter
</I>&gt;<i> email replaced letter
</I>&gt;<i> digital money replaced paper money (at least when it comes to 
</I>&gt;<i> busines2business transactions)
</I>&gt;<i> cars replaced carriages
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... it did not happen over night and some things still coexist, but 
</I>&gt;<i> look at LIQUID FEEDBACK or look at epetitionen.bundestag.de 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://epetitionen.bundestag.de">http://epetitionen.bundestag.de</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> It already coexists and the more it evolves, the more it will continue 
</I>&gt;<i> to replace the old ways of doing democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you develop digital grassroots democracy, the traditional 
</I>&gt;<i> structures will adapt themselves sooner or later, but the development 
</I>&gt;<i> of digital tools have to lead the way. If they dont lead, it will 
</I>&gt;<i> never be possible to make traditional structures adapt, because they 
</I>&gt;<i> have no reason to adapt.. why should they?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The path I can sees is: once we managed to get more and more
</I>&gt;<i>     people to participate in what is their very own belonging: their
</I>&gt;<i>     community and education has become so much better, that even John
</I>&gt;<i>     and Joe are ready to understand even more complex concepts, then
</I>&gt;<i>     comes the time for Votorola and all the other, nice concepts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> we have tried multiple times to get people on board, thats why 
</I>&gt;<i> votorola tries to create a &quot;mini beta&quot;, but its not easy.
</I>&gt;<i> currently the interface is lacking, but it constantly improves... 
</I>&gt;<i> compared to what it looked like a couple of months ago, it has 
</I>&gt;<i> improved dramatically :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i think the pirates but also the occupy movement is really needy when 
</I>&gt;<i> it comes to better tools.
</I>&gt;<i> they constantly complain about bad tools and they try different 
</I>&gt;<i> approaches, ...it just takes time and programmers to develop the tools 
</I>&gt;<i> further.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     For me the goal is to get these 33 millions on board, no matter
</I>&gt;<i>     what the solution looks like. If any one has some thoughts on how
</I>&gt;<i>     to get there, please share!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> yeah, ambitious goals. I'd like to see that too.
</I>&gt;<i> probably &quot;early birds&quot; or &quot;early adopters&quot; will be occupicies and 
</I>&gt;<i> pirates.... then it will continue to spread, and at some point, there 
</I>&gt;<i> will be a facebook plugin :P
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If you are interested: I got some ideas!
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> sure, your welcome to share :-)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     always be people unwilling or unable to fully participate. This
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     is the reality of the matter. However Alex is also correct in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that there are masses of people who are completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     disenfranchised, but desperately want to feel as if they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     made a difference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I know people who fit into both categories as well as those that

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     not the people we need to be worried about necessarily. When the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     tool or ecosystem of internet democracy is matured, they will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     ready.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     People like grandmother and the working class are the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     demographics that will be required if we want to really foment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     the change necessary to evolve our democratic structures.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     For that reason I suggest a dynamic distributed democracy as a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     compromise.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     This allows people to both take part in the process as a direct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     contributor to the online forum, as well as people to select
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     representatives to contribute for them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Of course this has its own downsides and the implementation is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     significantly more difficult and open to malicious behavior, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     satisfies the problems brought forward in this thread. On the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     other hand there is also a very important and distinct advantage.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     DDD transitions our political discussion and activity from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     mass-media and political parties into our communities of friends
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     and family.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Rather than fight the existing political structures and mass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     media we simply cut it away and render it useless. When you can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     elect people you know and trust as representatives whenever you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     want, the election cycle disappears. So it has all of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     advantages of both direct and direct democratic processes.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Hello Alex,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             visionary and it was never meant to be.  I'm an old man
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             (51) and I don't want to spend the rest of my life within
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             a lousy political system, while dreaming of a better world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             be applied tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             made so far with conventional parties. It is the attempt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to correct the existing concepts for the better, it's an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             evolution, not a revolution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             people are willing to participate in the political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             process. This is not the case.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I don't think that this is true. There is no political apathy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         of people, there is only an apathy when it comes to politicians.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         People have jobs and lives and they dont have the time nor
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         are they willing to learn about all these complicated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         political processes that do exist and that you have to comply
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         with in order to get your point through.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If political participation becomes as easy as using twitter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         or writing an email or sharing something on facebook, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         that will change the game.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             organized in political parties in Germany.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Because that's not the way to go. Parties are an outdated model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Only big parties matter (&gt;5% of votes) and they already have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         established structure and opinions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If you have a different opinion, you have to really work your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ass of and fight for you opinion if you join a party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         You have to attend physically and in the end, normally you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         adapt to their opinion in order to progress in you political
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         carreer or you wont stand a chance...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ...its just an exhausting undertaking...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             And even among those 5 million only a minority is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             actually actively involved in the political process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         yeah guess what. this is the case, because the structure of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the whole thing doesnt permit anything else.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         FORM creates FUNCTION :-)  ...It's the wrong form, so it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         doesnt fullfill the function that it's supposed to fullfill.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Instead, it creates a different function. We might call it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;democracy&quot; or &quot;representative democracy&quot;, but daily routine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and results define what it is, and it's not something most
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         people would wish it were.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I therefore come to the conclusion that the majority of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             voters are not willing to contribute the required effort
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             of time and energy,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         This conclusion isnt incorrect. But maybe its possible to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         reduce the required effort of time and energy by serveral
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         orders of magnitude.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to participate in the political process. But if only a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             minority is driving the political process, a system like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship of the active,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So, i dont think that this will ever happen. And even if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         are correct, than it is no change for the worse compared with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         our active system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Because what you fear is what currently is already established.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         You think people are not interested in politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I dont share this fundamental assumption.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I think the time and effort needed to participate is very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         high and the chances to change something are very low.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It's the process as such that prevents people from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         participating and people are only frustrated with this and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the politicians, but not with politics itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Politics are very important and most people have opinions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If they were not interested, they wouldnt have any opinions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in the first place.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             just like we currently have with our conventional
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             parties. (The concept of VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             couple more flaws, which I will not explain here).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I think votorola may not be perfect, but i dont know of any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         other system concept that is superior to the votorola concept.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Thats not to say that votorola shouldnt be improved and when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         it comes to &quot;user interface&quot; there is still a lot that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         done, but speaking about the concept behind votorola, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         really is pretty neat :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It's a bit sad that you dont want to elaborate on your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         thoughts about votorola.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             This is also the key to the understanding of my concept:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the voters are not dissatisfied with the political system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             as a whole.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         HA! Oh my gosh... and how they are :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They are totally dissatisfied with the political system as it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         is today.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         There is only political partys and vote once every couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         years....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             They are in principal content with the concept of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;politics as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         No they are not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It's true, that not everyone could participate in every kind
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         of politics, but for every kind of politics there are enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         non-politician-experts that could say something about it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Politicians are experts in NOTHING! Without Lobbyists they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         were unable to decide anything.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The Lobbyists are the EXPERTS.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The problem ist, that our current system is not open for any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         expert, but only for those lobbyists.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So it depends on the political issue, but for every issue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         there will be experts from all walks of life that could say
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         something about it and find good solutions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The only thing that might be needed is &quot;public administration
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         as a service&quot; ...but you dont need &quot;politics as a service&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         With &quot;public administration as a service&quot; its the same as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         with every company. The chairmen could not decide everything,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         thats why you give the &quot;public administration&quot; some leeway in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         decision-making. Where this starts and stops should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         decided by the grass roots democratic process and can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         adapted as needed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             The voters are discontent with the outcome of our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             politics in detail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         YES!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and that again is due to the lack of communication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             between politician and voters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         YES! :-) But this problem is much more fundamental than you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         might think.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It cannot be fixed by minor changes to the current system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I don't thin it succeeds.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The problem is, that technological and ecnomical change moves
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         faster than politicians are able to adapt to it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I dont believe its possible to govern this thing in a top
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         down fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         top down is too slow and by the time it has reached a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         decision, its already outdated.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         LOOK and THINK about what is currently happening all over
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         europe and all over the world!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The establishment realizes that it is TOO SLOW and thats why
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         they remove democracy step after step, because thats one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         method to be able to make decisions faster. ...not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         necessarily better, but at least faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I believe the only alternative is a system like votorola or a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         system with similar concepts, that will use the bottom up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         approach, but will be at least as fast as the dictatorship
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         approach, ...probably even faster and with way better decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Let me comment some of your statements:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;It's about parties, not about grass roots democracy ...&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Yes, concept speaks of a party and that is for a simple
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             reason: German laws allows us to organize ourselves in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             any fashion WITHIN a party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         yes and no. The pirate party faces some serious problems with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         establishing a permanent party conference.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         You dont have to change our current political system at all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         if you use this kind of argument, because ...all you need is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a party to get an absolute majority of votes and then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         organize that partys internals in a grass roots democratic
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         fashion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Establishing grass roots democracy on the level of our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             constitution requires a 60% majority in parliament,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that's a long way to go and, like I said, I would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             preferably see things happen in my lifetime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I bet you will see these major changes within your lifetime.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The technological singularity is currently predicted for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         year 2045 :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         But beside that, as the global financial cirsis continues,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the pirate parties world wide will grow like crazy :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And as soon as systems like votorola and the like are ready
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         for battle, they will be adopted and they will generate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         outstanding results, which will lead to further grows of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         pirate party and will eventually make all the other parties
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         adopt these grass roots concepts in order to survive.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I also do not see the need for parties any more, in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             concept you will find a section where I speak of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             party, that is founded to overcome all parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         That is the pirate party, because the only reason the pirate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         party as such exists is to HACK our current political system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         in order to inject grass roots democracy into the kernel of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         our political system.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;... not about grass roots democracy , but that's what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             metagovernment is all about.&quot; I do hope that this forum
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             is not dogmatic, but open to any idea, that helps to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             improve our democracies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         its not dogmatic.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         And I think other people on this mailinglist might have a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         different opinion from mine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I think that your concept is very nice compared with what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         current reality looks like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If it is able to convince people who know of nothing better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         than what we currently have, it can accomplish a lot.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         But comared to thoughts i've learned about through
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;, it sounds a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         bit underdeveloped ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I do claim, that my concept is in fact about grass roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             democracy. But it's not about straight forward grass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             roots democracy, it's a hybrid of conventional politics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and grass roots democracy. The compromise is solely made
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to make it work.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Once your concept is established, how does it evolve? Did you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         bake in a mechanism to enable your concept to evolve into
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         something even more grass roots?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I feel that it lacks such a mechanism.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;I dont know where to start.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             it has a board, why do you need a board?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             What kind of board? A board of elected politicians? Do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             you really think it's them who write the laws today?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Do you really think that the crowd is not able to do that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             by itself?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             It has staffs and staff managers? WTF?!? :-)&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             themselves, I think that the majority just don't WANT to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             make the effort.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Depends on how big the effort is. Even though it's a major
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         effort compared to a simple mouseclick oder a short email,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         people sometimes move.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         (see Stuttgart21, ACTA, noisy Airports, ...)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         There might be many more smaller movements that you dont
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         learn about because they are to small and &quot;divided and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         conquered&quot;. Often they dont know each other, and if they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         would, could otherwise join together....
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         People also take the time to watch the news or tv shows like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         &quot;Anne Will&quot; and the like, where politicians discuss. They
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         also listen to the radio during traffic hour and again, its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         about politics. They also read the newspaper... so if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         combine ALL THIS, people spend a lot of time with politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They know whats going on, they just are not able to give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         feedback during that time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So imagine they could give intelligent feedback in ways that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         would allow intelligent opinion forming...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             The majority of voters prefer politics as a service.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         No, they dont. They are very unhappy with politics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They would like to change it, they just cannot imagine how to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             And I'm not sure if you have an idea of the huge amount
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             of work we are talking about. A Swedish Anarchist from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the 1920s described her utopia as follows &quot;people go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             work in the factories for four hours. After the lunch
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             break, they go to work in parliament for another four
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             hours&quot;. That is, I think, a realistic scenario of a grass
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             root democracy. Are you willing to spend 4 hours a day on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             politics?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         NO! ..but like i said... combine tv, newspaper, radio,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         talking with other people about issues, and the like...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         People in fact DO INVEST time to learn about politics and to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         form opinions about it. They are just not able to give
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         feedback in a constructive way.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Luckily we dont live in the 1920s anymore. We have the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         internet. Thats why there is hope, that the economic crisis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         will not lead to war and thats why it is possible to imagine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         grass roots politics without massive time investment by people.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the job for me,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         you do, others might not.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         maybe you will change your mind, once you've seen what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         possible.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         but i think you should be able to delegate and do as you please.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         on the other hand i think you should allow people who want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         participate on their own to also do as they please.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             just like I do not fix my car by myself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         some people can and like to fix their car by themself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Luckily politics cannot be compared to cars, because politics
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         depend on topics and topics in politics are as diverse as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         life itself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So probably there is at least one kind of topic for everyone,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         where one would like or at least could say something that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         could be considered professional.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ...thats because everyone probably has a profession and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         daily routine that give him or her insights into some topics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             But I want more and better control over what he does and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I want more and better communication with him.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         yes, i think its vital to have good control and good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         communication with someone you delegate to.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The way a &quot;delegation mechanism&quot; is implemented is very vital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         and its not a trivial task to do.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If you do it the wrong way, you end up with serious problems.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Thats a problem the german pirate party currently faces with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         their LIQUID FEEDBACK SYSTEM.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;light&quot; stands for &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;It has a &quot;party mass&quot;, but shouldn't that be a private
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             thing? Everyone should do as he pleases, and if people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             want to meet, they could...&quot; (I'm not sure what you are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             referring to as &quot;party mass&quot;). Of course everyone can do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             as he pleases, have their own private meetings and attend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             whatever event they want to (see &quot;Individual Level of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             Participation&quot;). The concept only speaks of the services
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that I think the organization should offer, to improve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             communication. The concept of the party fair is, by the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             way , a counter proposal to the German &quot;Parteitag&quot;, a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             very undemocratic event, that is mandatory for German
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             parties.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         yes, but pirates seem to have found a way to HACK it :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         you should not &quot;close&quot; the parteitag and therefor it will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         continue and become something thats permanent. You then need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         a system that enables pirates to participate in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         permanent parteitag. Lets see what else is possible :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;... it should develop and host the EIPW, but as its such
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             an important tool, it should be open source and not bound
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to a comittee to foster development.&quot; As the concepts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             states, the tool is, in fact, open source, and it is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             owned by an independent organisation, the eipw.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &lt;<A HREF="http://eipw.org">http://eipw.org</A>&gt;. If you ever worked in an Open Source
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             project, then you have experienced, that there always is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             some dirty work, no-one likes to do. Besides taking care
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             of that, changing the EIPW must be a democratic process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and that process in turn has to be managed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Yeah... depends... have you ever heard of bitcoin? or what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         about p2p-sharing.plattforms. They are decentralized.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The same is true for votorola. Everyone could host their own
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         streetwiki.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Streetwikis could connect to each other.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         In the end it's all about trust and a concept that builds on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         centrality will always have a single point of failure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;Compared to what is reality today, your proposal is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             visionary, but even compared to the internal processes of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the pirate party and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0&quot;-system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             i'm not sure if you could still call EIPW visionary.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             When I started thinking about my concept the pirate party
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0 was not visible to me. By
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the time they emerged into my sight I found a couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             flaws and shortcomings in their concept. Otherwise I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             would have trashed my concept and joined them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Liquid Feedback, also its a light house project, is not state
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         of the art and has some serious shortcomings.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         The pirate party has just established &quot;Liquid Feedback 2.0&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It's still not perfect, but it has learned from the initial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         project and tries to improve on it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         There are 3 &quot;AG's&quot; that think very hard about how to evolve
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the grass roots democracy that should become internal to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         pirate party.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         1. AG B&#252;rgerbeteiligung (=&gt; Information Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         2. AG Meinungsfindung (=&gt; Discussion Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         3. AG Liquid Democracy (=&gt; Decision Tool)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             I see the pirates party's approach, beside my concept, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             so far as the only serious attempt in Germany to really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             change the political process. But, unfortunately, for me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             the gaps their concept is leaving are too big for me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Currently they have 3 mechanisms.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         1. Parteitag that every pirate is allowed to attend
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         2. An open wiki +etherpads and open AG's and mailinglists and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         mumble sessions that even non-pirates may join to work on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         partys manifesto
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         3. Liquid Feedback to create a picture of whats opinions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         exist and how much support they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         So its pretty open to anyone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Pirates from all over europe join the political discussions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         This is not perfect, but its the best you can currently find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         out there.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Beside that, the pirates know about all the shortcomings and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         they work hard to improve on them, thats why they have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         several working groups that are again open to anyone (even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         non-pirates) to work on the concepts for better grass roots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         democracy.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             &quot;I think your goals are not ambitious enough and some of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             your goals cannot be reached with such a conservative
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             approach as you layed out.&quot; Like I said before, I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             aiming to be evolutionary, not revolutionary.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I miss the element in your concept that describes how you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         establish a continuuous improvement process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             That's one of the major flaws of the pirate party: they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             are leaving people like my grandmother behind.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         you grandmother will die out before real change happens. your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         grandmother, and mine too, dont know whats going on in this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         world.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         They live in yesterdays world, and thats fine.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         everything that can be done without the internet was done in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the past.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         the only way to improve democracy is through the internet,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         there is no alternative (there might be one if scientists
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         discover telepathy or something like that)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ...i dont think your grandma wouldnt be able to use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         internet, it all depends on the &quot;user interface&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         ...it can be used through TV, telephone, computers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         cellphones, ...even robots.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Put a robot inside of your grandmas house. Its her personal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         politician. She might ask him stuff and tell him what she
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         wants and he will use the internet to do as she pleases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         These robots develop. There is already programs like &quot;SIRI&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         on iPhone and other similar &quot;personal agents&quot; that you could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         command through voice, that might be also used for such use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         cases.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It will take time, but it will develop. Sure, people who grow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         up with a technology always have a headstart, but so did your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         grandma while you and me were young.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         She had there time and she voted for people that brought the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         world to its current state ...we live in a fundamental
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         financial crisis and now its not her turn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         She will not be left behind, and there will be a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         effort to help her in using the new ways, but she has to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         on her part by being open minded.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         If she rejects the ways of the younger generations, then the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         younger generation can not do anything about her.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             They are also voters, that need to be included in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             democratic process. Should my concept ever be applied, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             expect it to evolve further. I do not expect it to be the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             final answer, but rather a piece of the path that leads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             into the future.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             This conversation started with the proposal to use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             EIPW instead of buying out Facebook. You could just do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             that and ignore the rest.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         Personally, i dont believe that its possible to &quot;buy out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         facebook&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         It would be just a waste of time to try to do that, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         everyone here has a different perspective.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             But if you think about the political process as whole, if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             you think &quot;once we have this result, what comes next?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             and especially when you think of something, that is meant
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             to be realistic enough to actually materialise in the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             real world I am sure you will come to similar conclusions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>             as I did, or maybe an even better solution!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         hopefully a less conservative approach.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>         I think the pirate party progresses in a nice way.
