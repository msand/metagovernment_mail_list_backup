<PRE>Friends,

Here you have stated very well the assumption behind your argument. It is
an important point that merits examination. My thoughts:

Politics is not a &quot;service,&quot; although politicians might like us to see it
that way. Politics is society's way of deciding its priorities.

Politicians have no more technical knowledge about this than the rest of us
(civil servants and non-elected advisors traditionally provide that), nor
do they implement anything themselves (permanent employees of the state do
that). The car-mechanic analogy isn't valid.

It is undeniable that many people in modern representative democracies are
apathetic when faced with the degraded forms it currently takes. But there
is good evidence that this degradation (including &quot;poor communication&quot;) is
in fact inherent in the representative model, whether or not we want to
argue that it has been a historically inevitable stage.

Also undeniable that rep-dem is well-entrenched within the present
world-system, alongside corporate capitalism, state militarism,
hierarchical relations of gender, age and skin-colour etc etc. It plays its
part.

The Metagov project is (I perceive) about moving towards participatory
governance, rather than trying to repair the representative model, now
that technology
allows us to supersede this. This reappraisal of governance is
contemporaneous with radical examinations of every other aspect of modern
life, from the interpersonal via the economic and the ecological to the
global.

We surely need to focus upon the integrated vision of creating a viable new
approach that encompasses all these dimensions. This is the larger process
of which Metagov represents a key part. The long term vision is absolutely
vital. Reforms, repairs and improvements can, should and will occur along
the way, but it is a strategic mistake to focus upon them. (I suggest that
those

BTW, at 50, despite the various aches and pains, I don't think of myself as
old yet! Young enough to expect to see a Global Transition&#8230;
