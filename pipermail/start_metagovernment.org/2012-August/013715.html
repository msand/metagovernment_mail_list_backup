Why? How can we assume that this selection is neutral and forms a common body 
to build consensus or even only a working democratical process on top of it? 
Sociology will tell us that the nation is ideology and that there are very 
different social levels involved. But even more: How do we know that this 
selection is even democratical itself? Have we voted upon it?

If I partition a contradictory society in different ways I will have different 
outcomes out of the same &quot;democratical&quot; processes even for a 50% majority rule 
(not for consent though!). The only real strength of the democratical process, 
a strength overseen in status-quo misdesigned processes, is its totality. If 
you are in a really democratical process, you trust that this process is good 
for you in general (total). Only few people really trust in &quot;democracy&quot; right 
now, how can we assume that the idea itself is appealing without showing 
participants how it is so? Why is breaking it down in the current form of 
segments a neutral first step?
