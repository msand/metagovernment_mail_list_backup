<PRE>Excellent! And so your proposal is that, in addition to attending to 
short term &quot;reforms, repairs, and improvements&quot;, we of the 
Metagovernment community *collaborate* in reaching *consensus* 
concerning an integrated long term vision that *synthesizes* our now 
very disparate and even competing individual visions. (Have I got that 
right?)

</I>&gt;<i> It is undeniable that many people in modern representative democracies 
</I>&gt;<i> are apathetic when faced with the degraded forms it currently takes. 
</I>&gt;<i> But there is good evidence that this degradation (including &quot;poor

</I>&gt;<i> whether or not we want to argue that it has been a historically 
</I>&gt;<i> inevitable stage.

</I>&gt;<i> aspect of modern life, from the interpersonal via the economic and the 
</I>&gt;<i> ecological to the global.

</I>&gt;<i> We surely need to focus upon the integrated vision of creating a 
</I>&gt;<i> viable new approach that encompasses all these dimensions. This is the
