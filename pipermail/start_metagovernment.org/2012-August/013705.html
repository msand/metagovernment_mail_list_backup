The aim is not to ruin their business, but the effect is. In order to make Facebook a free (as in freedom) place, it needs to have the corporate interest removed. But you do make an important nuanced distinction: we're not out to destroy Facebook, just to fundamentally change its nature.

However, I am still leery of relying on them to facilitate the process. Make a physical-world analogy. Imagine if Facebook also provided free access to physical meeting rooms (with billboards on the walls, I guess) in their headquarters building. Wouldn't they have the right to throw us out of a room for whatever reason they please? We're not paying them anything: they're just offering a free service to us.

For the above reasons, I'm still in favor of maintaining the central organization outside of FB. In catching up on my reading, I was reminded of this link Michael recently posted:

Is there any chance Votorola could be used just for pledging, or would that be a poor match of tool to purpose?
