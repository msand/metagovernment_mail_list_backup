<PRE>Hello Michael,

I do not claim do understand Votorola good enough to able to criticize 
the concept as such. My thoughts are more on the environment, in which 
Votorola is to take place.

And, instead of making an bold statements on where you are wrong, I 
prefer to state some questions. Answering them will either reveal the 
flaw or the righteousness of your concept (or lead to more questions). 
These are my questions:

Who is supposed to work with Votorola?
If it's for the common man: is Votorola simple enough for the common man 
to understand?
If it's for the common man: in how far is the use of Votorola rewarding?
How does Votorola provide transparency on how the results came about?
If it's for the common man: is that report simple enough for the common 
man to understand?

If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who can't handle 
a computer?
If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who refuse to 
put their trust in a computerized solution?

How does Votorola fit into the existing political process?
What changes to the existing political process are required to introduce 
Votorola?
Does Votorola require legal changes (changing the constitution)?

And the most important questions:
What does the roadmap for introducing Votorola look like?
How do you want to attract citizens and politicians towards Votorola?
Which are the mile stones from starting to universal acceptance?
How does the time line look like?

You don't necessarily have to answer these questions, although giving 
answers to all these questions may gain you trust in your solution. You 
might just use these questions as a check list.

Best regards
Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en

Ronald D. Grindle
