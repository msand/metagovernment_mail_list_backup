&#304;'m only making two assumptions: that the goal is to bring together
50% of fb shares, and that funds are not limited.

My point in the quoted paragraph is that the share price will
progressively increase as the 50% mark approaches.


&gt;<i> I think there is no way we can really predict what the market will do, and that we would just have to try it and see what happens.

</I>&gt;<i> They don't have a pure monopoly, as there are certainly other social networks out there. Also, it seems like they would have a good case for saying they don't have to support a group whose purpose is to ruin their business (American courts take profits very seriously).

</I>&gt;<i> Even if we did have a good case against them, they could still shut down the group. Our recourse would be to engage in a protracted legal battle against a horde of lawyers, which isn't really the point of the exercise.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I think about this, a petition wouldn't be quite right. We're not asking Facebook to do anything. The real tool we need is something where people can pledge funds. It would probably make sense to have a low cap on how much people can pledge, like $20 or maybe $100, so we don't get spammed with billion dollar pledges.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, we should be careful to follow the rules.  That group Ed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pointed to was shut down for breaking a rule.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty sure they can remove a group for no reason; as I understand it, groups are their property. They can also change their terms of use at any time.
