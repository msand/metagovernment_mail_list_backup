&gt;<i>  Hello Michael,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not claim do understand Votorola good enough to able to criticize the
</I>&gt;<i> concept as such. My thoughts are more on the environment, in which Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> is to take place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, instead of making an bold statements on where you are wrong, I prefer
</I>&gt;<i> to state some questions. Answering them will either reveal the flaw or the
</I>&gt;<i> righteousness of your concept (or lead to more questions). These are my
</I>&gt;<i> questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Who is supposed to work with Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
People


&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: is Votorola simple enough for the common man
</I>&gt;<i> to understand?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
in principle... yes!
in practice it depends on the user interface and if it's able to
communicate the concepts behind votorola (this is not the case yet)



&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: in how far is the use of Votorola rewarding?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
in principle... because it empowers people!
in practice it depends on the user interface and the &quot;gamification&quot; of the
consensus process that happens through it.


How does Votorola provide transparency on how the results came about?
&gt;<i>
</I>
everything is transparent and everyone could could analyze the whole
consensus tree.
it also has a decentralized structure and everyone could create its own
votorola community which connects to others through the mechanism of vote
mirroring, so everyone might join a community he or she trusts.


If it's for the common man: is that report simple enough for the common man
&gt;<i> to understand?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
yes, but in practice it again depends on the user interface!


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who can't handle a
</I>&gt;<i> computer?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
you dont!
how do you deal with those who cant write in a normal election?
how do you deal with those who dont know about the date the election takes
place?
they have relatives that could help those people.

the argument you are putting up here is: YOU MAY NOT USE THE INTERNET,
BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WILL NEVER USE IT!
1. These people will die out sooner or later
2. We are far from a situation where such systems might become the status
quo
3. these systems might be used in very different ways, even through pencil
and paper (where the table is a multitouch table...)

...so in the end it again is only a question of &quot;user interface design&quot; and
how you enable older people or so... to use the system.



&gt;<i> If it's for the common man: how do you deal with those, who refuse to put
</I>&gt;<i> their trust in a computerized solution?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
your argument is not legit!
people already trust computerized solutions for online banking, for
telephone calls, for hospitals and the machines that help sick people to
survive, and they also trust in a lot of other mechanisms.

how do you deal with people how dont trust the ballots in normal elections?
Did you ever watch a magician like DAVID COPPERFIELD make stuff disappear
in front of your eyes? So what in principal exactly makes the &quot;ballots in
normal elections&quot; more trustworthy than computerized elections?

RIGHT! ... NOTHING!

It all depends on transparency and maybe on decentralization, so that you
dont have a single point of failiure or so...
People accept it, because they've used to it and they've grown up with it.
They dont accept it because they know how it works exactly.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How does Votorola fit into the existing political process?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
That only time will tell....


What changes to the existing political process are required to introduce
&gt;<i> Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
no changes at all, or many changes. ...one cannot know how people will use
systems like votorola and how it will affect the current status quo, one
can only guess.



&gt;<i> Does Votorola require legal changes (changing the constitution)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
no.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the most important questions:
</I>&gt;<i> What does the roadmap for introducing Votorola look like?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
i think such a roadmap doesnt make sense.
its a grass roots approach and with a bit of luck, people will start using
it and eventually it goes viral and spreads.



&gt;<i> How do you want to attract citizens and politicians towards Votorola?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
we'll see. first find users to test, try to incorporate data that already
exists on other plattforms, ...it doesnt make sense to create a
&quot;masterplan&quot;.
it's one step after another and see whats possible and then try to do it.
give citizens who are willing to try it out a chance to give feedback, so
votorola can improve.


Which are the mile stones from starting to universal acceptance?
&gt;<i>
</I>
start with a mini beta, and evaluate the feedback it gives and improve
votorola.
But my opinion is: Always use &quot;Dynamic Steering&quot; instead of
&quot;Predict-and-Control&quot; approaches.

planning is important, but plans are a waste of time.



&gt;<i> How does the time line look like?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
most of the time a time line is a pretty useless thing :-)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You don't necessarily have to answer these questions, although giving
</I>&gt;<i> answers to all these questions may gain you trust in your solution. You
</I>&gt;<i> might just use these questions as a check list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
these questions are all plain wrong.
they dont give you any insight or any clue of the concept behind votorola.
