<PRE>Maybe, Pietro, you areright and the price will indeed go up. I see two 
motives for the FB-users to contribute money:

a) so they don't have to move to another network, because this would 
cost some time and energy
b) gratitude, respect and fairness towards the current FB-owners

Did I miss a motive?
Now the question is only: How much comes out of summarizing a) and b) 
across all users? If it is more than the current value of FB, then the 
price will go up.

For me personally though, a+b is less than $50 and if my evaluation is 
average, the price of FB will fall.

Speaking about fairness: I think, we should let the current FB-owners 
know, that we intend to buy FB or leave it. So they can decide for 
themselves if they want to bet on a rising or a falling price.

Pietro, I know you are quite activ in FB. Would a group be the way to 
go? How do people express their support, by becoming a member or by 
liking the group? Or are there other semi-democratic tools within FB 
which would be better?

Cheers,
Thomas

</I>&gt;<i> I agree on the last point (more below).  However the criterion is not

</I>&gt;<i> in the US, I think), but look at the relevant European law:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E102:EN:HTML">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E102:EN:HTML</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within
</I>&gt;<i>    the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be
</I>&gt;<i>    prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it
</I>&gt;<i>    may affect trade between Member States.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling
</I>&gt;<i>            prices or other unfair trading conditions;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the
</I>&gt;<i>            prejudice of consumers;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with
</I>&gt;<i>            other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive
</I>&gt;<i>            disadvantage;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the
</I>&gt;<i>            other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their
</I>&gt;<i>            nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with
</I>&gt;<i>            the subject of such contracts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And the corresponding Canadian law:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-50.html#h-34">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-50.html#h-34</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Prohibition where abuse of dominant position
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    79. (1) Where, on application by the Commissioner, the Tribunal
</I>&gt;<i>            finds that
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (a) one or more persons substantially or completely control,
</I>&gt;<i>            throughout Canada or any area thereof, a class or species of
</I>&gt;<i>            business,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (b) that person or those persons have engaged in or are engaging
</I>&gt;<i>            in a practice of anti-competitive acts, and
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>        (c) the practice has had, is having or is likely to have the
</I>&gt;<i>            effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially
</I>&gt;<i>            in a market,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>            the Tribunal may make an order prohibiting all or any of
</I>&gt;<i>            those persons from engaging in that practice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If our aim were to ruin Facebook's business, then true, we would not
</I>&gt;<i> have the law on our side.  But that is not our aim.  Thomas states it:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    I would like to use an open source alternative to Facebook.  Mainly
</I>&gt;<i>    because I don't want a huge company to mess with my data.  But since
</I>&gt;<i>    I can't convince my friends it doesn't work.  I guess, there is a
</I>&gt;<i>    &quot;network-effect&quot; where people go where the others already are and
</I>&gt;<i>    then they all stay there.  If this is true, open source alternatives
</I>&gt;<i>    will never have a chance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas is asking for choice.  Social publicity/promotion networks are
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;species of business&quot; that Facebook dominates and because of that
</I>&gt;<i> dominance there are no viable alternatives.  Thomas wants to fix that.
</I>&gt;<i> Am I reading you correctly, Thomas?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Facebook could argue that its users are not its customers.  Its real
</I>&gt;<i> customers are the buyers of ad space and its primary duty is to them.
</I>&gt;<i> But the users are nonetheless a party to the business and are bound by
</I>&gt;<i> contracts.  Where they cannot be bound, however, is in serving the
</I>&gt;<i> interests of the ad buyers (and shareholders) in having a captive user
</I>&gt;<i> base to milk.  That would be unfair and a clear abuse of dominance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Even if we did have a good case against them, they could still shut
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> down the group. Our recourse would be to engage in a protracted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legal battle against a horde of lawyers, which isn't really the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> point of the exercise.
</I>&gt;<i> It could be big news.  We could get a horde of lawyers of our own.  We
</I>&gt;<i> could also get the anti-trust regulators on our side.  They have a
</I>&gt;<i> long history of taking on giant firms (Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, IBM, GE,
</I>&gt;<i> Intel, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and winning.  Lots of publicity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But I think you're right to pour a little cold water on this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> talk.  We should not taunt Facebook.  We should follow the rules and
</I>&gt;<i> behave responsibly, and expect Facebook to do the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
