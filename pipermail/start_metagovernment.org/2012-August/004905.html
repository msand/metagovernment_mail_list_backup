</I>&gt;<i> question of time, right?
</I>
Yes, I think so.  The agreement will attract resources as it grows.
Those resources will open a path to action.  There's no telling what
path will open first, but the nearer it gets to opening the lower the
share price will fall, till purchasing Facebook itself becomes a path!
All of Facebook's capital is tied to the immobility of its users.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think a Facebook group makes sense, as it is just too beautiful

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, that is a real danger!
</I>
We might have anti-trust laws on our side.  Your initial post is clear
that the aim is to get around Facebook's monopoly.  As long as that
remains true, Facebook cannot arbitrarily shut down the group without
breaking the law.  They're allowed to have a monopoly, but not to
abuse it.  It would be a clear abuse to deprive the group of the use
of Facebook for the purpose of promotion and publicity, because it is
precisely here that Facebook has its monopoly.

&gt;<i> &gt; [...] So there should be an external petition such as on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.change.org/">http://www.change.org/</A> What I don't know is if it would be humanly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; workable to ask people to join a group and sign a petition. It's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the right approach, but asking for two clicks may be a pretty high
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; barrier.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe we can even use this danger for our purpose. Somehow write:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Let's see, how big we can grow, until facebook shuts us down and
</I>&gt;<i> thereby proves us right once more in our effort of making it open!
</I>&gt;<i> If that happens let's go here (external petition)!&quot;
</I>
In any case, we should be careful to follow the rules.  That group Ed
pointed to was shut down for breaking a rule.

It appears to have lots of lift capacity.  It should be possible to
float everyone's boat.
