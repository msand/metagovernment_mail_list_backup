<PRE>&#304; think the problem with this tactic is that as soon as the takeover bid is taken serious by the wallstreet market facebook shares in the market will actually increase in price. There will be a huge premium to pay if &quot;we&quot; are the ones that what to buy shares.

An alternative is to turn the tables on facebook shareholders. See what porsche tried to do with volkswagen:

&gt;<i>Porsche built up its stake in the much&#160;bigger VW through the use of stock options that allowed it to catch markets by surprise last year with the size of its holding.
</I><A HREF="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gY_UBiKMJ29Ueyq2L65mNzPsR-xQ">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gY_UBiKMJ29Ueyq2L65mNzPsR-xQ</A>

The bid failed in the end because of a perfect storm: porsche had to take out huge amounts of debt and then the financial crisis finished them off. Volkswagen now owns porsche.

&#304;f we can somehow without the knowledge of the markets and without raising awareness buy up facebook shares over the course of a couple of years we can corner the markets. &#304; think it&#39;s safe to assume there are currently a LOT of short contracts on facebook shares.

&#304;n these contracts a speculators speculates that the price of facebook shares will drop by at the latest a certain date in the future. How does it work?

The speculator &quot;borrows&quot; facebook shares from institutional investors (these people are in for the long run). The owner of the shares get a premium. The soeculator then sells the facebook shares. His objective now is to buy back the same amount of facebook shares at a later date for a lower. Once the facebook shares have been re-acquired the speculator hands over the shares back to the owner and - hopefully for the soeculator - makes a killing.

What happened in the case of vw is that porsche was buying vw shares behind the scenes (i don&#39;t know how they managed to hide their intentions from the market but somehow they did).

This was actually a very costly operation for porsche because over the years the shareprice for vw remained higher than it should have been.

Then suddenly they announced they had acquired a majority stakes in vw. Other speculator at this point went into full panic mode and a buying frenzy started. As the article states, for one day vw became the most valuable company on the planet.

This in my opinion is the only way to acquire facebook. &#304; don&#39;t know if it is at all feasable in an open democracy community.
