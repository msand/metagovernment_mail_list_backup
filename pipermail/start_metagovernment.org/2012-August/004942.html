Subject: Using deliberation to inform voters
To: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">NCDD-DISCUSSION at LISTS.THATAWAY.ORG</A>

Hi NCDD Community,

Regarding the theme of the upcoming conference, I think one aspect of civic infrastructure needing more attention is voting, the basic tool of democracy.  Many voters are not well informed due to a lack of time, interest or background.  It&#8217;s difficult for even engaged, well-educated voters to fully understand all the issues.  The potential for deliberative processes to provide information to voters has been demonstrated by the Citizens&#8217; Initiative Review in Oregon and the &#8220;What&#8217;s Next California&#8221; deliberative poll.  Other than these projects, I haven&#8217;t noticed any discussion of using the results of deliberations to inform voters.  I think the potential and the need is tremendous.  Voters can take advantage of the study and deliberation by other citizens to make more informed decisions.  If voters have better sources of information, possibly the influence of money in campaigns would be decreased.

Information for voters on ballot issues and candidates is currently supplied by the media and several organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, Project Vote Smart, MapLight and California Choices.  These organizations provide a valuable service, but deliberation results would give voters additional types of information.

A promising website currently under development, PollVault.com, will use Facebook to show users the ballot recommendations of ten advisors selected by the user.  The advisors currently shown on the site are mainly newspapers and advocacy groups.  I presume users will be able to add other advisors to their list.  This type of system could be used to deliver the results of election issue deliberations to voters.  

I&#8217;m hoping NCDD members will use their creativity to develop some innovative methods to inform voters.  Are there any projects in the works?  What do you think of the potential?

Henry Williams
