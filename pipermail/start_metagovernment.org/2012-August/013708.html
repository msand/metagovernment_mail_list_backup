No. There use to be a service where people could not just join, but
also pledge to put some money for a service.

&gt;<i> How do people express their support, by becoming a member or by liking the group?
</I>
You become a member of a &quot;group&quot; or you like a &quot;page&quot;. If you want
people to discuss you need a group. If you want to get an application
running you need a page (like we did for Vilfredo).

&gt;<i> Or are there other semi-democratic tools within FB which would be better?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not that I know of.

Thomas, please, this would not work.

It's like you are asking to turn your face fast enough to bite your
own ear. As soon as you express that kind of interest for Facebook
stocks the stocks will go up, and you will need more and more money.
The only reason why someone economically savvy would do this is to
&quot;pretend&quot; they wanted to buy stocks, buy them, have everybody buy them
as well, then sell his part when they are valued much more than they
are worth, and just keep the cash, while facebook value collapses.
This is NOT the way to go snatch a company.
