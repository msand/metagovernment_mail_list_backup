I agree on the last point (more below).  However the criterion is not
a pure monopoly, but a &quot;dominant position&quot;.  The Sherman Act is hard
to quote on this because of its age (case law and jurisprudence rule
in the US, I think), but look at the relevant European law:
<A HREF="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E102:EN:HTML">http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:12008E102:EN:HTML</A>

  Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within
  the internal market or in a substantial part of it shall be
  prohibited as incompatible with the internal market in so far as it
  may affect trade between Member States.

  Such abuse may, in particular, consist in:

      (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling
          prices or other unfair trading conditions;

      (b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the
          prejudice of consumers;

      (c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with
          other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive
          disadvantage;

      (d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the
          other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their
          nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with
          the subject of such contracts.

And the corresponding Canadian law:
<A HREF="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-50.html#h-34">http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-34/page-50.html#h-34</A>

  Prohibition where abuse of dominant position

  79. (1) Where, on application by the Commissioner, the Tribunal
          finds that

      (a) one or more persons substantially or completely control,
          throughout Canada or any area thereof, a class or species of
          business,

      (b) that person or those persons have engaged in or are engaging
          in a practice of anti-competitive acts, and

      (c) the practice has had, is having or is likely to have the
          effect of preventing or lessening competition substantially
          in a market,

          the Tribunal may make an order prohibiting all or any of
          those persons from engaging in that practice.

If our aim were to ruin Facebook's business, then true, we would not
have the law on our side.  But that is not our aim.  Thomas states it:

  I would like to use an open source alternative to Facebook.  Mainly
  because I don't want a huge company to mess with my data.  But since
  I can't convince my friends it doesn't work.  I guess, there is a
  &quot;network-effect&quot; where people go where the others already are and
  then they all stay there.  If this is true, open source alternatives
  will never have a chance.

Thomas is asking for choice.  Social publicity/promotion networks are
a &quot;species of business&quot; that Facebook dominates and because of that
dominance there are no viable alternatives.  Thomas wants to fix that.
Am I reading you correctly, Thomas?

Facebook could argue that its users are not its customers.  Its real
customers are the buyers of ad space and its primary duty is to them.
But the users are nonetheless a party to the business and are bound by
contracts.  Where they cannot be bound, however, is in serving the
interests of the ad buyers (and shareholders) in having a captive user
base to milk.  That would be unfair and a clear abuse of dominance.

&gt;<i> Even if we did have a good case against them, they could still shut
</I>&gt;<i> down the group. Our recourse would be to engage in a protracted
</I>&gt;<i> legal battle against a horde of lawyers, which isn't really the
</I>&gt;<i> point of the exercise.
</I>
It could be big news.  We could get a horde of lawyers of our own.  We
could also get the anti-trust regulators on our side.  They have a
long history of taking on giant firms (Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, IBM, GE,
Intel, Microsoft, Google, Apple) and winning.  Lots of publicity.

But I think you're right to pour a little cold water on this kind of
talk.  We should not taunt Facebook.  We should follow the rules and
behave responsibly, and expect Facebook to do the same.

</I>&gt;<i> As I think about this, a petition wouldn't be quite right. We're not asking Facebook to do anything. The real tool we need is something where people can pledge funds. It would probably make sense to have a low cap on how much people can pledge, like $20 or maybe $100, so we don't get spammed with billion dollar pledges.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In any case, we should be careful to follow the rules.  That group Ed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointed to was shut down for breaking a rule.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am pretty sure they can remove a group for no reason; as I understand it, groups are their property. They can also change their terms of use at any time.
