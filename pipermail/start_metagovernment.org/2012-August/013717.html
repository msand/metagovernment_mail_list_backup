<PRE>Ed and Pietro,

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> However, I am still leery of relying on them to facilitate the
</I>&gt;<i> process. Make a physical-world analogy. Imagine if Facebook also
</I>&gt;<i> provided free access to physical meeting rooms (with billboards on
</I>&gt;<i> the walls, I guess) in their headquarters building. Wouldn't they
</I>&gt;<i> have the right to throw us out of a room for whatever reason they
</I>&gt;<i> please? We're not paying them anything: they're just offering a free
</I>&gt;<i> service to us.
</I>
A monopoly (or dominance) in the provision of such rooms would make it
illegal to throw people out in order to protect the monopoly.  They'd
need some other reason, as I think their counsels would tell them.

There are technical reasons, however, why the effort could not be
contained primarily within Facebook.  Facebook is a specialized medium
for the purpose of publicity, but more than publicity is needed to
succeed.  So I think the effort would have to spread to other social
media, which would be used *as tools*.

Also other social media have monopolies (or dominances) too.  So the
effort would naturally spread to them *as targets*.  Again this would
lessen the dependence on Facebook.

With all this spreading across varied media, we might expect the
primary coordinating foci to be located external to them all, on some
kind of neutral ground, which might be exactly what you are proposing.

&gt;<i> For the above reasons, I'm still in favor of maintaining the central
</I>&gt;<i> organization outside of FB. In catching up on my reading, I was
</I>&gt;<i> reminded of this link Michael recently posted:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Category:Account">http://zelea.com/w/Category:Account</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Is there any chance Votorola could be used just for pledging, or
</I>&gt;<i> would that be a poor match of tool to purpose?
</I>
We call it the RAC (resource accounting framework).  It's designed for
exactly this purpose.  Conseo wanted a haven outside the traditional
economy where people could aggregate resources, such as labour and
money, for projects they agree with.  The RAC is only design I know of
that marries this aggregation with that of assent (consensus making),
and exactly this marriage is required for what Thomas proposes.

Votorola's implementation of the RAC is only partially complete, so
we'd have to work on it.  But the RAC is not specific to Votorola;
it's an open framework and other projects are free to implement it.
The user could then pledge using whatever toolset he/she prefers.

Pietro Speroni di Fenizio said:
&gt;<i> As soon as you express that kind of interest for Facebook stocks the
</I>&gt;<i> stocks will go up, and you will need more and more money.  ... have
</I>&gt;<i> you done a back of the envelope calculations to see how much money
</I>&gt;<i> you would need to raise at current market conditions?  ... The
</I>&gt;<i> higher this number is the more probable is that it will not succeed
</I>&gt;<i> and all you generate is a bubble.
</I>
It's something of a red herring, because purchasing Facebook on the
market is not central to Thomas's proposal.  The proposal is to build
consensus on changing Facebook, such as giving users access and
control of their own data as Thomas mentions, or eliminating ads as Ed
mentions, or, failing these changes, to move *en masse* to an
alternative network.  That's the core of the proposal.

It just happens that eliminating the ads or moving to another network
would destroy $50,000,000,000 in capital investment (according to Ed's
numbers), as Facebook's market price would plummet to the value of its
saleable assets.  At the very moment of success, therefore, the users
might start buying shares cheaply if they wished, eventually turning
Facebook (by then a shadow of its former self) into some kind of
producer cooperative.  But this would be just a lark, as it would be
of little value to them by this time, as they would effectively have
such a cooperative already.

Yes, it stands solid.  It's a beautiful idea!
