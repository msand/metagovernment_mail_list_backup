<PRE>Frank,

forgive me, if I do not take the time now to understand your concept. My 
response therefore might ignore some of the things you have already 
solved or misinterpret some facts. My thoughts:

In the &quot;Architecture for Democracy 2.0&quot; the &quot;Opinion Forming&quot;, as I call 
it, is a continuous process, that takes place in a separate section of 
the system/process and has its own voting, including tracking and 
statistics. Once the Opinion Forming shows signs of maturity it is then 
passed on to the &quot;Decision Forming&quot; process, which would, as I 
understand it, be e.g. processed by &quot;Open Assembly&quot; (in my concept a 
physical presence meeting).

As a new feature within the Decision Forming the voters, instead of only 
being able to agree or reject, can select from a list of choices, that 
is prepared by a board from the results worked out in the Opinion 
Forming process. One of the choices is &quot;Cannot decide&quot;, which gives the 
voter the opportunity to express, that they wish to carry on with the 
discussion, instead of making a final decisions.

Could that be a solution to the problems you faced?

Some comments:

&quot;For instance many of the concepts brought over to Open Assembly had a 
long history and users had a pre-defined notion of their opinion which 
often did not change, as they were already educated on that specific issue.&quot;
That's very much human nature. Once people spend a lot of energy on 
something, they have a hard time letting it go. The voting in the 
&quot;Opinion Forming&quot; process, plus the comments would give them the 
feedback, either approving their concept or motivate them to change it.

&quot;So for such a structure to work it must be individual and personalized. 
This means that employing some level of machine learning is necessary, 
or else users will quickly become disengaged from the inability to 
actually express their preference.&quot;
I'm not sure if I understood you right, especially that machine learning 
thing. In my concept the &quot;Opinion Forming&quot; is handled in the EIPW, which 
is similar to Facebook, with a personal section, called &quot;The Profile&quot;. 
And it's just as easy to handle as Facebook.

Best regards

Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en

</I>&gt;<i> Open Assembly employed a similar system with a phased system. First

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It allows comrade citizens to prepare information on an issue and
</I>&gt;<i>     offer a recommendation how to vote  to the other citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The english translation of the concept should be available soon.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Hi NCDD Community,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Regarding the theme of the upcoming conference, I think one aspect of civic infrastructure needing more attention is voting, the basic tool of democracy.  Many voters are not well informed due to a lack of time, interest or background.  It's difficult for even engaged, well-educated voters to fully understand all the issues.  The potential for deliberative processes to provide information to voters has been demonstrated by the Citizens' Initiative Review in Oregon and the &quot;What's Next California&quot; deliberative poll.  Other than these projects, I haven't noticed any discussion of using the results of deliberations to inform voters.  I think the potential and the need is tremendous.  Voters can take advantage of the study and deliberation by other citizens to make more informed decisions.  If voters have better sources of information, possibly the influence of money in campaigns would be decreased.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Information for voters on ballot issues and candidates is currently supplied by the media and several organizations, such as the League of Women Voters, Project Vote Smart, MapLight and California Choices.  These organizations provide a valuable service, but deliberation results would give voters additional types of information.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     A promising website currently under development, PollVault.com, will use Facebook to show users the ballot recommendations of ten advisors selected by the user.  The advisors currently shown on the site are mainly newspapers and advocacy groups.  I presume users will be able to add other advisors to their list.  This type of system could be used to deliver the results of election issue deliberations to voters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     I'm hoping NCDD members will use their creativity to develop some innovative methods to inform voters.  Are there any projects in the works?  What do you think of the potential?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
