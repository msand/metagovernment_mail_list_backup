<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Beautiful!  Please count Votorola in.

&gt;<i> This is interesting, but I do not yet see the overlap. My impression
</I>&gt;<i> of Votorola is of a ground-up tool for liquid democracy, while my
</I>&gt;<i> first impression of EveryVote is of an overlay on election-style
</I>&gt;<i> voting. To me, these seem somewhat incompatible (or at least very
</I>&gt;<i> differently-focused), so please clarify where I'm getting it wrong.
</I>
I think I can answer this one (if I understand).  In technical terms,
we care about the formal object (purpose) of the vote, but not that of
the vote-server.  So if the user's object in casting the vote is to
express an opinion on who should be president of Russia, then that
must not be changed when the vote is copied to other servers.  But the
administrator's wider object in providing the voting service need not
(and should not) be taken into account.  Even if it were run by United
Russia for the purpose of undermining free expression and shoring up
authoritarian rule (something we're all opposed to), then still we
ought to copy the votes of its users and express them as faithfully as
possible.  Otherwise the ultimate purpose of the voting network itself
(actionable consensus, counter-monoply) would be undermined.

This might be too extreme an example.  It might not be safe to attempt
this in Russia.  But if anyone did, then I think even there a strategy
of blind impartiality is the best hope of success.

&gt;<i> &gt; When can we get started?  Do you have a vote database running yet?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And yes, I'd be interested to know your level of development. If you
</I>&gt;<i> haven't started on the issue voting aspect, I get the impression
</I>&gt;<i> that NationBuilder might be compatible with your design.
