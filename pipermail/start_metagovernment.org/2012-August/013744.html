Have you explained them elsewhere?  Please share.  If Votorola has
conceptual flaws, then we need to address them ASAP.

&gt;<i> Hello Alex,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not visionary and it was 
</I>&gt;<i> never meant to be.  I'm an old man (51) and I don't want to spend the 
</I>&gt;<i> rest of my life within a lousy political system, while dreaming of a 
</I>&gt;<i> better world.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can be applied 
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I made so far with conventional 
</I>&gt;<i> parties. It is the attempt to correct the existing concepts for the 
</I>&gt;<i> better, it's an evolution, not a revolution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that people are 
</I>&gt;<i> willing to participate in the political process. This is not the case. 
</I>&gt;<i> Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized in political 
</I>&gt;<i> parties in Germany. And even among those 5 million only a minority is 
</I>&gt;<i> actually actively involved in the political process. I therefore come to 
</I>&gt;<i> the conclusion that the majority of voters are not willing to contribute 
</I>&gt;<i> the required effort of time and energy, to participate in the political 
</I>&gt;<i> process. But if only a minority is driving the political process, a 
</I>&gt;<i> system like VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship of the active, just 
</I>&gt;<i> like we currently have with our conventional parties. (The concept of 
</I>&gt;<i> VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more flaws, which I will not 
</I>&gt;<i> explain here).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is also the key to the understanding of my concept: the voters are 
</I>&gt;<i> not dissatisfied with the political system as a whole. They are in 
</I>&gt;<i> principal content with the concept of &quot;politics as a service&quot;. The 
</I>&gt;<i> voters are discontent with the outcome of our politics in detail and 
</I>&gt;<i> that again is due to the lack of communication between politician and 
</I>&gt;<i> voters. My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> . . .
</I>
