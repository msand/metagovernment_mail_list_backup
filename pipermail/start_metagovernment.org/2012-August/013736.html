<PRE>Hello Alex,

thanks for your response. Yes, the concept is not visionary and it was 
never meant to be.  I'm an old man (51) and I don't want to spend the 
rest of my life within a lousy political system, while dreaming of a 
better world.

My concept is meant to be a practical approach, which can be applied 
tomorrow. It is based on the experiences I made so far with conventional 
parties. It is the attempt to correct the existing concepts for the 
better, it's an evolution, not a revolution.

In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that people are 
willing to participate in the political process. This is not the case. 
Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized in political 
parties in Germany. And even among those 5 million only a minority is 
actually actively involved in the political process. I therefore come to 
the conclusion that the majority of voters are not willing to contribute 
the required effort of time and energy, to participate in the political 
process. But if only a minority is driving the political process, a 
system like VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship of the active, just 
like we currently have with our conventional parties. (The concept of 
VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more flaws, which I will not 
explain here).

This is also the key to the understanding of my concept: the voters are 
not dissatisfied with the political system as a whole. They are in 
principal content with the concept of &quot;politics as a service&quot;. The 
voters are discontent with the outcome of our politics in detail and 
that again is due to the lack of communication between politician and 
voters. My concept tries to overcome this communicational gap.

Let me comment some of your statements:

&quot;It's about parties, not about grass roots democracy ...&quot; Yes, concept 
speaks of a party and that is for a simple reason: German laws allows us 
to organize ourselves in any fashion WITHIN a party. Establishing grass 
roots democracy on the level of our constitution requires a 60% majority 
in parliament, that's a long way to go and, like I said, I would 
preferably see things happen in my lifetime.

I also do not see the need for parties any more, in my concept you will 
find a section where I speak of the party, that is founded to overcome 
all parties.

&quot;... not about grass roots democracy , but that's what metagovernment is 
all about.&quot; I do hope that this forum is not dogmatic, but open to any 
idea, that helps to improve our democracies.

I do claim, that my concept is in fact about grass roots democracy. But 
it's not about straight forward grass roots democracy, it's a hybrid of 
conventional politics and grass roots democracy. The compromise is 
solely made to make it work.

&quot;I dont know where to start.
it has a board, why do you need a board?
What kind of board? A board of elected politicians? Do you really think 
it's them who write the laws today?
Do you really think that the crowd is not able to do that by itself?
It has staffs and staff managers? WTF?!? :-)&quot;

I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by themselves, I think 
that the majority just don't WANT to make the effort. The majority of 
voters prefer politics as a service. And I'm not sure if you have an 
idea of the huge amount of work we are talking about. A Swedish 
Anarchist from the 1920s described her utopia as follows &quot;people go to 
work in the factories for four hours. After the lunch break, they go to 
work in parliament for another four hours&quot;. That is, I think, a 
realistic scenario of a grass root democracy. Are you willing to spend 4 
hours a day on politics?

I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does the job for me, 
just like I do not fix my car by myself. But I want more and better 
control over what he does and I want more and better communication with 
him. That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where &quot;light&quot; 
stands for &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.

&quot;It has a &quot;party mass&quot;, but shouldn't that be a private thing? Everyone 
should do as he pleases, and if people want to meet, they could...&quot; (I'm 
not sure what you are referring to as &quot;party mass&quot;). Of course everyone 
can do as he pleases, have their own private meetings and attend 
whatever event they want to (see &quot;Individual Level of Participation&quot;). 
The concept only speaks of the services that I think the organization 
should offer, to improve communication. The concept of the party fair 
is, by the way , a counter proposal to the German &quot;Parteitag&quot;, a very 
undemocratic event, that is mandatory for German parties.

&quot;... it should develop and host the EIPW, but as its such an important 
tool, it should be open source and not bound to a comittee to foster 
development.&quot; As the concepts states, the tool is, in fact, open source, 
and it is owned by an independent organisation, the eipw.org. If you 
ever worked in an Open Source project, then you have experienced, that 
there always is some dirty work, no-one likes to do. Besides taking care 
of that, changing the EIPW must be a democratic process and that process 
in turn has to be managed.

&quot;Compared to what is reality today, your proposal is visionary, but even 
compared to the internal processes of the pirate party and their &quot;liquid 
feedback 2.0&quot;-system, i'm not sure if you could still call EIPW 
visionary.&quot; When I started thinking about my concept the pirate party 
and their &quot;liquid feedback 2.0 was not visible to me. By the time they 
emerged into my sight I found a couple of flaws and shortcomings in 
their concept. Otherwise I would have trashed my concept and joined them.
I see the pirates party's approach, beside my concept,  so far as the 
only serious attempt in Germany to really change the political process. 
But, unfortunately, for me the gaps their concept is leaving are too big 
for me.

&quot;I think your goals are not ambitious enough and some of your goals 
cannot be reached with such a conservative approach as you layed out.&quot; 
Like I said before, I am aiming to be evolutionary, not revolutionary. 
That's one of the major flaws of the pirate party: they are leaving 
people like my grandmother behind. They are also voters, that need to be 
included in the democratic process. Should my concept ever be applied, I 
expect it to evolve further. I do not expect it to be the final answer, 
but rather a piece of the path that leads into the future.

This conversation started with the proposal to use the EIPW instead of 
buying out Facebook. You could just do that and ignore the rest.

But if you think about the political process as whole, if you think 
&quot;once we have this result, what comes next?&quot; and especially when you 
think of something, that is meant to be realistic enough to actually 
materialise in the real world I am sure you will come to similar 
conclusions as I did, or maybe an even better solution!

Best regards
Mit freundlichen Gr&#252;&#223;en
