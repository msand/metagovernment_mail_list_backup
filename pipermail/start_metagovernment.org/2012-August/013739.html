&gt;<i> In my eyes VOTOROLA has one big mistake: it assumes that people are willing to participate in the political process. This is not the case. Of more than 60 million voters only 5 million are organized in political parties in Germany. And even among those 5 million only a minority is actually actively involved in the political process. I therefore come to the conclusion that the majority of voters are not willing to contribute the required effort of time and energy, to participate in the political process. But if only a minority is driving the political process, a system like VOTOROLA only leads to a dictatorship of the active, just like we currently have with our conventional parties. (The concept of VOTOROLA has, in my opinion, a couple more flaws, which I will not explain here).
</I>&gt;<i> [snip]
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that the crowd is not able to do it by themselves, I think that the majority just don't WANT to make the effort. The majority of voters prefer politics as a service. And I'm not sure if you have an idea of the huge amount of work we are talking about. A Swedish Anarchist from the 1920s described her utopia as follows &quot;people go to work in the factories for four hours. After the lunch break, they go to work in parliament for another four hours&quot;. That is, I think, a realistic scenario of a grass root democracy. Are you willing to spend 4 hours a day on politics?

</I>&gt;<i> I prefer to vote for, and pay, a specialist, that does the job for me, just like I do not fix my car by myself. But I want more and better control over what he does and I want more and better communication with him. That is what I call &quot;grass root democracy light&quot;, where &quot;light&quot; stands for &quot;bearable for the average citizen&quot;.

Hello, Ronald. I've excerpted a couple of passages where you suggest, basically, that the citizens are too apathetic to be trusted with their own governance. The belief among many of us here is that this is mistaking a symptom for a disease.

I believe that people are apathetic because their opinions have no effect. What use is being politically engaged when the politicians are just going to do whatever (corrupt) thing they want anyway? If people knew that their opinions could directly and visibly influence policy, they would have a different level of engagement in the process.

Additionally, I think it is a serious mistake to think that everyone must participate in everything. If we boil all governance decisions down to &quot;which party should rule?&quot; or &quot;which politician should rule?&quot; why yes, we might hope that people would participate heavily in that decision (except that they won't because of the reason above).

If instead we ask every governance decision separately, and have people deliberate and vote on everything, then we don't need universal participation on anything. Here in the United States, I don't care what kind of paving surface is used on a road in a Dusseldorf suburb. Why should I vote on that? However, if it comes to my attention that the community there is deciding to use a substance that can only be harvested by causing the extinction of a key species, then I might suddenly want a voice in that decision. With a collaborative governance system, I could immediately jump in and have a significant effect on the decision. That is what we mean by participation: not mandatory participation in everything. Just the ability to participate in anything.
