</I>&gt;<i> You guys are way beyond me with the techno talk.
</I>&gt;<i> ,,,and maybe I am way off topic as I understood the subject line. However, just an idea a bit more general to the objective of rapid transformation: perhaps beginning with a very realistic virtual &quot;global game&quot; of democracy, or 'building a world', using today's circumstances and allowing each player but one voice, and more weight given to &quot;voices&quot; of affected regions, equal voice on global issues.
</I>
Why build a game when it'd probably easier just to build a functioning system?

&gt;<i> The objective is for a social transition, and one that can outpace and stifle that of consumerism and all that entails.
</I>&gt;<i>         With a game that is well built, as freeware, and whatever else to make it accessible and seamless and building first from major issues and the choices and the consequences of those linked; it could become an educational tool - certainly a few steps up from the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot;.
</I>
Problem is, government is boring.  And really slow.  If we could make
it fun, or at least mildly entertaining, we'd have a *huge* head start
on adoption.  But IMHO we're going to have to rely mostly on other
types of incentives, like civic duty, or maybe fear of being left out
or of loss of control (e.g., if everyone else is expressing their
opinions on this new system, maybe I'd better too), or some promise
that their taxes will go down or government reliability will go way
up.

&gt;<i>         For voter ID (player registration), a fingerprint(s)(not quite ready for general access to this yet part yet, but it's there on some keyboards), (taken at birth - moment of registration obviously to begin). registers only print and location (city, county...), no name, no address. (gender equality in anonymity)
</I>&gt;<i> ....just an idea; not sure if relevant to your discussion, so my apologies for interrupting if so,
</I>
I'm also not concerned about this level of authentication or even
people hacking the system.  My position is just that we need to have
some (and really any) way of verifying that person X exists and don't
really have to worry about whether person X really created or is using
account X.  This will cut out about 99% of the fraud and virtually all
of the systematic and long-term fraud because when person X finally
gets around to creating an account and finds that there's already one
in their name with a voting record, well, we've got a target that the
police would go and find (or, until such time as the new system
actually has control of the police, some group like Anonymous might
find the issue very interesting). Validating identification of the
real person X would be a hell of a lot easier than what people have to
go through to fix any other sort of identity theft (rather than having
to fix *everything*, they'd only have to supply one bit of uncorrupted
data (bank accounts, credit cards, drivers license numbers, pulling a
credit report and asking a few questions about credit history, etc.)
