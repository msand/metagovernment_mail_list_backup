<PRE>This concept is about evolution, I am not here to defend all the 
possible ways how it can develop. This is like challenging &quot;creator&quot; who 
just came with evolution, that it will fail because of this or that.

     Kind regards
         Michael

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> There is plenty of free hostings or you can start your hosting and host
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> these tiny amounts of data for those who do not know how to work with free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hosting.
</I>&gt;<i> So, no standardizing and everyone gets to learn a different system

</I>&gt;<i> course this means that the &quot;free&quot; services will have advertising on
</I>&gt;<i> them:  Sure you want a form of government where to &quot;vote&quot; you have to
</I>&gt;<i> ignore the ads on your page suggesting you vote a certain way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The rest is evolutionary. At the start some standards will probably
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> emerge,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> later aggregation methods and pages, verification projects,...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What format is the data in?  There's a zillion different ways to say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I think the US should change the nature of it's relationship with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Cuba&quot;, how do you aggregate all of those?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You may start with a text file if you need an example.  Write it in some way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that can be desirably aggregated, maybe you will start a new standard.
</I>&gt;<i> A standard format would seem to me to be a requirement.  Some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> XML would seem appropriate.  Now are people going to have to learn
</I>&gt;<i> this format and mark up their text properly (and then run an app to
</I>&gt;<i> check it), or will there be apps that create the data in the correct
</I>&gt;<i> format?  Who writes these apps, and are they tied to the data hosting
</I>&gt;<i> service, or independent?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Would you like to try it ? It would be very helpful for recognizing our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinions. You can also reuse the data in other projects. It is all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized......
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more importantly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so even if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you happen to check periodically to verify what the system thinks is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I believe a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to prevent every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is credible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even detect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hackers.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How could you know this ? I will not be peer to peer probably, I expect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> server to server. IMHO you have quick judgement.
</I>&gt;<i> What you're describing *is* peer to peer (i.e., if a central authority
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't control the servers, it's P2P, even if the peers are servers).
</I>&gt;<i> And this is not something I couldn't know, or that requires quick
</I>&gt;<i> judgement: I've been dealing with UNIX and networked systems for 35
</I>&gt;<i> years now, and yet am still regularly surprised (and disappointed) by
</I>&gt;<i> how often (and how easily) they get hacked.  Which leads to my expert
</I>&gt;<i> opinion being that a system that relies exclusively on security to
</I>&gt;<i> *prevent* hacking is unworkable, as is one that lacks a reliable way
</I>&gt;<i> for people to check the outputs.  Still, we ought to design it to be
</I>&gt;<i> as hack-proof as possible, if only to improve efficiency, which means
</I>&gt;<i> P2P is probably out as an architecture unless there is some sudden
</I>&gt;<i> breakthrough in that technology in the next few years...
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
