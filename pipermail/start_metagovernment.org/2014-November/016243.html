This is not making too much sense ;-)

&gt;<i> Was there actually an agreed on goal of some sort when we did the home page
</I>&gt;<i> game?  I suspect not.  But maybe specifying the requirements interview
</I>&gt;<i> questions boilerplate would generate in a backdoor direction thoughts about
</I>&gt;<i> goals and generate a partioning of the group along requirements.
</I>
We seem to frequently run into the problem that the policies that were
set up in the past no longer seem to reflect the opinions of the
current active users, and there's no way to change them because of
some sort of catch-22.

&gt;<i> Note that requirements can have an impossibility for an organization.  This
</I>&gt;<i> does not mean the requirements are impossible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a requirement issue Scott and I wanted to butt heads over, but i did
</I>&gt;<i> not want to play:  ownership and licensing of software and media.
</I>
I don't recall this, though I guess I do recall you not wanting to
play on a few occasions ;-)

&gt;<i> On licensing, i will not easily tolerate Alfredo and as I recall that was
</I>&gt;<i> all Scott would accept.
</I>
Wasn't me:  I'm up for anything.  Or at least anything organized (I'll
pass on &quot;Hey, everybody edit the Wiki!&quot; kinds of directives).

&gt;<i> The issue here is who makes money.
</I>&gt;<i> I propose that any software license for software used in this group be
</I>&gt;<i> distributed and under one of the big five Open Software Initiative approved
</I>&gt;<i> licenses.
</I>
I'd go even farther than that: IMHO *any* sort of commercial
exploitation is fundamentally incompatible with the goal of replacing
our existing governments.  There are just too many moral quandaries to
deal with if you have to balance the two needs.  So IMHO &quot;Open Source&quot;
is only part of what we'll need to require.  Things like Loomio are
harmless (and sometimes even useful) in the short term, but they
aren't part of the true future system.

&gt;<i> This need to be expanded in a techie way to cover details.  i will go with
</I>&gt;<i> RMS and say that any cores used on a FPGA is software.  Most all text and
</I>&gt;<i> images, except for logos, need to be under a Creative Commons &quot;free culture&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> license.  CC0 might be best but Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
</I>&gt;<i> could be used with care.
</I>&gt;<i> Are you into TL; DR yet?
</I>
Not me!

&gt;<i> The above might be the specification to a requirement that everyone has
</I>&gt;<i> access to all of the software and media and can largely do as they like with
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Agreed.  Forking has always got to be allowed, at least of the guts of
the system.  How acquired data gets shared is another matter...

&gt;<i> It does not touch directly major schisms in the FOSS tech community. And
</I>&gt;<i> these schisms will directly affect the creation of a community of developers
</I>&gt;<i> and users.
</I>
The politics of organizing the new system are going to be interesting.
While I like using open source software, I'm really not a big fan of
how these packages get developed, what with lots of squabbling and no
one being able to define even something as fundamental as a feature
set.  But if my philosophy above sticks, there will be one huge
difference between this one any almost all other open source packages
in that one of the influences won't be corporate needs, though that
unfortunately also means there won't be any on-loan corporate
developers pitching in to help...
