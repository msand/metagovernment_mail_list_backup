</I>You guys are way beyond me with the techno talk. 
,,,and maybe I am way off topic as I understood the subject line. However, just an idea a bit more general to the objective of rapid transformation: perhaps beginning with a very realistic virtual &quot;global game&quot; of democracy, or 'building a world', using today's circumstances and allowing each player but one voice, and more weight given to &quot;voices&quot; of affected regions, equal voice on global issues. 
The objective is for a social transition, and one that can outpace and stifle that of consumerism and all that entails. 
	With a game that is well built, as freeware, and whatever else to make it accessible and seamless and building first from major issues and the choices and the consequences of those linked; it could become an educational tool - certainly a few steps up from the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot;.
	For voter ID (player registration), a fingerprint(s)(not quite ready for general access to this yet part yet, but it's there on some keyboards), (taken at birth - moment of registration obviously to begin). registers only print and location (city, county...), no name, no address. (gender equality in anonymity)
....just an idea; not sure if relevant to your discussion, so my apologies for interrupting if so,
JPierre
