However, just an idea a bit more general to the objective of rapid transformation: perhaps beginning with a very realistic virtual &quot;global game&quot; of democracy, or 'building a world', using today's circumstances and allowing each player but one voice, and more weight given to &quot;voices&quot; of affected regions, equal voice on global issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Why build a game when it'd probably easier just to build a functioning system?
</I>By all means - so if you have an easier process that can gain popularity and credibility faster, then I'm all for it.
	 Correct me if I'm wrong: My understanding is that as a society, globally, we need to begin making some serious decisions as to the fate of our planet and (e)quality of life. We need more than just an evolution, we need a transformation. We have evolved, and now unless our common and global course is altered, we then devolve. 
	The game in question is meant to give voice to anyone, on issues anywhere (because 'issues' are everywhere), not by 'voting' for a candidate, but rather 'voting' on the issues, and they could 'vote' on any issues wherever they presently are, and/or on issues at place of origin. (In this case I use 'voting' as having a voice, but also voice can be as blogs on the issues....perhaps credits to the weight of a 'vote' acquired from discussions...all on-line. 
	The simulation creates a commons for decision making as democratically as I can imagine for now. 
	Ultimately the game is meant to create it's own economy based on its choices, then make redundant the decision-making attributed to gov'ts, and seamlessly insert itself as the common way to globally govern without a figurehead. The game allows for disbursement of taxes, and likely with varying baselines. 	
	Security begins with a db of a print, place  and  time registered with no other data. Of course with the common keyboards of the present, an alias would be the form of registry to begin. 
	Fingerprint ID, though anonymous, can still be deterrent to criminals (whose prints might already be in a police db which could be linked to a local alert). By extending the use of ID criminals could indeed be isolated, but this is a bit of sci-fi to begin.
	Also kids learn better with games, and use them - can you think of a better way to having a say in what's to come - it's a family thing. So with the print, different age groups might have 'voice' at different levels....it's a game, in a sense, but it is a virtual model for a Democracy without a lot of -isms attached. (...and I have no idea how to create &quot;games&quot;, but I can still tell a story.)



&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The objective is for a social transition, and one that can outpace and stifle that of consumerism and all that entails.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        With a game that is well built, as freeware, and whatever else to make it accessible and seamless and building first from major issues and the choices and the consequences of those linked; it could become an educational tool - certainly a few steps up from the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Problem is, government is boring.  And really slow.  If we could make
</I>&gt;<i> it fun, or at least mildly entertaining, we'd have a *huge* head start
</I>&gt;<i> on adoption.  But IMHO we're going to have to rely mostly on other
</I>&gt;<i> types of incentives, like civic duty, or maybe fear of being left out
</I>&gt;<i> or of loss of control (e.g., if everyone else is expressing their
</I>&gt;<i> opinions on this new system, maybe I'd better too), or some promise
</I>&gt;<i> that their taxes will go down or government reliability will go way
</I>&gt;<i> up. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        For voter ID (player registration), a fingerprint(s)(not quite ready for general access to this yet part yet, but it's there on some keyboards), (taken at birth - moment of registration obviously to begin). registers only print and location (city, county...), no name, no address. (gender equality in anonymity)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ....just an idea; not sure if relevant to your discussion, so my apologies for interrupting if so,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm also not concerned about this level of authentication or even
</I>&gt;<i> people hacking the system.  My position is just that we need to have
</I>&gt;<i> some (and really any) way of verifying that person X exists and don't
</I>&gt;<i> really have to worry about whether person X really created or is using
</I>&gt;<i> account X.  
</I>

&gt;<i> This will cut out about 99% of the fraud and virtually all
</I>&gt;<i> of the systematic and long-term fraud because when person X finally
</I>&gt;<i> gets around to creating an account and finds that there's already one
</I>&gt;<i> in their name with a voting record, well, we've got a target that the
</I>&gt;<i> police would go and find (or, until such time as the new system
</I>&gt;<i> actually has control of the police, some group like Anonymous might
</I>&gt;<i> find the issue very interesting). Validating identification of the
</I>&gt;<i> real person X would be a hell of a lot easier than what people have to
</I>&gt;<i> go through to fix any other sort of identity theft (rather than having
</I>&gt;<i> to fix *everything*, they'd only have to supply one bit of uncorrupted
</I>&gt;<i> data (bank accounts, credit cards, drivers license numbers, pulling a
</I>&gt;<i> credit report and asking a few questions about credit history, etc.)
</I>
This can be done with a print. Granted this requires hardware that is uncommon at this stage. If it begins as a game, it would not matter if X is really X or X cubed, and the objective is to give voice to billions, first virtually then systematically.

JPierre

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The issue here is who makes money.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I propose that any software license for software used in this group be

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The above might be the specification to a requirement that everyone has

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It does not touch directly major schisms in the FOSS tech community. And

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The politics of organizing the new system are going to be interesting.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    depending on which company they chose to host their data with?  And of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    course this means that the &quot;free&quot; services will have advertising on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    them:  Sure you want a form of government where to &quot;vote&quot; you have to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    ignore the ads on your page suggesting you vote a certain way?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The rest is evolutionary. At the start some standards will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    probably
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> emerge,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> later aggregation methods and pages, verification projects,...
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> What format is the data in?  There's a zillion different ways
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    to say
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;I think the US should change the nature of it's relationship with
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Cuba&quot;, how do you aggregate all of those?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You may start with a text file if you need an example. Write it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    in some way
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that can be desirably aggregated, maybe you will start a new
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    standard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    A standard format would seem to me to be a requirement.  Some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    XML would seem appropriate.  Now are people going to have to learn
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    this format and mark up their text properly (and then run an app to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    check it), or will there be apps that create the data in the correct
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    format?  Who writes these apps, and are they tied to the data hosting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    service, or independent?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Would you like to try it ? It would be very helpful for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    recognizing our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinions. You can also reuse the data in other projects. It is all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized......
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    importantly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    even if
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you happen to check periodically to verify what the system
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    thinks is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    believe a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    prevent every
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    credible
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    detect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> hackers.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> How could you know this ? I will not be peer to peer probably, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    expect
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> server to server. IMHO you have quick judgement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    What you're describing *is* peer to peer (i.e., if a central authority
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    doesn't control the servers, it's P2P, even if the peers are servers).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    And this is not something I couldn't know, or that requires quick
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    judgement: I've been dealing with UNIX and networked systems for 35
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    years now, and yet am still regularly surprised (and disappointed) by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    how often (and how easily) they get hacked.  Which leads to my expert
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    opinion being that a system that relies exclusively on security to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    *prevent* hacking is unworkable, as is one that lacks a reliable way
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    for people to check the outputs.  Still, we ought to design it to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    as hack-proof as possible, if only to improve efficiency, which means
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    P2P is probably out as an architecture unless there is some sudden
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    breakthrough in that technology in the next few years...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Regards,
