<PRE>this is hard to say and has to be analyzed more thouroughly.
It needs kind of a &quot;drop-in&quot; component (a javascript) that can be used in
*any* website, in order to add the feature of selecting anything on the
website and creating a &quot;comment stream&quot;....

I have some experience with creating something like that for adverts, where
spots for ads where not anywhere, but predefined and data was send back to
some server. To refine this to make it work cross browser in any kind of
environment took couple of weeks not fulltime, so to develop a nice drop-in
frontend component would probably take one month of full time work,
probably spread over a longer period instead of crammed into one actual
month.

Then there is the backend counterpart, which receives all the comments for
a website using the above mentioned frontend. Depending on the usage of
that kind of component, the backend has to serve massive amounts of
comments to all the websites using that feature to show to their users...
So this could be a service (paid with money or adverts or some other kind
of funding) ...or it could be a &quot;self hosted thing&quot;, so server side
component could be open source, but would then require the person who wants
the &quot;comments feature&quot; in their page, to host the server somewhere, which
requires way more effort than simply adding a javascript tag to a website.

Its hard for me to estimate how much effort it would be to create the
server infrastructure, but i assume a single well skilled programmer could
also do that within one month of full time work, which would then be 2
months of full time work for a skilled fullstack programmer.
Personally, i don't think i could do the backend part easily, but i think i
could manage to do the frontend part.

</I>&gt;<i> I think this is really awesome. Thanks for the links&#8230;! :)
</I>&gt;<i> Seems like it could be useful for a number of different applications.

</I>&gt;<i> Recently when we were using Vilfredo, I found I wanted a way to respond on
</I>&gt;<i> an aspect (or line) of a proposal without having to scroll between the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal and the comment box...or to switch over to *email*&#8230;..in order to
</I>&gt;<i> make a simple comment or suggestion. I think Medium would work well for
</I>&gt;<i> that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you people think the same, maybe there could be a &quot;KICKSTARTER
</I>&gt;<i> CAMPAIGN&quot; or other ways to present the functionality to others and get
</I>&gt;<i> funding in order to code this.
</I>&gt;<i> I personally - given time, thus given funding - could implement an open
</I>&gt;<i> source javascript component, which cna be &quot;drag'n'dropped&quot; into any web
</I>&gt;<i> page and be able to create that kind of &quot;popup&quot; next to &quot;selected website
</I>&gt;<i> content&quot; in order to comment on it and then transmit that data to a
</I>&gt;<i> backend, but also &quot;on page load&quot; receive all the data to populate the
</I>&gt;<i> webpage with &quot;comment thread icons&quot; or something like that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What would it take ($ wise) to implement what you&#8217;re suggesting?
