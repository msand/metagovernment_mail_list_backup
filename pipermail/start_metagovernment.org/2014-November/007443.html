<PRE>Scott,

thank you. I see now how would you like to solve these issues. Logically 
those are quite a good solutions.
Politically I would expect that opposition will target your weaknesses 
in coverage, transparency, security..... Radical transparency are scary 
words in some countries, e.g. totalities and post-totalities.
I think that it would be wise to weaken your opposition first, before 
you show them your weaknesses.
EvoA is not a goal it is more like a tool. It is not next generation and 
it would not be wise to promote it that way, but it may be one of the 
bridges between two generations of political systems.

What do you think ?

     Michael

</I>&gt;<i> This whole problem goes away with radical transparency, specifically

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think we need to solve these questions. When you do not solve it, I tend

</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, although being specific about requiring something that people
</I>&gt;<i> are not familiar with has it's own downsides, even if you've got logic

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was solving these questions and I have solved them somehow. I felt sorry
