<PRE>Max,

I see that requirements document could make this concept more 
understandable and attractive. On the other hand I do not dare to write it.
E.g. if I take your requirement &quot;requirement that everyone has access to 
all of the software and media and can largely do as they like with it.&quot; 
It can stop some projects that will provide anonymity. It may be a small 
server hosting 100 members. They hide the source data and publish just 
list of members and the sums of their opinions. (It may be number of 
sums according to different aggregation methods.) I do not see reason 
why to stop a project like that, do you ?

If you feel, that you know what to write into requirements document, 
please, create the document. I do not feel I know what to write there.

     Kind regards
         Michael

</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; There is plenty of free hostings or you can start your hosting
</I>&gt;<i>     and host
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; these tiny amounts of data for those who do not know how to work
</I>&gt;<i>     with free
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; hosting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     So, no standardizing and everyone gets to learn a different system
</I>&gt;<i>     depending on which company they chose to host their data with?  And of
</I>&gt;<i>     course this means that the &quot;free&quot; services will have advertising on
</I>&gt;<i>     them:  Sure you want a form of government where to &quot;vote&quot; you have to
</I>&gt;<i>     ignore the ads on your page suggesting you vote a certain way?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; The rest is evolutionary. At the start some standards will
</I>&gt;<i>     probably
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; emerge,
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; later aggregation methods and pages, verification projects,...
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; What format is the data in?  There's a zillion different ways
</I>&gt;<i>     to say
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; &quot;I think the US should change the nature of it's relationship with
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; Cuba&quot;, how do you aggregate all of those?
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; You may start with a text file if you need an example. Write it
</I>&gt;<i>     in some way
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; that can be desirably aggregated, maybe you will start a new
</I>&gt;<i>     standard.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     A standard format would seem to me to be a requirement.  Some sort of
</I>&gt;<i>     XML would seem appropriate.  Now are people going to have to learn
</I>&gt;<i>     this format and mark up their text properly (and then run an app to
</I>&gt;<i>     check it), or will there be apps that create the data in the correct
</I>&gt;<i>     format?  Who writes these apps, and are they tied to the data hosting
</I>&gt;<i>     service, or independent?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; Would you like to try it ? It would be very helpful for
</I>&gt;<i>     recognizing our
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; opinions. You can also reuse the data in other projects. It is all
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;&gt; decentralized......
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; (e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more
</I>&gt;<i>     importantly
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so
</I>&gt;<i>     even if
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; you happen to check periodically to verify what the system
</I>&gt;<i>     thinks is
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I
</I>&gt;<i>     believe a
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is
</I>&gt;<i>     that it's
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; *detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to
</I>&gt;<i>     prevent every
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is
</I>&gt;<i>     credible
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even
</I>&gt;<i>     detect
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;&gt; hackers.
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; How could you know this ? I will not be peer to peer probably, I
</I>&gt;<i>     expect
</I>&gt;<i>     &gt; server to server. IMHO you have quick judgement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     What you're describing *is* peer to peer (i.e., if a central authority
</I>&gt;<i>     doesn't control the servers, it's P2P, even if the peers are servers).
</I>&gt;<i>     And this is not something I couldn't know, or that requires quick
</I>&gt;<i>     judgement: I've been dealing with UNIX and networked systems for 35
</I>&gt;<i>     years now, and yet am still regularly surprised (and disappointed) by
</I>&gt;<i>     how often (and how easily) they get hacked.  Which leads to my expert
</I>&gt;<i>     opinion being that a system that relies exclusively on security to
</I>&gt;<i>     *prevent* hacking is unworkable, as is one that lacks a reliable way
</I>&gt;<i>     for people to check the outputs.  Still, we ought to design it to be
</I>&gt;<i>     as hack-proof as possible, if only to improve efficiency, which means
</I>&gt;<i>     P2P is probably out as an architecture unless there is some sudden
</I>&gt;<i>     breakthrough in that technology in the next few years...
</I>&gt;<i>       Regards,
