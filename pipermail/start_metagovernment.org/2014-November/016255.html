I think this is really awesome. Thanks for the links&#8230;! :)
Seems like it could be useful for a number of different applications.

Recently when we were using Vilfredo, I found I wanted a way to respond on an aspect (or line) of a proposal without having to scroll between the proposal and the comment box...or to switch over to *email*&#8230;..in order to make a simple comment or suggestion. I think Medium would work well for that.

&gt;<i> If you people think the same, maybe there could be a &quot;KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN&quot; or other ways to present the functionality to others and get funding in order to code this.
</I>&gt;<i> I personally - given time, thus given funding - could implement an open source javascript component, which cna be &quot;drag'n'dropped&quot; into any web page and be able to create that kind of &quot;popup&quot; next to &quot;selected website content&quot; in order to comment on it and then transmit that data to a backend, but also &quot;on page load&quot; receive all the data to populate the webpage with &quot;comment thread icons&quot; or something like that.
</I>
What would it take ($ wise) to implement what you&#8217;re suggesting?
