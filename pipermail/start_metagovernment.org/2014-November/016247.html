<PRE>Curious, this seemed to be in the middle of a digest.  If so, please
trim your posts in the future because most people probably won't
bother to find your edits...

Guess we'll find out, though we will have to be patient ;-)

&gt;<i>          Correct me if I'm wrong: My understanding is that as a society, globally, we need to begin making some serious decisions as to the fate of our planet and (e)quality of life. We need more than just an evolution, we need a transformation. We have evolved, and now unless our common and global course is altered, we then devolve.
</I>
That's my understanding as well.  And I think the people are ready:
This latest US election may turn out to have the lowest turnout since
the 1970s, with only about 30% of those eligible actually casting a
vote, and nearly everyone having to hold their nose in the process
since both parties have higher negative than positive ratings.

&gt;<i>         The game in question is meant to give voice to anyone, on issues anywhere (because 'issues' are everywhere), not by 'voting' for a candidate, but rather 'voting' on the issues, and they could 'vote' on any issues wherever they presently are, and/or on issues at place of origin. (In this case I use 'voting' as having a voice, but also voice can be as blogs on the issues....perhaps credits to the weight of a 'vote' acquired from discussions...all on-line.
</I>
That sounds like direct democracy to me, which is what I think we're
all proposing.

&gt;<i>         The simulation creates a commons for decision making as democratically as I can imagine for now.
</I>&gt;<i>         Ultimately the game is meant to create it's own economy based on its choices, then make redundant the decision-making attributed to gov'ts, and seamlessly insert itself as the common way to globally govern without a figurehead. The game allows for disbursement of taxes, and likely with varying baselines.
</I>
Ah, so this is where the game is different from just a functioning DD:
You've got a simulation back end to actually test the outcomes.
Sounds good, but besides being complicated and timeconsuming to
develop  I'm not even sure it would be very convincing.  People barely
trust economic models now.  Why would they trust a bunch of game
makers to do a better job of modeling the economy?

I'm still inclined to say that once enough people start participating
with the new system, the old one will have to start taking these
decisions into account.  And as they do, *that* will be the true test
of how well the new system actually works.  Maybe think of it as the
existing systems being the training wheels for the new one....

&gt;<i>         Security begins with a db of a print, place  and  time registered with no other data. Of course with the common keyboards of the present, an alias would be the form of registry to begin.
</I>&gt;<i>         Fingerprint ID, though anonymous, can still be deterrent to criminals (whose prints might already be in a police db which could be linked to a local alert). By extending the use of ID criminals could indeed be isolated, but this is a bit of sci-fi to begin.
</I>
Yeah, I think everyone knows we need better authentication systems.
I'm just thinking that we shouldn't be the prime movers for it,
especially considering I don't think we even need it.  I recommend
instead that we let the financial industry pull its weight (for a
change ;-)

&gt;<i>         Also kids learn better with games, and use them - can you think of a better way to having a say in what's to come - it's a family thing. So with the print, different age groups might have 'voice' at different levels....it's a game, in a sense, but it is a virtual model for a Democracy without a lot of -isms attached. (...and I have no idea how to create &quot;games&quot;, but I can still tell a story.)
</I>
Getting kids involved is key, but my solution to that is to let them
vote.  My proposal does require some sort of test that most won't be
able to pass until their mid-teens, but I think I'd like to see some
sharp pre-teens be able to do it too.  And I'm not worried about their
level of maturity: Certainly they'll be able to do a better job than
the voters who elected some of this recent round of politicians...
  Regards,
    Scott
