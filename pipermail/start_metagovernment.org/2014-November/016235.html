What format is the data in?  There's a zillion different ways to say

</I>
I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
(e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more importantly
too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so even if
you happen to check periodically to verify what the system thinks is
your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I believe a
centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is that it's
vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
*detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to prevent every
possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is credible
evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even detect
tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
hackers.

But your proposal does bear more than a passing resemblance to the
&quot;Goals&quot; section I propose for my System, where preferences on things
like foreign relations, tax rates, budgets, etc. will be stored for
each citizen and that information used by the proposers to make the
system more efficient.  For example, if 80% of the population sets
some element in their &quot;Goals&quot; section a certain way, there's 1) no
reason to even propose changing it (which would mean wasting
everyone's time voting on that proposal) if it is already the status
quo, and 2) a strong motivation to work toward capturing that 80% with
a well-crafted proposal if it isn't the status quo.
  Regards,
    Scott
