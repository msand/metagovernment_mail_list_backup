<PRE>I believe in my county we did 70% turnout.  This is not unheard of but good
for midterm elections. The differences are important if you are concerned
about turnout.  I am not much.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Why build a game when it'd probably easier just to build a functioning

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By all means - so if you have an easier process that can gain popularity
</I>&gt;<i> and credibility faster, then I'm all for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Guess we'll find out, though we will have to be patient ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;          Correct me if I'm wrong: My understanding is that as a society,
</I>&gt;<i> globally, we need to begin making some serious decisions as to the fate of
</I>&gt;<i> our planet and (e)quality of life. We need more than just an evolution, we
</I>&gt;<i> need a transformation. We have evolved, and now unless our common and
</I>&gt;<i> global course is altered, we then devolve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's my understanding as well.  And I think the people are ready:
</I>&gt;<i> This latest US election may turn out to have the lowest turnout since
</I>&gt;<i> the 1970s, with only about 30% of those eligible actually casting a
</I>&gt;<i> vote, and nearly everyone having to hold their nose in the process
</I>&gt;<i> since both parties have higher negative than positive ratings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         The game in question is meant to give voice to anyone, on issues
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere (because 'issues' are everywhere), not by 'voting' for a
</I>&gt;<i> candidate, but rather 'voting' on the issues, and they could 'vote' on any
</I>&gt;<i> issues wherever they presently are, and/or on issues at place of origin.
</I>&gt;<i> (In this case I use 'voting' as having a voice, but also voice can be as
</I>&gt;<i> blogs on the issues....perhaps credits to the weight of a 'vote' acquired
</I>&gt;<i> from discussions...all on-line.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That sounds like direct democracy to me, which is what I think we're
</I>&gt;<i> all proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         The simulation creates a commons for decision making as
</I>&gt;<i> democratically as I can imagine for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Ultimately the game is meant to create it's own economy based on
</I>&gt;<i> its choices, then make redundant the decision-making attributed to gov'ts,
</I>&gt;<i> and seamlessly insert itself as the common way to globally govern without a
</I>&gt;<i> figurehead. The game allows for disbursement of taxes, and likely with
</I>&gt;<i> varying baselines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ah, so this is where the game is different from just a functioning DD:
</I>&gt;<i> You've got a simulation back end to actually test the outcomes.
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds good, but besides being complicated and timeconsuming to
</I>&gt;<i> develop  I'm not even sure it would be very convincing.  People barely
</I>&gt;<i> trust economic models now.  Why would they trust a bunch of game
</I>&gt;<i> makers to do a better job of modeling the economy?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still inclined to say that once enough people start participating
</I>&gt;<i> with the new system, the old one will have to start taking these
</I>&gt;<i> decisions into account.  And as they do, *that* will be the true test
</I>&gt;<i> of how well the new system actually works.  Maybe think of it as the
</I>&gt;<i> existing systems being the training wheels for the new one....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Security begins with a db of a print, place  and  time
</I>&gt;<i> registered with no other data. Of course with the common keyboards of the
</I>&gt;<i> present, an alias would be the form of registry to begin.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Fingerprint ID, though anonymous, can still be deterrent to
</I>&gt;<i> criminals (whose prints might already be in a police db which could be
</I>&gt;<i> linked to a local alert). By extending the use of ID criminals could indeed
</I>&gt;<i> be isolated, but this is a bit of sci-fi to begin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, I think everyone knows we need better authentication systems.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm just thinking that we shouldn't be the prime movers for it,
</I>&gt;<i> especially considering I don't think we even need it.  I recommend
</I>&gt;<i> instead that we let the financial industry pull its weight (for a
</I>&gt;<i> change ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         Also kids learn better with games, and use them - can you think
</I>&gt;<i> of a better way to having a say in what's to come - it's a family thing. So
</I>&gt;<i> with the print, different age groups might have 'voice' at different
</I>&gt;<i> levels....it's a game, in a sense, but it is a virtual model for a
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy without a lot of -isms attached. (...and I have no idea how to
</I>&gt;<i> create &quot;games&quot;, but I can still tell a story.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Getting kids involved is key, but my solution to that is to let them
</I>&gt;<i> vote.  My proposal does require some sort of test that most won't be
</I>&gt;<i> able to pass until their mid-teens, but I think I'd like to see some
</I>&gt;<i> sharp pre-teens be able to do it too.  And I'm not worried about their
</I>&gt;<i> level of maturity: Certainly they'll be able to do a better job than
</I>&gt;<i> the voters who elected some of this recent round of politicians...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
