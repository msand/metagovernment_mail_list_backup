</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thus a start of evolutionary project is that you create your data and save
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> them somewhere. You will also need to tell others that you have done so and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where.
</I>&gt;<i> Public access?  What if they don't have any public-storage access
</I>&gt;<i> available to them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>There is plenty of free hostings or you can start your hosting and host 
these tiny amounts of data for those who do not know how to work with 
free hosting.
&gt;&gt;<i> The rest is evolutionary. At the start some standards will probably emerge,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> later aggregation methods and pages, verification projects,...
</I>&gt;<i> What format is the data in?  There's a zillion different ways to say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;I think the US should change the nature of it's relationship with
</I>&gt;<i> Cuba&quot;, how do you aggregate all of those?
</I>You may start with a text file if you need an example.  Write it in some 
way that can be desirably aggregated, maybe you will start a new standard.
&gt;&gt;<i> Would you like to try it ? It would be very helpful for recognizing our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opinions. You can also reuse the data in other projects. It is all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized......
</I>&gt;<i> I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more importantly
</I>&gt;<i> too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
</I>&gt;<i> makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so even if
</I>&gt;<i> you happen to check periodically to verify what the system thinks is
</I>&gt;<i> your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
</I>&gt;<i> milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
</I>&gt;<i> afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I believe a
</I>&gt;<i> centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
</I>&gt;<i> prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
</I>&gt;<i> independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
</I>&gt;<i> detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is that it's
</I>&gt;<i> vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
</I>&gt;<i> *detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to prevent every
</I>&gt;<i> possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is credible
</I>&gt;<i> evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even detect
</I>&gt;<i> tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
</I>&gt;<i> hackers.
</I>How could you know this ? I will not be peer to peer probably, I expect 
server to server. IMHO you have quick judgement.

&gt;<i> But your proposal does bear more than a passing resemblance to the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Goals&quot; section I propose for my System, where preferences on things
</I>&gt;<i> like foreign relations, tax rates, budgets, etc. will be stored for
</I>&gt;<i> each citizen and that information used by the proposers to make the
</I>&gt;<i> system more efficient.  For example, if 80% of the population sets
</I>&gt;<i> some element in their &quot;Goals&quot; section a certain way, there's 1) no
</I>&gt;<i> reason to even propose changing it (which would mean wasting
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's time voting on that proposal) if it is already the status
</I>&gt;<i> quo, and 2) a strong motivation to work toward capturing that 80% with
</I>&gt;<i> a well-crafted proposal if it isn't the status quo.
</I>&gt;<i>    Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>      Scott
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Kind regards
