<PRE>Whatever &quot;features&quot; a software tool might have, in order to succeed, it
needs:


*<A HREF="https://medium.com/about/dont-write-alone-8304190661d4">https://medium.com/about/dont-write-alone-8304190661d4</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://medium.com/about/dont-write-alone-8304190661d4">https://medium.com/about/dont-write-alone-8304190661d4</A>&gt;<A HREF="https://medium.com/about/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2">https://medium.com/about/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2</A>
&lt;<A HREF="https://medium.com/about/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2">https://medium.com/about/why-medium-notes-are-different-and-how-to-use-them-well-5972c72b18f2</A>&gt;*

Why?
Because, there can be a seperate &quot;thread&quot; of discussion for each part of
the content.

Go to the above links and randomly SELECT ANY TEXT with your mouse.
There will be a small &quot;popup menu&quot; which offers you to:
   - either tweet the content via twitter (to share stuff with others)
   - comment on exactly the part of the text you marked and start a
discussion thread

This kind of usability feature is mandatory if we want success.

*Some of you might have heard about:*
*<A HREF="https://disqus.com/">https://disqus.com/</A> &lt;<A HREF="https://disqus.com/">https://disqus.com/</A>&gt;*

...which basically offers a &quot;comenting system&quot; as a service for other
people to bake it into their existing websites. This is a VERY IMPORTANT
MECHANISM for what we want to achieve, but the problem is, that it is way
to coarse-grained for a well structured discussion, but if you combine
&quot;DISQUS&quot; with the features from &quot;MEDIUM COMMENTS&quot;, in order to offer
everyone to easily integrate a &quot;single sign on discussion system&quot; into
their existing web-pages, then what you get is a very solid foundation that
more advanced features and analytics and the like could be built on.


If you people think the same, maybe there could be a &quot;KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN&quot;
or other ways to present the functionality to others and get funding in
order to code this.
I personally - given time, thus given funding - could implement an open
source javascript component, which cna be &quot;drag'n'dropped&quot; into any web
page and be able to create that kind of &quot;popup&quot; next to &quot;selected website
content&quot; in order to comment on it and then transmit that data to a
backend, but also &quot;on page load&quot; receive all the data to populate the
webpage with &quot;comment thread icons&quot; or something like that.

So there would need to be some kind of &quot;backend&quot; which should basically
also offers &quot;registration&quot; and differnet levels of &quot;credential validations&quot;
(anonymous -&gt; ... -&gt; registered with email -&gt; .. -&gt; registered with
personal identity card / tax number) and which allows *ANY PERSON* at *ANY
WEB PAGE* which uses the service, to comment on *ANY PART *and identify
themseles in the ongoing discussion :-)

this could really become a very very dynamic thing :-)
I'm thrilled. I'm not good in organizing funding or presenting this or
marketing to reach potential sponsors, but i can code the frontend
component and i can help creating some kind of &quot;mock up&quot;

What do you people think?

something is very strong and i currently cannot imagine that there are

there are alternative perspectives too :-)Please do not feel discouraged to
