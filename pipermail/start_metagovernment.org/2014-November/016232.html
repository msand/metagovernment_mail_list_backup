Right, which is why I specifically exclude them as early candidates
for adoption.  This whole issue was a big part of the problem of how
communism was actually implemented after the Bolshevik revolution
(i.e., are the people ready for this yet?).  Lenin and his &quot;vanguard
of the elite&quot; ended up on top after this struggle which is in part why
the experiment failed so dismally and brutally (IMHO it was going to
fail anyway, but 20+ million people didn't have to die in the
process).

&gt;<i> I think that it would be wise to weaken your opposition first, before you

</I>
To paraphrase Forrest Gump: Transparency is as transparency does.  I
struggle with this one a lot too, but generally end up on the
philosophical high road.  The transformation could happen as a
ground-up movement, gradually making the existing political systems
obsolete (and this is the path Ed and the other early contributors to
Metagovernment.org advocated), or it could happen the way
Hitler/Mao/Lenin did it which is to wait for a crisis to develop and
then resort to any means available to get out in front of it to
ostensibly &quot;lead the people out&quot;.  If we're going to attempt the
former, we need to fight fair from very start.  Fortunately one of the
strengths of my plan over most others is the acceptance of the fact
that we're going to have force a significant minority of the people
(i.e., that 25% who are high SDA) to accept a system that they'll be
instinctively afraid of.  But as I point out in the book, we
neurotypicals can be trusted to treat them far better than they ever
have treated us.

&gt;<i> EvoA is not a goal it is more like a tool. It is not next generation and it
</I>&gt;<i> would not be wise to promote it that way, but it may be one of the bridges

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ?
</I>
I think I'm opposed to this sort of multi-step/gradual-transition
plan.  Seems to me it just makes for a lot of extra work and slows
progress for no good reason.  The way the new system will gain
traction will be to actually build a system capable of running a
government, and then actually use it to do so.  Unfortunately other
than some prototyping to convince myself that it's possible to build
something like this I haven't done much work on it yet, mostly because
I'm still a noob when it comes to understanding the politics, social
psychology, philosophy, and economics needed to design it properly.
But I'm ramping up rapidly so it shouldn't be too much longer before I
can start on the actual implementation.

My latest exploration is into the very curious overlap between
utilitarian philosophy and psychopathy.  Turns out psychopaths are the
ultimate utilitarians.  This is helpful to me because I struggle a lot
with the distinctions between my philosophy and straight
utilitarianism, and also with where psychopaths and sociopaths fit
along the SDA spectrum.  The book is &quot;The wisdom of psychopaths&quot; by
Dutton and his website is <A HREF="http://kevindutton.co.uk/">http://kevindutton.co.uk/</A>
