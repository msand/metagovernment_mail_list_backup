<PRE>Hello,

I was making some notes about how should decision making look. You may 
find my notes bellow or updated in my Notepad.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:MichaelS#Notepad">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:MichaelS#Notepad</A>

Who will be asking questions ? There is power in formulating questions. 
No, there will be one question at the beginning: &quot;What question is most 
desirable to be solved next ?&quot;(What's next?)

Who will be answering the question ? In my opinion, the people I know do 
not solve this question satisfactory. They make the same mistakes all 
the time.

Who can solve certain question satisfactory ? Those who understand the 
question, those who know something about it. This will be valid for 
other questions too.

How to empower people, who understand certain question, to resolve the 
question officially ? They need to be empowered and still mostly 
independent. They need to be empowered by people, they need to have 
public support.

How will public identify the people who should solve certain question ? 
They need to be the person (direct) or know one (representative) or have 
the opportunity to test understanding of their proxies (meritocracy).

How will they test them, if necessary? They need to set certain 
conditions to them, that will ensure them that they are qualified and 
act in the public interest. It is up to voters what conditions they 
select for their vote.

How will look an answer to a certain question (What's next?) ? It is an 
open question, the answer should be order of preference.

How to aggregate order of preference ? The best option beat every other 
option in man-on-man contest - Condorcet.

How to resolve ties in Condorcet method ? Lowest count of last options. 
We will oppose each other just as little as possible.

Some people want to oppose each other even less. We may give them 
opportunity to condition their vote, that it will be counted only if the 
option will beat all other options with more than requested higher majority.

Where is discussion ? People who understand certain questions discuss 
them regularly and more importantly they read publications about those 
topics.

What do you think ?

     Regards
         Michael
