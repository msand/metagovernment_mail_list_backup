</I>
So, no standardizing and everyone gets to learn a different system
depending on which company they chose to host their data with?  And of
course this means that the &quot;free&quot; services will have advertising on
them:  Sure you want a form of government where to &quot;vote&quot; you have to
ignore the ads on your page suggesting you vote a certain way?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The rest is evolutionary. At the start some standards will probably

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> later aggregation methods and pages, verification projects,...

</I>&gt;<i> You may start with a text file if you need an example.  Write it in some way

</I>
A standard format would seem to me to be a requirement.  Some sort of
XML would seem appropriate.  Now are people going to have to learn
this format and mark up their text properly (and then run an app to
check it), or will there be apps that create the data in the correct
format?  Who writes these apps, and are they tied to the data hosting
service, or independent?

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Would you like to try it ? It would be very helpful for recognizing our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinions. You can also reuse the data in other projects. It is all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decentralized......
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think I'm actually opposed to the idea of a totally decentralized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (e.g., peer to peer) system.  Too easy to spoof, and more importantly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too hard to detect when an alternate source for &quot;your&quot; data somehow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> makes it into the chain.  Even worse, it could come and go, so even if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you happen to check periodically to verify what the system thinks is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your data it wouldn't prevent someone from changing the path a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> milliseconds before a &quot;vote&quot;, then change it back immediately
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afterward.  So, even though it basically *invites* attack, I believe a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> centralized data store is required.  Distributed, of course, to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> prevent single-point-of-failure, but all mirrors rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independent sources.  I'd propose some sort of versioning to allow
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> detection of hacks.  My philosophy on all of these things is that it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vastly more important to be able to have a totally reliable way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *detect* this sort of &quot;voter fraud&quot; than it is to try to prevent every
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possible cause of it.  You can always redo a vote if there is credible
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> evidence that it was invalid, but if normal citizens can't even detect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tampering the government will effectively be run by sysadmins and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hackers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How could you know this ? I will not be peer to peer probably, I expect
</I>&gt;<i> server to server. IMHO you have quick judgement.
</I>
What you're describing *is* peer to peer (i.e., if a central authority
doesn't control the servers, it's P2P, even if the peers are servers).
And this is not something I couldn't know, or that requires quick
judgement: I've been dealing with UNIX and networked systems for 35
years now, and yet am still regularly surprised (and disappointed) by
how often (and how easily) they get hacked.  Which leads to my expert
opinion being that a system that relies exclusively on security to
*prevent* hacking is unworkable, as is one that lacks a reliable way
for people to check the outputs.  Still, we ought to design it to be
as hack-proof as possible, if only to improve efficiency, which means
P2P is probably out as an architecture unless there is some sudden
breakthrough in that technology in the next few years...

    Scott
