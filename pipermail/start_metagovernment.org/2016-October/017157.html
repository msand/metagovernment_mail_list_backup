<PRE>What you propose is quite close to LD.
But (2) and (5) are pretty random. Both restrict people's decision-making capacity.
To make it truly democratic, (2) should be removed and (5) made optional.

 Subject: Re: [MG] Axiom 6: People are not competent to choose their proxies
   
Hi all,

Let me present an alternative view of how representation/delegation should work. This is my own personal take on the matter, but I believe it has a lot in common with the liquid feedback approach.

1) You get to choose who to delegate to. It's not decided by any kind of system or algorithm by default. Ideally, you'll feel competent enough to participate directly. If not, you can delegate. You and only you are competent enough to choose a delegate. Our decision-making capabilities are far from perfect, but they're far better than any human-invented algorithm.

2) You delegate in specific areas - no blanket delegations.

3) For every specific area, you can choose to participate directly yourself, delegate, or do nothing at all. You can change this choice at any time.

4) You can base your choice of who to delegate to on any criteria you like. Maybe it's because you think that person is an expert in the field. Maybe it's because they have a PhD or a lifetime of professional experience. Maybe not. Maybe you know them personally. Maybe you're confident you share the same interests. Maybe you've noticed that you tend to agree with their proposals. It's up to you.

5) Delegations are transitive, so when you delegate to somebody, you're also trusting their judgement to potentially pass it on to someone else. If/when this happens, you receive a notification.

6) You can override or revoke delegations at any time. So if there are any people who have gained a large degree of influence through delegation, they are always dependent on retaining the trust placed in them by all those who have chosen to delegate. So there are two major ways that an oligarchy is prevented from cementing its power at the top: a) division into specific subject areas, b) potential to revoke delegations.

7) Delegations are open. Everybody can see who's delegating to whom. In the case of transitive delegations, you can trace the path of delegations as they are passed from one person to the next.

Now let me make two quick points about the argument as you've laid it out above, Scott, because I don't believe the distinction you've drawn between &quot;representationist&quot; and &quot;elitist&quot; holds any water.

On the one hand, you argue that to admit some people understand a certain issue better than others is elitist. On the other hand, you want people to be represented by others who have &quot;the time/motivation/experience/etc . to properly investigate the issue&quot;. Yet spending time investigating a subject and gaining experience in a field - this is precisely how you acquire what most people call expertise. I'm aware that we live in an age where people have little faith in &quot;experts&quot; - and often for good reason. But that's not to say that expertise doesn't exist. What we need to ensure is that experts - or other people with influence - are acting in good faith. We do this by designing the system so that they are always reliant on maintaining their base of support.

Another fundamental problem with this same point:

&quot;people should be represented by direct voters who will vote like they would if they had the time/motivation/experience/etc . to properly investigate the issue before voting&quot;

How will we ever know how people would have voted if they *did* have this motivation, if they *did* spend a lot of time looking into it and if the *did* have relevant experience? The reason to want to delegate your vote - on a particular subject, not a blanket delegation - is precisely because you *don't* have that level of interest/time etc. to devote to that particular field. You cannot even know yourself how you would vote if you did. So your definition of &quot;representation&quot; is something unknowable.

Regards,
Paul

I might consider implementing a warning system too against anyone trying to game the system by misrepresenting themselves in the personality&#160;test. If a certain number of users switch their vote from the one the proxy chooses, the system alerts the other auto-matched users that this proxy might not be representing them. &#160; &#160;

One of the things Kling said has kind of stuck in my craw:

&quot;We discussed this and came to the conclusion that there are
other factors than representativeness which play a role when delegating
a vote, i.e. sympathy and popularity.&quot;

I'm sensing basically the same view from Carlo and Sergey, although
they might claim other factors, such as &quot;expertise&quot;, as being
important. I'm going to call my Axiom 5, which states that people
should be represented by direct voters who will vote like they would
if they had the time/motivation/experience/etc . to properly
investigate the issue before voting, the &quot;representationist&quot; position.
I'll call the opposite position &quot;elitism&quot; because it implies that
there is something special about those people you propose to want to
delegate to (if you have an alternative proposal for what to call it,
by all means make it).

I frequently point to demagogues as an example of a fatal flaw in the
elitist position, but what exactly is the problem with demagogues? Is
it just that they're racist, nationalistic, and authoritarian? Not at
all! If that were the real problem, then what we should be doing is
designing social engineering countermeasures to those things, which we
could then apply not only to the demagogues but to anyone else who
might vote that way, regardless of whether they were being led by a
demagogue or not.

No, the problem with demogogues is their ability to *amplify* their
position on any and all issues by convincing others, who may or not
agree with the demagogue on any *specific* issue, to effectively grant
a blanket proxy to the demagogue. But what about using &quot;expertise&quot; or
&quot;popularity&quot; or &quot;familiarity&quot; or some other criteria to select a
proxy? That should be OK, right? No, because it has exactly the same
fatal flaw: By granting a proxy to someone based on any single
characteristic and exclusive of knowing their actual personality type,
it is virtually guaranteed that the proxy will distort the voting on a
wide range of issues because of their ability to amplify their votes,
which will over-represent their personality type in the final decision
and which is essentially taking advantage of those who have granted
them a proxy unless the elite just coincidentally happens to cast a
true representationist vote.

All of course is *in addition to* the other problems I've pointed out
with a system that allows granting proxies to specific individuals:
1) The possibility of dead-ending and no vote being cast.
2) The possibility of corruption because the elite then becomes a
target for manipulation.
3) The possibility of corruption due to the elite casting a self-serving vote.

At this point I have to recommend that we equate the elitist position
with those who think they need to have the ability to disable
stability control on their cars, a position that even the experts in
that field consider to be just plain stupid, even on a race track, let
alone out in traffic:
<A HREF="http://www.roadandtrack.com/ca">http://www.roadandtrack.com/ca</A> r-culture/a28714/turning-off- stability-control-is-one-of- the-dumbest-things-you-can-do- in-a-car/

Bottom line, I'm walking back on my proposal to even *calculate* a
vote from those one follows, let alone allowing automatically casting
that vote. This still allows people to make the calculation manually
by actually looking at the votes of those they're following and then
manually voting, but requiring even this extra effort should
discourage almost everyone from doing so, which of course is in their
best interest if what we're trying to build is a representationist
system. I still think it's a good idea to allow blocking of specific
individuals from the AutoMatch, but my current thinking is to have
that be a separate system from the &quot;follow&quot; feature.

Anyone care to try to defend the elitist position?
&#160; Regards,
&#160; &#160; Scott
