This is something new. Until recently you were insisting that other means of choosing delegates (other than your matching system) would be at disadvantage. For example, if I were to choose my own delegate based on my own judgment, you would require that I always vote directly. Essentially, you wanted to save me from myself (claiming that I will fall asleep), just like representative democracy proponents, or direct democracy purists. Just like them, you were happily infringing on my right to use my own vote according to my conscience.

</I>&gt;<i> Scott, there is a huge difference in your assessment on the openness

</I>&gt;<i> that (at least) one of you (Scott or Ned) cannot be trusted on psychological

</I>
Well, neither, probably. The real problem is that Ned doesn't actually
know me other than as a bully shooting down his ideas. I'm sure there
is a skill of assessing people's personality via email/blog
posts/twitter/etc., but it's never going to be anywhere near as
accurate as if you'd actually spent significant real-world time with
someone.

But bottom line I think this kind of discrepancy doesn't matter at
all: AutoMatch is a very convenient feature, but it's only there as an
assistant: If you fill out a delusional inventory form, or try to game
the system by appearing to be someone you're not, it's really only
going to make it less useful for *you, because you'll find the vote it
calculates for you won't match how you'd actually vote (if you took
the time to learn everything you need to know about an issue). It'll
still be useful to people who don't have an agenda other than making
sure their opinions count. In general, your self report will have a
very high correlation with inventories filled out by people who know
you well and so *will* be useful when matched with other people who
are also playing it straight.

&#160; &#160; Scott
