<PRE>One of the things Kling said has kind of stuck in my craw:

&quot;We discussed this and came to the conclusion that there are
other factors than representativeness which play a role when delegating
a vote, i.e. sympathy and popularity.&quot;

I'm sensing basically the same view from Carlo and Sergey, although
they might claim other factors, such as &quot;expertise&quot;, as being
important. I'm going to call my Axiom 5, which states that people
should be represented by direct voters who will vote like they would
if they had the time/motivation/experience/etc. to properly
investigate the issue before voting, the &quot;representationist&quot; position.
I'll call the opposite position &quot;elitism&quot; because it implies that
there is something special about those people you propose to want to
delegate to (if you have an alternative proposal for what to call it,
by all means make it).

I frequently point to demagogues as an example of a fatal flaw in the
elitist position, but what exactly is the problem with demagogues? Is
it just that they're racist, nationalistic, and authoritarian? Not at
all! If that were the real problem, then what we should be doing is
designing social engineering countermeasures to those things, which we
could then apply not only to the demagogues but to anyone else who
might vote that way, regardless of whether they were being led by a
demagogue or not.

No, the problem with demogogues is their ability to *amplify* their
position on any and all issues by convincing others, who may or not
agree with the demagogue on any *specific* issue, to effectively grant
a blanket proxy to the demagogue. But what about using &quot;expertise&quot; or
&quot;popularity&quot; or &quot;familiarity&quot; or some other criteria to select a
proxy? That should be OK, right? No, because it has exactly the same
fatal flaw: By granting a proxy to someone based on any single
characteristic and exclusive of knowing their actual personality type,
it is virtually guaranteed that the proxy will distort the voting on a
wide range of issues because of their ability to amplify their votes,
which will over-represent their personality type in the final decision
and which is essentially taking advantage of those who have granted
them a proxy unless the elite just coincidentally happens to cast a
true representationist vote.

All of course is *in addition to* the other problems I've pointed out
with a system that allows granting proxies to specific individuals:
1) The possibility of dead-ending and no vote being cast.
2) The possibility of corruption because the elite then becomes a
target for manipulation.
3) The possibility of corruption due to the elite casting a self-serving vote.

At this point I have to recommend that we equate the elitist position
with those who think they need to have the ability to disable
stability control on their cars, a position that even the experts in
that field consider to be just plain stupid, even on a race track, let
alone out in traffic:
<A HREF="http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28714/turning-off-stability-control-is-one-of-the-dumbest-things-you-can-do-in-a-car/">http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28714/turning-off-stability-control-is-one-of-the-dumbest-things-you-can-do-in-a-car/</A>

Bottom line, I'm walking back on my proposal to even *calculate* a
vote from those one follows, let alone allowing automatically casting
that vote. This still allows people to make the calculation manually
by actually looking at the votes of those they're following and then
manually voting, but requiring even this extra effort should
discourage almost everyone from doing so, which of course is in their
best interest if what we're trying to build is a representationist
system. I still think it's a good idea to allow blocking of specific
individuals from the AutoMatch, but my current thinking is to have
that be a separate system from the &quot;follow&quot; feature.

Anyone care to try to defend the elitist position?
  Regards,
    Scott
