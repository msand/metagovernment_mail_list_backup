Let me ask you something. Is it the case that you design/theory is relying heavily on this grand assumption, that people with close psychological profiles have close political preferences, and more specifically, would vote similarly on various issues? Have you actually tested this idea empirically, to verify how much it is true?

&gt;<i> to me to be missing the point: If I wanted quality decisions above
</I>&gt;<i> all, I'd be advocating for a reliable way to create a benevolent
</I>&gt;<i> dictatorship or some kind of oligarch/elite-based system.
</I>
Accept that you would have no idea how to insure that the dictator was acting in the interests of the people.
I also see that you regard your system's lack of ability to produce quality decision on difficult questions not as a bug but a feature. It is kind of shocking.


&gt;<i> &gt; How would you expect two people with similar profiles be equally good for such a task?

&gt;<i> Aha! I think we've exposed another elitist!
</I>
It may surprise you, but when I&#160; am flying on a plane, I prefer that the plane is steered by a seasoned pilot, and not by a random passenger, even if he scores high on your matching test. Not sure why you call it &quot;elitism&quot;.

&gt;<i> Then what? We already know they're mostly scumbags.
</I>
Well, some are probably lesser scumbags than the others. But I agree, it would still be far worse than delegation. Though my views on how delegation should be designed seem closer to &quot;classical&quot; LD.

Agreed. It's getting close to time, although I kind of feel like I
dodged a bullet by coming up with AutoMatch before starting
implementation. I don't have time to waste doing it wrong the first
time, not to mention the risk to the name/concepts that could come
from a project that goes down in flames because I neglected to account
for something...

&gt;&gt;<i> How &quot;The People&quot; want to optimize (by number of goals achieved, a

</I>&gt;<i> No, I was asking what you are optimizing. When you say the system is
</I>&gt;<i> suboptimal, you probably have some optimality criterion in your head/theory.
</I>&gt;<i> If you do not, I would not call it a theory.
</I>
Optimality is to be judged by the quality of the &quot;match&quot; (hence the
name &quot;Matchism&quot; ;-) between the policies produced and some aggregate
measure of the Will of the People. It doesn't require appeal to any
conventional sense of &quot;optimality&quot; (efficiency, lack of cycles, speed
of execution, etc.). Probably the best measure of &quot;matching&quot; will
simply be public opinion: If people like it, use it, and trust it, it
will have achieved at least some level of optimality that can be
progressively improved from there. It seems to me a pretty low bar to
be more &quot;optimal&quot; in this sense than misrepresentative democracy:
*Everyone* knows how fundamentally incapable that is of producing
policy that even a simple majority of the people would endorse.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for how the Goals will be defined, I expect it'll work similar to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the budgeting system (big list of items that people can rank order,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and even add their own items to),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so let's say people set multiple goals, defining quantitative criteria
</I>&gt;<i> of meeting these goals, rated them by importance. Now we need to build a
</I>&gt;<i> utility function which we want to maximize. This utility function should
</I>&gt;<i> include costs of reaching the goals, as well as goal trade-offs, as usually
</I>&gt;<i> the goals are not independent and we have limited resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would you agree that this is not an easy task in general?
</I>
Sure, but fortunately that is not what I propose to do ;-) I was
somewhat mystified by the discussion a few weeks ago on this list
about assessing the quality of decisionmaking. The whole thing seemed
to me to be missing the point: If I wanted quality decisions above
all, I'd be advocating for a reliable way to create a benevolent
dictatorship or some kind of oligarch/elite-based system. But real
people are going to make mistakes: There will be reversals, there will
be occasional examples of &quot;mob justice&quot;, there will be policy created
and enforced by demagogues, etc. Just like we have now ;-) The
difference will be that in my proposal these will be The People's
*own* mistakes, not mistakes made (at least supposedly) on their
behalf. I'll concede that the former being superior to the latter is
largely a matter of faith, because there's never been a large-scale
society where it has been tried. It *does* work in small scale
societies, because our species wouldn't have survived to this point
otherwise.

&gt;<i> You cannot just
</I>&gt;<i> listen to random people (with matching profiles) who are bold enough to
</I>&gt;<i> express their opinions (vote directly) on what those costs and trade-offs
</I>&gt;<i> are. But your anonymous psychological profiling will do just that. I know I
</I>&gt;<i> will never trust such systems. How would you expect two people with similar
</I>&gt;<i> profiles be equally good for such a task? It is just incomprehensible for
</I>&gt;<i> me.
</I>
Aha! I think we've exposed another elitist! You can join Carlo over in
the peanut gallery. Maybe read some psychology while you're waiting
for something else to cynically and irrationally reject: Your
statement above &quot;bold enough to express their opinions&quot; makes no sense
in the context of a personality-based proxy system (i.e., &quot;boldness&quot;
*is* a personality characteristic). The wikipedia article on Big 5 is
actually not too bad a place to start, although I note that there is
no mention of how Big 5 correlates to ideology/party affiliation/etc.
so you'll have to extrapolate a little (or go find and read the
literature on that, some of which can be found directly on
matchism.org):
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits</A>

More on this issue of experts vs. psychological matches for
decisionmaking in my response to Carlo's post today...

&gt;&gt;<i> First of all, they'd have to come
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in fairly large numbers (at least as large as the number of HO/HC
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> direct voters).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are designing a system that should not fail when most people are not
</I>&gt;<i> paying attention. Now you are relying on assumption that actually many
</I>&gt;<i> enough people are paying attention.
</I>
No, since it is a open-voting system it'd be more like having a free
press: There are *lots* of people who'd be willing to sit down and
comb through the data looking for anomalies like this, probably a lot
of them the very authoritarians who'd be most likely to try to game
the system (for all their likelihood of participating in bad behavior
like this, authoritarians are actually quite skilled and highly
motivated at detecting and punishing abuse and so would be generally
be very useful cogs in the machine). It wouldn't take much to
incentivize reporting of attempts to buy/coerce/game votes, for
example offering a bounty to be paid as a fine by the perpetrator...

&gt;&gt;<i> Secondly, this kind of thing would be very easy to detect: You'd see a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bimodal distribution of the HO/HC voters (some real, some fake) and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could therefore easily single out the ones attempting to game the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system by comparing the personality profiles with their voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> records. If this becomes a serious problem, we could always add
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trusted-source to the personality profile measure (i.e., the actual
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> inventory might be done by someone else).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is easy, then you can easily fix the current system, just go and
</I>&gt;<i> inform people who the candidates really are.
</I>
Then what? We already know they're mostly scumbags. But what
alternative do we have? Are you going to run for office to replace
them? I can assure you that I'm not. I don't have any
theoretical/philosophical problem with representative democracy, it's
merely a social engineering issue: The kinds of people who are willing
and able to participate in systems like that are just fundamentally
psychologically different from neurotypicals (i.e., most of the rest
of us), and so I consider it just a practical impossibility to fix any
kind of system that relies on self-selection into roles that require
significant effort to perform. Only by lowering the barriers will it
be possible to get the wide cross section of participants we need to
have a true democracy.
