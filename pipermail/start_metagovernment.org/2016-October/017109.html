<PRE>My best understanding it was $350 and a  screen shot that proports to put
your product in interstate commerce and I might think you could arrange
that.  On the other hand, I failed.  If Scott did it, he has the better
experience.

On the other hand, if you do not patent and it can be patented then someone
else can and then you almost can not use it yourself in your own company.
So the bullying threats do not solve much for you.  On the other hand, I do
not remember saying you should patent anything.  Also jump to conclusions
based on ideology and reading comprehensive sound, ah, like a religious
problem.  Or maybe a troll or a shill.  The defense here is accessible
prior art and  changes in the patent office. There are organizations that
collect prior art and on your side.  I am not expert on that.  So   there
is choice of copy left and cc variations to work on before worrying much
about patents.  Also getting rich can be useful.
