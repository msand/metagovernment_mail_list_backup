</I>Correlation is not enough. You need to be sure that correlation is high. Why did not you check it? You are saying that you want to do everything right in the first attempt, but you have not bothered validating the fundamental assumption your theory is based on. And it is not that hard: you just need to poll a group of people. Such a poll is probably no more than 1% or .1% or .01% of effort you will invest in your project. Why do not do it first?
It is not like everything you assume is always correct. Think how you had to reconsider your design based on the numbers from that Mainz paper (.5 vs.6 or something like that). These numbers, by the way, are very suspicious, and you better check how they were obtained. .6 really makes very little sense. If somebody delegates his vote to a trusted delegate, why would he bother overwriting it 40% of the time? It means he has very little trust in his own delegate. Then why does he keep that delegate? If he does not overwrite, then correlation should be close to 1. You should really check the raw data.

No, I haven't done this, nor AFAIK has anyone else. But there is
*tons* of research that shows that ideology, measured on a simple
left-right scale or the more complete two-dimensional
left-right/authoritarian-libertarian scale, shows high levels of
correlation with opinions on public policy issues. And Haidt (and many
others) have shown that those scales can be mapped directly onto the
Big-5. Sure, I'm assuming a kind of transitivity in correlation to get
directly from Big-5 to voting records, but my prediction is that the
correlations will be even *better* than if you had to pass through
something as coarse as political ideology or party affiliation. There
are lots of unknown unknowns in my proposal, but my expert opinion is
that this isn't something that we need to worry about.

&gt;&gt;<i> to me to be missing the point: If I wanted quality decisions above
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all, I'd be advocating for a reliable way to create a benevolent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dictatorship or some kind of oligarch/elite-based system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Accept that you would have no idea how to insure that the dictator was
</I>&gt;<i> acting in the interests of the people.
</I>
Again, speaking just for myself, I don't actually think this would be
hard to do. There have been many examples of benevolent dictators and
I'll bet we could pick a good one just using a Big 5 scores (though
I'd greatly prefer to also have access to RWA, SDO, and psychopathy
measures, just for insurance). The problem with most actual dictators
is that the same personality types that crave that power are the very
ones who will abuse it once they get it. For example it's actually
historically more common to find &quot;benevolent monarchs&quot; because they
often have power just handed to them rather than having to run the
gauntlet of power struggle, the only ones making it through that being
SDAP and so very dangerous to have in positions of unrestricted power.

&gt;<i> I also see that you regard your system's lack of ability to produce quality
</I>&gt;<i> decision on difficult questions not as a bug but a feature. It is kind of
</I>&gt;<i> shocking.
</I>
I wouldn't exactly consider it a &quot;feature&quot;, just a justifiable
compromise. We humans are very imperfect creatures and it is IMHO
unreasonable to expect any type of government we create to be anything
near perfect. But there are degrees and directions of imperfection and
I think we can do much better if we are allowed to at least *choose*
which ones we'll have to live with.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How would you expect two people with similar profiles be equally good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for such a task?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Aha! I think we've exposed another elitist!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may surprise you, but when I&#160; am flying on a plane, I prefer that the
</I>&gt;<i> plane is steered by a seasoned pilot, and not by a random passenger, even if
</I>&gt;<i> he scores high on your matching test. Not sure why you call it &quot;elitism&quot;.
</I>
It *is* elitism, and there's nothing wrong with it for any sort of
skilled occupation, including IMHO the executive branch of government.
But as been shown ad nauseum by our current misrepresentative
democracies, most public policy decisions don't require that level of
expertise. What they require instead is taking into account the
personalities of the decisionmakers: We're going to end up far better
off if, e.g.,&#160; our nuclear weapons policy is decided by people who are
psychologically like you and me even if they never finished high
school rather than the SDAPs with college degrees (or even PhDs) who
are able to make those policy decisions now without ever even having
to consult us. I have little doubt, for example, that the majority of
The People will simply vote for unilateral disarmament (we can't ever
use them, what possible rational justification could there be for even
keeping them, let alone wasting trillions of dollars supporting them?)
You'll never see SDAPs do that, though, which again is just a
characteristic of their personalities, not the result of some
education or other &quot;expertise&quot; that they have. You probably already
even know this, even if you think you don't: Who's more likely to vote
for a carbon tax, a conservative or a green? Do you need know how many
years of schooling they have or what their job is or how many books
they've read or meetings they've attended on this issue to make this
determination? Would knowing any of those things even be relevant at
all in making your prediction?
&#160; Regards,
&#160; &#160; Scott
