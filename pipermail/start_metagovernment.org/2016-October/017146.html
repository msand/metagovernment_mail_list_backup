</I>
What is hard to understand? In any discussion group diverse enough, most topics are not interesting to any given participant (say 70-90% discussions on this list are not interesting to me). Votes on those issues are going to be near random, because only an idiot would spend time carefully figuring out his vote on an irrelevant issue. Do you really not understand that you should only measure distance between people on the issues they care about? 


&gt;<i> (political/moral/technical or whatever other criteria a voter
</I>&gt;<i> typically uses) and IMHO the fact that they don't correlate already
</I>&gt;<i> tells us everything we need to know.
</I>
No, it tells us nothing, which will be proven by (probably) relative infrequency of overrides.


&gt;<i> My prediction is that the number
</I>&gt;<i> of overrides is going to be so small as to be insignificant,
</I>
Which exactly means that people are happy with their delegates, they agree with them on important issues.

</I>
This is the problem: They'd have to either go through a lot of work to
properly anonymize the data for publication, and/or go back and get
permissions from the PP to release it. I'm guessing neither of these
is going to happen.

&gt;<i> b) If (a) is not possible, could you provide some details on the dynamics of
</I>&gt;<i> delegation? Specifically, how often did voters overwrite the votes of their
</I>&gt;<i> delegates? How often did they switch delegates? What was the fraction of the
</I>&gt;<i> sector delegations among total delegations?
</I>
These are good questions, and I'll ask them in my reply to him.

&gt;<i> His answer actually explains a lot:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, we were surprised that there is such a low correlation between
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the past voting decision by delegates and the voting decisions of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> delegee.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Past* voting! This is an example of the well known fact: points distributed
</I>&gt;<i> randomly in a high-dimentional cube are roughly equidistant. In other words,
</I>&gt;<i> if people are indifferent to some questions, they will act as noise drowning
</I>&gt;<i> out the signal. Instead one should measure correlation *after* the
</I>&gt;<i> delegation. That is one should look at how often the votes are overwritten.
</I>&gt;<i> I bet this correlation will be close to 1.
</I>
Again, I'll ask, but I'm guessing you're going to be disappointed:
Past votes should be a reliable indicator of tendencies
(political/moral/technical or whatever other criteria a voter
typically uses) and IMHO the fact that they don't correlate already
tells us everything we need to know. My prediction is that the number
of overrides is going to be so small as to be insignificant, but it
still would be interesting to know whether the participants do
something like remove or change a delegation after it happens.
