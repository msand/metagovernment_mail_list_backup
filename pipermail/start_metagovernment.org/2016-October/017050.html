<PRE>&gt;<i> True, but isn't that one of the things we're here to do, try to find the holes before we fall in them?
</I>Of course. We just disagree where the holes are.
&gt;<i> I might even concede that people are *perfectly* rational, in some contexts, albeit probably mostly artificial environments. The point is not to expect perfect rationality
</I>I was only talking about a degree of rationality (&quot;somewhat rational&quot;). Now you concede that it is OK. I feel like it is these kind of inconsistencies that bother some other people as well.
&gt;<i> &gt; To even start talking about merits of your scientific theory, you need to specify a model that you consider. Please point to where you have done it.&gt; I'm assuming this means that the first few thousand words on matchism.org is not what you're looking for?
</I>Not quite. I tried to read your writeup a few years ago, and again just recently. I have the same problem as before: as I move forward, the amount of unanswered questions keeps piling up. I can give specific examples. You are talking about (sub)optimality of a political system. What is the quantity that you are optimizing? Presumably, it is the ability to achieve &quot;the goals of the people&quot;. How do you quantify it? How do you define the goals of the people? I looked up ahead the &quot;Goals&quot; chapter, but it just gives a laundry list of possible proposals. What is the principle behind composing this list? Should not we combine all goals into one objective to talk about optimality? Or do you want to consider multi-objective optimization?
&gt;<i> &gt; The way I understand your model, your proposed engineering design for dealing with &quot;unequal participation rates&quot; is flawed. But it is pointless to seriously discuss it before you define your model.
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure why that's the case
</I>Very briefly: 1) An active group of organized voters can hijack your system by faking whatever psychological tests you are proposing. 2) Applying L2 norm to the past votes is problematic in many ways.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Scott,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my defense I would only say I prefer science and real (social) engineering
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I brought to your attention a simple theoretical paper justifying use of delegation, you trashed its results on the grounds of some holes in the model.True, but isn't that one of the things we're here to do, try to find the holes before we fall in them?&gt;You basically refused to admit that people possess a degree of rationality. I find it ironic that at the same time you insist on having a scientific discussion.
</I>&gt;<i>I might even concede that people are *perfectly* rational, in some contexts, albeit probably mostly artificial environments. The point is not to expect perfect rationality and design the system so that it works even with these departures. Departures on this mailing list I think can be handled by pointing them out, at least for most people in most case, albeit probably not on the fundamental religious issues (like, whether consensus is a realistically achieveable goal in any real-world public policy debate).&gt; &gt; matchism in particular is a *scientific* theory about how different personalities operate in current systems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To even start talking about merits of your scientific theory, you need to specify a model that you consider.

</I>&gt;<i>Not sure why that's the case: All you need to accept is that different personality types have different voting preferences, saving you a lot of work understanding the specific behavior exhibited by people with high SDO, high RWA, and high scores on any of the tests for psychopathy.&gt; I am not even sure you are reading my posts.I'm not either. Gmail itself said that this message would have ended up in my spam folder except for the existence of that new filter I created that prevented it.
