You SHOULD ask: &quot; how's that working out for the United States?&quot;.  And
the answer is, is that it is failing.

You're being a bit extreme.

&gt;<i> People have the right to self-governance, but not if

</I>&gt;<i> of Hitler, which IMHO in itself should have been considered an act of

</I>&gt;<i> before he became Chancellor (i.e., &quot;Lebensraum&quot;)).
</I>
You are naive.  ANY government of humans (compared to say, robots), is
guaranteed to have social and/or economic instability.  THAT IS NOT
THE PROBLEM.

The problem is when there is no recourse or means to self-correct
(like allowing others to win an election).  The best any government
(cf anarchy) can accomplish and WILL EVER ACCOMPLISH is fairness and
balance *over time*.  Fortunately, governments have that (or can
create it easily).

&gt;<i> Any government
</I>&gt;<i> based on &quot;no reasonable objection&quot; would almost immediately become a
</I>&gt;<i> failed state and so become a burden or even a threat to all
</I>&gt;<i> neighboring jurisdictions.
</I>
In some ways you are right.  The failure is that nothing gets done.
You can compare the success of the metagovernment effort, for example
(very little has been accomplished, but it has hosted a good forum.)

&gt;<i> But since you're apparently another expert on consensus-based
</I>&gt;<i> government, I invite you to try your hand at my &quot;libertarian
</I>&gt;<i> challenge&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong and there's some &quot;magic incantation&quot; that
</I>&gt;<i> will allow that system to work in a general population even though up
</I>&gt;<i> to this point it's has only been shown to work in homogeneous groups
</I>&gt;<i> that share common goals...
</I>
No, I can't give you a magic incantation, because humans ultimately
don't work by rules/laws -- no matter how well crafted.  But I do
invite you to check out this page:

&lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government">http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government</A>&gt;  There you'll see all the
options any libertarian would be PUFFED with for a good while.
