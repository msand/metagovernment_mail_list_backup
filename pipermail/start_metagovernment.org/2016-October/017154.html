Of course it is a significant obstacle. This is how PlaceAVote went out of business. They were thinking just like you, like any other (pure) DD proponent: it is just one click or just a single button.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are protected from doing stupid things. Difference between you and the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Chinese leaders, is that of degree.&gt;

</I>

Slippery slope fallacy was your invoking of &quot;first they came after communists ...&quot; argument to reject using Reddit on the grounds of (pretty much) nonexistent censorship. I am advocating for a transparent and elegant design based on universally accepted ideals (such as &quot;all men are (created) equal&quot;). Unlike you, I am leaving all options available to people, like if they want to try some ad-hoc untested technology like matchism. You, on the other hand, are revealing yourself as a real authoritarian, by declaring it an axiom(!) that people cannot choose their delegates.

Requiring you to open an app and push a *single* button seems to me a
pretty insignificant &quot;obstacle&quot;. Granted, LQFB doesn't even require
this, but then again, we've seen how that turns out...

</I>&gt;<i> No, I prefer that you always cast a direct vote, until you understand why
</I>&gt;<i> this is a problem. But I want to make my voting decisions by any means
</I>&gt;<i> (technologically) possible. Which, by the way, will not be difficult in
</I>&gt;<i> principle (i.e. you will never know how I am casting my &quot;direct&quot; votes via
</I>&gt;<i> Internet), unless you resort to intrusive policing, in the name of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, of course.
</I>
Back in 1996, just as the first web browsers were becoming available,
I wrote an article related to this:
<A HREF="http://www.metacard.com/wp4.html">http://www.metacard.com/wp4.html</A>

The gist of that was that it seemed to me a terrible mistake to allow
information sources to *require* that you use their viewer to get
access to their data. Twenty years later we're finally getting some
standards (like JSON) and tools that allow the kind of thing I was
talking about.

I therefore propose that *eventually* we could standardize and publish
the API such that you'd be able to use whatever front-end you want to
interact with the voting system, including one that auto-voted based
on whatever criteria you want (even, I suppose, turning your vote over
to Donald Trump or some other authoritarian demagogue). How quickly
this happens depends on how many others share your concerns. My
prediction would be that it's going to be below the critical mass
necessary to even get a tool like that built, because that number will
be drastically reduced because once people grok how AutoMatch works
(and I'm not sure you even do yet), they'll agree that it's the better
way. But at least at first, although the API will essentially be
public (open source), there can't be any promises that it won't change
because that might cripple future development of a system that we
really only vaguely understand the requirements for at this point.

&gt;<i> Most people never heard about possibility of delegation and are quite happy
</I>&gt;<i> how they are protected from doing stupid things by the current
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracy. Just like people in China are quite happy how they
</I>&gt;<i> are protected from doing stupid things. Difference between you and the

This is known as the &quot;slippery slope&quot; fallacy. A matter of degree is
*all* the difference unless you're a religious fanatic.
