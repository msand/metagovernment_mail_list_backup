<PRE>Hi Ed,
welcome back, and thanks for jumping in when we needed you. I did not even
thought you were still reading all the posts.

I personally have found myself changing position over the years, where I
value my time much more, I stopped believing everybody is always in good
faith. And as such I would welcome some moderation from time to time. This
being one.

In the past I have participated in other anarchist groups where no
moderation was imposed for a long time. In one case the website did not
even have registration, but you would sign the message with your name (or
any name).

When did it end? When one member got so upset with the childish behaviour
of another member that said to the webmaster and everybody else: &quot;this is
my last message until this changes&quot;.

Now if you refuse to moderate, you are basically letting nature take its
course. Which is fine, but *how many members will this list lose before you
accept to moderate the asocial person that drives them away?*

It's fine if your aim is spiritual advancement. Not so fine if you have a
more pragmatic aim, like making an eDemocracy system that works.

Carlo, I agree with you that the current system does not work. But I do not
like a system that is based upon the assumption that might is right. And
more people are always right.

If you need to decide how to set up a complex moderation system, then use
Vilfredo.
If you need to chose among the various discussion tools, then Airesis will
work well, too.

As always different kind of questions are better solved with different
tools.

Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> whether to turn on moderation but rather on *how* to organize it...
