Wow. Lots of lurkers, then...

&gt;<i> Scott, where do you see this relay? It does not appear in my headers.

</I>
You shouldn't see it from local domain, which sendmail shouldn't route
through the SMTP relay. But I've appended the headers I get to the end
of this message FYI.

&gt;<i> I can contact ASO support, but I would need to know what I am asking them.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Sometimes emails don&#8217;t seem to go through&#8221; isn&#8217;t a very attackable problem
</I>&gt;<i> for a support team, and would invariably just spawn follow-up questions I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot answer.
</I>
Agreed, this is a hard problem, and probably not one they're going to
be very interested in solving (i.e., there's no money in maintaining
mailing lists). Which is why I think we should just move the list to
some domain that does this for other (e.g., academic) reasons.

Anyone on this list have a .edu address from a university that already
has an active set of mailing lists? Seems to me that's probably our
best option (I'm on a couple of lists hosted by brown.edu that are
rock-solid reliable, for example). We might even ask brown.edu: I
don't know if the lists have to be sponsored by someone affiliated
with the university or not...

&gt;<i> As I have noted, I am not opposed to migrating the list. However, I am
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to migrating it to Google. I have very little trust of their
</I>&gt;<i> strategy of providing free services in exchange for intelligence on the
</I>&gt;<i> actions of humanity. All of their initiatives seem to be oriented toward
</I>&gt;<i> collecting this intelligence, and that loses my trust. (It will be
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to see what Wikileaks is about to release on Google.)
</I>
I guess I agree with this assessment in theory, and predict that it's
only a matter time before Google becomes explicitly &quot;evil&quot; rather than
just devious and underhanded like they are now (not that this opinion
prevents me from making extensive of their services: They use me, but
I'm using them too ;-) But, then, I consider *all* advertising to be
unethical manipulation of the very people least aware and capable of
resisting it, and look forward to the day when this kind of abuse
joins exploitation of slaves, workers, women, children, etc. as just
one of the things that we as a civilization have grown out of.
  Regards,
    Scott
