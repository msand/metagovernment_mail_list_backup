Seems like an overkill for such a small group. But if somebody would like to do the work setting up such a system, I am fine with it.
By the way, did you see my comments on the paper that you mentioned:

? Do you have anything to say? Thanks.

Will it actually bring some change?

--- &gt;8 cut here 8&lt; ---

In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
individual can't know what is the best choice.

I understand your allergy against that kind of thinking, but there is
a fundamental difference to representative democracy: In the broken
governance models we experience in western democracies we are told
that the experts and oligarchs know better, but thanks to the power
of corruption that isn't true. Whereas in the liquid democratic
model the temporary leadership arises out of actual reason and is
not corruptible, therefore it is not only okay, it is necessary to
model the failure of the individual to assert what's best for him.

This is my personal guess. Can't say if other LD proponents would
agree and I'm not in a position to write papers on this.

</I>&gt;<i> to be encoded even in the brief intro on the Home page (a hard-won
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot;).
</I>
I bet I would have something to criticize about it but apparently
there is no homepage:

&gt;<i> Although of course I seldom consider that my statements on this list
</I>&gt;<i> represent the opinions of everyone else on it (contrary to Carlos'
</I>&gt;<i> apparent belief), this time it's different: If you don't speak up, I,

You could make social progress if you eliminate your ad hominem
approach. Just because you have a hard time understanding others
gives you no right to dismiss their talking. I have relayed information
and I have tagged personal opinions where appropriate, so you are
once again talking from your behind.

&gt;<i> and possibly everyone else, will consider it to be tacit approval that
</I>
Tacit approval is a dysfunctional model for democracy AFAICT.

&gt;<i> these are things we agree on as necessary axioms for the design of any
</I>&gt;<i> General Purpose government (albeit not necessarily for regulation of
</I>&gt;<i> more homogeneous groups (corporations, political parties, religious
</I>&gt;<i> orders, etc.)):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Legitimate government is of, by, and for The People (i.e., Democracy).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) To achieve #1, it is necessary to have high participation rates in
</I>&gt;<i> government decisionmaking, with a goal being universal participation,
</I>&gt;<i> at least at some level of involvement.
</I>
You're already asking for the moon here, which is a good strategy for
never achieving anything. I would rather reduce it to an open invitation
and a civil right for anyone to get involved, but to respect that a
scary large majority just can't be bothered.

Even among those that adhere to a political party, only some 10% will
actually participate in any way. Most just think it is a cool party
and contribute financially.

The architecture we have to deal with currently has some thousand
people elected into parliaments per nation of which by representative
superstructures like the &quot;eurogroup&quot;, IMF, TTIP negotiators, European
Commission, The Fed, only a ridiculous number of people actually has
real political power while most of the parliamentaries are reduced to
a choice of acquitting what is presented before them or occasionally
block something. It is particularely absurd how so much power comes
together in individuals such as presidents and chancellors.

It doesn't take neither so much revolution nor so much perfection to
already arrive at a hugely better democratic system for humanity,
because even a simple use of liquid democracy would be a great step
forward from the sick condition we are in today. I've seen how those
ten thousand people in one liquid feedback were producing so much
healthier political vision than anything that is coming out of the
EU and the UN that I no longer consider huge numbers an essential,
the thing that counts is that the method works - that we get to make
policy that keeps homo sapiens on this earth without destroying it.

And that means being able to develop sane policy, free from corruption.

&gt;<i> 3) To achieve #2 in a real world environment where people are busy and
</I>&gt;<i> rationally decide not to invest significant time in direct
</I>&gt;<i> participation, some sort of proxy/delegation/representation system is
</I>&gt;<i> a necessary component of any general-purpose democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The primary design goal of this proxy system must be achieving #2,
</I>&gt;<i> with any other goal (tapping into expertise, underutilized resources,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) being a distant second in priority.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Therefore, because the proxy system is merely an expedient, it must
</I>&gt;<i> be designed to facilitate casting the same vote that each voter would
</I>&gt;<i> cast if they had the time/motivation/skills/knowledge/etc. to properly
</I>&gt;<i> and fully investigate and understand the issue at hand.
</I>
No, because the individuals aren't intelligent enough. Collective
intelligence can only manifest itself if the right method is employed
and its apparent injustice is understood as actually being better.
It means putting ideological prejudices aside and understanding why
liquid feedback works, for example.

&gt;<i> Note that the &quot;representative&quot; nature of system doesn't need to be an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit component of the design, it can be an emergent phenomenon.
</I>
The essential difference between &quot;representative&quot; and &quot;proxy&quot; is how
in representative democracy the representative is let off the hook
whereas a proxy stays under the dynamic checks of liquid updating.

&gt;<i> I'm not opposed to a sampling-based system in theory, and indeed would
</I>&gt;<i> concede that it could be far more efficient than the systems in my
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. But I can't see a way to engineer the myriad ways of gaming
</I>&gt;<i> the system out of it, nor am I convinced that The People would even
</I>&gt;<i> trust a sampling-based selection method, given the relatively low
</I>&gt;<i> level of understanding of statistics in the general population.
</I>
Better if the system can take as many people that care to take part?
Currently i see no hard technological limits to impede scaling.
