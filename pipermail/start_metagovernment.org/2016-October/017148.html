<PRE>&gt;<i> I think you're assuming that everyone *did* cast a vote on most or all
</I>&gt;<i> issues, whether they cared about it or not.
</I>
I assumed nothing of the sort, as there were 500000 votes cast by 14000 people on 6500 initiatives. A typical person voted on a small fraction of initiatives.

What I do assume, is that in all kinds of activities participation by people is power-law distributed, with majority of people doing very little. You keep talking about the median 8, but I hope you noticed that the mean is about 35. That tells us that a typical participant was rather passive, even when compared to an average. A typical participant probably had only a vague idea about delegation and did not care looking closer at it.

By the way, this is another good question to ask: how many direct votes were cast by an average voter who ever delegated.

&gt;<i> Although there's no
</I>&gt;<i> way to measure it now, it seems to me that indeed direct votes
</I>&gt;<i> probably *were* only cast for issues the voters cared about.
</I>
There is no reason to expect that. It is far more likely that a typical participant has only a short-lived enthusiasm about the whole endeavor. And by the way, the same power low still applies here: the majority of votes cast by this &quot;lazy&quot; participants were upon a very casual inspection of an initiative. And I would predict that those few votes cast were cast in a relatively short span of time (another thing to look at).


&gt;<i> &gt; Which exactly means that people are happy with their delegates, they agree
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with them on important issues.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is another completely unsubstantiated assumption. 
</I>
I was incorrect here. To check if people agree on important issues we need to know which issues are important to them. Still, there is no reason to expect that most votes were carefully thought out. Remember power laws!

</I>
I think you're assuming that everyone *did* cast a vote on most or all
issues, whether they cared about it or not. With a median of 8 votes
over 3 years, this is almost certainly not true. Although there's no
way to measure it now, it seems to me that indeed direct votes
probably *were* only cast for issues the voters cared about. Which
means they *should* correlate with the votes of the people they chose
as delegates.

&gt;&gt;<i> My prediction is that the number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of overrides is going to be so small as to be insignificant,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which exactly means that people are happy with their delegates, they agree

</I>
This is another completely unsubstantiated assumption. I would predict
that the exact opposite is more likely: That they simply didn't care
about those issues enough to become directly involved. This only means
that voters who didn't override have no idea whether or not their
delegates voted like they would (nor do they care, even though they
really should because otherwise public policy becomes a matter of
&quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;).
