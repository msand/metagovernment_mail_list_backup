I already provided one clear example of that, from the 2015 British
Election Study:
<A HREF="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg</A>

There tons of studies that show the same kind of thing. A good one I
just found the other day is:
<A HREF="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> such predictions will not be inferior to votes of self-selected proxies.
</I>
I think the Kling paper clearly does show this: Correlations there
were lower than any simple ideology/personality model has shown (and
I've read at least a dozen papers on this, and skimmed a dozen or two
more). As of course does the results of most voting for
&quot;representatives&quot; in any republican form of government. I mean,
seriously, poor people who vote Republican in the US? Really? That's a
thing?

But I'll certainly admit that the data on &quot;delegates&quot; and &quot;proxies&quot; in
my use of the term *is* pretty sparse, because other than LQFB there
just haven't been any non-toy runs of any system that has these
features.
  Regards,
    Scott
