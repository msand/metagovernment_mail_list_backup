Where am I going to get the data? You'd have to have hundreds of
people voting on at least dozens of professional-quality proposals
after having completed the same personality inventory to have enough
data to do an analysis, and to be done properly it'd have to be a
truly randomly selected sample (i.e., the usual self-selection system
polling we usually see in polls/experiments on the Internet wouldn't
really tell us anything useful). That's a PhD-scale project. We'll get
the data, eventually, but I see no alternative to bootstrapping based
on theory. Really, if it doesn't work out, IMHO that'd be a
Nobel-prize-quality finding...

&gt;<i> You are saying that you want to do everything right in
</I>&gt;<i> the first attempt, but you have not bothered validating the fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> assumption your theory is based on. And it is not that hard: you just need
</I>&gt;<i> to poll a group of people. Such a poll is probably no more than 1% or .1% or
</I>&gt;<i> .01% of effort you will invest in your project. Why do not do it first?
</I>
I've actually done these kinds of experiments (I have both a Master's
and a PhD in experimental psychology) and can tell you that it's a
*lot* more than 1% of the work it'll take to do the system design and
programming. And it'd all be wasted because that raw data wouldn't be
useful for anything other that publishing a paper about it, whereas if
we collect it using a running system, that system will be off to the
races by the time enough data has accumulated.

I have considered going up to the university here to try to sell some
Master's or PhD candidate on the idea and have them do it, but again
this IMHO is not an efficient use of my time (I'm no longer an
academic and so having my name on a paper is of no value to me, nor do
I have any interest in mentoring and indeed would have some moral
qualms about corrupting some young soul with ideas that would only
harm their chances of getting an academic post in the future). Plus I
don't want to wait that long (it'd take years to run that experiment).

&gt;<i> It is not like everything you assume is always correct. Think how you had to
</I>&gt;<i> reconsider your design based on the numbers from that Mainz paper (.5 vs.6
</I>&gt;<i> or something like that). These numbers, by the way, are very suspicious, and
</I>&gt;<i> you better check how they were obtained. .6 really makes very little sense.
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody delegates his vote to a trusted delegate, why would he bother
</I>&gt;<i> overwriting it 40% of the time? It means he has very little trust in his own
</I>&gt;<i> delegate. Then why does he keep that delegate? If he does not overwrite,
</I>&gt;<i> then correlation should be close to 1. You should really check the raw data.
</I>
OK, I'm convinced: Those number also seemed suspicious to me and I was
considering writing the authors to ask them some questions like this.
I'll go ahead and do that. Here's my list, what else would you want to
know?

1) Of the ~500K votes in the data set, what percentage are direct vs.
delegated votes?

2) Why is there such a low correlation between the direct votes of the
participants and the direct votes of those they choose to delegate to
(as stated in the paper, 0.6 vs 0.5 for participants chosen at
random)? Wouldn't you expect people to choose delegates based on their
ability to *represent* them, not just vote seemingly randomly?

3) Since delegation is so easy to do, why did so few participants
actually do it?

4) How common was dead-ending in the delegation system (a participant
delegated only to someone who never cast a vote nor re-delegated)?

5) You state that the primary role of supervoters was to prevent
stagnation by pushing affirmative voting over the supermajority
requirement. But if this is mainly what they do, why not just dispense
with the delegation feature and lower the supermajority requirement
(to say 55% or 60%)?

6) &quot;Open voting&quot;, where every participant's votes are visible to all
the others, is a necessary characteristic of a delegation system.
There is no mention of this issue in the paper. Was it common to hear
about people who refused to vote publicly because they didn't want to
disclose their position? Did you ever hear of any instances where a
participant's voting record became an issue for debate?

7) Is the actual text of the proposals voted on in your data set
available someplace? It would be good to get some idea of the length
and quality of them, as well as some assessment of how controversial
and substantive they were.

</I>&gt;<i> Sergey
