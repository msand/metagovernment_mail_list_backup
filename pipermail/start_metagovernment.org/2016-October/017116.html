<PRE>These issues were resolved by having multiple DOMAINS of governance.
If one domain doesn't have the decisions that they like, they can move
to another &quot;state&quot; that does.  It's like a fractal.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here are some of my counter-principles to Scott's &quot;Axioms of Government&quot;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's like shooting fish in a barrel: The only thing more pitiful than
</I>&gt;<i> an elitist is a &quot;consensusist&quot; ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (D) A rule of action or choice is justified, and thus valid, only if all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> those affected by the rule or choice could accept it in a reasonable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discourse. (This is the Habermas Discourse Principle.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK, so who defines &quot;reasonable&quot;? If someone says &quot;Abortion is Murder&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> can I conclude that they're not being reasonable and just ignore their
</I>&gt;<i> input?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this isn't really the big problem with the consensusist
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy, which is that it assumes that no decision is preferable to
</I>&gt;<i> one that is made over the objections of some minority in the
</I>&gt;<i> population. This is not only just an irrational position to take, but
</I>&gt;<i> it also displays a really profound ignorance of what the human species
</I>&gt;<i> is really like. People are biologically *programmed* to accept that
</I>&gt;<i> things don't always go their way and to defer to majority opinion.
</I>&gt;<i> It's called &quot;socialization&quot;, and it actually has a significant effect
</I>&gt;<i> on behavior in most primate species and even many social animals even
</I>&gt;<i> less closely related to humans (wolves and elephants are just the two
</I>&gt;<i> most common examples). To cast this feature of humans aside as being
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;unfair&quot; is not only incompetent social engineering, it's also highly
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian (as in &quot;Hey, you don't know what's good for you, we're
</I>&gt;<i> going to protect from having some policy you don't like from being
</I>&gt;<i> inflicted on you even when you're absolutely sure that it's really no
</I>&gt;<i> big deal. Hope you like the status quo!&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> By extension, a population-scale public-matter decision system is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> legitimate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the extent that it produces decisions that are in accord with (D).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Meaning nothing important will ever be decided. Don't we already have
</I>&gt;<i> that with the US congress? In the past year they've only passed a
</I>&gt;<i> total of 24 substantive bills.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anyone can propose anything, on equal footing. (Some must not be more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> equal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than others, either with respect to opportunity to propose or with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> respect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to treatment of proposals proposed.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I've got to wade through all the proposals made by high-school
</I>&gt;<i> students as part of their homework for their civics class and give
</I>&gt;<i> them the same priority as proposals from the Global Manager (the
</I>&gt;<i> equivalent in my system of something like &quot;president of the world&quot;)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A proposal succeeds at the point that it reaches the status of facing no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unresolved objections.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vote-counts do not decide. (&quot;Might makes right&quot; is not a principle that I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buy into. It ignores/overrides (D).)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Exactly. Again, no progress, profound ignorance of human nature.
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately Ned is in such a small minority here that there's no
</I>&gt;<i> chance his opinion will count for anything ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Guesses about what will or will not work are just guesses. Show me your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> test
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> results, and I will show you mine.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, your theory is that if I design an airplane wing with a computer
</I>&gt;<i> (or indeed with a slide rule) and some knowledge of aerodynamics  I'll
</I>&gt;<i> have no better chance of successfully flying than someone who straps
</I>&gt;<i> boards on their arms and starts flapping? Good thing most scientists
</I>&gt;<i> would consider this to be a ridiculous statement or there'd be no
</I>&gt;<i> progress in any of those fields either...
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
