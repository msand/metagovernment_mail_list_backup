Nope.  One thing at a time.  Mailing list.  Does it work as expected?  No.
Why not? False positives on spam.

You have other reasons why it does not work. Ok.. Start another thread.

Do not please wreck this attempt to fix one little problem for which there
is agreed to be a problem and there is many examples where this is not such
a problem and there are experts on call to fix.

And particularly so by pushing Ed's buttons so he has an excuse not to talk
to tech.
