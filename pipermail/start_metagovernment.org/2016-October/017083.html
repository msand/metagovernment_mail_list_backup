Having observed Scott behaviour for longer than you, I would disagree.


&gt;<i> &gt; Now if you refuse to moderate, you are basically letting nature take its

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> Carlo, I agree with you that the current system does not work. But I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not like a system that is based upon the assumption that might is right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And more people are always right.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how any of these two statements are factually applicable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
You do not understand how to apply the might is right?
Or you do not understand how to apply something which is not the might is
right?

The first one is trivial, any voting system where the majority decides.
The second is more tricky, and in a sense this is what we are trying to
solve here. I would say that workable solutions can be Vilfredo,
Sociocracy, and any system where any one can raise an issue that the
majority need to tackle to move on. They tend to work well in small groups,
but not to scale. And of course if we are dealing with moderating a single
person that person must be excluded from being able to force (i.e. voting)
an issue (albeit they can still raise it - proposing).

One temporary compromise might be to use qualified majorities.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you need to decide how to set up a complex moderation system, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you mean collectively deciding the rules for this mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Not the actual list of rules. Vilfredo does not work well on lists of
several items because an item might dominate and eliminate another
absolutely acceptable item. It would work if you split the list into a list
of things that need to be achieved. And for each you run a separate
question. But this is fairly longer, and still it would not solve the
integration problem (one item working coherently with another). For this
maybe Airesis might be better. And there is also a new tool for lists made
by Paolo Valdemarin. But I haven't tested it enough. Actually now that I
think about it it was more to collectively order lists. It came out from a
conversation we had at Ahref years ago.

I was more thinking about using Vilfredo to define the general structure.
Something like: &quot;we should have a wiki, and a discussion board with so many
places. And the discussion board should have those characteristics, and ...&quot;

This is the kind of question for which Vilfredo works really well. Lists?
Naah


&gt;<i> Well, I can tell you rightaway that you will not obtain a single
</I>&gt;<i> applicable rule set but rather several proposals on the Front of
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto. There's at least one person that will not agree with anything
</I>&gt;<i> everybody else could possibly agree upon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Vilfredo has changed a lot in those years. The new Vilfredo (Vilfredo 2) is
very different from the previous version (Vilfredo goes to Athens). Now
people vote on a continuous scale of a triangle. The aim is that if at any
moment you want to order the proposals you can. So the question can be
interrupted at any time. Thus avoiding the &quot;agreement by exhaustion&quot; effect
we use to have on Vilfredo.

One of the things we are experimenting on in Vilfredo, but it is still not
in the run version, is the &quot;blind moderation&quot; (*Ed* pay attention here).
The idea is that we still need to have someone deciding when to move on a
decision, and where to define some threasholds. But the moderator should be
neutral and not part of the discussion. And should just decide based upon
how people vote. In fact the moderator should not even be allowed to read
the proposals. But only see the patterns with which people vote. Eventually
an AI should do this work egregiously.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, did I ever tell you that, after trying out Vilfredo, I
</I>&gt;<i> wrote up Liquid Feedback policies oriented at obtaining similar
</I>&gt;<i> discussion patterns like on Vilfredo (the continuous remixing of
</I>&gt;<i> other people's proposals), but without allowing individuals with
</I>&gt;<i> unconstructive intentions to nuke the process?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am so interested in this I started another thread specifically to discuss
this.


&gt;<i> If you need to chose among the various discussion tools, then Airesis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will work well, too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Probably.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Why not? They have a voting system, and also a blind commenting system. You
don't need much more.


&gt;<i> As always different kind of questions are better solved with different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also wouldn't agree on this statement as the democratic implications
</I>&gt;<i> of tools are relevant and many of them apparently do some aspect well
</I>&gt;<i> but leave out the important rest.
</I>

Which is why they should be applied to different kind of questions
