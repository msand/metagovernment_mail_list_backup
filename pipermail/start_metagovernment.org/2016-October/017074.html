<PRE>This is basically a question of eating our own dogfood. Not in terms of software, but in terms of philosophy.

I do (hypothetically) moderate already, in that if someone starts sending outright commercial spam to the list, I will boot them. But if I take action against someone based on much fuzzier judgements of the content and motivation of their posts, it is very difficult to determine where to draw the line. If I do it based solely only on my own judgement, I am acting as an authoritarian, which I will not do. I am more than willing to moderate (and/or to enable others to moderate) if we have a ruleset that clearly defines what should be moderated.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now if you refuse to moderate, you are basically letting nature take its

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you accept to moderate the asocial person that drives them away?*
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How many will not even start writing to the list in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i> How many will never recommend it to anybody else? I've seen several
</I>&gt;<i> political parties collapse in size and significance because they
</I>&gt;<i> essentially hadn't learned how to do a philosophically correct
</I>&gt;<i> interpretation of the concept of Freedom of Expression and integrate
</I>&gt;<i> it with a sociological architecture that has a chance to scale.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Carlo, I agree with you that the current system does not work. But I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not like a system that is based upon the assumption that might is right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And more people are always right.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't see how any of these two statements are factually applicable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you need to decide how to set up a complex moderation system, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, you mean collectively deciding the rules for this mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i> Well, I can tell you rightaway that you will not obtain a single
</I>&gt;<i> applicable rule set but rather several proposals on the Front of
</I>&gt;<i> Pareto. There's at least one person that will not agree with anything
</I>&gt;<i> everybody else could possibly agree upon.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, did I ever tell you that, after trying out Vilfredo, I
</I>&gt;<i> wrote up Liquid Feedback policies oriented at obtaining similar
</I>&gt;<i> discussion patterns like on Vilfredo (the continuous remixing of
</I>&gt;<i> other people's proposals), but without allowing individuals with
</I>&gt;<i> unconstructive intentions to nuke the process?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you need to chose among the various discussion tools, then Airesis
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will work well, too.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As always different kind of questions are better solved with different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tools.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I also wouldn't agree on this statement as the democratic implications
</I>&gt;<i> of tools are relevant and many of them apparently do some aspect well
</I>&gt;<i> but leave out the important rest.
