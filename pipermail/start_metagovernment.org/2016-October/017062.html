</I>I do not see Ed to be an obstacle. He seems to be fine with whatever the list participants going to decide. I just do not know what it is that they are going to decide. I personally want a moderate convenience, that's it. If somebody fixes the bugs of this list, great! If people move somewhere else, great!

Finally had time to do a little more investigation on this and my
conclusion is that gmail is being a little overzealous in it's
filtering *but* it's not completely out of line here:
1) Your yahoo address is actually a red flag now. It's probably time
to start thinking about switching (rats from a sinking ship!)
2) The hosting service the metagovernment site on is using an EU-based
SMTP relay (mailchannels.net) that looks to me to be set up to
facilitate spam (notably, it is not participating in the various
spam-prevention protocols US-based hosting services are using). Ed
could complain about this and maybe get something done, but I've found
him to be conspicuously unresponsive and unconcerned about the various
failures of metagovernment.org, which again is why I'd propose
replacing him (and then rehosting the site) rather than expecting him
to do anything to address this (or indeed, any other) problem.

If you agree that something needs to be done, please email
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A> and request that he defecate or abdicate
(i.e, shit or get off the pot).
