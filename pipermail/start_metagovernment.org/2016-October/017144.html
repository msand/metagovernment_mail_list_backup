<PRE>&gt;<i> I have a couple of followup questions/comments, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be happy to include any of yours if you're interested
</I>
I guess you wanted me to write my questions explicitly. Here I go:

a) It would be great if you could release the data you analyzed in your work, appropriately modifies to preserve privacy of the participants. The detailed (yet anonymized) voting and delegation data would be particularly of great value. Having proposal and discussion transcripts available would be even better, but we understand that it may be too much to ask. How long do you think it may take to release the anonymized data?


b) If (a) is not possible, could you provide some details on the dynamics of delegation? Specifically, how often did voters overwrite the votes of their delegates? How often did they switch delegates? What was the fraction of the sector delegations among total delegations?

&gt;<i> My big question is: Is there any chance the web site is going to be
</I>&gt;<i> fixed anytime in the near future? I'd like to make formal
</I>&gt;<i> introductions between the groups, but not with us with our pants down
</I>&gt;<i> like they are...
</I>
Yeah, I hate to say it, but it has been a real embarrassment. I do not understand how it does not bother some people. Even if the wiki is resurrected, it kind of not of high quality. It had been neglected long before it went down; a lot of stuff there does not reflect the current views of people who wrote it. It just hangs there.

&gt;<i> 2) He's as mystified as we are about the low correlation between
</I>&gt;<i> voting records and proxy/delegate choice.
</I>

His answer actually explains a lot:

&gt;<i> Yes, we were surprised that there is such a low correlation between
</I>&gt;<i> the past voting decision by delegates and the voting decisions of the
</I>&gt;<i> delegee.
</I>
*Past* voting! This is an example of the well known fact: points distributed randomly in a high-dimentional cube are roughly equidistant. In other words, if people are indifferent to some questions, they will act as noise drowning out the signal. Instead one should measure correlation *after* the delegation. That is one should look at how often the votes are overwritten. I bet this correlation will be close to 1.


&gt;<i> 4) Do we want to ask them to do this dead-end analysis? I'm thinking
</I>&gt;<i> not, mainly because of the very low delegation rate.
</I>
I am curious, but this is not a priority to me. If they release the data, all such questions can be easily answered.


&gt;<i> 7) Do we want to push for release of the text of the proposals?
</I>
Google translated texts could be of some value. But it is really up to them. I will be happy with bare numbers.

&gt;<i> Members typically discovered the
</I>&gt;<i> delegation system over time and if a member gets inactive after voting
</I>&gt;<i> on a few initiatives, we have no delegation in the records. 
</I>

Seems like a huge drawback of non-preferential delegation. Is Carlo reading?


&gt;<i> Activity is power-law-distributed.
</I>
Are Ed and Jacopo reading?

 Subject: [MG] Fwd: Questions about &quot;Voting Behaviour and Power in Online Democracy&quot;
   
Got a response back from the lead author of the LQFB/PP article,
appended to this message (original questions at the bottom, in my
message to him). I have a couple of followup questions/comments, but
I'd be happy to include any of yours if you're interested (i.e., best
I function as ambassador, at least until we can hopefully get him and
some of his colleagues to join this list).

My big question is: Is there any chance the web site is going to be
fixed anytime in the near future? I'd like to make formal
introductions between the groups, but not with us with our pants down
like they are...

My summary analysis of his responses:
1) That's only 15% of the votes delegated (i.e., even less than the
20% I converged on using the data that was available in the article).
2) He's as mystified as we are about the low correlation between
voting records and proxy/delegate choice.
4) Do we want to ask them to do this dead-end analysis? I'm thinking
not, mainly because of the very low delegation rate.
7) Do we want to push for release of the text of the proposals? I'm
thinking yes, particularly if we're willing to do some sort of
quality/vote count analysis (i.e., do the number of votes correlate
with quality/length/complexity/controversial nature of the proposals?)

Hei Scott,

thank you for your mail, I'll answer myself ;)

I just had a look at the database again, so:

1) There were 499.009 direct votes and 428.952 of them were made by
voters without delegations (i.e. voting weight = 1).

2) Yes, we were surprised that there is such a low correlation between
the past voting decision by delegates and the voting decisions of the
delegee. We discussed this and came to the conclusion that there are
other factors than representativeness which play a role when delegating
a vote, i.e. sympathy and popularity. This also would have implications
for the behaviour in a representative democracy -- I think it would be
interesting to check how people agree with the program of the party they
vote for. I expect a similar correlation.

3) The Pirate Party advocates direct democracy, so many members liked to
vote themselves. Additionally, some were not in favour of the delegation
system. And then there is inactivity: Members typically discovered the
delegation system over time and if a member gets inactive after voting
on a few initiatives, we have no delegation in the records. Activity is
power-law-distributed.

4) That is a very interesting question -- my gut feeling tells me that
this never happened, but I might be wrong! In order to check this, I
would have to process all database dumps, i.e. read a dump, query some
table, read the next dump... If you are really really interested, I can
put that on my todo list for end of November.

5) uff, so many questions :D Yes, if you want to introduce a flexible
quorum, you could e.g. lower the quorum over time based on the average
agreement rate. The delegation system just gives some voters a higher
voting weight so that they can push selected initiatives they like.
Lowering the quorum is like pushing ALL initiatives a bit. The rate of
accepted initiatives would be the same for both solutions, though. But
it would influence, WHICH initiatives are successful -- lowering the
quorum is like taking the top-X initiatives of a time period, the
delegation system lets some delegates pick the initiatives which should
pass.

6) The open voting system indeed is an issue. I would guess that there
were some discussions, but unfortunately I am not aware of any.

7) Yes, we do have the text but we still are working on a data privacy
concept to store the dataset at our secure datacenter -- the text of
proposals is very sensitive, as it often reveals the identity of the author.

Thank you for the offer -- yes, as soon as we got permission from the
Pirate Party to release some (anonymised?) part of the dataset, we will
work on further analyses and then we are happy to share the research
ideas from the very beginning with your mailing list :) If you give me
the name of that mailing list, I can also advertise it in my group, as
we do have multiple political scientists who are interested in the study
of democratic systems.

Cheers
Christoph

&gt;<i> I'm writing on behalf on the members of a direct-democracy mailing
</I>&gt;<i> list I'm on regarding your 2015 article &quot;Voting Behaviour and Power in
</I>&gt;<i> Online Democracy&quot;. That paper has been cited many times in our group
</I>&gt;<i> over the past several weeks, but it's become obvious that we're
</I>&gt;<i> unclear on some key issues about how LQFB actually worked in the PP
</I>&gt;<i> runs you used as your dataset.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you can help shed some light on these issues, we'd greatly
</I>&gt;<i> appreciate it. If you're not the best contact to handle this sort of
</I>&gt;<i> inquiry, please feel free to forward this message on to someone more
</I>&gt;<i> appropriate. If you (or your delegate ;-) would prefer to have this
</I>&gt;<i> discussion in German, we have members who can translate these
</I>&gt;<i> questions and your responses to/from English for the rest of the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are the main things we're unclear on:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Of the ~500K votes in the data set, what percentage are direct vs.
</I>&gt;<i> delegated votes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Why is there such a low correlation between the direct votes of the
</I>&gt;<i> participants and the direct votes of those they choose to delegate to
</I>&gt;<i> (as stated in the paper, around 0.6 vs 0.5 for participants chosen at
</I>&gt;<i> random)? Wouldn't you expect people to choose delegates based on their
</I>&gt;<i> ability to *represent* them, not just vote seemingly randomly for them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Since delegation is so easy to do, why did so few participants
</I>&gt;<i> actually do it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) How common was dead-ending in the delegation system (a participant
</I>&gt;<i> delegated only to someone who never cast a vote nor re-delegated)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) You state that the primary role of supervoters was to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> stagnation by pushing affirmative voting over the supermajority
</I>&gt;<i> requirement. But if this is mainly what they do, why not just dispense
</I>&gt;<i> with the delegation feature and lower the supermajority requirement
</I>&gt;<i> (to say 55% or 60%)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6) &quot;Open voting&quot;, where every participant's votes are visible to all
</I>&gt;<i> the others, is a necessary characteristic of a delegation system.
</I>&gt;<i> There is no mention of this issue in the paper. Was it common to hear
</I>&gt;<i> about people who refused to vote publicly because they didn't want to
</I>&gt;<i> disclose their position? Did you ever hear of any instances where a
</I>&gt;<i> participant's voting record became an issue for debate?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7) Is the actual text of the proposals voted on in your data set
</I>&gt;<i> available someplace? It would be good to get some idea of the length
</I>&gt;<i> and quality of them, as well as some assessment of how controversial
</I>&gt;<i> and substantive they were.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, thanks in advance for any light you can shed on these issues,
</I>&gt;<i> including sending any additional references you have for how LQFB
</I>&gt;<i> works in the &quot;real world&quot;. We'd also be happy to review any
</I>&gt;<i> in-progress work anyone there is undertaking: We're apparently pretty
</I>&gt;<i> good at finding any weaknesses or unclear statements in the papers we
</I>&gt;<i> read ;-)
