Good reference. And I wasn't aware of it, which is perhaps a little
surprising considering I actually was in Taiwan for a couple of months
during the period this was happening: It was actually during that
period that my first draft of Matchism (called &quot;The Plan&quot; at the time)
took shape and I actually started writing it down because I was
constantly being bombarded with anecdotal reports of the &quot;lack of
transparency&quot; issues mentioned in that article (although IMHO as it
turns out  this &quot;lack of transparency&quot; is mostly just a euphemism for
&quot;hidden corruption&quot;).

My wife (who is from Taiwan) had heard of the Uber integration
project, so it obviously has (or at least had) some impact, but as far
as she knows that's about the only thing relevant to regular people
that has changed as a result of the operation of this system. We'll be
back there this winter, though, and I'll definitely look into this
further at that time.

&gt;<i> I haven't seen it mentioned here, but it's a large scale operation that
</I>&gt;<i> seems to be succeeding. Even if not exactly what we might envision, makes
</I>&gt;<i> for a good case study I think.
</I>
As I've said (many times) before, I consider projects like this to
actually be harmful to us achieving our goals: They stunt the growth
of any real demand for change by giving the *illusion* of providing
The People with control over public policy without actually providing
them with any real power. In this case, as in the LQFB PP run, the
number of active participants is vanishingly small compared with the
size of the population overall, the result being that it's only a
slightly broader base of SDAPs who end up making all the decisions.

But I do agree that Taiwan would make a very good early adopter of any
proposed new government system: It's a highly educated and
conscientious population with a good mix of respect for tradition and
openness to new ways of doing things. The population is a large enough
size to allow a non-trivial run (unlike, say, Iceland) but homogeneous
and isolated enough that version 1.0 of the new system wouldn't have
to solve all the tribalistic/religious/territorial problems that most
other countries face.
  Regards,
    Scott
