It's worse than that: Sometimes the messages aren't delivered at all.

&gt;<i> 2) someone thinks THE problem is EU based smyp services selected as the

</I>
That's my theory on the Spam problem. Probably doesn't explain the
lost messages, though.

&gt;<i> 3) as I have said here and perhaps not received by you, when I ivestigated
</I>&gt;<i> this problem I found my gmail app on android would flag related posts as
</I>&gt;<i> possibly hostile because their validity scheme did not conform to yahoo's
</I>&gt;<i> standard of validity.  I did this by hovering over one of the emails of one
</I>&gt;<i> of the victims.
</I>
This is evidence that it's not just Gmail that's messing up. There's
something *generally* wrong about how the message headers are being
formed, and/or with the sites along the message path.

&gt;<i> 4) I eventually sent an email to this list suggesting possible causes to be
</I>&gt;<i> ruled out and asking how that might be done with no respose.
</I>
What you asked was probably beyond the skills (or a least time
availability) of the people who would need to do it.

&gt;<i> 5) in the past I also have had to go to he archives to see if my posts have
</I>&gt;<i> been received, which is one reason to avoid this site.
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> 6) has anyone discussed any of this with the techs at the smallorange?
</I>
I'm still in favor of just moving, but hold out little hope for this
actually happening: Ed seems reluctant to take on a leadership role
here and IMHO the only way a move is going to happen is if he emails
the subscriber list to someone who will take it and install it at
another site. I'll volunteer to do the latter (at Google Groups), but
believe it would take an act of god to achieve &quot;consensus&quot; on
approving a move like this unilaterally and approving GG as the
destination. Even so, this all seems fitting to me, as the ultimate
proof of the bankruptcy of Ed's long-held faith that the status quo is
acceptable and that all decisionmaking should occur by waiting for
consensus to arrive spontaneously (albeit magically), rendering it
unnecessary to actually make a decision.

    Scott
