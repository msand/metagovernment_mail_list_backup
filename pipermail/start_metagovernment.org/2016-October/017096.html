<PRE>Hi everyone hi Scott
Einstein teach &quot;Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not
simpler&quot;
I believe your point N3:

3) To achieve #2 (high participation rates in government decision making)
in a real world environment where people are busy and rationally decide not
to invest significant time in direct participation, some sort of
proxy/delegation/representation system is a necessary component of any
general-purpose democracy.

Defy Einstein teaching as a simpler solution

In an ideal world we should care for every one education to understand
issues and solutions to be voted should be objectively synthesized with
facts checking.

Also, in an ideal world the time to read the facts and therefore the time
spent to take decisions should be considered as work and paid or tax
discounted according to minimum wage.

I dispute the simpler assumption that proxy voting/delegation must be
implemented.
It may be an option, and if exercised ( no tax discount! ), the value of
the vote should be &gt;1.
In Pietro's web site there is good analysis on this subject. Unfortunately
he just
renovate the site and I cannot find the article.(
<A HREF="http://home.pietrosperoni.it/">http://home.pietrosperoni.it/</A>)

Please don't tell me that we do not live in an ideal world, I know, but the
system we are looking for is to create one.

I see any delegation and proxy voting as possible cancer that should be not
promoted as necessary.

Very soon in Italy we vote for Constitutional reform I am ashamed just to
read how they present the question. Very little is presented by the
government as facts and this is already unconstitutional!

Regards
Jacopo

&gt;<i> You all don't mind if I actually try to *use* the list to discuss

</I>&gt;<i> I'm still reeling from Carlos' statement that my axiom about
</I>&gt;<i> representation is an outlier and that it's not part of the belief
</I>&gt;<i> system of everyone on this list. But I figured I should write down how
</I>&gt;<i> I get to that one to see if there are others along the way that may be
</I>&gt;<i> problematic. I'm hoping not, since more than one of them seems to me
</I>&gt;<i> to be encoded even in the brief intro on the Home page (a hard-won
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although of course I seldom consider that my statements on this list
</I>&gt;<i> represent the opinions of everyone else on it (contrary to Carlos'
</I>&gt;<i> apparent belief), this time it's different: If you don't speak up, I,
</I>&gt;<i> and possibly everyone else, will consider it to be tacit approval that
</I>&gt;<i> these are things we agree on as necessary axioms for the design of any
</I>&gt;<i> General Purpose government (albeit not necessarily for regulation of
</I>&gt;<i> more homogeneous groups (corporations, political parties, religious
</I>&gt;<i> orders, etc.)):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Legitimate government is of, by, and for The People (i.e., Democracy).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) To achieve #1, it is necessary to have high participation rates in
</I>&gt;<i> government decisionmaking, with a goal being universal participation,
</I>&gt;<i> at least at some level of involvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) To achieve #2 in a real world environment where people are busy and
</I>&gt;<i> rationally decide not to invest significant time in direct
</I>&gt;<i> participation, some sort of proxy/delegation/representation system is
</I>&gt;<i> a necessary component of any general-purpose democracy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4) The primary design goal of this proxy system must be achieving #2,
</I>&gt;<i> with any other goal (tapping into expertise, underutilized resources,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.) being a distant second in priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5) Therefore, because the proxy system is merely an expedient, it must
</I>&gt;<i> be designed to facilitate casting the same vote that each voter would
</I>&gt;<i> cast if they had the time/motivation/skills/knowledge/etc. to properly
</I>&gt;<i> and fully investigate and understand the issue at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the &quot;representative&quot; nature of system doesn't need to be an
</I>&gt;<i> explicit component of the design, it can be an emergent phenomenon.
</I>&gt;<i> For example Ned's Blinap and &quot;Citizen Juries&quot; could both meet the
</I>&gt;<i> requirements of #5 via sampling, which also potentially provides
</I>&gt;<i> proper representation *provided* that the sampling is indeed unbiased.
</I>&gt;<i> That is, it can't be like the US jury-selection system, where not only
</I>&gt;<i> is not everybody in the pool that the samples are taken from, but that
</I>&gt;<i> anyone with half a brain can get out of serving by merely speaking a
</I>&gt;<i> few magic words (mine are &quot;jury nullification&quot; ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not opposed to a sampling-based system in theory, and indeed would
</I>&gt;<i> concede that it could be far more efficient than the systems in my
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. But I can't see a way to engineer the myriad ways of gaming
</I>&gt;<i> the system out of it, nor am I convinced that The People would even
</I>&gt;<i> trust a sampling-based selection method, given the relatively low
</I>&gt;<i> level of understanding of statistics in the general population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that 5 *also* allows for a proper &quot;representative&quot; democracy, the
</I>&gt;<i> trick again being to somehow provide the &quot;representative&quot; part while
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously eliminating all the ways our current misrepresentatives
</I>&gt;<i> (and those who pay to get them elected) have devised to game the
</I>&gt;<i> system. My opinion on this is also that it's practically impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> engineer, leaving anonymous personality-matched proxies as the only
</I>&gt;<i> viable option.
