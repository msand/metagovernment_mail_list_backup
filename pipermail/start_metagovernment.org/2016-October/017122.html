Again, how is that working out for the Syrians? The freedom to leave
is worthless without a guarantee of admittance someplace else. Same
with calling for help: What if no one answers? What if ISIS and Russia
are the only ones who answer?

But all of this is a side issue: The real problem is that you're still
considering moral standards as something that stops at your chosen
border. It's a common mistake, and in fact is a consequence of our
genetically programmed tribalism. But once you get past that (and it
isn't *too* difficult to socially engineer conditioning to ensure that
everyone does), you'll see that the whole concept of &quot;if you don't
like it, leave&quot; is morally and intellectually bankrupt. For example,
given what we now know about its origins and consequences FGM (and to
be even-handed, probably circumcision) is immoral *everywhere*. The
People (of Earth) are just unwilling to try to enforce a ban on it in
central Africa because most people don't consider the residents there
as &quot;people&quot; (in this case it's even harder to justify because of the
racism issue piled on top of the usual tribalism). Again, if someone
is living under a dysfunctional government, it's not just a problem
for them, it's a problem for *all* of us.
  Regards,
    Scott
