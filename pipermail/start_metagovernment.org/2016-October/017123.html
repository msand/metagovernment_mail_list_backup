I guess I wasn't precise enough about degree: Sure, all human
civilizations are going to have these instabilities (some might even
say that's necessary for progress!). But I'm talking about the
life-altering stuff. Something like the &quot;misery index&quot; (unemployment
rate + inflation rate), but also accounting for other quality-of-life
issues: Incarceration rate, murder rate (including executions and
killings in foreign countries by the military), access to basic needs
like food/water/shelter, etc. Add them all up and draw a line that
says &quot;anything above that is inhumane and we all need to pitch in to
do something about it&quot;, even if what's to be done is overthrowing a
dysfunctional government. At present certainly Venezuela, Syria,  and
North Korea would qualify, with the US and China being within spitting
distance, the US mostly because of militarism and inequality issues
(e.g., 1.5 million people homeless in the US for at least part of the
year last year).

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In some ways you are right.  The failure is that nothing gets done.

</I>
Not exactly a ringing endorsement ;-) But, again, I thought it was you
who was advocating for a &quot;no unresolved objection&quot; rule, something
that is very common in the systems we've experimented with. Now you're
agreeing with me that it's *not* a viable rule for general-purpose
government?

&gt;&gt;<i> But since you're apparently another expert on consensus-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government, I invite you to try your hand at my &quot;libertarian
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> challenge&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong and there's some &quot;magic incantation&quot; that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will allow that system to work in a general population even though up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to this point it's has only been shown to work in homogeneous groups
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that share common goals...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I can't give you a magic incantation, because humans ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> don't work by rules/laws -- no matter how well crafted.
</I>
True: Most behavior is governed by instincts (I call them &quot;Clinations&quot;
in the Matchism manifesto) in combination with socialization. These
are like laws, but fully internalized rather than just written down.
The Clinations we can't do much about because they're mostly genetic,
but there's a lot that could be done with socialization given a proper
field of social engineering. We just waste the majority of our effort
teaching kids to say &quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; while mostly ignoring
the need to constrain deprecated Clinations like tribalism and
fearmongering. But the kind of deference and cooperation necessary to
allow a &quot;no unresolved objection&quot; rule to work in any decisionmaking
system are in very short supply in most people's Clinations, and it'd
be *really* hard to condition it into them because there's so little
infrastructure to hang them from. Basically the same reason communism
fails: It's just a poor match to human nature...

&gt;<i> But I do
</I>&gt;<i> invite you to check out this page:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government">http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government</A>&gt;  There you'll see all the
</I>&gt;<i> options any libertarian would be PUFFED with for a good while.
</I>
Citing &quot;governance&quot; per your correction: Sure, it's easy to be
libertarian in a product-development team (especially a software
product team). Where it gets hard is in the real world, where
inconvenient truths arise like the need for taxation and restrictions
on individual freedom for environmental or public safety reasons.
