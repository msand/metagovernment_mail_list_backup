So you already made an ideological choice over science?

As it stands sociology has made it clear that unmoderated mailing
lists cannot function. If your wish to impose ideological choices
on this list is more important than the findings of the various
sources I listed in response to Pietro, than I would assume the
&quot;metagovernment&quot; project cannot fulfil its objectives (taking a
guess at what those are) on ideological grounds, which are known
to be fallacious and impossible to scale.

I perceive such a non-scientific and ideological approach as an
imposition on the group. By refusing to take responsibility you
are making an undemocratic choice against the interests of the
collective.

Theory of democracy is a fascinating topic. It can turn out to
be the opposite of what you thought was right, so it can turn
out to tell you that all the time you thought you were doing
the right thing you were actually doing wrong. And the only way
to find out is by putting ideology aside and looking at the facts.

Not trying to be mean to anyone. 99% of Internet activists thinks
moderation is bad when in fact it is the only known method that
works, that's why 99% of Internet forums fail to function socially.

I would recommend to make metagovernment.org transcend the fallacy
of traditional mailing lists. In order to do so, the question is not
whether to turn on moderation but rather on *how* to organize it...
according to current status of sociological science, which kind of
already figured that out in the 80's. The Internet just hasn't been
paying attention, because sociology doesn't feel like real science
or something like that.
