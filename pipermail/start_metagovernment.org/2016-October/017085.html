<PRE>Agreed Ed. But our dogfood are eDemocracy platforms. No one among us
suggests that a mailing list could be a workable form of government or no
government was workable at all. So basically the dogfood this mailing list
has would be:
Vilfredo (not good for discussion), Airesis (adopted as it is not coming
from here, but workable as it has discussion board I think), candiwi
(pre-alpha), whitehouse 2 (we never managed to install it with Derek) or
liquid feedback (also not good for discussion). Another option would be to
use github.

I wonder if github could be used as a tool for discussion. Just a wild idea.

SO basically we have no dogfood available except maybe Airesis. But Airesis
is basically only implementing a discussion package, so the philosophy is
the standard philosophy from any discussion board (Jacopo might fill us up
on this).

Maybe making a self moderating discussion that scales to any size board
might be a workable aim for this community. Using everything we have
learned from Vilfredo, liquid feedback, airesis (especially the blind
commenting system), candiwi and whitehouse 2 and github.

In the meantime we have no dogfood that supports our philosophy. And the
unmoderated mailing list is not better than the moderated one. They both
don't work.


Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This being one.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem can also arise with people imposing themselves on others
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; while being fully convinced to be acting in good faith. So I would not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consider Scott in bad faith, he just isn't contributing thoughts that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; help the group getting anywhere and has a habit of using manipulative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and insulting wording to achieve a sense of leadership. These are all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very human defects, and it is up to us to have mechanisms that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; deal with it. An unmoderated mailing list is no such mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now if you refuse to moderate, you are basically letting nature take its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; course. Which is fine, but *how many members will this list lose before
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you accept to moderate the asocial person that drives them away?*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How many will not even start writing to the list in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; How many will never recommend it to anybody else? I've seen several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; political parties collapse in size and significance because they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; essentially hadn't learned how to do a philosophically correct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpretation of the concept of Freedom of Expression and integrate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it with a sociological architecture that has a chance to scale.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Carlo, I agree with you that the current system does not work. But I do
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; not like a system that is based upon the assumption that might is right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; And more people are always right.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't see how any of these two statements are factually applicable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you need to decide how to set up a complex moderation system, then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Oh, you mean collectively deciding the rules for this mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Well, I can tell you rightaway that you will not obtain a single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; applicable rule set but rather several proposals on the Front of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pareto. There's at least one person that will not agree with anything
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everybody else could possibly agree upon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; By the way, did I ever tell you that, after trying out Vilfredo, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrote up Liquid Feedback policies oriented at obtaining similar
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; discussion patterns like on Vilfredo (the continuous remixing of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other people's proposals), but without allowing individuals with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unconstructive intentions to nuke the process?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If you need to chose among the various discussion tools, then Airesis
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; will work well, too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Probably.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As always different kind of questions are better solved with different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; tools.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I also wouldn't agree on this statement as the democratic implications
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of tools are relevant and many of them apparently do some aspect well
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but leave out the important rest.
