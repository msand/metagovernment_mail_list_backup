</I>&gt;<i> Scott, there is a huge difference in your assessment on the openness
</I>&gt;<i> measure. Is overall agreement still withing the tolerance? Or does it mean
</I>&gt;<i> that (at least) one of you (Scott or Ned) cannot be trusted on psychological
</I>&gt;<i> profiling?
</I>
Well, neither, probably. The real problem is that Ned doesn't actually
know me other than as a bully shooting down his ideas. I'm sure there
is a skill of assessing people's personality via email/blog
posts/twitter/etc., but it's never going to be anywhere near as
accurate as if you'd actually spent significant real-world time with
someone.

But bottom line I think this kind of discrepancy doesn't matter at
all: AutoMatch is a very convenient feature, but it's only there as an
assistant: If you fill out a delusional inventory form, or try to game
the system by appearing to be someone you're not, it's really only
going to make it less useful for *you, because you'll find the vote it
calculates for you won't match how you'd actually vote (if you took
the time to learn everything you need to know about an issue). It'll
still be useful to people who don't have an agenda other than making
sure their opinions count. In general, your self report will have a
very high correlation with inventories filled out by people who know
you well and so *will* be useful when matched with other people who
are also playing it straight.
  Regards,
    Scott
