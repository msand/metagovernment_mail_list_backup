Not in the US. Registering and protecting a USPTO trademark is a
fairly significant undertaking (been there, done that). But I agree
that registering a domain name gets you probably 95% effective
protection of the name merely as the result of the social-influence it
provides.

</I>
Don't scratch your head: IMHO even applying for patent protection for
a software product is an immoral act and will eventually doom your
project to failure as people like me (and there are a *lot* of us)
will simply reject your proposal as just another attempt to game the
system at the expense of the rest of us.

    Scott
