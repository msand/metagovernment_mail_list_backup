<PRE>Thanks, Pietro &amp; Michal.

Forgot to reply to this one.

Maybe. Who checks on the SMS service? Who checks on the bureaucracy
of servicing accounts? What if the attacker is a nation state that
can fake phone numbers and postal addresses ad lib? One practical
way to tackle this is to have people become members of an association
or political party, so you collectively define procedures for legal
registration, elect officials to run them and judges to check them.

At <A HREF="http://bestbits.net/lf/">http://bestbits.net/lf/</A> somebody seems to have set up a
test implementation. Maybe you can ask for a login there?
Or maybe the Russian Pirates have an instance running? I also
know some Maidan activists in Kiev have been trying out LQFB.

While looking for answers to this question I bumped into
<A HREF="http://www.interaktive-demokratie.org">http://www.interaktive-demokratie.org</A> which lists things that
have happened around LQFB recently I wasn't even aware of.

This &quot;WeGovNow!&quot; thing from London combines LQFB with OSM...
impressive:

I am sure they are not happy about the Facebook Login thing
however... ;)

Here's an interesting paper that works out reasons how some
alternatives to transitive delegations fail to fulfil the
preconditions of liquid democracy:

And then there are other (partial) LD tools that may have a login
to offer like
