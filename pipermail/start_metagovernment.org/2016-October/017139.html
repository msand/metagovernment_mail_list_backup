I simply want that other people were not setting up artificial obstacles in my decision-making (how I decide my vote).

</I>&gt;<i> representative for you being the second major problem
</I>
You really want to save me from myself. I would not mind it, if you were doing it without infringing on my freedom. The moment you choose to limit my options on how I decide my vote, you are infringing on my democratic freedoms. Just like in the current representative democracies.


&gt;<i> No, you'd *always* be able to cast a direct vote, or not vote at all if that's what you prefer.
</I>
No, I prefer that you always cast a direct vote, until you understand why this is a problem. But I want to make my voting decisions by any means (technologically) possible. Which, by the way, will not be difficult in principle (i.e. you will never know how I am casting my &quot;direct&quot; votes via Internet), unless you resort to intrusive policing, in the name of democracy, of course.


&gt;<i> But most people *like* having automatic
</I>&gt;<i> features (automatic updates of their software, automatic transmissions
</I>&gt;<i> and lane-keeping and autobraking in their cars, etc.) and will have no
</I>&gt;<i> objection if they're not only automatic, but are also designed to
</I>&gt;<i> protect you from doing stupid things.
</I>
Most people never heard about possibility of delegation and are quite happy how they are protected from doing stupid things by the current representative democracy. Just like people in China are quite happy how they are protected from doing stupid things. Difference between you and the Chinese leaders, is that of degree.

</I>
Perhaps I wasn't clear. Both of the above are true: By &quot;assistant&quot; I
mean that it will compute your vote and vote for you if you don't do
anything. But at it's core this is a direct democracy system: Nobody
really *needs* an AutoMatch system because they can always cast a
direct vote on any issue. In fact, there would have to be an option to
turn off the AutoMatch feature if that's what you really want to do.

&gt;<i> For example, if I were to choose my own delegate based on my
</I>&gt;<i> own judgment, you would require that I always vote directly. Essentially,
</I>&gt;<i> you wanted to save me from myself (claiming that I will fall asleep),
</I>
&quot;Sleeping&quot; isn't the issue. Being manipulated by demagogues is the
biggest potential problem with simple incompetence at picking good
representative for you being the second major problem (the latter
obviously being a serious problem in LQFB).

&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> like representative democracy proponents, or direct democracy purists. Just
</I>&gt;<i> like them, you were happily infringing on my right to use my own vote
</I>&gt;<i> according to my conscience.
</I>
No, you'd *always* be able to cast a direct vote, or not vote at all
if that's what you prefer. But most people *like* having automatic
features (automatic updates of their software, automatic transmissions
and lane-keeping and autobraking in their cars, etc.) and will have no
objection if they're not only automatic, but are also designed to
protect you from doing stupid things.
