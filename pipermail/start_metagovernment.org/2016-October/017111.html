Yeah, the filing is the easy part. The hard part is paying lawyers to
contact people who try to use the name for something they will claim
is unrelated to your use. Unlike the social-enforcement route, if you
don't aggressively defend your actual trademark the legal system here
will consider it null and void if the time comes to use it when a
completely unambiguous infringement occurs.

&gt;<i> On the other hand, if you do not patent and it can be patented then someone

</I>
Actually that's not true either: Patents can be prevented or even
voided after they're issued by &quot;prior art&quot;. The trick, though, is to
completely disclose what you're doing (open source I would think would
be sufficient) and with an accurate timestamp so that if someone tries
to come along and patent your idea they can't. I used to do this all
the time when I was in the software business: Whenever I came up with
something potentially patentable I'd post a detailed design document
about it on the MetaCard mailing list, the archives of which would
serve as a prior-art database should someone else come along and try
to use my idea against me or my company (my allergy to software
patents having developed some 30 years ago...)

&gt;<i> So the bullying threats do not solve much for you.  On the other hand, I do
</I>&gt;<i> not remember saying you should patent anything.  Also jump to conclusions
</I>&gt;<i> based on ideology and reading comprehensive sound, ah, like a religious
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  Or maybe a troll or a shill.  The defense here is accessible prior
</I>&gt;<i> art and  changes in the patent office. There are organizations that collect
</I>&gt;<i> prior art and on your side.  I am not expert on that.  So   there is choice
</I>&gt;<i> of copy left and cc variations to work on before worrying much about
</I>&gt;<i> patents.  Also getting rich can be useful.

Agreed, unfortunately I'd have to recommend choosing a different field
to work in if this is the goal: Even the workflow and collaboration
market is completely saturated by now and it'd be tough to even
survive trying to market a decisionmaking-assistance product. Not to
mention the problems that would occur if you actually tried to market
your system as an *actual* government: Google tentacles
nothwithstanding I don't think the world is ready to turn over public
policy decisionmaking to a corporation or indeed any system with even
a hint of proprietary interest in it.
  Regards,
    Scott
