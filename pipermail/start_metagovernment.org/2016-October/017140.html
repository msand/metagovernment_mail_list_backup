1) Do you agree with the assessment?
Mostly. I also feel self-reporting bias plays a significant role.
2) Would you be concerned about having this information become public?
As things stand, no. But if a lot of people believed the personality test
could predict my behaviour in specific situations, that would become a
concern. I might also answer differently if I were concerned about public
judgement.

</I>&gt;<i> freedoms. Just like in the current representative democracies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, you'd *always* be able to cast a direct vote, or not vote at all if
</I>&gt;<i> that's what you prefer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I prefer that you always cast a direct vote, until you understand why
</I>&gt;<i> this is a problem. But I want to make my voting decisions by any means
</I>&gt;<i> (technologically) possible. Which, by the way, will not be difficult in
</I>&gt;<i> principle (i.e. you will never know how I am casting my &quot;direct&quot; votes via
</I>&gt;<i> Internet), unless you resort to intrusive policing, in the name of
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, of course.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But most people *like* having automatic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; features (automatic updates of their software, automatic transmissions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and lane-keeping and autobraking in their cars, etc.) and will have no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; objection if they're not only automatic, but are also designed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; protect you from doing stupid things.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Most people never heard about possibility of delegation and are quite
</I>&gt;<i> happy how they are protected from doing stupid things by the current
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracy. Just like people in China are quite happy how
</I>&gt;<i> they are protected from doing stupid things. Difference between you and the
</I>&gt;<i> Chinese leaders, is that of degree.

</I>&gt;<i> Still seeing your messages get &quot;unspam-filtered&quot; by that gmail filter

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But bottom line I think this kind of discrepancy doesn't matter at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; all: AutoMatch is a very convenient feature, but it's only there as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; assistant:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is something new. Until recently you were insisting that other
</I>&gt;<i> means of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; choosing delegates (other than your matching system) would be at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; disadvantage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps I wasn't clear. Both of the above are true: By &quot;assistant&quot; I
</I>&gt;<i> mean that it will compute your vote and vote for you if you don't do
</I>&gt;<i> anything. But at it's core this is a direct democracy system: Nobody
</I>&gt;<i> really *needs* an AutoMatch system because they can always cast a
</I>&gt;<i> direct vote on any issue. In fact, there would have to be an option to
</I>&gt;<i> turn off the AutoMatch feature if that's what you really want to do.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, if I were to choose my own delegate based on my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; own judgment, you would require that I always vote directly. Essentially,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you wanted to save me from myself (claiming that I will fall asleep),
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Sleeping&quot; isn't the issue. Being manipulated by demagogues is the
</I>&gt;<i> biggest potential problem with simple incompetence at picking good
</I>&gt;<i> representative for you being the second major problem (the latter
</I>&gt;<i> obviously being a serious problem in LQFB).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like representative democracy proponents, or direct democracy purists.
</I>&gt;<i> Just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like them, you were happily infringing on my right to use my own vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; according to my conscience.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you'd *always* be able to cast a direct vote, or not vote at all
</I>&gt;<i> if that's what you prefer. But most people *like* having automatic
</I>&gt;<i> features (automatic updates of their software, automatic transmissions
