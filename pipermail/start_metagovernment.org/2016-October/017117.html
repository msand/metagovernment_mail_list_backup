How's that working out for the Syrians? I also consider the above
statement to be morally irresponsible: If we saw some
city/state/country actually vote to try this, I'd have to vote for
replacement of that government, by force if necessary, to save them
from themselves. People have the right to self-governance, but not if
it virtually guarantees political or economic instability (or election
of Hitler, which IMHO in itself should have been considered an act of
war by the nations he had already disclosed were in his sights even
before he became Chancellor (i.e., &quot;Lebensraum&quot;)). Any government
based on &quot;no reasonable objection&quot; would almost immediately become a
failed state and so become a burden or even a threat to all
neighboring jurisdictions.

But since you're apparently another expert on consensus-based
government, I invite you to try your hand at my &quot;libertarian
challenge&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong and there's some &quot;magic incantation&quot; that
will allow that system to work in a general population even though up
to this point it's has only been shown to work in homogeneous groups
that share common goals...
