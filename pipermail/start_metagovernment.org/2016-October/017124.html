<PRE>Surely the auto-match system needs to be a little more complicated than
signing up to Facebook.

If it's a psychological match you'd presumably need to ask a lot of
questions to get some variety in the matches, and not have determined boxes
we fall into. How would these questions be chosen?

Are you assigned a different match for each vote dependent on the closest
match you have who bothers to cast?

Would users have a 'block future matches' button if they didn't agree with
the decisions that their match chooses?

I think I'm in agreement with this strategy. But the auto-match
system would have to be comprehensive and verifiable and so I worry others
might then consider it too invasive and not bother filling out a survey at
all.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; give rise to some discussion?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Will it actually bring some change?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possibly: As I said before, your linking to that article on LQFB had a
</I>&gt;<i> profound effect on my thinking about the issue of delegation, albeit
</I>&gt;<i> with the opposite effect to what you intended...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; --- &gt;8 cut here 8&lt; ---
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; individual can't know what is the best choice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still not sure I follow this. My response to it last time was to
</I>&gt;<i> claim it was just an endorsement of elitism, but reading it again is
</I>&gt;<i> it possible that it's &quot;the wisdom of crowds&quot; you're appealing to? It
</I>&gt;<i> all has a kind of mystical/religious feel to it. What *exactly* do
</I>&gt;<i> these supervoters do that makes them such an essential part of the
</I>&gt;<i> system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (snip)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tacit approval is a dysfunctional model for democracy AFAICT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oooh, don't let Ed hear you talking like that ;-) In fact, &quot;tacit
</I>&gt;<i> approval&quot; is by far the largest factor in our current
</I>&gt;<i> misrepresentative democracies and I would admit is even a fundamental
</I>&gt;<i> characteristic of my proposal. The major difference being the group
</I>&gt;<i> and position you're &quot;approving&quot; of when you don't take direct action:
</I>&gt;<i> In misrepresentative democracy, and indeed IMHO in LQFB, you're
</I>&gt;<i> approving of the SDAPs/Activerts whereas in AutoMatch through inaction
</I>&gt;<i> you're only approving of the position of the proxies who have been
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically matched to you...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) To achieve #1, it is necessary to have high participation rates in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; government decisionmaking, with a goal being universal participation,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; at least at some level of involvement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; You're already asking for the moon here, which is a good strategy for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never achieving anything. I would rather reduce it to an open invitation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and a civil right for anyone to get involved, but to respect that a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; scary large majority just can't be bothered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence AutoMatch. It's not only not asking for the moon, it's about as
</I>&gt;<i> easy as signing up for Facebook. And you only have to do it once in
</I>&gt;<i> your life and then everything is handled for you from then on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Even among those that adhere to a political party, only some 10% will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; actually participate in any way. Most just think it is a cool party
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and contribute financially.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ever hear of &quot;Straight Ticket Voting&quot;? It's still very common here in
</I>&gt;<i> the US, where people who know nothing at all about many or even all of
</I>&gt;<i> the candidates will just vote based on the D or R after their names.
</I>&gt;<i> After FSOG my guess is that it's ballpark about 50% of voters, e.g.,
</I>&gt;<i> see:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/pdfs/straightticket.pdf">http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/pdfs/straightticket.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The architecture we have to deal with currently has some thousand
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; people elected into parliaments per nation of which by representative
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; superstructures like the &quot;eurogroup&quot;, IMF, TTIP negotiators, European
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Commission, The Fed, only a ridiculous number of people actually has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; real political power while most of the parliamentaries are reduced to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a choice of acquitting what is presented before them or occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; block something. It is particularely absurd how so much power comes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; together in individuals such as presidents and chancellors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed! My proposal for &quot;Managers&quot; grant them far less power (they can
</I>&gt;<i> only implement the policies, not define them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It doesn't take neither so much revolution nor so much perfection to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; already arrive at a hugely better democratic system for humanity,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because even a simple use of liquid democracy would be a great step
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; forward from the sick condition we are in today. I've seen how those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ten thousand people in one liquid feedback were producing so much
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; healthier political vision than anything that is coming out of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; EU and the UN that I no longer consider huge numbers an essential,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the thing that counts is that the method works - that we get to make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; policy that keeps homo sapiens on this earth without destroying it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And that means being able to develop sane policy, free from corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also agreed: LQFB would be a great improvement over our current
</I>&gt;<i> system. But since it's still deeply flawed and if we're changing
</I>&gt;<i> systems anyway, why not design something even better, learning from
</I>&gt;<i> the mistakes made by the designers of LQFB?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; No, because the individuals aren't intelligent enough. Collective
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; intelligence can only manifest itself if the right method is employed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and its apparent injustice is understood as actually being better.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It means putting ideological prejudices aside and understanding why
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; liquid feedback works, for example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, &quot;works&quot; is a fairly large exaggeration of what has actually been
</I>&gt;<i> shown. Even in the homogeneous groups tested to date the low turnout
</I>&gt;<i> and poor voter/delegate voting correlation tells me that it would have
</I>&gt;<i> the same problems as misrepresentative government if anyone actually
</I>&gt;<i> tried to use it on the general population (that is, the SDAPs would
</I>&gt;<i> end up making all the decisions). It's probably even worse than that:
</I>&gt;<i> Because the samples tried so far are all high-openness personality
</I>&gt;<i> types, it's quite possible that LQFB would fail to work even for
</I>&gt;<i> homogeneous authoritarian groups because the ability to game the
</I>&gt;<i> system (via demogoguery, in particular) would be so much more commonly
</I>&gt;<i> exploited by people from that kind of population. Please reread
</I>&gt;<i> Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiment and try to imagine how
</I>&gt;<i> individuals would be able to find and exploit these weaknesses in
</I>&gt;<i> LQFB, particularly if you mixed in some double-highs as he did (who do
</I>&gt;<i> you think would end up with all the delegations?):
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I'm not opposed to a sampling-based system in theory, and indeed would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; concede that it could be far more efficient than the systems in my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; proposals. But I can't see a way to engineer the myriad ways of gaming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the system out of it, nor am I convinced that The People would even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; trust a sampling-based selection method, given the relatively low
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; level of understanding of statistics in the general population.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Better if the system can take as many people that care to take part?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Currently i see no hard technological limits to impede scaling.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed: I certainly plan to design for the eventuality that 10 billion
</I>&gt;<i> people could cast direct votes, or that only a few thousand do and the
</I>&gt;<i> rest use those people as proxies. Direct sampling would save a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> CPU cycles (you might only need to sample a few hundred individuals
</I>&gt;<i> to, e.g., make a policy on abortion), but with the downside being that
</I>&gt;<i> few humans would trust the results because most people simply don't
</I>&gt;<i> grok statistics.
