<PRE>Thank you for the useful answers to five of the six questions

Small orange does have a chat support as well as email support.

Here is a different question:

How many names on the mailing list?

Hmm.  Accurate to one significant digit.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me try to reason with you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do so under the thought that you are not very technical.  I am
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I think you should figure out some things before you do random
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;fixes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Correct me in line please.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) you state that the problem is things end up in the spam folder.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's worse than that: Sometimes the messages aren't delivered at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) someone thinks THE problem is EU based smyp services selected as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's my theory on the Spam problem. Probably doesn't explain the
</I>&gt;<i> lost messages, though.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) as I have said here and perhaps not received by you, when I
</I>&gt;<i> ivestigated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this problem I found my gmail app on android would flag related posts as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibly hostile because their validity scheme did not conform to yahoo's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard of validity.  I did this by hovering over one of the emails of
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the victims.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is evidence that it's not just Gmail that's messing up. There's
</I>&gt;<i> something *generally* wrong about how the message headers are being
</I>&gt;<i> formed, and/or with the sites along the message path.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I eventually sent an email to this list suggesting possible causes to
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ruled out and asking how that might be done with no respose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you asked was probably beyond the skills (or a least time
</I>&gt;<i> availability) of the people who would need to do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) in the past I also have had to go to he archives to see if my posts
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been received, which is one reason to avoid this site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6) has anyone discussed any of this with the techs at the smallorange?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still in favor of just moving, but hold out little hope for this
</I>&gt;<i> actually happening: Ed seems reluctant to take on a leadership role
</I>&gt;<i> here and IMHO the only way a move is going to happen is if he emails
</I>&gt;<i> the subscriber list to someone who will take it and install it at
</I>&gt;<i> another site. I'll volunteer to do the latter (at Google Groups), but
</I>&gt;<i> believe it would take an act of god to achieve &quot;consensus&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> approving a move like this unilaterally and approving GG as the
</I>&gt;<i> destination. Even so, this all seems fitting to me, as the ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> proof of the bankruptcy of Ed's long-held faith that the status quo is
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable and that all decisionmaking should occur by waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> consensus to arrive spontaneously (albeit magically), rendering it
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary to actually make a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
