Agreed. But back to your original point, you were trying to make the
claim that there was something beneficial, or at least not
misrepresentative, about allowing voters to chose their proxies. I'm
still not seeing any evidence for that.

&gt;<i> By the way, this is another good question to ask: how many direct votes were
</I>&gt;<i> cast by an average voter who ever delegated.
</I>
I'll add it to the list. Along with your (and my) requests for more
information on how delegation was actually used:
1) What was the median, mean, and max number of delegations by
individual voters?
2) What was the median, mean, and max number of delegation *changes* by voters?
3) Did people actually use the feature where you could delegate by domain?
4) How often did people override their delegate's vote?
5) How often did people set up a delegation and later stop using that
system entirely?
6) Any correlation between #4 and #5?

&gt;<i> There is no reason to expect that. It is far more likely that a typical
</I>&gt;<i> participant has only a short-lived enthusiasm about the whole endeavor. And
</I>&gt;<i> by the way, the same power low still applies here: the majority of votes
</I>&gt;<i> cast by this &quot;lazy&quot; participants were upon a very casual inspection of an
</I>&gt;<i> initiative. And I would predict that those few votes cast were cast in a
</I>&gt;<i> relatively short span of time (another thing to look at).
</I>
Agreed, and again, hence AutoMatch. We need to keep those
fad-following voters in the system so that they can continue to be
represented even if they totally stop participating directly.
  Regards,
    Scott
