&gt;<i> One thing I know does work: if a message erroneously appears in your spam

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
even better set up a positive filter that moves every metagovernment
message to the inbox. I have it for both Vilfredo and metagovernment
(although I specify that the filter should be ignored for messages from
Carlo Von Lynx ;-) ).


&gt;<i> Now if the problem is that list messages are completely disappearing, that
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a valid support request.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>When this happened to Vilfredo they were refused by google. Basically
modern emails need to specify the domain they are coming from, and give a
domani key which should be the cryptographically linked to the one you
specify in the DNS.

I stored all this info here:
