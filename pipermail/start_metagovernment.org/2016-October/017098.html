I'm not even sure I'd call this an &quot;ideal&quot; world, since it would have
to be populated by some species other than homo sapiens. I'm trying to
devise a system that'll work for *us*, not some idealized species that
are all rational and all have the *interest* (not even counting for
the time) to fully participate in decisionmaking. It's not just about
the money: Some people just can't or won't do this stuff almost
*regardless* of how much you pay them. Not to mention the loss of
freedom required to *force* them to do it: What you propose to me
sounds like a military draft on steroids, and would be a lifelong
commitment, not just a 2 or 4 year hitch.

Of course this does bring up the possibility that some personality
types, because of the very nature of the people who have them, will be
underrepresented by direct voters in my proposal. It's an empirical
question, but my educated guess is that this not going to be a
problem: While it's true that e.g., LO/HC individuals (conservatives
and authoritarians) have a higher-than-typical motivation to
participate, I believe I've read posts from (or even met) individuals
who range along all of the dimensions who are interested enough in
politics in general to cast direct votes that can be used for proxy
matching. The nice thing about using sampling for proxy selection is
that even if there are only a handful of e.g., LC/LO/HA/LN individuals
who will bother to take the time to direct vote, that'll be enough to
allow the rest of them to get proper representation.

&gt;<i> Please don't tell me that we do not live in an ideal world, I know, but the
</I>&gt;<i> system we are looking for is to create one.
</I>
Agreed. But I think we also need to be mindful of the bootstrapping
problem: It may not be possible to get directly to an &quot;ideal world&quot;
from where we are now (e.g., coming up with the money to implement
paid voting I consider to be a non-starter). So some intermediate form
of government will be necessary to get us moving in the right
direction. I recall having a conversation with Ned about Blinap,
complementing him on it's greater efficiency than anything I'd
proposed, but still having reservations about whether it was possible
to implement it directly from our current system. A sampling-based
system may be government 4.0, but we're stuck at 2.0
(misrepresentative democracy, which is at least a big improvement over
1.0 which is monarchy/dictatorship) and there's too much education and
social engineering necessary to get directly to 4.0 that we'll need a
3.0 (e.g., automatch) at least as an intermediate step.

&gt;<i> I see any delegation and proxy voting as possible cancer that should be not
</I>&gt;<i> promoted as necessary.
</I>
Agreed that it is potentially dangerous, which is why we need to
carefully consider all the risks and minimize them as much as we can.
Which is why we're having this discussion...

&gt;<i> Very soon in Italy we vote for Constitutional reform I am ashamed just to
</I>&gt;<i> read how they present the question. Very little is presented by the
</I>&gt;<i> government as facts and this is already unconstitutional!
</I>
Hey, it's the same thing here! I can't believe even the low quality of
the referendums. There are a whopping 13 of them (4 city, 9 state) we
get to vote on next month (a record, I think). Such a wasted
opportunity. Ironically, one of the referendums is about making it
much harder to get things on the ballot at all ;-)
