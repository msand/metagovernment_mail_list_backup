<PRE>May be beating a dead horse, but I'd still like one of the
consensusists on the list (i.e., Ned) to explain to me how it would
work in a real-world example. You could pick abortion or gun control
or welfare or immigration or minority rights/treatment, but I'd prefer
you show how that most fundamental of government practices, taxation,
would work:

Say I'm a radical libertarian and believe to my very core that
taxation is a form of coercion and is therefore an unacceptable
infringement on my liberty. A proposal comes up that requires taxation
to fund. How does this issue get resolved while adhering to the &quot;no
unresolved objections&quot; requirement:

1) All proposals that require taxation fail.

2) All proposals have an exclusion such that libertarians do not have
to pay taxes.

3) The libertarians are all declared &quot;unreasonable&quot; and their
objection is overruled.

If you pick #3, you also have the onus to describe who decides what is
unreasonable and what procedure they use to do that.

I eagerly await enlightenment.
  Regards,
    Scott
