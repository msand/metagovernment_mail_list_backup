<PRE>A: Has anyone heard of a word for the difference between a net
governance system that's based on having politicians verses completely
removing them?

B: Also I'm curious if anyone else's been noticing way more resonance
on the net in regards to net democracy? What's goin on with the
coalition page? I'd love to see that thing back up...

And the good news: I've been finding ways to showcase my own design
innovations for net democracy. I'm just on the verge of making it
public but understanding what I'd need to do to effectively copy-left
something at the mockup stage has proven difficult. Is CC the best
option 'pre-code'?
