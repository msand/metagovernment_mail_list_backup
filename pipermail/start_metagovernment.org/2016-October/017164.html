This may be expecting a lot, since it's been 25 years since I took a
statistics class and at least 20 since I ever actually did any
analysis, but I'm game. I look forward to seeing your stab at this...

&gt;<i> The second reference is especially useful, because it can tell us something
</I>&gt;<i> about the predictive power of the model you are proposing. Based on it, I
</I>&gt;<i> believe, we can estimate answer to the following question. Imagine we have a

</I>&gt;<i> people from the overrepresented subgroup if you need). Now take their big-5
</I>&gt;<i> profiles and use them as best as you can to predict their affiliation (lib
</I>&gt;<i> or con).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Question: based on the paper, what success rate of your prediction you can
</I>&gt;<i> hope to achieve? (It is anywhere from 50% to 100%; the former is a fully
</I>&gt;<i> random prediction, the latter is the perfect prediction.)
</I>
I think it's not possible to quantify this with the analysis they've
provided. What they do provide is this (Results section of Study 1),
the paper again is
<A HREF="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf:">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf:</A>

&quot;A regression analysis was first conducted using each of the broad Big
Five domains to predict political party preference. The overall model
significantly predicted party preference, F(5, 425) = 10.11, p &lt; .01&quot;

What this says is that measuring 425 subjects on 5 variables there is
less than one chance in a hundred that the accurate prediction of
party affiliation from this model is due to some random characteristic
of the data. This is actually a very robust result: The usual criteria
in psych experiments is p &lt; 0.05 with Fs in the 4-5 range.

Unfortunately what it *doesn't* tell us is what you want to know,
which is the inverse: Given 5 values for some person chosen at random
what percentage of the time will you get their party affiliation
right? The reason why this is a different question is that we don't
know what the distributions along those dimensions are. For example
it's possible that the model can predict with 100% accuracy those
individuals with exceptionally high or low values on one or more
dimensions, but if the majority of people don't have such extremes it
will kill accuracy in the inverse case even though this wouldn't
significantly reduce the F result from the model. My response to this
is: If there are a lot of people who are &quot;average&quot; on all 5 dimensions
it probably doesn't *matter* how good their matches are because their
votes will *always* appear to be random WRT their Big 5 scores or
indeed any other ideology/personality measure . The AutoMatch system
will still work in that case, it just won't work any better than just
randomly sampling (i.e., it's equivalent to Ned's Blinap sampling
proposal for those kinds of people). Which, upon thinking about it,
may even turn out to be quite good: If the voting pattern of these
&quot;normals&quot; turned out be perfectly rational instead of being driven by
their ideologies, they'd be matched to other &quot;normals&quot; and a rational
vote would end up being cast for them.

I also note two things that make even this analysis incomplete and
that what I actually propose to do I predict will have even stronger
results:
1) I'm not proposing to predicting just party affiliation, but rather
direct votes on the issues. Party affiliation is fuzzy, being
influenced by things like environment, family tradition, etc. People's
direct votes on things like gay rights are going to be far more
correlated with their Big 5 scores than even their party affiliation.
For example: Believe it or not, there are actually significant numbers
of gay Republicans in the US, my prediction being that AutoMatch would
distinguish gay Republicans from the others by personality (studies
show that there are correlations between Big 5 scores and sexual
orientation) and match them accordingly.
2) I'm planning to do the matches using the raw scores rather than
after preprocessing to Big 5 dimensions. This gets at what are called
&quot;aspects&quot; or &quot;facets&quot; of personality that the preprocessing
eliminates. You see some of this in Study 2 in the Hirsh paper (Table
2, for example).

&gt;<i> And a related question: what minimum success rate (in the previous question)
</I>&gt;<i> you would like to have to consider your method useful? Give a specific
</I>&gt;<i> number please.
</I>
I'd be happy with anything over 50%. The problem is that the votes of
our existing mispresentatives are *negatively* correlated with The
Will of The People. Anything that convinces people to abandon the idea
of choosing their representatives, particularly if they're only given
a very limited selection of potential delegates, will be a huge
improvement over what we have now. This of course even includes LQFB,
even though the delegate correlation was only 60% in the PP run. The
main advantage of AutoMatch over LQFB in that case being shifted to
the disenfranchisement issue: At best only 15% of the people were
being represented by delegates in LQFB (and that's an overestimate
because it doesn't count dead ends) meaning that most people's
preferences simply weren't taken into account at all.

My hopes, of course, are much higher and at this point I'd be willing
to predict a better than 90% accuracy rate on issues with high
correlation to ideology (welfare, immigration, etc.), again at least
for people who have high or low values on one or more of the Big 5
dimensions. I've never seen any actual data on this, but my sense from
reading the forums is that the early adopters will nearly all have
this characteristic.

Oh, and I also recommend that paper as an introduction to MFT, which
is another inventory that could be used to do the matching. I'm
inclined to not use it, at least at first, because although it might
be a little better at detecting ideological differences than Big 5, my
sense is that it's more likely to miss things that Big 5 captures that
may turn out to be important for vote matching. It also hasn't been
studied nearly as much and so may have other undesireable
characteristics. Nevertheless if you ever need to design a system that
has delegation, it's something you need to know about and so I also
recommend the following, which shows kind of a &quot;real world&quot; data
analysis using MFT:
