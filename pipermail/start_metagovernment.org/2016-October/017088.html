<PRE>I post here but could be also in the List management thread and in the
Metagovernment Airesis group forum
if there is a way to unite all this methods in one, that can be feasily
followed by all!....?

  I try to respond giving the status of the Airesis project.
Tecnologie Democratiche the association that sponsor and promote like
Metagovernment alternative edemocracy platform including Airesis as the
internal project, is in a critical stage due to lack of human and economic
resources. This summer our main programmer give up to concentrate on other
projects and the group sadly  is stalling because we do not have and we did
not find other programmers to continue the development. The server hosting
is paid untill june 2017, but we turn off the testing server where new
versions trial and debug is done to cut on expences.

The methodology of the decisional is proven effective and moderation was
never implemented, an open forum is the starting point ( for my point of
wiew worked better than the mailing list) of any debate. The mailing list
is where general communication and the forum notification are directed so
that we can follow more debates. If the debate reach the point where a
decision should be taken, any one (becoming relator) can open a proposal
where the debate is focused on outline solutions.  Solutions are the result
of a forum like debate where each contribution is evaluated by the
participants and when positively evaluated the relator &quot;should&quot; (point that
must be automated) integrate in the solutions debated.
this is managed by each paragraph. Once is integrated is removed from the
proposal debate to let the participants  focus on the latest contributions.
Once no more solution are found the next step is voting using the
appropriate system, majority for yes/no and Shulze for multiple choices
(and we envision other method for each decisional characteristics, even
Vilfredo can be used if consensus is needed or median for deciding a value
etc etc). If every one stick to the methodology we see a very effective and
fast decision making.  The process is dynamic  as the new decision can be
immediately discussed in the forum and if problem emerge due to
implementation the whole process can be restarted.
For brevity  i did not mention all the options that can be set in the
decisional process.
Quorum setting, time constraint etc, without mention also the group
management functions and working areas where subgroup may discuss and take
low level decisions. But this is for very large groups. Many of you have
administrative rights in the metagovernment testing group that was set for
the purpose to evaluate the platform.

I conclude this report with an invitation to unite efforts  to build
democratically one platform and to converge effort to make it the best
platform and the most easy to use, modular an with all the necessary
options  so that the flexibility  make the platform dynamically  adaptable
to  any scenarios.

If our intrinsic intelligence became the divisive  and therfore  become the
limit to our evolution then we cannot called intelligence.  We as a group
can overcome this and look for the convergence tho bring just ONE plarform
to succeed.
I am thinking globally for the benefit of humankind.
I start to feel like  there is a conspiracy to prevent such an effort from
succeeding.
Only people interested to communal and i may say even comunistics interest
can achieve this.
