Again, it only requires clicking that button if you want do the
equivalent of turning off stability control, which anyone who knows
anything about cars can tell you is a stupid thing to do. I await the
day when people will realize that choosing your own delegates is
equally stupid because that's exactly what the science tells us (the
election of Hitler as dictator with an 88% supermajority and the
forty-plus percent of Americans who are planning to try to elect a
narcissistic psychopath as president are about as convincing to me as
my experiences dropping things and having them fall down instead of
up).

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; representative democracy. Just like people in China are quite happy how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; are protected from doing stupid things. Difference between you and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Chinese leaders, is that of degree.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is known as the &quot;slippery slope&quot; fallacy. A matter of degree is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> *all* the difference unless you're a religious fanatic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Slippery slope fallacy was your invoking of &quot;first they came after
</I>&gt;<i> communists ...&quot; argument to reject using Reddit on the grounds of (pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much) nonexistent censorship.
</I>
BS: I looked at it carefully and found that hundreds or even thousands
of posts had been deleted in many of the subdivisions. This is not
&quot;nonexistent&quot;, in fact it's an every-day occurrence. And that has
nothing to do with the slippery slope fallacy: It's just a design flaw
in the design of the Reddit forum system.

&gt;<i> I am advocating for a transparent and elegant
</I>&gt;<i> design based on universally accepted ideals (such as &quot;all men are (created)
</I>&gt;<i> equal&quot;).
</I>
And I agree, although I'd add &quot;All men are equally incompetent at
choosing delegates who will properly represent them&quot;. If you've got
evidence to the contrary, bring it on. Otherwise, I'll have to rely on
mine which clearly shows that people are *not* qualified to do this,
and in fact are probably even less qualified to do this than they are
at casting direct votes in most cases.

&gt;<i> Unlike you, I am leaving all options available to people, like if
</I>&gt;<i> they want to try some ad-hoc untested technology like matchism. You, on the
</I>&gt;<i> other hand, are revealing yourself as a real authoritarian, by declaring it
</I>&gt;<i> an axiom(!) that people cannot choose their delegates.
</I>
I can understand your confusion, although I would guess you'd make the
same accusation against the Ford engineers who neglected to provide
this option in my wife's car (a C-Max). My pickup does have the
dashboard button for this, but not being stupid, I've never turned it
off, even when we go 4-wheeling or drive on the beach or in snow or
wherever.

But I'd recommend you reevaluate your claim: Doing something because
there is sufficient scientific evidence to make an unambiguous social
engineering design decision is different than just being an
authoritarian and enforcing some rule that I just pulled out of my
ass. Or if it came from the programming provided by my genes, which is
my guess as to where your insistence on &quot;freedom&quot; in this matter is
coming from. If you think people (including yourself) are actually
rational, I invite you to refute the hundreds of examples listed on:
