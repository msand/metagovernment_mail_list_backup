<PRE>I might consider implementing a warning system too against anyone trying to
game the system by misrepresenting themselves in the personality test. If a
certain number of users switch their vote from the one the proxy chooses,
the system alerts the other auto-matched users that this proxy might not be
representing them.

&gt;<i> One of the things Kling said has kind of stuck in my craw:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;We discussed this and came to the conclusion that there are
</I>&gt;<i> other factors than representativeness which play a role when delegating
</I>&gt;<i> a vote, i.e. sympathy and popularity.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm sensing basically the same view from Carlo and Sergey, although
</I>&gt;<i> they might claim other factors, such as &quot;expertise&quot;, as being
</I>&gt;<i> important. I'm going to call my Axiom 5, which states that people
</I>&gt;<i> should be represented by direct voters who will vote like they would
</I>&gt;<i> if they had the time/motivation/experience/etc. to properly
</I>&gt;<i> investigate the issue before voting, the &quot;representationist&quot; position.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll call the opposite position &quot;elitism&quot; because it implies that
</I>&gt;<i> there is something special about those people you propose to want to
</I>&gt;<i> delegate to (if you have an alternative proposal for what to call it,
</I>&gt;<i> by all means make it).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I frequently point to demagogues as an example of a fatal flaw in the
</I>&gt;<i> elitist position, but what exactly is the problem with demagogues? Is
</I>&gt;<i> it just that they're racist, nationalistic, and authoritarian? Not at
</I>&gt;<i> all! If that were the real problem, then what we should be doing is
</I>&gt;<i> designing social engineering countermeasures to those things, which we
</I>&gt;<i> could then apply not only to the demagogues but to anyone else who
</I>&gt;<i> might vote that way, regardless of whether they were being led by a
</I>&gt;<i> demagogue or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the problem with demogogues is their ability to *amplify* their
</I>&gt;<i> position on any and all issues by convincing others, who may or not
</I>&gt;<i> agree with the demagogue on any *specific* issue, to effectively grant
</I>&gt;<i> a blanket proxy to the demagogue. But what about using &quot;expertise&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;popularity&quot; or &quot;familiarity&quot; or some other criteria to select a
</I>&gt;<i> proxy? That should be OK, right? No, because it has exactly the same
</I>&gt;<i> fatal flaw: By granting a proxy to someone based on any single
</I>&gt;<i> characteristic and exclusive of knowing their actual personality type,
</I>&gt;<i> it is virtually guaranteed that the proxy will distort the voting on a
</I>&gt;<i> wide range of issues because of their ability to amplify their votes,
</I>&gt;<i> which will over-represent their personality type in the final decision
</I>&gt;<i> and which is essentially taking advantage of those who have granted
</I>&gt;<i> them a proxy unless the elite just coincidentally happens to cast a
</I>&gt;<i> true representationist vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of course is *in addition to* the other problems I've pointed out
</I>&gt;<i> with a system that allows granting proxies to specific individuals:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) The possibility of dead-ending and no vote being cast.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) The possibility of corruption because the elite then becomes a
</I>&gt;<i> target for manipulation.
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The possibility of corruption due to the elite casting a self-serving
</I>&gt;<i> vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At this point I have to recommend that we equate the elitist position
</I>&gt;<i> with those who think they need to have the ability to disable
</I>&gt;<i> stability control on their cars, a position that even the experts in
</I>&gt;<i> that field consider to be just plain stupid, even on a race track, let
</I>&gt;<i> alone out in traffic:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28714/turning-">http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28714/turning-</A>
</I>&gt;<i> off-stability-control-is-one-of-the-dumbest-things-you-can-do-in-a-car/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bottom line, I'm walking back on my proposal to even *calculate* a
</I>&gt;<i> vote from those one follows, let alone allowing automatically casting
</I>&gt;<i> that vote. This still allows people to make the calculation manually
</I>&gt;<i> by actually looking at the votes of those they're following and then
</I>&gt;<i> manually voting, but requiring even this extra effort should
</I>&gt;<i> discourage almost everyone from doing so, which of course is in their
</I>&gt;<i> best interest if what we're trying to build is a representationist
</I>&gt;<i> system. I still think it's a good idea to allow blocking of specific
</I>&gt;<i> individuals from the AutoMatch, but my current thinking is to have
</I>&gt;<i> that be a separate system from the &quot;follow&quot; feature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyone care to try to defend the elitist position?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
