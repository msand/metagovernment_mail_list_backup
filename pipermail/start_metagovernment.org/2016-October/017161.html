<PRE>The world is not my doorstop. If it doesn't work treat it like a
donkey. The need of all of us is greatly shown by all of us.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I suspect writing you 100 mails will not change your point of view that

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> because, as you put it, &quot;you can't force online participation if the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> motivation is zapped by the way the government ignores everything you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> do.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that was just one attempt of deployment. As a tool for writing a
</I>&gt;<i> party programme it was excellent &#8211; unprecedented compared to all the
</I>&gt;<i> seriously flawed working group approaches.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It certainly would have been interesting to see LQFB deployed in
</I>&gt;<i> parliament the moment the party implementing LQFB decisions is actually
</I>&gt;<i> at government. But that means that a new political force is actually
</I>&gt;<i> empowered rather than cluelessly criticized by nay-sayers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> You will never understand that it is silly to even speak about the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> government ignoring you, are you even expecting the government to HELP
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> when you are trying to take power away from them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, populist simplification again, as if all elected politicians are
</I>&gt;<i> always ill-intended and not trying to do the right thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Facebook did not need any government help to succeed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Twitter did not need any government help to succeed
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But neither of those have any business interest in genuine democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> Genuine democracy has no viable business model. As long as a company
</I>&gt;<i> is earning money with it, people cannot trust the set-up. Also, the
</I>&gt;<i> success of Twitter and Faceboogle is built on bulk data exfiltration
</I>&gt;<i> and abuse of privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you bring these examples up I get the impression I am spending
</I>&gt;<i> time talking to people that have little idea of what they are talking
</I>&gt;<i> about. No idea about how government actually works, what politicians
</I>&gt;<i> actually try to do and how capitalism is at odds. Just a thick layer
</I>&gt;<i> of prejudice which simplifies decisions for yourself - but now you are
</I>&gt;<i> trying to impose your prejudices on other folks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this mailing list is pointless. For a moment I thought there
</I>&gt;<i> was genuine scientific interest in here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> LQFB and Airesis could be used by millions of people right now, the only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> reason why they are not used is simply because people do not want to use
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> And they do not want to use them as simply they do not see them as
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fitting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> their needs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wild guesses without the slightest evidence.
