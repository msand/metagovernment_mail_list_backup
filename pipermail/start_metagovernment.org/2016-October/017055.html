<PRE>Reposting, my mistake: Another thing I dislike about this list is that
hitting &quot;reply&quot; doesn't go to the list (you have to hit &quot;reply all&quot;).

Still, IMHO it doesn't hurt to point one out, even if it's something

</I>
Well, if you're going to handwave and not define &quot;somewhat&quot; (or even
how it varies by context), I'm going to be bothered as well ;-)

The range of irrational behaviors and the contexts that cause them I
think are well documented. My belief is that it's far easier to change
the context than to try to actually correct the humans involved. I
don't see the inherent conflict in allowing that some humans are
adequately rational in some contexts, but also claiming that this is
not the most common situation. Perhaps this can be cleaned up in the
manifesto the next time I'm updating it (which should be soon, since
that pending-update list is getting kind of long at this point).

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; To even start talking about merits of your scientific theory, you need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; to specify a model that you consider. Please point to where you have done
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm assuming this means that the first few thousand words on matchism.org
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not what you're looking for?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not quite. I tried to read your writeup a few years ago, and again just
</I>&gt;<i> recently. I have the same problem as before: as I move forward, the amount
</I>&gt;<i> of unanswered questions keeps piling up. I can give specific examples. You
</I>&gt;<i> are talking about (sub)optimality of a political system. What is the
</I>&gt;<i> quantity that you are optimizing? Presumably, it is the ability to achieve
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;the goals of the people&quot;. How do you quantify it? How do you define the
</I>&gt;<i> goals of the people? I looked up ahead the &quot;Goals&quot; chapter, but it just
</I>&gt;<i> gives a laundry list of possible proposals. What is the principle behind
</I>&gt;<i> composing this list? Should not we combine all goals into one objective to
</I>&gt;<i> talk about optimality? Or do you want to consider multi-objective
</I>&gt;<i> optimization?
</I>
Part of the problem is my ability to tolerate a great deal of
uncertainty in predicting how the system will actually end up working.
How &quot;The People&quot; want to optimize (by number of goals achieved, a
weighted/ranked list, merely making progress on a larger number of
goals without achieving any of them, etc.) is really up to them. You
and I might rationally try to define a &quot;five year plan&quot; or some such
thing, but I suspect that that is not what The People will want. I'm
just proposing to give them the tools that will allow them to
undertake this project, tools that protect them from the most
disruptive means of &quot;gaming the system&quot; the SDAPs currently use to get
their way.

As for how the Goals will be defined, I expect it'll work similar to
the budgeting system (big list of items that people can rank order,
and even add their own items to), but we've got to get the delegation
system worked out first, budgeting being one of those things that few
individuals will participate in and so will be particularly
susceptible to the kinds of gaming of the system you bring up below.

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; The way I understand your model, your proposed engineering design for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; dealing with &quot;unequal participation rates&quot; is flawed. But it is pointless to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; seriously discuss it before you define your model.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not sure why that's the case
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very briefly: 1) An active group of organized voters can hijack your system
</I>&gt;<i> by faking whatever psychological tests you are proposing.
</I>
I don't see how this would work. Say a bunch of authoritarians want to
hijack the high-openness/high-conscientiousness vote. They fake their
personality tests and then direct vote, hoping to get matched to HO/HC
voters who let their proxies ride. First of all, they'd have to come
in fairly large numbers (at least as large as the number of HO/HC
direct voters). Secondly, doing this requires that they abandon their
LO/HC comrades because they'd no longer be available to act as proxies
for them (meaning the LO/HC voters would get poorer matches, and
indeed might end up getting matched to people who don't well represent
them and so will vote contrary to their desires (i.e., their proxies
might vote HO/HC which would work against the authoritarians plot).

Secondly, this kind of thing would be very easy to detect: You'd see a
bimodal distribution of the HO/HC voters (some real, some fake) and
could therefore easily single out the ones attempting to game the
system by comparing the personality profiles with their voting
records. If this becomes a serious problem, we could always add
trusted-source to the personality profile measure (i.e., the actual
inventory might be done by someone else).

I'm maybe a little more enamored of true open voting than most people
are, but if, e.g., my neighbor or one of my FB friends or one of my
family members were to participate in a little adventure like that,
there'd be real-world consequences. On the other hand, it does require
that people be more aware and more tolerant of different personality
types than they are now, but this is also IMHO a good thing. Providing
for shaming somebody for trying to game the system is a perfectly
acceptable tool to use in the design of the system (it's genetically
programmed into human social behavior), as should shaming someone who
tries to trick or coerce someone who is psychologically different from
them. Fortunately the research shows that authoritarians are both the
most likely to participate in this kind of cheating, but are also the
most susceptible to correction using social pressure. They're also,
perhaps not coincidentally, the ones most interested in protecting
their own privacy while at the same time calling for the kind of
widespread surveillance that invades everyone else's (i.e., it's tough
to be consistent if you're an authoritarian ;-)

&gt;<i> 2) Applying L2
</I>&gt;<i> norm to the past votes is problematic in many ways.
</I>
I consider vote-based matching to be inferior for many reasons, most
especially because I don't anticipate that most people will even get
to the 10 or 20 well-researched direct votes necessary to do it
(certainly in the PP LQFB run they didn't). But it's easy to do and
might be useful for some people in some situation so I still think it
should be there as an option.
  Thanks for the feedback!
