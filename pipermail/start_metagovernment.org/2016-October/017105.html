</I>
Possibly: As I said before, your linking to that article on LQFB had a
profound effect on my thinking about the issue of delegation, albeit
with the opposite effect to what you intended...

&gt;<i> --- &gt;8 cut here 8&lt; ---

</I>&gt;<i> In my understanding of the Koblenz paper we have reason to assume that
</I>&gt;<i> the collective intelligence quality of the results we achieved had
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with the transitivity of votes that would sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> indeed bring voting power to people that deserve it even if they seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be of the &quot;wrong opinion&quot; to the individual. Simply because the
</I>&gt;<i> individual can't know what is the best choice.
</I>
I'm still not sure I follow this. My response to it last time was to
claim it was just an endorsement of elitism, but reading it again is
it possible that it's &quot;the wisdom of crowds&quot; you're appealing to? It
all has a kind of mystical/religious feel to it. What *exactly* do
these supervoters do that makes them such an essential part of the
system?

(snip)

&gt;<i> Tacit approval is a dysfunctional model for democracy AFAICT.
</I>
Oooh, don't let Ed hear you talking like that ;-) In fact, &quot;tacit
approval&quot; is by far the largest factor in our current
misrepresentative democracies and I would admit is even a fundamental
characteristic of my proposal. The major difference being the group
and position you're &quot;approving&quot; of when you don't take direct action:
In misrepresentative democracy, and indeed IMHO in LQFB, you're
approving of the SDAPs/Activerts whereas in AutoMatch through inaction
you're only approving of the position of the proxies who have been
psychologically matched to you...

&gt;&gt;<i> 2) To achieve #1, it is necessary to have high participation rates in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government decisionmaking, with a goal being universal participation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at least at some level of involvement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're already asking for the moon here, which is a good strategy for
</I>&gt;<i> never achieving anything. I would rather reduce it to an open invitation
</I>&gt;<i> and a civil right for anyone to get involved, but to respect that a
</I>&gt;<i> scary large majority just can't be bothered.
</I>
Hence AutoMatch. It's not only not asking for the moon, it's about as
easy as signing up for Facebook. And you only have to do it once in
your life and then everything is handled for you from then on.

&gt;<i> Even among those that adhere to a political party, only some 10% will
</I>&gt;<i> actually participate in any way. Most just think it is a cool party
</I>&gt;<i> and contribute financially.
</I>
Ever hear of &quot;Straight Ticket Voting&quot;? It's still very common here in
the US, where people who know nothing at all about many or even all of
the candidates will just vote based on the D or R after their names.
After FSOG my guess is that it's ballpark about 50% of voters, e.g.,
see:
<A HREF="http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/pdfs/straightticket.pdf">http://www.austincc.edu/cppps/pdfs/straightticket.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> The architecture we have to deal with currently has some thousand
</I>&gt;<i> people elected into parliaments per nation of which by representative
</I>&gt;<i> superstructures like the &quot;eurogroup&quot;, IMF, TTIP negotiators, European
</I>&gt;<i> Commission, The Fed, only a ridiculous number of people actually has
</I>&gt;<i> real political power while most of the parliamentaries are reduced to
</I>&gt;<i> a choice of acquitting what is presented before them or occasionally
</I>&gt;<i> block something. It is particularely absurd how so much power comes
</I>&gt;<i> together in individuals such as presidents and chancellors.
</I>
Agreed! My proposal for &quot;Managers&quot; grant them far less power (they can
only implement the policies, not define them).

&gt;<i> It doesn't take neither so much revolution nor so much perfection to
</I>&gt;<i> already arrive at a hugely better democratic system for humanity,
</I>&gt;<i> because even a simple use of liquid democracy would be a great step
</I>&gt;<i> forward from the sick condition we are in today. I've seen how those
</I>&gt;<i> ten thousand people in one liquid feedback were producing so much
</I>&gt;<i> healthier political vision than anything that is coming out of the
</I>&gt;<i> EU and the UN that I no longer consider huge numbers an essential,
</I>&gt;<i> the thing that counts is that the method works - that we get to make
</I>&gt;<i> policy that keeps homo sapiens on this earth without destroying it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that means being able to develop sane policy, free from corruption.
</I>
Also agreed: LQFB would be a great improvement over our current
system. But since it's still deeply flawed and if we're changing
systems anyway, why not design something even better, learning from
the mistakes made by the designers of LQFB?

&gt;<i> No, because the individuals aren't intelligent enough. Collective
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence can only manifest itself if the right method is employed
</I>&gt;<i> and its apparent injustice is understood as actually being better.
</I>&gt;<i> It means putting ideological prejudices aside and understanding why
</I>&gt;<i> liquid feedback works, for example.
</I>
Well, &quot;works&quot; is a fairly large exaggeration of what has actually been
shown. Even in the homogeneous groups tested to date the low turnout
and poor voter/delegate voting correlation tells me that it would have
the same problems as misrepresentative government if anyone actually
tried to use it on the general population (that is, the SDAPs would
end up making all the decisions). It's probably even worse than that:
Because the samples tried so far are all high-openness personality
types, it's quite possible that LQFB would fail to work even for
homogeneous authoritarian groups because the ability to game the
system (via demogoguery, in particular) would be so much more commonly
exploited by people from that kind of population. Please reread
Altemeyer's Global Change Game experiment and try to imagine how
individuals would be able to find and exploit these weaknesses in
LQFB, particularly if you mixed in some double-highs as he did (who do
you think would end up with all the delegations?):
<A HREF="http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf">http://matchism.org/refs/Altemeyer_2003_RWAInheritEarth.pdf</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not opposed to a sampling-based system in theory, and indeed would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concede that it could be far more efficient than the systems in my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals. But I can't see a way to engineer the myriad ways of gaming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the system out of it, nor am I convinced that The People would even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> trust a sampling-based selection method, given the relatively low
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level of understanding of statistics in the general population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Better if the system can take as many people that care to take part?
</I>&gt;<i> Currently i see no hard technological limits to impede scaling.
</I>
Agreed: I certainly plan to design for the eventuality that 10 billion
people could cast direct votes, or that only a few thousand do and the
rest use those people as proxies. Direct sampling would save a lot of
CPU cycles (you might only need to sample a few hundred individuals
to, e.g., make a policy on abortion), but with the downside being that
few humans would trust the results because most people simply don't
grok statistics.
