Maybe more &quot;complicated&quot;, since you do need to think a little, but
probably not any more timeconsuming, especially if you count all the
photo-uploading and friend-finding they expect you to do at first.

&gt;<i> If it's a psychological match you'd presumably need to ask a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> questions to get some variety in the matches, and not have determined boxes
</I>&gt;<i> we fall into. How would these questions be chosen?
</I>
I'd use the standard Big 5, at least to start with. There are several
of these on the Internet, and they take about 10 minutes to do. I've
started a separate thread with more on this.

&gt;<i> Are you assigned a different match for each vote dependent on the closest
</I>&gt;<i> match you have who bothers to cast?
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i> Would users have a 'block future matches' button if they didn't agree with
</I>&gt;<i> the decisions that their match chooses?
</I>
Hadn't considered this, but it's a good idea. They will have
information sufficient to do this: After each direct vote people will
be asked to either contribute a post about *why* they voted the way
they did, or at least to rate the quality of other posts they relied
on when making their decision. Perhaps it could be tied directly to
the &quot;follows&quot;: I think we can specifically rule out *including* people
in your &quot;follows&quot; as automatches, but *excluding* those with a
negative link has more merit. It would also provide a good check on
the potential to game the system by faking your personality inventory
and then casting direct votes in hopes of tricking automatchers into
voting contrary to their personality. I'll have to think about this
some more.

&gt;<i> I think I'm in agreement with this strategy. But the auto-match system would
</I>&gt;<i> have to be comprehensive and verifiable and so I worry others might then
</I>&gt;<i> consider it too invasive and not bother filling out a survey at all.
</I>
Agreed: See my other post, then tell me whether you think this is
going to be an issue or not.
  Regards,
    Scott
