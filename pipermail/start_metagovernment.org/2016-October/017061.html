</I>The Russian Pirates are a joke. I have tried to encourage them to implement (or adopt) delegation, to no avail. They barely exist. A similar story with the Russian Internet Party, which I think is defunct by now.

What if want my vote to be decided by majority vote of my delegates, or by their weighted average? Or even to have my vote counted fractionally to reduce variance of the voting outcome. Why the cycles are so valuable?

</I>The three out of four I checked in the past. Airesis did not have delegation. I did not see an online community around the democracyOs. Adhocracy looked moribund. Does agoravoting has an online community?

Thanks, Pietro &amp; Michal.

Forgot to reply to this one.

Maybe. Who checks on the SMS service? Who checks on the bureaucracy
of servicing accounts? What if the attacker is a nation state that
can fake phone numbers and postal addresses ad lib? One practical
way to tackle this is to have people become members of an association
or political party, so you collectively define procedures for legal
registration, elect officials to run them and judges to check them.

This &quot;WeGovNow!&quot; thing from London combines LQFB with OSM...
impressive:

I am sure they are not happy about the Facebook Login thing
however... ;)
