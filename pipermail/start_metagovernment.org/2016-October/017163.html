These are great references. Let us see how you (and I) understand the reported results.

The second reference is especially useful, because it can tell us something about the predictive power of the model you are proposing. Based on it, I believe, we can estimate answer to the following question. Imagine we have a group of people (similar to one in the paper). We split it in two equal parts, self-reported liberals and conservatives. (You can eliminate some people from the overrepresented subgroup if you need). Now take their big-5 profiles and use them as best as you can to predict their affiliation (lib or con).


Question: based on the paper, what success rate of your prediction you can hope to achieve? (It is anywhere from 50% to 100%; the former is a fully random prediction, the latter is the perfect prediction.)


And a related question: what minimum success rate (in the previous question) you would like to have to consider your method useful? Give a specific number please.


Regards,Sergey

I already provided one clear example of that, from the 2015 British
Election Study:
<A HREF="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg">http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/files/2015/08/Dennison-personality-traits-fig-1.jpg</A>

There tons of studies that show the same kind of thing. A good one I
just found the other day is:
<A HREF="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~cdeyoung/Pubs/Hirsh_2010_A_politics_PSPB.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> such predictions will not be inferior to votes of self-selected proxies.
</I>
I think the Kling paper clearly does show this: Correlations there
were lower than any simple ideology/personality model has shown (and
I've read at least a dozen papers on this, and skimmed a dozen or two
more). As of course does the results of most voting for
&quot;representatives&quot; in any republican form of government. I mean,
seriously, poor people who vote Republican in the US? Really? That's a
thing?

But I'll certainly admit that the data on &quot;delegates&quot; and &quot;proxies&quot; in
my use of the term *is* pretty sparse, because other than LQFB there
just haven't been any non-toy runs of any system that has these
features.
