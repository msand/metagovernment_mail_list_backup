<PRE>Hi everyone, this is very technical, but i do want to propose to use
Airesis for managing the proposal and the vote if should be necessary.
Also I would like to express my very real difficolty to follow and
understand some of the discussions from the mails as there is no sintesis
of the concepts and the text organization of the comments within the mail
may become very confusing.

I believe the simple notification  should be better with link to where is
decided to keep the debate and looking for way to organize the concepts to
make it more easily navigable and participate.

regards to all
jacopo

ps i found myself abandoning some very interesting discussion just for the
above problem

</I>&gt;<i> Scott, where do you see this relay? It does not appear in my headers.
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, my address is local to this domain so might not go through that
</I>&gt;<i> relay. Could you share your headers (or the relevant snippet)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can contact ASO support, but I would need to know what I am asking them.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;Sometimes emails don&#8217;t seem to go through&#8221; isn&#8217;t a very attackable problem
</I>&gt;<i> for a support team, and would invariably just spawn follow-up questions I
</I>&gt;<i> cannot answer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I have noted, I am not opposed to migrating the list. However, I am
</I>&gt;<i> opposed to migrating it to Google. I have very little trust of their
</I>&gt;<i> strategy of providing free services in exchange for intelligence on the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Let me try to reason with you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I do so under the thought that you are not very technical.  I am
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sometimes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; and I think you should figure out some things before you do random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;fixes&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Correct me in line please.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 1) you state that the problem is things end up in the spam folder.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's worse than that: Sometimes the messages aren't delivered at all.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 2) someone thinks THE problem is EU based smyp services selected as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; host.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's my theory on the Spam problem. Probably doesn't explain the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lost messages, though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 3) as I have said here and perhaps not received by you, when I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ivestigated
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; this problem I found my gmail app on android would flag related posts as
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; possibly hostile because their validity scheme did not conform to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yahoo's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; standard of validity.  I did this by hovering over one of the emails of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; of the victims.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is evidence that it's not just Gmail that's messing up. There's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something *generally* wrong about how the message headers are being
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formed, and/or with the sites along the message path.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I eventually sent an email to this list suggesting possible causes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; ruled out and asking how that might be done with no respose.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you asked was probably beyond the skills (or a least time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> availability) of the people who would need to do it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 5) in the past I also have had to go to he archives to see if my posts
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; been received, which is one reason to avoid this site.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 6) has anyone discussed any of this with the techs at the smallorange?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm still in favor of just moving, but hold out little hope for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually happening: Ed seems reluctant to take on a leadership role
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> here and IMHO the only way a move is going to happen is if he emails
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the subscriber list to someone who will take it and install it at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another site. I'll volunteer to do the latter (at Google Groups), but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> believe it would take an act of god to achieve &quot;consensus&quot; on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approving a move like this unilaterally and approving GG as the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> destination. Even so, this all seems fitting to me, as the ultimate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proof of the bankruptcy of Ed's long-held faith that the status quo is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceptable and that all decisionmaking should occur by waiting for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus to arrive spontaneously (albeit magically), rendering it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unnecessary to actually make a decision.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Scott
