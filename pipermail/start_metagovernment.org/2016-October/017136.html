a O47-C58-E48-A74-N11 Big Five!!&lt;/a&gt;

My results, the only category I was surprised about was Openness.
Generally, think of myself as higher than that.

It's an interesting way to determine voting preference, and no doubt some
fine tuning could occur based on actual voting preference when results
started coming in.

We need to be careful how these results get displayed I think. Give the
public too much information on the system and the quicker it can be worked
out how to game it. e.g.There will inevitably be a personality type that
truly doesn't care and will never correct whatever they end up voting for,
this would be the type to fake and have the most influence with.

However, give the public too little information on the system and trust/
confidence becomes an issue. I think the best balance is to make
information accessible but a process to get to, so much that it puts up red
flags if you dive too deeply and you might get investigated on your
motives.

I'm also wondering if users are allowed to abstain from a vote? Some people
might not want to be represented in a particular proposal because they are
too conflicted.
