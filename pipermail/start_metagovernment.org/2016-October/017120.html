<PRE>SORRY.  I gave you the wrong link.  The end should say &quot;governance&quot;,
not &quot;government&quot;.

Corrected link:

</I>&gt;<i> You SHOULD ask: &quot; how's that working out for the United States?&quot;.  And
</I>&gt;<i> the answer is, is that it is failing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I also consider the above
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> statement to be morally irresponsible: If we saw some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> city/state/country actually vote to try this, I'd have to vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> replacement of that government, by force if necessary, to save them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from themselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're being a bit extreme.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> People have the right to self-governance, but not if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it virtually guarantees political or economic instability (or election

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> war by the nations he had already disclosed were in his sights even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before he became Chancellor (i.e., &quot;Lebensraum&quot;)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You are naive.  ANY government of humans (compared to say, robots), is
</I>&gt;<i> guaranteed to have social and/or economic instability.  THAT IS NOT
</I>&gt;<i> THE PROBLEM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is when there is no recourse or means to self-correct
</I>&gt;<i> (like allowing others to win an election).  The best any government
</I>&gt;<i> (cf anarchy) can accomplish and WILL EVER ACCOMPLISH is fairness and
</I>&gt;<i> balance *over time*.  Fortunately, governments have that (or can
</I>&gt;<i> create it easily).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any government
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> based on &quot;no reasonable objection&quot; would almost immediately become a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> failed state and so become a burden or even a threat to all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> neighboring jurisdictions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In some ways you are right.  The failure is that nothing gets done.
</I>&gt;<i> You can compare the success of the metagovernment effort, for example
</I>&gt;<i> (very little has been accomplished, but it has hosted a good forum.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But since you're apparently another expert on consensus-based
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> government, I invite you to try your hand at my &quot;libertarian
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> challenge&quot;. Maybe I'm wrong and there's some &quot;magic incantation&quot; that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will allow that system to work in a general population even though up
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to this point it's has only been shown to work in homogeneous groups
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that share common goals...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I can't give you a magic incantation, because humans ultimately
</I>&gt;<i> don't work by rules/laws -- no matter how well crafted.  But I do
</I>&gt;<i> invite you to check out this page:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government">http://wiki.hackerspaces.org/government</A>&gt;  There you'll see all the
</I>&gt;<i> options any libertarian would be PUFFED with for a good while.
