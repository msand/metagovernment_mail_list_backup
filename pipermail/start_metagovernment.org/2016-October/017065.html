<PRE>At this moment, there are 159 addresses subscribed to this list.

Scott, where do you see this relay? It does not appear in my headers. Granted, my address is local to this domain so might not go through that relay. Could you share your headers (or the relevant snippet)?

I can contact ASO support, but I would need to know what I am asking them. &#8220;Sometimes emails don&#8217;t seem to go through&#8221; isn&#8217;t a very attackable problem for a support team, and would invariably just spawn follow-up questions I cannot answer.

As I have noted, I am not opposed to migrating the list. However, I am opposed to migrating it to Google. I have very little trust of their strategy of providing free services in exchange for intelligence on the actions of humanity. All of their initiatives seem to be oriented toward collecting this intelligence, and that loses my trust. (It will be interesting to see what Wikileaks is about to release on Google.)

</I>&gt;<i> Small orange does have a chat support as well as email support.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here is a different question:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How many names on the mailing list?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hmm.  Accurate to one significant digit.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me try to reason with you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I do so under the thought that you are not very technical.  I am sometimes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and I think you should figure out some things before you do random &quot;fixes&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Correct me in line please.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) you state that the problem is things end up in the spam folder.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's worse than that: Sometimes the messages aren't delivered at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) someone thinks THE problem is EU based smyp services selected as the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; host.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's my theory on the Spam problem. Probably doesn't explain the
</I>&gt;<i> lost messages, though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3) as I have said here and perhaps not received by you, when I ivestigated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this problem I found my gmail app on android would flag related posts as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; possibly hostile because their validity scheme did not conform to yahoo's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standard of validity.  I did this by hovering over one of the emails of one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the victims.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is evidence that it's not just Gmail that's messing up. There's
</I>&gt;<i> something *generally* wrong about how the message headers are being
</I>&gt;<i> formed, and/or with the sites along the message path.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4) I eventually sent an email to this list suggesting possible causes to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ruled out and asking how that might be done with no respose.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What you asked was probably beyond the skills (or a least time
</I>&gt;<i> availability) of the people who would need to do it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5) in the past I also have had to go to he archives to see if my posts have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; been received, which is one reason to avoid this site.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6) has anyone discussed any of this with the techs at the smallorange?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still in favor of just moving, but hold out little hope for this
</I>&gt;<i> actually happening: Ed seems reluctant to take on a leadership role
</I>&gt;<i> here and IMHO the only way a move is going to happen is if he emails
</I>&gt;<i> the subscriber list to someone who will take it and install it at
</I>&gt;<i> another site. I'll volunteer to do the latter (at Google Groups), but
</I>&gt;<i> believe it would take an act of god to achieve &quot;consensus&quot; on
</I>&gt;<i> approving a move like this unilaterally and approving GG as the
</I>&gt;<i> destination. Even so, this all seems fitting to me, as the ultimate
</I>&gt;<i> proof of the bankruptcy of Ed's long-held faith that the status quo is
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable and that all decisionmaking should occur by waiting for
</I>&gt;<i> consensus to arrive spontaneously (albeit magically), rendering it
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary to actually make a decision.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
