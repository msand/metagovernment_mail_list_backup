Looks pretty moderate overall, which is actually one of the most
common profiles. You're obviously also very poorly represented by
politicians in misrepresentative democracies.

&gt;<i> It's an interesting way to determine voting preference, and no doubt some
</I>&gt;<i> fine tuning could occur based on actual voting preference when results
</I>&gt;<i> started coming in.
</I>
Exactly. Standard Big 5 is just a starting point: There are lots of
ways to optimize, including picking questions from other inventories
and dropping questions that don't correlate with voting preference.

&gt;<i> We need to be careful how these results get displayed I think. Give the
</I>&gt;<i> public too much information on the system and the quicker it can be worked
</I>&gt;<i> out how to game it. e.g.There will inevitably be a personality type that
</I>&gt;<i> truly doesn't care and will never correct whatever they end up voting for,
</I>&gt;<i> this would be the type to fake and have the most influence with.
</I>
I'm sure people will try to do exactly this. Since the data will all
be public it will be pretty easy to figure out where the low hanging
fruit is and do the AutoMatch equivalent of gerrymandering: Finding
the most vulnerable populations and then trying to exploit them by
casting just enough phony votes to flip the total vote if most of them
allow the match vote to go through. But as I said before, because the
data is public it will also be very easy to *detect* this kind of
tampering and then take action against the perpetrators (sanctions,
dropping dox, etc.) There also lots of things we can include in the
system design to discourage this kind of thing (requiring independent
confirmation of personality type, preventing people from redoing their
profile more than once or twice a year, including a &quot;block&quot; or
negative link feature so that people can exclude the suspect vote from
the AutoMatch process, etc.)

&gt;<i> However, give the public too little information on the system and trust/
</I>&gt;<i> confidence becomes an issue. I think the best balance is to make information
</I>&gt;<i> accessible but a process to get to, so much that it puts up red flags if you
</I>&gt;<i> dive too deeply and you might get investigated on your motives.
</I>
That's generally known as &quot;security through obscurity&quot; and trying to
do it this will get you a lot of grief from the &quot;real&quot; security
aficionados. But, yeah, tracking who accesses the raw data *is* a
reasonable thing to do because that information could be very useful
if an actual plot is discovered.

&gt;<i> I'm also wondering if users are allowed to abstain from a vote? Some people
</I>&gt;<i> might not want to be represented in a particular proposal because they are
</I>&gt;<i> too conflicted.
</I>
Definitely, but it would require casting a direct vote. You can vote
&quot;yes&quot;, &quot;no&quot;, or &quot;abstain&quot;. Or you can do nothing in which case the
AutoMatch vote will be recorded for you. Which I guess itself might be
&quot;abstain&quot; if the majority of your AutoMatched proxies voted that way.

    Scott
