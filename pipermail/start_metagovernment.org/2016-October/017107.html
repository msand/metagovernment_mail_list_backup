It's like shooting fish in a barrel: The only thing more pitiful than
an elitist is a &quot;consensusist&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> (D) A rule of action or choice is justified, and thus valid, only if all
</I>&gt;<i> those affected by the rule or choice could accept it in a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> discourse. (This is the Habermas Discourse Principle.)
</I>
OK, so who defines &quot;reasonable&quot;? If someone says &quot;Abortion is Murder&quot;,
can I conclude that they're not being reasonable and just ignore their
input?

But this isn't really the big problem with the consensusist
philosophy, which is that it assumes that no decision is preferable to
one that is made over the objections of some minority in the
population. This is not only just an irrational position to take, but
it also displays a really profound ignorance of what the human species
is really like. People are biologically *programmed* to accept that
things don't always go their way and to defer to majority opinion.
It's called &quot;socialization&quot;, and it actually has a significant effect
on behavior in most primate species and even many social animals even
less closely related to humans (wolves and elephants are just the two
most common examples). To cast this feature of humans aside as being
&quot;unfair&quot; is not only incompetent social engineering, it's also highly
authoritarian (as in &quot;Hey, you don't know what's good for you, we're
going to protect from having some policy you don't like from being
inflicted on you even when you're absolutely sure that it's really no
big deal. Hope you like the status quo!&quot;).

&gt;<i> By extension, a population-scale public-matter decision system is legitimate
</I>&gt;<i> to the extent that it produces decisions that are in accord with (D).
</I>
Meaning nothing important will ever be decided. Don't we already have
that with the US congress? In the past year they've only passed a
total of 24 substantive bills.

&gt;<i> Anyone can propose anything, on equal footing. (Some must not be more equal
</I>&gt;<i> than others, either with respect to opportunity to propose or with respect
</I>&gt;<i> to treatment of proposals proposed.)
</I>
So I've got to wade through all the proposals made by high-school
students as part of their homework for their civics class and give
them the same priority as proposals from the Global Manager (the
equivalent in my system of something like &quot;president of the world&quot;)?

&gt;<i> A proposal succeeds at the point that it reaches the status of facing no
</I>&gt;<i> unresolved objections.
</I>&gt;<i> Vote-counts do not decide. (&quot;Might makes right&quot; is not a principle that I
</I>&gt;<i> buy into. It ignores/overrides (D).)
</I>
Exactly. Again, no progress, profound ignorance of human nature.
Fortunately Ned is in such a small minority here that there's no
chance his opinion will count for anything ;-)

&gt;<i> Guesses about what will or will not work are just guesses. Show me your test
</I>&gt;<i> results, and I will show you mine.
</I>
So, your theory is that if I design an airplane wing with a computer
(or indeed with a slide rule) and some knowledge of aerodynamics  I'll
have no better chance of successfully flying than someone who straps
boards on their arms and starts flapping? Good thing most scientists
would consider this to be a ridiculous statement or there'd be no
progress in any of those fields either...

    Scott
