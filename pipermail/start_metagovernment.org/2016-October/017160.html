Snark aside, I think I've come as close to this as we're able to at
this point in the development of our technology. The trick is to limit
the power of the &quot;dictator&quot; to executing the laws, rather than making
them. Eventually some AI will be capable of actually making the laws
based on its ability to figure out what makes us tick, but IMHO that
is is far enough off (decades, maybe centuries) that it's too risky to
our species to plan to wait that long before we start using something
better.

Mean time, you're right that it doesn't bother me at all to restrict
your freedom to do dumb things. For example I'd vote to remove the
&quot;disable stability control&quot; button from *all* cars because that's
exactly the kind of thing that people who value their &quot;freedom&quot; think
they need and are entitled to have, nevermind that they're wrong both
on a moral and a technical level. And when self-driving cars start
becoming common I'll be voting to subsidize them to accelerate the
adoption of them and then when they're universally available, vote to
criminalize the practice of driving your own car on the public roads
entirely. Your &quot;freedom&quot; doesn't extend to the right to put other
people's lives at risk, especially when all it gets you is a sop to
your delusion that the Dunning-Kruger effect doesn't apply to you.
Your insistence on the &quot;freedom&quot; to pick your own delegates/proxies I
consider to be a textbook example of that.
  Regards,
    Scott
