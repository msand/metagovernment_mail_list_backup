The problem can also arise with people imposing themselves on others
while being fully convinced to be acting in good faith. So I would not
consider Scott in bad faith, he just isn't contributing thoughts that
help the group getting anywhere and has a habit of using manipulative
and insulting wording to achieve a sense of leadership. These are all
very human defects, and it is up to us to have mechanisms that can
deal with it. An unmoderated mailing list is no such mechanism.

&gt;<i> Now if you refuse to moderate, you are basically letting nature take its
</I>&gt;<i> course. Which is fine, but *how many members will this list lose before
</I>&gt;<i> you accept to moderate the asocial person that drives them away?*
</I>
How many will not even start writing to the list in the first place?
How many will never recommend it to anybody else? I've seen several
political parties collapse in size and significance because they
essentially hadn't learned how to do a philosophically correct
interpretation of the concept of Freedom of Expression and integrate
it with a sociological architecture that has a chance to scale.

&gt;<i> Carlo, I agree with you that the current system does not work. But I do
</I>&gt;<i> not like a system that is based upon the assumption that might is right.
</I>&gt;<i> And more people are always right.
</I>
I don't see how any of these two statements are factually applicable.

&gt;<i> If you need to decide how to set up a complex moderation system, then
</I>&gt;<i> use Vilfredo.
</I>
Oh, you mean collectively deciding the rules for this mailing list?
Well, I can tell you rightaway that you will not obtain a single
applicable rule set but rather several proposals on the Front of
Pareto. There's at least one person that will not agree with anything
everybody else could possibly agree upon.

By the way, did I ever tell you that, after trying out Vilfredo, I
wrote up Liquid Feedback policies oriented at obtaining similar
discussion patterns like on Vilfredo (the continuous remixing of
other people's proposals), but without allowing individuals with
unconstructive intentions to nuke the process?

&gt;<i> If you need to chose among the various discussion tools, then Airesis
</I>&gt;<i> will work well, too.
</I>
Probably.

&gt;<i> As always different kind of questions are better solved with different
</I>&gt;<i> tools.
</I>
I also wouldn't agree on this statement as the democratic implications
of tools are relevant and many of them apparently do some aspect well
but leave out the important rest.
