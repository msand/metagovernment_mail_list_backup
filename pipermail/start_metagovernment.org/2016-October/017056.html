This is an absolutely incorrect statement, and it's very disappointing
to see you even make it, as I thought you were at least paying
attention. I *have* a proposal, and am refining as we go. Actually I
seem to be the only one actually *doing* this as all the rest seem to
be dead in the water. So you're not only wrong, you've got it exactly
backwards.

The &quot;flapping&quot; analogy only applies to *deliberative* system, which
IMHO are not required components of eDemocratic systems. We can argue
that point, but you'll first have to concede my position on voting
(i.e., that low-turnout voting only facilitates gaming of the system
by SDAPs/Activerts) and also offer a counterproposal to mine that
solves this problem somehow differently than mine. I haven't seen one.

&gt;<i> keeps criticising people stopping them from

</I>
Well I'm not here to be criticized personally, but unlike some (most?)
others, I'm happy to have my proposal criticized, as I think that can
only improve it. Flash Cards had a good go at it yesterday (an idea of
how to game it), but I think it survived without requiring
modification. If there are other glaring weaknesses, by all means,
shoot those fish in a barrel.
  Regards,
     Scott
