I think this is probably not it, but agree that it surely couldn't
hurt to get that fixed.

In gmail, it's &quot;show original&quot; from the menu at the top-right of the
message. In others, it's usually something like &quot;show headers&quot;

Right. Looks like they're contracting out SMTP. Lots of small outfits
do this, exactly because of the spam problem. But IMHO they've picked
the wrong company to outsource to. You should point this out to them,
but I wouldn't hold my breath that they'll actually change.

&gt;<i> I have no special affinity for maintaining this host; except that
</I>&gt;<i> transferring is somewhat of a pain (especially since I used the cpanel
</I>&gt;<i> version of mailman, which means that transferring it requires intrusive
</I>&gt;<i> assistance from the host). If we were to transfer to a different host, I
</I>&gt;<i> would prefer that it be something that helps remove me (or anyone) from
</I>&gt;<i> having special privileges.
</I>
Restarting the list someplace else is an hour or two kind of project
and so is not a reason for not doing it. I'd still recommend moving it
google groups (or anywhere, really), but it seems to me that the
bigger problem is coming up with a quorum of active users who would
all vote for the same new host. Sounds like a job for a deliberative
democracy system, no? ;-)

IMHO this is just because there hasn't been a proper incentive to come
up with an alternative to moderation: Remember, just about every other
list/forum/etc. has an *incentive* to allow or even facilitate chaos
because more controversy = more eyeballs = more revenue. I've run
mailing lists before and am always baffled by these calls for
moderation or censorship because it seems to me they're massive
overreactions to what are relatively minor incidents. This list, for
example, is fine and I'd recommend the whiners just work on getting
their story straight rather than crying to list mom or playing
passive-aggressive games when their ideas are attacked.

</I>
Agreed. If the list were a little bigger I'd recommend just signing up
additional managers (google groups, for example, makes this very
easy), but I'm not even sure that'd be addressing the real problem,
which is the hosting service not the list management.

    Scott
