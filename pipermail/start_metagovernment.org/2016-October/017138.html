Perhaps I wasn't clear. Both of the above are true: By &quot;assistant&quot; I
mean that it will compute your vote and vote for you if you don't do
anything. But at it's core this is a direct democracy system: Nobody
really *needs* an AutoMatch system because they can always cast a
direct vote on any issue. In fact, there would have to be an option to
turn off the AutoMatch feature if that's what you really want to do.

&gt;<i> For example, if I were to choose my own delegate based on my
</I>&gt;<i> own judgment, you would require that I always vote directly. Essentially,
</I>&gt;<i> you wanted to save me from myself (claiming that I will fall asleep),
</I>
&quot;Sleeping&quot; isn't the issue. Being manipulated by demagogues is the
biggest potential problem with simple incompetence at picking good
representative for you being the second major problem (the latter
obviously being a serious problem in LQFB).

&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;<i> like representative democracy proponents, or direct democracy purists. Just
</I>&gt;<i> like them, you were happily infringing on my right to use my own vote
</I>&gt;<i> according to my conscience.
</I>
No, you'd *always* be able to cast a direct vote, or not vote at all
if that's what you prefer. But most people *like* having automatic
features (automatic updates of their software, automatic transmissions
and lane-keeping and autobraking in their cars, etc.) and will have no
objection if they're not only automatic, but are also designed to
protect you from doing stupid things.
