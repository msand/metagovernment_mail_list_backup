You got my point, thanks!

&gt;<i> I do (hypothetically) moderate already, in that if someone starts
</I>sending outright commercial spam to the list, I will boot them. But if I
take action against someone based on much fuzzier judgements of the
content and motivation of their posts, it is very difficult to determine
where to draw the line. If I do it based solely only on my own
judgement, I am acting as an authoritarian, which I will not do. I am
more than willing to moderate (and/or to enable others to moderate) if
we have a ruleset that clearly defines what should be moderated.

Glad your thoughts are heading in the right direction. Yes, it
is normal that these are the next things to worry about once you
realize that no moderation is no democracy either. How can one
individual possibly do the right thing?

Luckily some people have seen this movie several times already
and can give some hints. The generally accepted real-life solution
to this challenge was conceived in the early 18th century and is
generally known as the Separation of Powers. It suggests that in
order to have a *democratically* moderated mailing list we should
have the following:

	- A legislational body that will formulate the rules of
	  code of conduct.
	- An executive body that will try to implement those
	  rules to the best of their intellectual and ethical
	  understanding.
	- A judicial body that will exercise oversight over the
	  executive and defend the rights of individuals should
	  any abuse take place.

So the ingredients needed to do this are two-fold: A method for
this community to agree upon a code of conduct and a method for
this community to elect individuals among itself to fulfil the
executive and judicial roles.

Any attempts to somehow simplify this architecture (like letting
the assembly also be the judges or letting the assembly also do
the moderation) will typically fail painfully for the reasons I
think I have elaborated and underpinned with research docs in the
convivenza document.

So you may find it overkill to think even a mailing list needs a
full blown democratic architecture to become democratic, but
I'm afraid no-one has figured out a decent shortcut.

There is an indecent one, which is however generally very accepted:
It's the shortcut by which a company is entrusted to run the
platforms and is expected to somehow respect democratic needs.
Think Reddit or Facebook. Since we are here to discuss eDemocracy
and know that handing out the power to a company is not a solution,
I don't see any alternative to creating the formal preconditions
of inner justice and democracy, then discuss the tools to go with it.

As Ed correctly asserted, it is not a question of software - it is
a question of getting the philosophical preconditions right before
getting started.

I just feel that &quot;might is right&quot; sounds superficial and invites
ill interpretations just because it rhymes so nice.

&gt;<i> The first one is trivial, any voting system where the majority decides.
</I>
That is a question of policy. I am in favor of very qualified majorities
as the proposals to do vilfredo-like debate in LQFB
suggest.

&gt;<i> The second is more tricky, and in a sense this is what we are trying to
</I>&gt;<i> solve here. I would say that workable solutions can be Vilfredo,
</I>&gt;<i> Sociocracy, and any system where any one can raise an issue that the
</I>&gt;<i> majority need to tackle to move on. They tend to work well in small
</I>&gt;<i> groups, but not to scale. And of course if we are dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> moderating a single person that person must be excluded from being able
</I>&gt;<i> to force (i.e. voting) an issue (albeit they can still raise it -
</I>&gt;<i> proposing).
</I>
LQFB scales well, but it may be overkill for a small group like
this one.

&gt;<i> One temporary compromise might be to use qualified majorities.
</I>
Since suspending voting rights of individuals is a spiny issue
I would rather use a 90% majority than introducing any statutory
procedure by which that one person would have to be excluded.

And since this is pretty much the normal case in most situations
I don't see how qualified majories can not be a permanent
&quot;compromise&quot; rather than temporary.

&gt;<i> Vilfredo has changed a lot in those years. The new Vilfredo (Vilfredo 2)
</I>&gt;<i> is very different from the previous version (Vilfredo goes to Athens).
</I>&gt;<i> Now people vote on a continuous scale of a triangle. The aim is that if
</I>&gt;<i> at any moment you want to order the proposals you can. So the question
</I>&gt;<i> can be interrupted at any time. Thus avoiding the &quot;agreement by
</I>&gt;<i> exhaustion&quot; effect we use to have on Vilfredo.
</I>
Oh, interesting. I missed this development.

&gt;<i> One of the things we are experimenting on in Vilfredo, but it is still
</I>&gt;<i> not in the run version, is the &quot;blind moderation&quot; (*Ed* pay attention
</I>&gt;<i> here). The idea is that we still need to have someone deciding when to
</I>&gt;<i> move on a decision, and where to define some threasholds. But the
</I>&gt;<i> moderator should be neutral and not part of the discussion. And should
</I>&gt;<i> just decide based upon how people vote. In fact the moderator should not
</I>&gt;<i> even be allowed to read the proposals. But only see the patterns with
</I>&gt;<i> which people vote. Eventually an AI should do this work egregiously.
</I>
Also interesting. Could it by any chance be similar to the effect
I suggest in the 90% consensus proposal? Only when most people
support a sufficiently consensual proposal a concluding vote is
triggered.

That is the point I wanted to get to. And yes of course that means me.
I want you to elect me as both executive and judicial. Ideally make
me also the only parlamentarian.
