<PRE>Valid registered trademarks beat domain names but a domain name can give
you a valid registered trademark.

If your code is to be GLPv3, as,an example, then your text can reasonably
be some version of CC.
After you figure out which version then it might be possible to think about
your art work and graphics. The head scratcher might be patents.

Do you understand the different versions of CC, not all of which are
&quot;free&quot;?  You might chose CC with derivatives and attribution.

Direct vs. Representative Democracy is not good enough for you?

Not me: If anything I sense *more* resistance to it, probably because
of all the scams/cybercrime/cyberbullying reports we're seeing.
Whatever system we come up with will have to have a lot more
resistance to these kinds of things than the popular forums do
(although, as I've said, our problem is actually much easier than
theirs because we're not selling &quot;eyeballs&quot; and so not indirectly
profiting by allowing, or even encouraging, chaos).

&gt;<i> And the good news: I've been finding ways to showcase my own design

I consider the risk of competition from people using your code or
ideas to be extremely low. Your main goal should be to protect the
name, in which case getting the domain and putting up a robust (e.g.,
complete and google and bing indexed) manifesto/blog should be
sufficient.
