<PRE>This looks roughly OK for me. The crucial statement is really #5: 


&gt;<i> Therefore, because the proxy system is merely an expedient, it must
</I>&gt;<i> be designed to facilitate casting the same vote that each voter would
</I>&gt;<i> cast if they had the time/motivation/skills/knowledge/etc. to properly
</I>&gt;<i> and fully investigate and understand the issue at hand.
</I>
I would like to understand why he is opposed to it. I guess I also did not listen carefully enough.

&gt;<i> My opinion on this is also that it's practically impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> engineer, leaving anonymous personality-matched proxies as the only
</I>&gt;<i> viable option
</I>
As I explained in my previous post, this just does not make sense to me. At most I would agree to use it as a tool for advising possible delegates. I would then have to go and read what they say and see how they vote on various issues. Maybe it could be useful. I have serious doubts and the burden is on you to prove otherwise if you expect me (or anyone else) to use it. But no blind/anonymous matching please.

 Subject: [MG] Axioms of Government
   
You all don't mind if I actually try to *use* the list to discuss
&quot;government&quot; while we try to figure out what to do with it?

I'm still reeling from Carlos' statement that my axiom about
representation is an outlier and that it's not part of the belief
system of everyone on this list. But I figured I should write down how
I get to that one to see if there are others along the way that may be
problematic. I'm hoping not, since more than one of them seems to me
to be encoded even in the brief intro on the Home page (a hard-won
&quot;consensus&quot;).

Although of course I seldom consider that my statements on this list
represent the opinions of everyone else on it (contrary to Carlos'
apparent belief), this time it's different: If you don't speak up, I,
and possibly everyone else, will consider it to be tacit approval that
these are things we agree on as necessary axioms for the design of any
General Purpose government (albeit not necessarily for regulation of
more homogeneous groups (corporations, political parties, religious
orders, etc.)):

1) Legitimate government is of, by, and for The People (i.e., Democracy).

2) To achieve #1, it is necessary to have high participation rates in
government decisionmaking, with a goal being universal participation,
at least at some level of involvement.

3) To achieve #2 in a real world environment where people are busy and
rationally decide not to invest significant time in direct
participation, some sort of proxy/delegation/representation system is
a necessary component of any general-purpose democracy.

4) The primary design goal of this proxy system must be achieving #2,
with any other goal (tapping into expertise, underutilized resources,
etc.) being a distant second in priority.

5) Therefore, because the proxy system is merely an expedient, it must
be designed to facilitate casting the same vote that each voter would
cast if they had the time/motivation/skills/knowledge/etc. to properly
and fully investigate and understand the issue at hand.

Note that the &quot;representative&quot; nature of system doesn't need to be an
explicit component of the design, it can be an emergent phenomenon.
For example Ned's Blinap and &quot;Citizen Juries&quot; could both meet the
requirements of #5 via sampling, which also potentially provides
proper representation *provided* that the sampling is indeed unbiased.
That is, it can't be like the US jury-selection system, where not only
is not everybody in the pool that the samples are taken from, but that
anyone with half a brain can get out of serving by merely speaking a
few magic words (mine are &quot;jury nullification&quot; ;-)

I'm not opposed to a sampling-based system in theory, and indeed would
concede that it could be far more efficient than the systems in my
proposals. But I can't see a way to engineer the myriad ways of gaming
the system out of it, nor am I convinced that The People would even
trust a sampling-based selection method, given the relatively low
level of understanding of statistics in the general population.

Note that 5 *also* allows for a proper &quot;representative&quot; democracy, the
trick again being to somehow provide the &quot;representative&quot; part while
simultaneously eliminating all the ways our current misrepresentatives
(and those who pay to get them elected) have devised to game the
system. My opinion on this is also that it's practically impossible to
engineer, leaving anonymous personality-matched proxies as the only
viable option.

&#160; &#160; Scott
