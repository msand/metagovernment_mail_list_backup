Oh boy, here we go again. Apparently Carlo is unfamiliar with the
English cliche &quot;The pot calling the kettle black&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i> As it stands sociology has made it clear that unmoderated mailing
</I>&gt;<i> lists cannot function.
</I>
LOL! In fact, such lists have survived for *decades* (I'm on at least
two of them).

&gt;<i> I perceive such a non-scientific and ideological approach as an
</I>&gt;<i> imposition on the group. By refusing to take responsibility you
</I>&gt;<i> are making an undemocratic choice against the interests of the
</I>&gt;<i> collective.
</I>
LOL! Again! Carlo is obviously the kind of person who would have
&quot;voted&quot; for Hitler or Stalin (or Trump) as dictator because only they
can ensure &quot;law and order&quot;. Not that this is such an unusual position:
88% of German voters voted to make Hitler dictator in 1934. But I'm
very surprised to see someone advocate this position on *this* list.

&gt;<i> Theory of democracy is a fascinating topic. It can turn out to
</I>&gt;<i> be the opposite of what you thought was right, so it can turn
</I>&gt;<i> out to tell you that all the time you thought you were doing
</I>&gt;<i> the right thing you were actually doing wrong. And the only way
</I>&gt;<i> to find out is by putting ideology aside and looking at the facts.
</I>
I call BS here too: You can't base a society, or even a decisionmaking
system, on &quot;facts&quot;. All these &quot;facts&quot; are subject to interpretation
and bias, most especially in determining which ones are relevant and
which are not. To claim otherwise is just naive.

&gt;<i> Not trying to be mean to anyone. 99% of Internet activists thinks
</I>&gt;<i> moderation is bad when in fact it is the only known method that
</I>&gt;<i> works, that's why 99% of Internet forums fail to function socially.
</I>
Again, BS: I'm no expert on this, but the HyperCard mailing list I'm
on has functioned without moderation (not counting a few unsubscribing
of spammers) for almost 30 years now (it started on AOL before there
even was a public internet). Sure there have been a few bruised egos
and some hasty departures, but it endures exactly *because* it lacks
all the drama that those types tend to inflict on any rational
discussion.

&gt;<i> I would recommend to make metagovernment.org transcend the fallacy
</I>&gt;<i> of traditional mailing lists. In order to do so, the question is not
</I>&gt;<i> whether to turn on moderation but rather on *how* to organize it...
</I>&gt;<i> according to current status of sociological science, which kind of
</I>&gt;<i> already figured that out in the 80's. The Internet just hasn't been
</I>&gt;<i> paying attention, because sociology doesn't feel like real science
</I>&gt;<i> or something like that.
</I>
OK, I'll bite: Sociology barely *is* a science, organized as it is by
tin-pot authoritarians with off-the-wall agendas. Other than the work
of a few biosociologists (e.g., Anthony Walsh) I've found exactly zero
useful information in that entire field. Now if you want to talk real
science, there is a bit of work in social psychology that might be
useful to this discussion...

    Scott
