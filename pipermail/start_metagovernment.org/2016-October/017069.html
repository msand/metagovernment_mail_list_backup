Did so. You didn't pay attention apparently.

Removing people that cannot act socially in respect of democratic
principles is neither censorship nor disrespectful of democracy.

If this is what you think, this shows you don't even know what
censorship or democracy really means.

Get competent.

The list of links I posted in reply to Pietro contains several
sociological explanations of these fallacies of yours.

But I do acknowledge that your false idea of censorship and
democracy is popular - in fact it seems to be predominant on
the Internet over the actual philosophical concepts, thus
leading to a general inability of the Internet to be socially
respectful and thus democratic.

Think about it.

I know it hurts, but there are decades of knowledge in these
few words. I had a simple idea of censorship and democracy
myself, many many years ago. But I prefer to learn over
getting stuck in ideology.
