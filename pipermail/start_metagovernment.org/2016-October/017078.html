Agreed, *however* I'm on a dozen different mailing lists and this is
the only one that seems to have this problem.

&gt;<i> One thing I know does work: if a message erroneously appears in your spam

This fixed the most common problem I had, so I endorse it.

&gt;<i> Now if the problem is that list messages are completely disappearing, that

</I>
Problem is, it's hard to prove there's a problem when the very absence
of a message is the only evidence. Which is, again, why I see no
alternative to just moving the list to someplace that doesn't have
this problem...
