I think you're assuming that everyone *did* cast a vote on most or all
issues, whether they cared about it or not. With a median of 8 votes
over 3 years, this is almost certainly not true. Although there's no
way to measure it now, it seems to me that indeed direct votes
probably *were* only cast for issues the voters cared about. Which
means they *should* correlate with the votes of the people they chose
as delegates.

&gt;&gt;<i> My prediction is that the number
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of overrides is going to be so small as to be insignificant,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which exactly means that people are happy with their delegates, they agree
</I>&gt;<i> with them on important issues.
</I>
This is another completely unsubstantiated assumption. I would predict
that the exact opposite is more likely: That they simply didn't care
about those issues enough to become directly involved. This only means
that voters who didn't override have no idea whether or not their
delegates voted like they would (nor do they care, even though they
really should because otherwise public policy becomes a matter of
&quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot;).
