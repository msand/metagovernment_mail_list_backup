&gt;<i> 1) You get to choose who to delegate to. It's not decided by any kind of
</I>&gt;<i> system or algorithm by default. Ideally, you'll feel competent enough to
</I>&gt;<i> participate directly. If not, you can delegate. You and only you are
</I>&gt;<i> competent enough to choose a delegate. Our decision-making capabilities are
</I>&gt;<i> far from perfect, but they're far better than any human-invented algorithm.
</I>
What evidence do you have that people are competent to chose their
delegates? Certainly there is no evidence for this from the PP LQFB
run, nor indeed from the operation of any existing or historical
republic.

I also do find your faith in the competence in everyman being able to
make decisions over the ability of computers (or other elites) to be
somewhat at odds with the rest of your argument...

&gt;<i> 2) You delegate in specific areas - no blanket delegations.
</I>
Making the problem of delegation orders of magnitude more difficult.
And probably even *more* vulnerable to exploitation by demagogues and
corrupt (or at least corruptible) individuals. Domain expertise IMHO
is almost synonymous with biased voting. Who's the world's leading on
expert on abortion?  The Pope! Does this mean that we should all be
pressured to delegate to him on the issue of reproductive rights, or
moral issues in general?

&gt;<i> 3) For every specific area, you can choose to participate directly yourself,
</I>&gt;<i> delegate, or do nothing at all. You can change this choice at any time.
</I>
According to the LQFB PP run, &quot;do nothing at all&quot; wins 6 to 1. All
this proposal does is effectively disenfranchise the vast majority of
the population. I know I asked for someone to defend the elitist
position, but I'm somewhat surprised that promoting oligarchy turned
out to be the major component of the argument...

&gt;<i> 4) You can base your choice of who to delegate to on any criteria you like.
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's because you think that person is an expert in the field. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> it's because they have a PhD or a lifetime of professional experience. Maybe
</I>&gt;<i> not. Maybe you know them personally. Maybe you're confident you share the
</I>&gt;<i> same interests. Maybe you've noticed that you tend to agree with their
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. It's up to you.
</I>
And if I want to be manipulated by a demagogue or someone who will
profit from making decisions for me, or who, by simply being honest
about their own genetic programming, will vote against what mine tells
me to do, by god that is my right!

&gt;<i> 5) Delegations are transitive, so when you delegate to somebody, you're also
</I>&gt;<i> trusting their judgement to potentially pass it on to someone else. If/when
</I>&gt;<i> this happens, you receive a notification.
</I>
We haven't gotten the results of this analysis for LQFB yet, but my
contention is that you're just multiplying the level of incompetence
by allowing this (my prediction is that the voting correlation will
drop from a measly 0.6 down to the truly random 0.5 by the second
jump).

&gt;<i> 6) You can override or revoke delegations at any time. So if there are any
</I>&gt;<i> people who have gained a large degree of influence through delegation, they
</I>&gt;<i> are always dependent on retaining the trust placed in them by all those who
</I>&gt;<i> have chosen to delegate. So there are two major ways that an oligarchy is
</I>&gt;<i> prevented from cementing its power at the top: a) division into specific
</I>&gt;<i> subject areas, b) potential to revoke delegations.
</I>
See my &quot;death by a thousand cuts&quot; argument. Even if people are only
manipulated into making bad choices in twos or threes, it's still a
non-viable system because it doesn't *represent* them.

&gt;<i> On the one hand, you argue that to admit some people understand a certain
</I>&gt;<i> issue better than others is elitist.
</I>
Not at all: I fully agree with that statement. I'm only saying that
&quot;voting based on level of understanding an issue&quot; is not even
correlated with &quot;voting like I would if I had the time/motivation to
gain that same level of understanding&quot;. Why is that so hard to
understand?

&gt;<i> On the other hand, you want people to
</I>&gt;<i> be represented by others who have &quot;the time/motivation/experience/etc. to
</I>&gt;<i> properly investigate the issue&quot;. Yet spending time investigating a subject
</I>&gt;<i> and gaining experience in a field - this is precisely how you acquire what
</I>&gt;<i> most people call expertise. I'm aware that we live in an age where people
</I>&gt;<i> have little faith in &quot;experts&quot; - and often for good reason. But that's not
</I>&gt;<i> to say that expertise doesn't exist. What we need to ensure is that experts
</I>&gt;<i> - or other people with influence - are acting in good faith. We do this by
</I>&gt;<i> designing the system so that they are always reliant on maintaining their
</I>&gt;<i> base of support.
</I>
Again, I'm still having trouble understanding why people are having
trouble understanding the problem here. Is it possible that both a
conservative and a progressive will have the same level of
&quot;understanding&quot; or expertise on an issue? If so, how likely is it that
they'll *still* vote opposite each other? The point is that expertise
isn't the issue, personality is.

&gt;<i> Another fundamental problem with this same point:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;people should be represented by direct voters who will vote like they would
</I>&gt;<i> if they had the time/motivation/experience/etc. to properly investigate the
</I>&gt;<i> issue before voting&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How will we ever know how people would have voted if they *did* have this
</I>&gt;<i> motivation, if they *did* spend a lot of time looking into it and if the
</I>&gt;<i> *did* have relevant experience?
</I>
Because, duh, this can be predicted from their personality profile!

&gt;<i> The reason to want to delegate your vote -
</I>&gt;<i> on a particular subject, not a blanket delegation - is precisely because you
</I>&gt;<i> *don't* have that level of interest/time etc. to devote to that particular
</I>&gt;<i> field. You cannot even know yourself how you would vote if you did. So your
</I>&gt;<i> definition of &quot;representation&quot; is something unknowable.
</I>
Only if you completely discount the possibility that ideology/party
affiliation/personality can be used to predict voting habits. My
proposal is has the same general characteristics as one based on
ideology/party affiliation (like all our existing misrepresentative
democracies are), it's just much more precise and much less subject to
corruption and misrepresentation because it eliminates the
power-aggregating properties of those simplistic systems.
