Subject: [MG] Book review of "Democracy for Realists"
Message-ID: <CACobxW0D9=CLTtB7YVBN_k3V+Q=Ddc-D7CJhd3+qbg4oUydPDQ@mail.gmail.com>

Looks like everyone else took the summer off too: I was swamped by
demands in RL and about the only political thing I got done was to
read Democracy for Realists (Achen and Bartels, 2016). Hopefully
things will settle down and I can get back to updating proxyfor.me now
that the Angular developers have released version 4 which reportedly
has fixed many of the design flaws that were vexing me with the
previous version (Angular 2: Seems they skipped "3").

I can't say that I'd recommend the book, especially for this group
which is undoubtedly fully aware of all the flaws in misrepresentative
democracy. It's criticism of direct democracy is at best half-hearted
and they offer exactly pretty much only one anecdotal analysis to
justify their dismissal of it: Apparently there was an example of The
People cutting fire department budgets when given direct control over
them in Illinois (data from Tessin 2009, which turns out to be an
unpublished PhD dissertation). Unfortunately although the authors
claim that this was a bad outcome, they offer very little in terms of
economic analysis to prove it. Sure, fire response times increased,
but they never provide any direct evidence that compared fire
insurance rates in these counties in Illinois with comparable counties
other states to prove that it was economically an unwise decision. Not
to mention the whole problem of expecting people to make wise
decisions when the only power they're given is to veto a tax increase
(vs. giving them total control over the budget which would allow them
to cut some other service to use that money to beef up fire fighting).
There is of course no citation of any experiments actually comparing
direct with representative democracy (e.g., maybe compare how often
major decisions are reversed in the two systems: My money would be on
representative democracy having a far higher failure rate by this
criteria). I haven't found experimental reports like that either,
though.

I was also very disappointed that they failed to deliver on the
promises made by the endorsements on the dust jacket (and cited in the
reviews on Amazon and elsewhere): Nowhere do they propose a better
system, or even any way to improve our current systems beyond some
vague handwaving about how reducing inequality will result in better
democracy. Unfortunately they apparently even lack even any awareness
of the Catch-22 implicit in their recommendation. All in all I think
the title of the book should probably have been "Democracy for Cynics"
;-)

About the only thing I *did* find enlightening were the
descriptions/examples of how demagogues take advantage of uninformed
voters and how they even have major impacts in the operation of
small-scale "deliberative democracies" like New England town halls
(i.e., "activerts" end up making the decisions in those forums, just
like they do in misrepresentative democracies everywhere else).

Anyone else get anything else out of it?

     Scott

I know I've used this analogy before, but it's all so reminiscent of
studying the arrangement of the deck chairs on the Titanic: We already
*know* that misrepresentative democracy is hopelessly flawed and that
no minor tweaks to it is going to make it perform acceptably. Do we
really need to know to the third decimal place how humans display
irrational and even unpredictable behavior in our current systems to
design new systems that eliminate the underlying flaws that lead to
that kind of behavior? It's really a shame to see so many bright
people spinning their wheels trying to theorize about how an
inherently flawed system actually works, especially when they could
instead be working on the kind of applied research that would allow
social engineers to design and implement a better one...

Subject: [MG] Democracy.Earth paper on GitHub
Message-ID: <CACobxW0hYLewJztVaqdhRTiBc0VB_3rYqRTQp-GYH2fL+bnndw@mail.gmail.com>

Democracy.Earth is trying something new, releasing a white paper on GitHub:
https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper

Unfortunately they've fallen for Liquid Democracy as the underlying
technology, something I think we've pretty much concluded is
non-viable. I'd like to advise them of this issue, but curiously can't
really figure out how to do this given the constraints of GitHub.
Anyone else have any idea other than just opening an "issue" that
their entire system is doomed to failure because of a fundamental
design flaw?

If you'd like, I'll post the screed I've written for them here, though
of course you've probably all already seen everything in it during the
analysis of the LQFB system we did last year.

I do recommend reading the paper, if only to see how little being
associated with big-shot organizations like TED and Y Combinator
really gets you in terms of competence (or enlightenment)...

I also recommend reading the "Google Votes" paper they cite, another
Liquid Democracy implementation:
http://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1092&context=dpubs_series

Curiously (or perhaps not) the delegation rate in "Google Votes" was
almost exactly the same as LQFB (around 3%) which is just another nail
in the coffin of the Liquid Democracy architecture. This just
reinforces my conclusion that the only viable decisionmaking
technology will include having delegation be the *default* (i.e.,
proxy selection will have to be "opt out" rather than "opt in").

    Scott

Message-ID: <CACobxW3ee2LLA8R0Bxiip35qDORp04n+iRepkM_rRJnQgfSWFw@mail.gmail.com>

I've been struggling with Russian (at least according to their IP
addresses) spammers/trolls/bots hacking into the Matchism forum for
the past few months, a problem that has gotten significantly worse
over the past few weeks. The problem is that most of the "Captcha"
routines have now been broken, resulting in fake accounts being
created at the rate of dozens an hour (and once an account is
"verified" by email they promptly fill the forum with spam and/or fake
political rants).

But I think I've got these holes plugged now and would appreciate it
if you all could help me make sure that I haven't just shut *everyone*
out. If you could create an account and make sure you can post
(nothing selling erection pills, just so I can distinguish you from
the spammers!), it'd be very helpful.

To give you something to talk about, I've posted my response to the
Democracy.earth proposal, and put up a short "rules of thumb for
designing an EDD system" post:
