Agree, that&#8217;s why my initially was thought was to propose an automatic process than I was hovering between automatic with a manual intervention &#8211; someone to summarize (de-compile) the raw content. Horrible to read is this legal wording/format being used, I wonder if they won&#8217;t be better off writing this in a sort of machine code/pseudocode, at least that way you could parse it within automated processes.

&gt;<i>Even FB and Twitter know this, as the majority of what is posted on them is merely relayed from other sources, not original content.
</I>
That is a potential problem, might be ok for fb and the others to use a partial reliable/entertaining source &#8211; however, in the case of a decision system, the source must be to be most accurate as opposed to just popular.  

I guess if you were to use this, you will either find an accurate source for a summary, a general public friendly version, or get someone with necessary expertize to generate that based on the raw data, at least for these most important issues.

In any case, benchmarking a system against current political setup will be most interesting and most certainly will draw some attention.

I agree, as most ideas/projects get in the incipient stage on trying to perfect details.

 

This is key, though: You definitely don't want to burn out the small pool of early adopters you'll get by forcing them try to use something that's horribly broken. I plan to err on the side of caution: Your early testers will give you a good clue when it's ready by spreading the word even if you don't ask them to.

 

In any case, best model fits best on reality and reality is changing as we speak &#8211; the social dynamics of every new generation is different(even that is not yet represented at the top), however any model you bring forward, if to be successful, it will have to match on that and the only way to get that is sync is on ongoing process. 

 

A small-business mantra: Find your niche, then exploit it fully before attempting to expand into other areas. To me this means making the system work best as an app on mobile devices because those are the people who will be most receptive to a new way of doing things.

 

 

As for strategies on how to mobilize a critical mass, how about:

-          Peg on current political/social issues, to draw people into the tool/system?

Definitely, and I recommend not being shy here. Having people vote on hot-button issues like abortion/gay rights/gun control/immigration is key to getting them hooked. This is another reason why building your own content (proposals) is key: Most real legislative bodies are paralyzed when trying to deal with these things, but they're things that *we* can take on without having to worry about getting tossed out of office ;-)

 

-          Gamification? To incentivize contributions/participation

 

I go back and forth on this. Multiplayer games are addicting in many cases precisely because of the competition. But it'll be the death of any system that tries to exploit tribalism and you end up with liberals vs conservatives. Again.

 

-          Expose platform on big social systems such as facebook,linkedin etc. over their  API

 

I agree this is how it will go viral. Whether this is what you want to try right off the bat or not, I'm not sure. Again, you don't want to annoy the early adopters by growing *too* fast or people will look at it before it's ready and never be willing to give it a second chance after being disappointed once.

 

-          Provide an API for this system to be integrated by other online social systems

 

I don't know about an API, but the raw data and its formats definitely should be published such that other people can do this sort of integration.

 

One interesting approach I was thinking about will be to peg on what on whatever is currently voted, by say parliament or equivalent, and offer public interface to vote on in parallel or in advance. Many government bodies nowadays publish their agendas daily or near real-time and module/process could be implemented to import these in the system and/or represent manually.

 

As in my previous post, I think this is a bad idea: I get very discouraged whenever I see a system that's unpleasant to use because the raw content is so tedious to read.  To start I think the system developer is going to have write *all* of the proposals to ensure that people will find them interesting and provocative. This is another reason why I believe that all proposal-generation-oriented systems are doomed to languish in obscurity: You'll just never get to critical mass if you have to rely on your users to make your content interesting.  Even FB and Twitter know this, as the majority of what is posted on them is merely relayed from other sources, not original content.

  Regards,

    Scott
