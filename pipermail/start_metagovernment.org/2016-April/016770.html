</I>&gt;<i> I believe that we basically need to satisfy three categories of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott seems to concentrate most of his effort on Freedom.
</I>&gt;<i>

Actually I'd say, of those 3, Participation is the most important to me
(and under the matchism philosophy). But it has to be the right kind of
participation: People shouldn't be expected to be experts in any particular
field or to have huge amounts of time to invest in running their
government. They just need to have the final say in any policy decision.
The key is to get the broad middle, or their proxies, involved in the
process to prevent the extremists from always getting their way (as they do
now).


&gt;<i> Still I do not know whether is it making his position simpler or more
</I>&gt;<i> successful. Moreover, I do not know whether just Freedom is enough.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hadn't seen this one before, and at least at first reading I can't say I'm
a big fan. It's hard for me to see how most of these can be classified as
&quot;human needs&quot;, when the strengths of each of the needs varies so much
between individual humans. I think it's instructive to compare this system
with psychological measures, such as the Big Five Personality Traits or FFM
(<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits</A>) which not only
allow for these kinds of individual differences, but indeed is the entire
reason for that theory's existence. The FFM also has the advantage of being
based on actual science rather than handwaving (AKA economics ;-)

A couple of other observations/criticisms:
1) Notice how &quot;work&quot; appears in more than half of the &quot;Having&quot; boxes? I
agree with him here: Developing a way to ensure that everybody has work is
key to the success of any system, and why this makes up a big chunk of the
matchism design.

2) What he's got for &quot;Identity&quot; is basically the description of tribalism.
I really hope he's wrong on that whole category or we're in deep trouble.
My claim would be that identity doesn't require tribalism (for example,
I've got more than enough of the former, but have pretty much eradicated
the latter from my personality, though that did take a lot of work), and
indeed &quot;Identity&quot; as he describes it seems to me to not even be a separate
category, it's merely the inverse of his Freedom category.
  Regards,
    Scott
