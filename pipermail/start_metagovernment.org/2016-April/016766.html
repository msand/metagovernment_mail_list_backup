</I>&gt;<i> Scott I contest your last statement Vilfredo is different than Airesis,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure there are differences in the specifics, I'm just lumping them together
based on their shared emphasis on the proposal phase rather than on the
actual decisionmaking phase.


&gt;<i> In Vilfredo a large group is unlikely ending a discussion and can be used
</I>&gt;<i> for example at the UN Security  Council to write a text that MUST be
</I>&gt;<i> accepted by tuning precice diplomatic language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Assuming there is a need for something like the UN Security Council in the
next generation government. I certainly don't (i.e., IMHO we've failed if
the UN continues to exist at all, let alone a SDAP-heaven like the Security
Council).


&gt;<i> Airesis can be used by very large group where  multiple solutions can be
</I>&gt;<i> defined  during the proposal building periods and the contribution of the
</I>&gt;<i> people involved  will define the quality  of the solutions. Is a work that

</I>&gt;<i> relator/s  but there is control instruments that allow the debate to be
</I>&gt;<i> monitored  and serious people easily understand quality of the relator/s
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
But you're just glossing over the major flaw here as if it were a feature:
By making the &quot;quality of the solutions&quot; dependent on the &quot;contribution of
the people&quot; at the proposal phase, you're just guaranteeing that the
proposals will be deeply flawed and that The People simply can't make a
good decision simply because the proposals they get will not be what they
need. My claim is that by emphasizing the proposal production part of the
process, you're trying to solve the wrong problem.

&gt;<i> At a given problem we may establish any number of solutions and even very
</I>&gt;<i> extremely opposite solutions from one another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discussion is open and for the sake of this example we need to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> that the system is open to everyone regardless of the digital divide, ok?
</I>&gt;<i> All the member have access to the system!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
They do, and this *sounds* good, but in practice only the extremists will
actually *use* it. This is exactly the opposite of what we need to do to
solve the problem of bad government. How does your system encourage the
people who *don't* have strong opinions to participate?


&gt;<i> People may participate during the debate phase but may choose not to,
</I>&gt;<i> right Scott?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Sure, that's fine. But then, they'll only get to vote on lousy watered-down
proposals because those are the only ones that will survive the &quot;debate&quot;
part of the process as it is defined in Airesis (and Vilfredo).


&gt;<i> Then we get to the point that all the possible solutions are exausted and
</I>&gt;<i> all of them are part of the decision that should find the winner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
True, but they will be &quot;exhausted&quot; by the extremists. The neurotypicals
will never even see them because all the proposals that they would have
preferred will have been removed from the pool by the extremists.


&gt;<i> Now the second phase is open and the vote by the Shulze method ,in case of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple solution, will be automatically applied. If only two choises are
</I>&gt;<i> defined, then the majority rule will be automatically applied. If only one
</I>&gt;<i> single choise is available then the sysrem will automatically use the
</I>&gt;<i> Yes,Neutral or No vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is very different from Vilfredo where opposite vision must find  a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's certainly less strict than Vilfredo, where the *only* exit is that
type of &quot;no-objection&quot; result (or &quot;last man standing&quot; as I described it
before). But, again, by emphasizing the proposal phase, my prediction is
that the outcomes of the two systems will be very similar: Policy that has
been defined by the extremists rather than by the neurotypicals in the
middle. A good proposal, one that meets the needs of the non-extremists,
will need exactly zero tweaking by The People during the generation phase.
They'll just need to read the highest rated pro and con arguments for a
proposal and vote their conscience (or defer to their
psychologically-matched proxies who will do this for them).

&gt;<i> In Airesis ve have a democratic  decision but the wisdom of the mass
</I>&gt;<i> should be the winner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not compare Airesis and Vilfredo otherwise i doubt you
</I>&gt;<i> understand the tools. I really hope we can agree on that.
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis want to be a compendium of different decisional processes because
</I>&gt;<i> there is not a single method that work for every  situation, but we want to
</I>&gt;<i> help the people to find the best decisional tool or combine different
</I>&gt;<i> method to reach the smartest, easiest,  fastest  and best decision for
</I>&gt;<i> every single situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>That's fine, but IMHO unnecessary: If the right proposals come up, a simple
majority rule vote will work fine. The key problem we need to solve is
getting the right proposals in front of The People and with the exactly
information they need to evaluate them. The actual mechanics of the vote
are small potatoes compared with that (well, excluding how proxy votes
work, which will require some very sophisticated engineering).

    Scott
