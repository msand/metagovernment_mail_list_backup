<PRE>Hi Larry,

it sounds like a meritocracy. So the problem is basically that you may be
very educated and still prejudiced. Give more power to educated,
authoritarians will get more educated.
Book gift for you

</I>&gt;<i> right you vote power is zero &#8211; perhaps just count it in as  a popular vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, every proposal will have positive and negatives. Say, on a most

</I>&gt;<i> a positive result on saving a number of lives but it will also come at a
</I>&gt;<i> cost (negative) say that will eat in the budget allocated on other areas

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Scott I contest your last statement Vilfredo is different than Airesis,
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo may be choosen as a method of reaching certain type of consensus
</I>&gt;<i> within the multiple decisional models of Airesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately  we could not agreed with Pietro to make Vilfredo as one of
</I>&gt;<i> the possible system to define singularly each solutions in proposal made on
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis because of coding language and other issues, basically lack of
</I>&gt;<i> resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo is open source and if any one is villing to rewrite in Ruby then
</I>&gt;<i> we could use Vilfredo to settle SLIGHT  differences of opinion over one
</I>&gt;<i> single solution that will be incorporated then in a  multiple solutions
</I>&gt;<i> race that Airesis will settle.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Vilfredo a large group is unlikely ending a discussion and can be used
</I>&gt;<i> for example at the UN Security  Council to write a text that MUST be
</I>&gt;<i> accepted by tuning precice diplomatic language.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis can be used by very large group where  multiple solutions can be
</I>&gt;<i> defined  during the proposal building periods and the contribution of the
</I>&gt;<i> people involved  will define the quality  of the solutions. Is a work that
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment is unfortunately the result of the interpretation of the
</I>&gt;<i> relator/s  but there is control instruments that allow the debate to be
</I>&gt;<i> monitored  and serious people easily understand quality of the relator/s
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At a given problem we may establish any number of solutions and even very
</I>&gt;<i> extremely opposite solutions from one another.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The discussion is open and for the sake of this example we need to imagine
</I>&gt;<i> that the system is open to everyone regardless of the digital divide, ok?
</I>&gt;<i> All the member have access to the system!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People may participate during the debate phase but may choose not to,
</I>&gt;<i> right Scott?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we get to the point that all the possible solutions are exausted and
</I>&gt;<i> all of them are part of the decision that should find the winner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now the second phase is open and the vote by the Shulze method ,in case of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple solution, will be automatically applied. If only two choises are
</I>&gt;<i> defined, then the majority rule will be automatically applied. If only one
</I>&gt;<i> single choise is available then the sysrem will automatically use the
</I>&gt;<i> Yes,Neutral or No vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is very different from Vilfredo where opposite vision must find  a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Airesis ve have a democratic  decision but the wisdom of the mass
</I>&gt;<i> should be the winner
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please do not compare Airesis and Vilfredo otherwise i doubt you
</I>&gt;<i> understand the tools. I really hope we can agree on that.
</I>&gt;<i> Airesis want to be a compendium of different decisional processes because
</I>&gt;<i> there is not a single method that work for every  situation, but we want to
</I>&gt;<i> help the people to find the best decisional tool or combine different
</I>&gt;<i> method to reach the smartest, easiest,  fastest  and best decision for
</I>&gt;<i> every single situation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we could all agree on this common goal and work together in this
</I>&gt;<i> scenario our time will be better spent that arguing on the inexistent
</I>&gt;<i> single decisional process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Out there the political system is obviously flawed and we all pay the
</I>&gt;<i> consequence, what have we done?
</I>&gt;<i> I invite all of you, the Metagovernment  people that I met here to join
</I>&gt;<i> the Association tecnologiedemocratiche.it  to use our great joined
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence to work toward  this common goal BUT UNITED on the development
</I>&gt;<i> of a global multi methodological decisional approach where the expertise
</I>&gt;<i> are distributed and as a team we make a real change. No one will have to
</I>&gt;<i> hope to make money out of it, but must be a democratic communistic open
</I>&gt;<i> source not for profit approach with representatives in every country on
</I>&gt;<i> earth.

</I>&gt;<i> Dear Scott the proposal in Airesis should be discussed on the Platform to

</I>&gt;<i> only ones who will participate in a proposal-shaping process) what they

</I>&gt;<i> acceptable by the extremists on both ends, and then have those same

</I>&gt;<i> Here are Ned's most recent Airesis proposals, with my 2 cents after each:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  &quot;We&quot; (initially those of us interested, then The People of Earth)
</I>&gt;<i> wish/need to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;best&quot; global social system that we can. (The one
</I>&gt;<i> that we have now is not doing so well.) To do that together, &quot;we&quot; must
</I>&gt;<i> first come up with and agree on how we will measure &quot;best&quot;. So, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> list of metrics (perhaps prioritized) applicable to global social systems
</I>&gt;<i> that can be *objectively*measured. (For a definition of the term &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; as it is being used here, see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much as I like an engineered solution to all problems, my considered
</I>&gt;<i> opinion is that we lack the information and technology we need to to make
</I>&gt;<i> the kinds of determinations this proposal requires. So, instead, I propose
</I>&gt;<i> an incremental prototype-based approach. Under the tenets of Matchism,
</I>&gt;<i> there's no problem operating in a low-information environment like this, we
</I>&gt;<i> just have to trust that we'll recognize a good system when we see one
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., the system we end up *will* match our (current) needs if only our
</I>&gt;<i> assessment system can actually collect *all* of our opinions, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just those who traditionally speak up when decisions are being made).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Particular designs are created, then proposed, then tested and
</I>&gt;<i> compared, then selected or not. That is the way that designs are &quot;found&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally. (The other way that designs are &quot;found&quot; is unintentionally
</I>&gt;<i> -- the design just happens by accident.) So, to &quot;find&quot; new global social
</I>&gt;<i> system designs intentionally, we need a *decision system* that can
</I>&gt;<i> receive and rigorously, independently, realistically test and compare
</I>&gt;<i> design proposals. Proposals are invited -- what decision system design
</I>&gt;<i> shall we use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Majority rules. Sometimes derided as &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Rejection
</I>&gt;<i> of that in favor of collaborative or consensus-based models is actually
</I>&gt;<i> counter to the tenets of Matchism: If the majority of humans are
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with a solution, even if it means imposing some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> discrimination against some minority or the environment or whatever, then
</I>&gt;<i> *that*, by definition, is the proper decision. This of course opens up the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that we will bring back slavery, deny women the right to
</I>&gt;<i> participate, etc. if that's what the majority decides. If you believe that
</I>&gt;<i> this will happen and are opposed to Matchism or a majority-rules base
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking system on that basis, you are actually a chauvinist and an
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian: You are attempting to impose your world view on the majority
</I>&gt;<i> of people who would rather do it differently. Not that there's anything
</I>&gt;<i> wrong with that, but best evidence to date is that you are in the minority
</I>&gt;<i> and that your views will therefore be discounted. Ironic, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Basically we have two choices: build a laboratory in which we can
</I>&gt;<i> realistically test and compare competing global social systems designs
</I>&gt;<i> harmlessly before inflicting one of them on the world, or not. (Armchair
</I>&gt;<i> ideologue amateurs will choose to skip the laboratory testing -- amateurs
</I>&gt;<i> always do. Something to do with a variation of the Dunning&#8211;Kruger effect.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with #1, this IMHO is a recipe for inaction and so not a viable
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. We simply lack the knowledge and technology to do this. People's
</I>&gt;<i> natural conservatism will prevent USSR/Red China type disasters from
</I>&gt;<i> occurring if SDAP-based leadership can be prevented from seizing control
</I>&gt;<i> (again, if The People, as a whole, are the ones actually making the
</I>&gt;<i> decisions). If they make a hash of it by our current thinking, it's our
</I>&gt;<i> current thinking that's wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>
