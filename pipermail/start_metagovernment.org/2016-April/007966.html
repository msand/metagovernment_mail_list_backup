<PRE>I see that Ned has put up a bunch of new proposals on Airesis in response
to my post. You can get to them from the Metagovernmant home page there:
<A HREF="https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment">https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment</A>

I'm going to post another message here with my 2 cents on them, but in this
post I'm going to do a &quot;meta&quot; analysis of why I'm not highly motivated to
actually use Airesis, or indeed any of the other  systems that people on
this list seem to be drawn toward.

The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need
here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making
systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the
proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account
everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are
passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our
psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the
neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.

If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say
&quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the
generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out
large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use
psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an
individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket
abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative
government.

Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box
where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty
much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs,
or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or
Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the
most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual
decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The
biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to
participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;.
Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes
that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO
making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they
end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly
shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the
most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and
effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak
&quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the
problems they were meant to address.
  Regards,
    Scott
