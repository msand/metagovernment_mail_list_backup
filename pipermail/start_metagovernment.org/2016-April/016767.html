&gt;<i> We, as a species, be default, don&#8217;t know much aside our basic instincts,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I disagree, with both claims: We know *a lot* about our instinctive
behaviors (I call them Clinations in matchism), what we mostly lack is any
skill at reasoning about them. This can be learned, though. As for judging
the quality of systems based on success or failure of individuals or
policies, the problem here is that this requires working to change the
system from within. I'm thinking this is unlikely to happen, or at least to
happen as fast we need it to. If all you have to work with is what is
acceptable to our current policymakers (who are mostly SDAP), you simply
don't have enough range.

&gt;<i> If it were for a popular vote, many of our great achievements, say space
</I>&gt;<i> exploration,  will had never happen &#8211; as the knowledge/understanding of the
</I>&gt;<i> masses at the time was limited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>This is a value judgement: It's not even appropriate to consider space
exploration a &quot;great achievement&quot; unless you compare it to other things
that might have been done with those resources (curing cancer or diabetes,
ending poverty, preventing the Vietnam or Iraq wars, etc.).

&gt;<i> Sure, everyone must have the right to vote and participate in the decision
</I>&gt;<i> making
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However everyone has the obligation/responsibility to have a very good
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge/understanding on the subject &#8211; say a political platform they are
</I>&gt;<i> voting on, otherwise their vote is:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> a)      Lottery like random
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> b)      Most dangerous , easily manipulated by extreme  propaganda not on
</I>&gt;<i> the real value
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>True, but there is a third, &quot;outside the box&quot; option: Delegating their vote
to psychologically matched proxies. They therefore don't have to become
experts on a subject, they just have to defer to people who are like them
who have (i.e., like &quot;representatives&quot;, but not self-selected and (most of
the time) not SDAP). This gets around both of these issues, although with
b) we also benefit from the fact that susceptibility to propaganda is not
uniformly distributed in the population (authoritarians, for example, are
vastly more like to act on group-think like this, but fortunately are a
minority of the population).


&gt;<i> I think one way avoid this is to associate a knowledge factor on the issue
</I>&gt;<i> to every vote.
</I>&gt;<i> Say by default your vote has a full value of 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then as a part of vote casting you will have to take a test with random
</I>&gt;<i> question on the issue/platform you are voting on. That will provide some
</I>&gt;<i> insurance that you understand the pros and cons. Getting only half the
</I>&gt;<i> answers right will factor/give you 0.5 value of vote &#8211; if you get none
</I>&gt;<i> right you vote power is zero &#8211; perhaps just count it in as  a popular vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Unfortunately what you're going to do with this is weed out the
non-extremists. These are exactly the same people that are disenfranchised
by our current systems, with disastrous results.

&gt;<i> Now, every proposal will have positive and negatives. Say, on a most
</I>&gt;<i> recent issue, your vote to increase security against terrorism, might have
</I>&gt;<i> a positive result on saving a number of lives but it will also come at a
</I>&gt;<i> cost (negative) say that will eat in the budget allocated on other areas
</I>&gt;<i> and will require people to give up on things like privacy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>It's true: Policymaking is hard. I just happen to have faith that regular
people can do it, if they're provided with a system that makes it efficient
for them to do so. If the resulting policies are very different from what
we have now, *as long as it matches The Will of The People*, the new policy
is the right policy (that's matchism).

    Scott
