<PRE>&gt;<i>Again, the result of SDAP leadership, acting as amateur social engineers: What *is* the best way to reduce terrorism? Or does the fact that 10 times as many people die in car accidents and from drug overdoses mean that we should concentrate our efforts there instead?
</I>


Agree, actually their approach actually suits their game &#8211; it&#8217;s a lot harder to gain political capital by  solving real problems (as you mentioned,  car accidents, drugs,etc), than jump in and be the hero who saved world from the all mighty terrorists, all &#8220;five&#8221; of them &#8230;

&gt;<i>but you (and the SDAP leadership) are advocating simply taking the decision out of my hands based on your own value judgments.  I do have a problem with that.
</I>
 

Me? :) I wish I had that &#8220;power&#8221; &#8211; I am just presenting an argument in support of something I believe is of importance for all of us in the long term, and open for debate. And by the way politicians mostly &#8220;support&#8221; this not because they have genuine interest into it or vision &#8211; it&#8217;s because of the extraordinary nature of it that makes it a great political capital/tool.   

 

&gt;<i>The &quot;proxies&quot; will be matched the same way that eHarmony and match.com work
</I>
 

I wonder how many relationships matched by either eharmony or matched.com were successful in the end? However, this is all new to me, I will need more time to look into it. 

&gt;<i> It is vastly more difficult to change people than to change systems
</I>


Well, not sure about this one, only people will change the system. Even if you bring a system in parallel and convince people to adhere to it, only to latter replace the current &#8211; that still involves a change in the people. I don&#8217;t think there is a way around it. The current &#8220;system&#8221; will never agree to its own extinction &#8211; you might try to trick it in &#8211; but that could take even longer bottom =up approach and with less guarantees that you will be ever successful.

&gt;<i>This is a value judgement: It's not even appropriate to consider space exploration a &quot;great

</I>
Perhaps &#8220;space exploration&#8221; is not the best example to bring forward (might sound a bit exotic), however I must argue, knowing what it takes, that this is a great feat of achievement for our civilization. 

And, ok, I will compare, on one side:

-           A lot more money was spent in an attempt to cure cancer and other diseases, or to alleviate poverty, and all with little results so far.

 

Actually *lots* of progress has been made in curing cancers, although it's been very uneven so far (some are completely curable, but with many others very little progress has been made). Eradicating poverty has been a dismal failure, other than the &quot;rising tide lifts all boats&quot; phenomenon (poverty in developed countries ain't what it used to be), but IMHO that's exactly because the wrong people are working on it: Almost all of the &quot;work&quot; is done by amateur social engineers, most of whom, to make things worse, are SDAP and so are more interested in stigmatizing the poor than in fixing the underlying problems. This could have, and I maintain would have, been very different if The People had been the ones choosing our goals and assigning who works on them.

 

-           Wars in Vietnam/Iraq &#8211; ironically, US motivated involvement in these on the idea of preventing war and terrorism &#8211; and for that they spent only in Iraq 1.7 trillion? And to date the Vietnam war cost over  is at 700 billion?

Again, the result of SDAP leadership, acting as amateur social engineers: What *is* the best way to reduce terrorism? Or does the fact that 10 times as many people die in car accidents and from drug overdoses mean that we should concentrate our efforts there instead?

 

And on the other side:

-          With an average budget of 20billion a year, Nasa is just a tiny fraction of these cumulated costs allocated to say cancer/diseases, poverty, trying to stop wars etc.

 

Is there even a &quot;stop wars&quot; or &quot;alternative to wars&quot; department that we could vote to increase funding for? 

-          They did deliver, agree not as efficient as it should had as they turn to much in bureaucracy, but overall major progress is undeniable.   

-          Space exploration is most important to insure the long term survival of our species, as a whole. As long as we are pinned to this rock we are sitting ducks, and everything we did, all these thousands of years of sacrifice and hopes, could be gone in a puff, with no story to tell or not even a sign that we ever existed.

 

I don't have a problem with space exploration, or any scientific endeavor per se, but you (and the SDAP leadership) are advocating simply taking the decision out of my hands based on your own value judgments.  I do have a problem with that.

 

&gt;<i> Delegating their vote to psychologically matched proxies.
</I>
That is to assume that their psychological matched &#8220;proxies&#8221; are genuine &#8211; which in reality is not as most political campaign strategists will manipulate  along the lines of what a specific niche want to hear &#8211; psychologically. If you are going to &#8220;anchor&#8221; to a proxy, I believe you need to do that on something more than just a &#8220;feeling&#8221; of  right or wrong, as that, as history proved over and over again, is prone to manipulation.

The &quot;proxies&quot; will be matched the same way that eHarmony and match.com work: You answer a bunch of questions and get matched with a selection of other people who would likely vote the same way as you do, but for whatever reason have more time to research the issues or who have had some specialized education or work experience in a particular field. The only way to manipulate people under this scenario is if you simply lie on the questionaires. But there's a built-in fix for this: With open voting it'll be trivial to detect someone like this, either before you pick your proxies, or perhaps even systematically (people's profiles might get an asterisk if their voting record does not match their profile).

 

And, manipulation is not a quality of a limited group of &#8220;authoritarians&#8221; is part of our own nature, so even if you are going to dilute that top influence you are still going to get an unwanted bias from with the system. In my opinion, whatever system you implement you will need something to validated /score how genuine that vote is.

But we've got to work with the raw material we've got. Another key tenet of matchism is that morality and progress in public policy is a progressive thing: It is vastly more difficult to change people than to change systems, so we change the systems now, and the morality of the people will follow along some decades later.

 

&gt;<i>They therefore don't have to become experts on a subject
</I>
They don&#8217;t need to be experts on the subject; they just need to be educated in the sense of seeing core value of the proposal, to see beyond manipulation and marketing techniques. I believe that this kind of education should be part of the basic curriculum.

I agree with your conclusion that education is key: People need to know *how* they are being manipulated. Most important IMHO in this area is how fearmongering turns borderline people into authoritarians, increasing the problematic votes from less than a quarter of the population to closer to half. But unfortunately this would take decades to achieve and we may not have that long, so we need to put the corrections in the system design, not require that the people change first.

 


&gt;<i> Unfortunately what you're going to do with this is weed out the non-extremists
</I>
That is if you assume that only extremists care to learn about what they are voting for? In any case, the secret here will be in asking the right questions to represent both sides of the coin, pros and cons, benefits and costs.
I think the core extremists are less of a problem as they usually are a minority &#8211; the major problem is when they become a psychological matched proxy for mass niches through manipulation of perception. 

No, the problem is that these extremists are the ones who participate in the political process. The vast majority of regular people (the neurotypicals) just defer to them (politicians, military and industry leaders, etc.) There currently *are* no matching leaders because they are simply psychologically not like the majority of the neurotypicals in the population.

 

You will forcing proposals to provide accurate/clear information on both pros and cons in order to get a valid vote and that in turn will bring in better awareness &#8211; the way I see it manipulation happens where things are fuzzy and essential information is omitted.

 Agreed, with the addition that The People must be the ones who decide what is relevant and useful. If you have a committee or whatever making these decisions (the way it works now), that committee gets populated with SDAPs (because they're the ones that like to do this kind of work) and as a result the evaluation is as useless as just letting the SDAPs vote on things directly.
