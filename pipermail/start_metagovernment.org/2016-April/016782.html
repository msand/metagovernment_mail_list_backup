I agree, as most ideas/projects get in the incipient stage on trying to perfect details.



In any case, best model fits best on reality and reality is changing as we speak &#8211; the social dynamics of every new generation is different(even that is not yet represented at the top), however any model you bring forward, if to be successful, it will have to match on that and the only way to get that is sync is on ongoing process. 



As for strategies on how to mobilize a critical mass, how about:



-          Peg on current political/social issues, to draw people into the tool/system?

-          Gamification? To incentivize contributions/participation

-          Expose platform on big social systems such as facebook,linkedin etc. over their  API

-          Provide an API for this system to be integrated by other online social systems

One interesting approach I was thinking about will be to peg on what on whatever is currently voted, by say parliament or equivalent, and offer public interface to vote on in parallel or in advance. Many government bodies nowadays publish their agendas daily or near real-time and module/process could be implemented to import these in the system and/or represent manually.

Larry

Dear Scott

the proposal making will be an expression of individual views and combined views that will form different solution to a problem. Once there is no more to say and no other solution are expressed the proposal is considered completed. At that point there is a vote on the solutions and range voting is applied by using the shulze method.

 

Oh, I understand how it's *supposed* to work. I'm just saying, from a social engineering perspective, that the outcome is suboptimal because these &quot;consensus-building&quot; approaches burn out and eliminate the very people the decision-making system needs to function properly: Focusing on the proposal refining process is exactly backwards because doing so actually *prevents* the right decisions from being made because it filters out all of the people who should be the ones actually making the decisions!

 

As we are few non one plan to enforce the outcome! If we where thousand then will be interesting to see how it will play out

Vilfredo created a compromise and politics are compromise anyway!

 

Certainly there are advantages to supermajority decisions (enforceability, general respect for the law and government, etc.), but in general I disagree with this view: Politics primarily needs to be compromise-oriented because our current political systems emphasize divisiveness (party-based elections, corruptible representative based decisionmaking, etc.) My belief is that good proposals will be adopted by regular people just by having them read well-reasoned arguments, or being able to pick psychologically-matched proxies who will do this for them. In the US, things like gun control and abortion restrictions, which most people consider to be politically intractable, seem to me relatively easy to solve because

 

If

 

the majority of the people just *know* what restrictions are appropriate. 

 

and

 

The problem is that we have no way of turning that general belief about what is appropriate into law. 

 

and

 

A system that offers great facility in developing compromise is of no value in these cases: 

 

 but

 

Someone could just write down what the general feeling of the neurotypicals is and they will vote to approve it.

 

So that

 

No proposal-shaping or consensus-building is necessary at all.

 

Why the 

 

/goto/ Someone... it.

 

never take place 

/goto/

???

 

Ok after reading you and reading that there is no need to build a  Proposal shaping or consensus -building tool

 

What we have accomplished to make society work better, NOTHING.

 

I do believe that is just because we do not know how to do that.

Because there is no conscience about our organizational power and on the other side there is a very well established system that slowly but constantly work to make sure that this conscience is not surfacing.

 

A tool that let you shape collaboratively what you &quot;know&quot; and let you organize your collaborative  power to deliberate, does the trick to focus people into the possibility.

Once is ready and available is now time to become activist and organize a critical mass &lt;<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass_(sociodynamics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass_(sociodynamics</A>)&gt;  

 

Some one may think that this must be done in a lab! No must be done in the big lab that is your social system and turning it around so that little by little the peaceful revolution take place.

 

I love you guys but sometime I think why there is so little action? the tool are made but the critical mass no one knows how to mobilize. Maybe we should stop thinking about the perfect self sustaining social system but look for way to build unstoppable social mass.

We have the internet!!!!

Sure, the extremists on both sides are going to hate the resulting policies, but that's OK because those are exactly the kind of minorities we *should* be discriminating against.

I see that Ned has put up a bunch of new proposals on Airesis in response to my post. You can get to them from the Metagovernmant home page there:

<A HREF="https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment">https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment</A>

 

I'm going to post another message here with my 2 cents on them, but in this post I'm going to do a &quot;meta&quot; analysis of why I'm not highly motivated to actually use Airesis, or indeed any of the other  systems that people on this list seem to be drawn toward.

 

The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.

 

If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say &quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative government.

 

Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs, or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;. Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak &quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the problems they were meant to address.

  Regards,

    Scott
