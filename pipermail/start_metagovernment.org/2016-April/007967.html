<PRE>Here are Ned's most recent Airesis proposals, with my 2 cents after each:

1)  &quot;We&quot; (initially those of us interested, then The People of Earth)
wish/need to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;best&quot; global social system that we can. (The one
that we have now is not doing so well.) To do that together, &quot;we&quot; must
first come up with and agree on how we will measure &quot;best&quot;. So, we need a
list of metrics (perhaps prioritized) applicable to global social systems
that can be *objectively*measured. (For a definition of the term &quot;social
system&quot; as it is being used here, see
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html</A> )

Much as I like an engineered solution to all problems, my considered
opinion is that we lack the information and technology we need to to make
the kinds of determinations this proposal requires. So, instead, I propose
an incremental prototype-based approach. Under the tenets of Matchism,
there's no problem operating in a low-information environment like this, we
just have to trust that we'll recognize a good system when we see one
(i.e., the system we end up *will* match our (current) needs if only our
assessment system can actually collect *all* of our opinions, rather than
just those who traditionally speak up when decisions are being made).

2) Particular designs are created, then proposed, then tested and compared,
then selected or not. That is the way that designs are &quot;found&quot;
intentionally. (The other way that designs are &quot;found&quot; is unintentionally
-- the design just happens by accident.) So, to &quot;find&quot; new global social
system designs intentionally, we need a *decision system* that can receive
and rigorously, independently, realistically test and compare design
proposals. Proposals are invited -- what decision system design shall we
use?

Majority rules. Sometimes derided as &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Rejection
of that in favor of collaborative or consensus-based models is actually
counter to the tenets of Matchism: If the majority of humans are
comfortable with a solution, even if it means imposing some sort of
discrimination against some minority or the environment or whatever, then
*that*, by definition, is the proper decision. This of course opens up the
possibility that we will bring back slavery, deny women the right to
participate, etc. if that's what the majority decides. If you believe that
this will happen and are opposed to Matchism or a majority-rules base
decisionmaking system on that basis, you are actually a chauvinist and an
authoritarian: You are attempting to impose your world view on the majority
of people who would rather do it differently. Not that there's anything
wrong with that, but best evidence to date is that you are in the minority
and that your views will therefore be discounted. Ironic, isn't it?

3) Basically we have two choices: build a laboratory in which we can
realistically test and compare competing global social systems designs
harmlessly before inflicting one of them on the world, or not. (Armchair
ideologue amateurs will choose to skip the laboratory testing -- amateurs
always do. Something to do with a variation of the Dunning&#8211;Kruger effect.)

As with #1, this IMHO is a recipe for inaction and so not a viable
proposal. We simply lack the knowledge and technology to do this. People's
natural conservatism will prevent USSR/Red China type disasters from
occurring if SDAP-based leadership can be prevented from seizing control
(again, if The People, as a whole, are the ones actually making the
decisions). If they make a hash of it by our current thinking, it's our
current thinking that's wrong.
  Regards,
    Scott
