The problem with this is that most bills being voted on by parliaments are
lengthy and filled with technical talk, often with reference to other
complex bills, also, most bills are about a subject that most of us care
little about. This not blend well with the average citizens attention span,
it's even been noted that at times the politicians don't even have the
patience to read these things through. This indeed might be a larger
overall problem but I think the system that we end up needs to strive for
simplicity.

I propose that each bill presented in the system should answer a Frequently
Asked Questions section that is the same questions every time. A set of
questions that help break down any idea for any change. This would provide
a quick and easy reference that the average citizen would be able to
digest, then if they felt any question was not answered to the truthfully
or to the full extent they could prod further into the bill.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> As we are few non one plan to enforce the outcome! If we where thousand

</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo created a compromise and politics are compromise anyway!

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Certainly there are advantages to supermajority decisions (enforceability,
</I>&gt;<i> general respect for the law and government, etc.), but in general I
</I>&gt;<i> disagree with this view: Politics primarily needs to be compromise-oriented
</I>&gt;<i> because our current political systems emphasize divisiveness (party-based
</I>&gt;<i> elections, corruptible representative based decisionmaking, etc.) My belief
</I>&gt;<i> is that good proposals will be adopted by regular people just by having
</I>&gt;<i> them read well-reasoned arguments, or being able to pick
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically-matched proxies who will do this for them. In the US,
</I>&gt;<i> things like gun control and abortion restrictions, which most people

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that we have no way of turning that general belief about

</I>&gt;<i> this list seem to be drawn toward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need
</I>&gt;<i> here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are
</I>&gt;<i> passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out
</I>&gt;<i> large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an
</I>&gt;<i> individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket
</I>&gt;<i> abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box
</I>&gt;<i> where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs,
</I>&gt;<i> or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the
</I>&gt;<i> most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The
</I>&gt;<i> biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes
</I>&gt;<i> that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they
</I>&gt;<i> end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the
</I>&gt;<i> most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and
</I>&gt;<i> effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the
</I>&gt;<i> problems they were meant to address.
