<PRE>&gt;<i>I love you guys but sometime I think why there is so little action? the tool are made but the critical mass no one knows how to mobilize. Maybe we should stop thinking about the perfect self sustaining social system but look for way to build unstoppable social mass.
</I>
Or yet, another &#8220;wild&#8221; idea, what about creating a political party on top of this system were the actual &#8220;politicians&#8221; will be/function just as speakers/interface for proposals/decision/votes/PR resulted from within the system. 

People might be more entice to participate by the fact that they will be actually represented into the real life.

&gt;&gt;<i> In any case, best model fits best on reality and reality is changing as we speak &#8211; the social dynamics of every new generation is different(even that is not yet represented at the top), however any model you bring forward, if to be successful, it will have to match on that and the only way to get that is sync is on ongoing process.
</I>
Dynamic Democracy where voted proposal can  be immediately put back in discussion, especially if social results are showing a deteriorating quality of life.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for strategies on how to mobilize a critical mass, how about:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Peg on current political/social issues, to draw people into the tool/system
</I>
Will try to put current issues on proposal or vote on my new criticall mass group creation an Airesis

&gt;&gt;<i> -          Gamification? To incentivize contributions/participation
</I>
I have doubt that we can gamificate a democracy platform, we have even made an analysis in Airesis but the cost of programming was to expensive, instead i know that there are virtual society games where they play acting like real public service managers and thet need to take group decisions. This could be a good promoter of democratic process  education

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Expose platform on big social systems such as facebook,linkedin etc. over their  API
</I>
Too expensive for our association, we considered for the Meetup platform but resources was not sufficient

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Provide an API for this system to be integrated by other online social systems
</I>
This was on our plan but the head programmer give up last month and we are kind of desperate!
I estimate that  if i do not succeed in bringing my experimental critical mass group to at least 100000 users by may 2017 the assocciation may not be able to maintain the server. All the internationalization  effort i made over the last 3 years, 13 languages,  dozens of volunteers  translation are going to be waisted.
To give you an idea of how generous are Italians: 15000 registered users have contributed last year with 1600 euros! barely sufficient to pay for the hosting.
13 languages i including specific domains .us .eu in english have accounted for 600 users only! I try to do some communication outside of Italy, but there is something not very clear because I cannot explain suche little success outside of Italy.

Kind Regards
J

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One interesting approach I was thinking about will be to peg on what on whatever is currently voted, by say parliament or equivalent, and offer public interface to vote on in parallel or in advance. Many government bodies nowadays publish their agendas daily or near real-time and module/process could be implemented to import these in the system and/or represent manually.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Scott
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proposal making will be an expression of individual views and combined views that will form different solution to a problem. Once there is no more to say and no other solution are expressed the proposal is considered completed. At that point there is a vote on the solutions and range voting is applied by using the shulze method.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, I understand how it's *supposed* to work. I'm just saying, from a social engineering perspective, that the outcome is suboptimal because these &quot;consensus-building&quot; approaches burn out and eliminate the very people the decision-making system needs to function properly: Focusing on the proposal refining process is exactly backwards because doing so actually *prevents* the right decisions from being made because it filters out all of the people who should be the ones actually making the decisions!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Certainly there are advantages to supermajority decisions (enforceability, general respect for the law and government, etc.), but in general I disagree with this view: Politics primarily needs to be compromise-oriented because our current political systems emphasize divisiveness (party-based elections, corruptible representative based decisionmaking, etc.) My belief is that good proposals will be adopted by regular people just by having them read well-reasoned arguments, or being able to pick psychologically-matched proxies who will do this for them. In the US, things like gun control and abortion restrictions, which most people consider to be politically intractable, seem to me relatively easy to solve because

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm going to post another message here with my 2 cents on them, but in this post I'm going to do a &quot;meta&quot; analysis of why I'm not highly motivated to actually use Airesis, or indeed any of the other  systems that people on this list seem to be drawn toward.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say &quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative government.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs, or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;. Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak &quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the problems they were meant to address.
