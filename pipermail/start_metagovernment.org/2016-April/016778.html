<PRE>I was trying to apply the mechanism know from you to Neighbourhoods's
Messengers' Network and I came to an interesting paradox.
Let us assume the decision (labelled as global) of the neighbourhood was
&quot;neurotipical&quot; and that it was some standardised neighbourhood. With an
average number and quality of SDO, RWA, etc...

Now, should I expect all neighbourhoods to be standardised and simple say
that they will probably accept it as well (except they express the
opposite)?

What about local conditions? Climate? Available technology?

Kind regards
m.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So how to avoid tribalism?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Socialization. The problem now really isn't that we don't know how to do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it, we just don't recognize that we need to. I cringe every time I hear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so-called liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton rail against TPP
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or NAFTA or other trade agreements, as if it's OK if we in the US inflict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> deprivation or even starvation on people living in other countries just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> long as the guy down the block doesn't have to worry about his job and can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> afford to buy a new car every couple of years. There are certainly a small
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> minority of people who are at risk of being directly affected by these
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> treaties, in which case opposition can be considered to be rational
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> self-interest. But for most people it's simply tribalism (if not outright
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> racism) that is governing their behavior. Often times this tribalism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually causes *irrational* behavior: For example, even though their
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standard of living would go up due to the treaty, because the standard of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> living of &quot;those other people&quot; would go up more the tribalists feel like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they're somehow getting screwed over.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Are there any good tribes?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Good question. I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because of the slippery-slope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem: Once you get the idea that it's OK to divide people into &quot;us&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;them&quot; it seems to me very difficult to clearly distinguish situations
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where it's OK to do this from those where it's not. I'd be tempted to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exclude certain broad categories, like team sports, except that soccer
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hooligans and the riots we have here in the US after major competitions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have convincingly shown that there are problems even allowing for that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I recognize that this presents serious problems for matchism itself,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which like any movement requires &quot;joining&quot; and would probably need to take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> advantage of tribalism to grow. How is it not hypocritical to want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> divide the world into matchists and non-matchists when matchism itself says
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you shouldn't do this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I think the more important question is the same one that applies to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all social-engineering corrections for our problematic Clinations: Is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> general stress reduction from achieving the social engineering goal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> definitely greater than the stress inflicted by the procedure itself? The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> answer to this question seems pretty clear to me for tribalism, but is much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> less obvious for other things (religion, deference to authority, drug use,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> etc.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   Regards,
