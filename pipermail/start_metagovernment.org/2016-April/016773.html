This is essentially the way it works here in Boulder, Colorado too,
although we have fewer referendums that we actually get to vote on
(legalizing marijuana being the most significant recent example). But
although the &quot;blue book&quot; that contains this information is sent out with
the ballot, as it turns out few people read it (it's not actually part of
the ballot itself), nor is there any sort of citizen review or rating of
the quality of this &quot;information&quot; (i.e., it's just the extremist's
unchallenged opinions).


&gt;<i> The vote value is always a one and we shall rely on better education and

This of course is characteristic of all democracies, representative or
otherwise. But again, I'd argue that the problem of &quot;selfish behavior&quot;
you're describing in this case is with the way the proposals are written,
and who they're written by, not with the way people vote. People will vote
for tax increases, for example, that don't even benefit themselves if the
right proposal comes by. This actually happens often here in Boulder where
the Open Space and Mountain Parks department, which is funded by special
sales taxes approved directly by the voters, has more money than they know
what to do with and have and continue to buy up vast tracts of land that
very few of the citizens ever even visit (indeed a sizable fraction of it
we are even prohibited from &quot;trespassing&quot; on, even though we collectively
own it!).

    Scott
