<PRE>Dear Scott
the proposal making will be an expression of individual views and combined
views that will form different solution to a problem. Once there is no more
to say and no other solution are expressed the proposal is considered
completed. At that point there is a vote on the solutions and range voting
is applied by using the shulze method.
As we are few non one plan to enforce the outcome! If we where thousand
then will be interesting to see how it will play out
Vilfredo created a compromise and politics are compromise anyway!

&gt;<i> I see that Ned has put up a bunch of new proposals on Airesis in response

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment">https://airesis.eu/groups/metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to post another message here with my 2 cents on them, but in
</I>&gt;<i> this post I'm going to do a &quot;meta&quot; analysis of why I'm not highly motivated
</I>&gt;<i> to actually use Airesis, or indeed any of the other  systems that people on
</I>&gt;<i> this list seem to be drawn toward.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need
</I>&gt;<i> here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making
</I>&gt;<i> systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the
</I>&gt;<i> proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account
</I>&gt;<i> everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are
</I>&gt;<i> passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the
</I>&gt;<i> neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the
</I>&gt;<i> generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out
</I>&gt;<i> large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an
</I>&gt;<i> individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket
</I>&gt;<i> abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative
</I>&gt;<i> government.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box
</I>&gt;<i> where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty
</I>&gt;<i> much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs,
</I>&gt;<i> or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the
</I>&gt;<i> most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The
</I>&gt;<i> biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to
</I>&gt;<i> participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes
</I>&gt;<i> that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they
</I>&gt;<i> end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly
</I>&gt;<i> shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the
</I>&gt;<i> most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and
</I>&gt;<i> effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the
</I>&gt;<i> problems they were meant to address.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
