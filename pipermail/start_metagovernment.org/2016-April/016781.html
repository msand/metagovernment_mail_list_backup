&gt;<i>This is a value judgement: It's not even appropriate to consider space exploration a &quot;great 
</I>&gt;<i>achievement&quot; unless you compare it to other things that might have been done with those &gt;resources (curing cancer or diabetes, ending poverty, preventing the Vietnam or Iraq wars, etc.).
</I>
Perhaps &#8220;space exploration&#8221; is not the best example to bring forward (might sound a bit exotic), however I must argue, knowing what it takes, that this is a great feat of achievement for our civilization. 

And, ok, I will compare, on one side:

-           A lot more money was spent in an attempt to cure cancer and other diseases, or to alleviate poverty, and all with little results so far.

-           Wars in Vietnam/Iraq &#8211; ironically, US motivated involvement in these on the idea of preventing war and terrorism &#8211; and for that they spent only in Iraq 1.7 trillion? And to date the Vietnam war cost over  is at 700 billion? 

And on the other side:

-          With an average budget of 20billion a year, Nasa is just a tiny fraction of these cumulated costs allocated to say cancer/diseases, poverty, trying to stop wars etc. 

-          They did deliver, agree not as efficient as it should had as they turn to much in bureaucracy, but overall major progress is undeniable.   

-          Space exploration is most important to insure the long term survival of our species, as a whole. As long as we are pinned to this rock we are sitting ducks, and everything we did, all these thousands of years of sacrifice and hopes, could be gone in a puff, with no story to tell or not even a sign that we ever existed. 

&gt;<i> Delegating their vote to psychologically matched proxies.
</I>
That is to assume that their psychological matched &#8220;proxies&#8221; are genuine &#8211; which in reality is not as most political campaign strategists will manipulate  along the lines of what a specific niche want to hear &#8211; psychologically. If you are going to &#8220;anchor&#8221; to a proxy, I believe you need to do that on something more than just a &#8220;feeling&#8221; of  right or wrong, as that, as history proved over and over again, is prone to manipulation. 
And, manipulation is not a quality of a limited group of &#8220;authoritarians&#8221; is part of our own nature, so even if you are going to dilute that top influence you are still going to get an unwanted bias from with the system. In my opinion, whatever system you implement you will need something to validated /score how genuine that vote is. 

&gt;<i>They therefore don't have to become experts on a subject
</I>
They don&#8217;t need to be experts on the subject; they just need to be educated in the sense of seeing core value of the proposal, to see beyond manipulation and marketing techniques. I believe that this kind of education should be part of the basic curriculum.

&gt;<i> Unfortunately what you're going to do with this is weed out the non-extremists
</I>
That is if you assume that only extremists care to learn about what they are voting for? In any case, the secret here will be in asking the right questions to represent both sides of the coin, pros and cons, benefits and costs.
I think the core extremists are less of a problem as they usually are a minority &#8211; the major problem is when they become a psychological matched proxy for mass niches through manipulation of perception. 
You will forcing proposals to provide accurate/clear information on both pros and cons in order to get a valid vote and that in turn will bring in better awareness &#8211; the way I see it manipulation happens where things are fuzzy and essential information is omitted. 

Regards,

Larry

We, as a species, be default, don&#8217;t know much aside our basic instincts, however we learn from failure and success of some who deviate from these &#8220;core values&#8221;.

I disagree, with both claims: We know *a lot* about our instinctive behaviors (I call them Clinations in matchism), what we mostly lack is any skill at reasoning about them. This can be learned, though. As for judging the quality of systems based on success or failure of individuals or policies, the problem here is that this requires working to change the system from within. I'm thinking this is unlikely to happen, or at least to happen as fast we need it to. If all you have to work with is what is acceptable to our current policymakers (who are mostly SDAP), you simply don't have enough range.

If it were for a popular vote, many of our great achievements, say space exploration,  will had never happen &#8211; as the knowledge/understanding of the masses at the time was limited.

This is a value judgement: It's not even appropriate to consider space exploration a &quot;great achievement&quot; unless you compare it to other things that might have been done with those resources (curing cancer or diabetes, ending poverty, preventing the Vietnam or Iraq wars, etc.).

Sure, everyone must have the right to vote and participate in the decision making 

However everyone has the obligation/responsibility to have a very good knowledge/understanding on the subject &#8211; say a political platform they are voting on, otherwise their vote is:

a)      Lottery like random

b)      Most dangerous , easily manipulated by extreme  propaganda not on the real value

True, but there is a third, &quot;outside the box&quot; option: Delegating their vote to psychologically matched proxies. They therefore don't have to become experts on a subject, they just have to defer to people who are like them who have (i.e., like &quot;representatives&quot;, but not self-selected and (most of the time) not SDAP). This gets around both of these issues, although with b) we also benefit from the fact that susceptibility to propaganda is not uniformly distributed in the population (authoritarians, for example, are vastly more like to act on group-think like this, but fortunately are a minority of the population).

 

I think one way avoid this is to associate a knowledge factor on the issue to every vote. 
Say by default your vote has a full value of 1.

Then as a part of vote casting you will have to take a test with random question on the issue/platform you are voting on. That will provide some insurance that you understand the pros and cons. Getting only half the answers right will factor/give you 0.5 value of vote &#8211; if you get none right you vote power is zero &#8211; perhaps just count it in as  a popular vote.

Unfortunately what you're going to do with this is weed out the non-extremists. These are exactly the same people that are disenfranchised by our current systems, with disastrous results.

Now, every proposal will have positive and negatives. Say, on a most recent issue, your vote to increase security against terrorism, might have a positive result on saving a number of lives but it will also come at a cost (negative) say that will eat in the budget allocated on other areas and will require people to give up on things like privacy.

It's true: Policymaking is hard. I just happen to have faith that regular people can do it, if they're provided with a system that makes it efficient for them to do so. If the resulting policies are very different from what we have now, *as long as it matches The Will of The People*, the new policy is the right policy (that's matchism).

  Regards,

    Scott

 

Or maybe I am wrong? Thoughts?
