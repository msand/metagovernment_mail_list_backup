</I>
 

At that point I was talking along the lines of a personal budget/not gov(hence the quotes). I know governments cheat their way through. However people (not all of them) know how to balance their own budget/resources and prioritize on what matter most for them. 
And I was referring to it as budgeting in the idea that voters need to balance/prioritize what they want in the constrains of real life limited resource scenario. 

 

&gt;<i> The trick I think is to change the whole way budgeting is done to a &quot;per capita&quot; basis.

Yes, I was thinking along these lines just from a different perspective. Your perspective on this is interesting as well. I will need to put more thought into this as it could provide some interesting options. 

 

Regards,

 

Larry

Other dimension could be a limited &#8220;budget&#8221; for every voter should balance, same as in real life, say many have security concerns, however they don&#8217;t spend their entire budget  in making their house fort knox at the expense of everything else. Same could be done when  voting on different issues where you would be required to balance/prioritize between various needs bounded by a fixed &#8220;budget&#8221;.

 

I've played with a few of these government-sponsored budgeting systems, and always come away discouraged: There's just no way for an ordinary citizen to make any sense of the budgeting process the way it's done now. Not even counting a fundamental misconception in your description above: Unlike all of us, the government doesn't operate on a fixed budget. Not only do they have the power to create money out of thin air (fiat currency), but they (we) have the ability to set the tax rate to provide however much, or however little, The People want.

 

The trick I think is to change the whole way budgeting is done to a &quot;per capita&quot; basis. For example, &quot;How much do you want to pay the police force this year, per person in the community they serve?&quot; This allows the presentation of all sorts of relevant information, like how much communities of similar size pay, per capita, for equivalent service (comparing communities of similar size, socio-economic class, etc.) Same with schools: &quot;How much do you think we should pay *per student* in this community?&quot; &quot;How much, per person, should we spend on national defense?&quot;. Then the hard one, the &quot;Standard Income&quot; (the matchism equivalent to the minimum wage, pensions, disability, and most other forms of welfare): &quot;What is the minimum income required to live a comfortable and dignified existence in your community?&quot; The taxes would then be *automatically* adjusted to provide this level of support, and shown in comparison with GDP in that community (studies show that tax rates are economically optimal at about 30% of GDP, as compared with the 40% they are in the US and the 50%+ they are in most European countries). This is totally different from the way it's done now, where setting taxes and spending are done at completely different times by completely different groups with completely different agendas.

    Scott
