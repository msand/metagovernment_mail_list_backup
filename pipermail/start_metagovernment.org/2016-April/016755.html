<PRE>Dear Scott the proposal in Airesis should be discussed on the Platform to
be able to evaluate a construction of solution from different point of view
.
The mailing list does not have a counter to approve or disapprove that
everyone can evaluate. Confronting mind byreplying and evaluate. based on
the evaluation Ned will incorporate the solution or the modification.
If not the proposal never rich an end

&gt;<i> Here are Ned's most recent Airesis proposals, with my 2 cents after each:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1)  &quot;We&quot; (initially those of us interested, then The People of Earth)
</I>&gt;<i> wish/need to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;best&quot; global social system that we can. (The one
</I>&gt;<i> that we have now is not doing so well.) To do that together, &quot;we&quot; must
</I>&gt;<i> first come up with and agree on how we will measure &quot;best&quot;. So, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> list of metrics (perhaps prioritized) applicable to global social systems
</I>&gt;<i> that can be *objectively*measured. (For a definition of the term &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; as it is being used here, see
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html</A> )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Much as I like an engineered solution to all problems, my considered
</I>&gt;<i> opinion is that we lack the information and technology we need to to make
</I>&gt;<i> the kinds of determinations this proposal requires. So, instead, I propose
</I>&gt;<i> an incremental prototype-based approach. Under the tenets of Matchism,
</I>&gt;<i> there's no problem operating in a low-information environment like this, we
</I>&gt;<i> just have to trust that we'll recognize a good system when we see one
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., the system we end up *will* match our (current) needs if only our
</I>&gt;<i> assessment system can actually collect *all* of our opinions, rather than
</I>&gt;<i> just those who traditionally speak up when decisions are being made).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) Particular designs are created, then proposed, then tested and
</I>&gt;<i> compared, then selected or not. That is the way that designs are &quot;found&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally. (The other way that designs are &quot;found&quot; is unintentionally
</I>&gt;<i> -- the design just happens by accident.) So, to &quot;find&quot; new global social
</I>&gt;<i> system designs intentionally, we need a *decision system* that can
</I>&gt;<i> receive and rigorously, independently, realistically test and compare
</I>&gt;<i> design proposals. Proposals are invited -- what decision system design
</I>&gt;<i> shall we use?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Majority rules. Sometimes derided as &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Rejection
</I>&gt;<i> of that in favor of collaborative or consensus-based models is actually
</I>&gt;<i> counter to the tenets of Matchism: If the majority of humans are
</I>&gt;<i> comfortable with a solution, even if it means imposing some sort of
</I>&gt;<i> discrimination against some minority or the environment or whatever, then
</I>&gt;<i> *that*, by definition, is the proper decision. This of course opens up the
</I>&gt;<i> possibility that we will bring back slavery, deny women the right to
</I>&gt;<i> participate, etc. if that's what the majority decides. If you believe that
</I>&gt;<i> this will happen and are opposed to Matchism or a majority-rules base
</I>&gt;<i> decisionmaking system on that basis, you are actually a chauvinist and an
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian: You are attempting to impose your world view on the majority
</I>&gt;<i> of people who would rather do it differently. Not that there's anything
</I>&gt;<i> wrong with that, but best evidence to date is that you are in the minority
</I>&gt;<i> and that your views will therefore be discounted. Ironic, isn't it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Basically we have two choices: build a laboratory in which we can
</I>&gt;<i> realistically test and compare competing global social systems designs
</I>&gt;<i> harmlessly before inflicting one of them on the world, or not. (Armchair
</I>&gt;<i> ideologue amateurs will choose to skip the laboratory testing -- amateurs
</I>&gt;<i> always do. Something to do with a variation of the Dunning&#8211;Kruger effect.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As with #1, this IMHO is a recipe for inaction and so not a viable
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. We simply lack the knowledge and technology to do this. People's
</I>&gt;<i> natural conservatism will prevent USSR/Red China type disasters from
</I>&gt;<i> occurring if SDAP-based leadership can be prevented from seizing control
</I>&gt;<i> (again, if The People, as a whole, are the ones actually making the
</I>&gt;<i> decisions). If they make a hash of it by our current thinking, it's our
</I>&gt;<i> current thinking that's wrong.
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott
