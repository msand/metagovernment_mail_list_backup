Socialization. The problem now really isn't that we don't know how to do
it, we just don't recognize that we need to. I cringe every time I hear
so-called liberals like Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton rail against TPP
or NAFTA or other trade agreements, as if it's OK if we in the US inflict
deprivation or even starvation on people living in other countries just
long as the guy down the block doesn't have to worry about his job and can
afford to buy a new car every couple of years. There are certainly a small
minority of people who are at risk of being directly affected by these
treaties, in which case opposition can be considered to be rational
self-interest. But for most people it's simply tribalism (if not outright
racism) that is governing their behavior. Often times this tribalism
actually causes *irrational* behavior: For example, even though their
standard of living would go up due to the treaty, because the standard of
living of &quot;those other people&quot; would go up more the tribalists feel like
they're somehow getting screwed over.

Are there any good tribes?
&gt;<i>
</I>
Good question. I think the answer is &quot;no&quot;, because of the slippery-slope
problem: Once you get the idea that it's OK to divide people into &quot;us&quot; and
&quot;them&quot; it seems to me very difficult to clearly distinguish situations
where it's OK to do this from those where it's not. I'd be tempted to
exclude certain broad categories, like team sports, except that soccer
hooligans and the riots we have here in the US after major competitions
have convincingly shown that there are problems even allowing for that.

And I recognize that this presents serious problems for matchism itself,
which like any movement requires &quot;joining&quot; and would probably need to take
advantage of tribalism to grow. How is it not hypocritical to want to
divide the world into matchists and non-matchists when matchism itself says
you shouldn't do this?

But I think the more important question is the same one that applies to all
social-engineering corrections for our problematic Clinations: Is the
general stress reduction from achieving the social engineering goal
definitely greater than the stress inflicted by the procedure itself? The
answer to this question seems pretty clear to me for tribalism, but is much
less obvious for other things (religion, deference to authority, drug use,
etc.)

   Scott
