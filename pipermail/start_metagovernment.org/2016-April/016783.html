</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And, ok, I will compare, on one side:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -           A lot more money was spent in an attempt to cure cancer and
</I>&gt;<i> other diseases, or to alleviate poverty, and all with little results so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Actually *lots* of progress has been made in curing cancers, although it's
been very uneven so far (some are completely curable, but with many others
very little progress has been made). Eradicating poverty has been a dismal
failure, other than the &quot;rising tide lifts all boats&quot; phenomenon (poverty
in developed countries ain't what it used to be), but IMHO that's exactly
because the wrong people are working on it: Almost all of the &quot;work&quot; is
done by amateur social engineers, most of whom, to make things worse, are
SDAP and so are more interested in stigmatizing the poor than in fixing the
underlying problems. This could have, and I maintain would have, been very
different if The People had been the ones choosing our goals and assigning
who works on them.


&gt;<i> -           Wars in Vietnam/Iraq &#8211; ironically, US motivated involvement
</I>&gt;<i> in these on the idea of preventing war and terrorism &#8211; and for that they
</I>&gt;<i> spent only in Iraq 1.7 trillion? And to date the Vietnam war cost over  is
</I>&gt;<i> at 700 billion?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Again, the result of SDAP leadership, acting as amateur social engineers:
What *is* the best way to reduce terrorism? Or does the fact that 10 times
as many people die in car accidents and from drug overdoses mean that we
should concentrate our efforts there instead?


&gt;<i> And on the other side:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          With an average budget of 20billion a year, Nasa is just a
</I>&gt;<i> tiny fraction of these cumulated costs allocated to say cancer/diseases,
</I>&gt;<i> poverty, trying to stop wars etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is there even a &quot;stop wars&quot; or &quot;alternative to wars&quot; department that we
could vote to increase funding for?

&gt;<i> -          They did deliver, agree not as efficient as it should had as
</I>&gt;<i> they turn to much in bureaucracy, but overall major progress is undeniable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          Space exploration is most important to insure the long term
</I>&gt;<i> survival of our species, as a whole. As long as we are pinned to this rock
</I>&gt;<i> we are sitting ducks, and everything we did, all these thousands of years
</I>&gt;<i> of sacrifice and hopes, could be gone in a puff, with no story to tell or
</I>&gt;<i> not even a sign that we ever existed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't have a problem with space exploration, or any scientific endeavor
per se, but you (and the SDAP leadership) are advocating simply taking the
decision out of my hands based on your own value judgments.  I do have a
problem with that.


&gt;<i> &gt; Delegating their vote to psychologically matched proxies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is to assume that their psychological matched &#8220;proxies&#8221; are genuine &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> which in reality is not as most political campaign strategists will
</I>&gt;<i> manipulate  along the lines of what a specific niche want to hear &#8211;
</I>&gt;<i> psychologically. If you are going to &#8220;anchor&#8221; to a proxy, I believe you
</I>&gt;<i> need to do that on something more than just a &#8220;feeling&#8221; of  right or wrong,
</I>&gt;<i> as that, as history proved over and over again, is prone to manipulation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>The &quot;proxies&quot; will be matched the same way that eHarmony and match.com
work: You answer a bunch of questions and get matched with a selection of
other people who would likely vote the same way as you do, but for whatever
reason have more time to research the issues or who have had some
specialized education or work experience in a particular field. The only
way to manipulate people under this scenario is if you simply lie on the
questionaires. But there's a built-in fix for this: With open voting it'll
be trivial to detect someone like this, either before you pick your
proxies, or perhaps even systematically (people's profiles might get an
asterisk if their voting record does not match their profile).


&gt;<i> And, manipulation is not a quality of a limited group of &#8220;authoritarians&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i> is part of our own nature, so even if you are going to dilute that top
</I>&gt;<i> influence you are still going to get an unwanted bias from with the system.
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion, whatever system you implement you will need something to
</I>&gt;<i> validated /score how genuine that vote is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>But we've got to work with the raw material we've got. Another key tenet of
matchism is that morality and progress in public policy is a progressive
thing: It is vastly more difficult to change people than to change systems,
so we change the systems now, and the morality of the people will follow
along some decades later.

&gt;<i>They therefore don't have to become experts on a subject
</I>
&gt;<i> They don&#8217;t need to be experts on the subject; they just need to be
</I>&gt;<i> educated in the sense of seeing core value of the proposal, to see beyond
</I>&gt;<i> manipulation and marketing techniques. I believe that this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> education should be part of the basic curriculum.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree with your conclusion that education is key: People need to know
*how* they are being manipulated. Most important IMHO in this area is how
fearmongering turns borderline people into authoritarians, increasing the
problematic votes from less than a quarter of the population to closer to
half. But unfortunately this would take decades to achieve and we may not
have that long, so we need to put the corrections in the system design, not
require that the people change first.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately what you're going to do with this is weed out the
</I>&gt;<i> non-extremists
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is if you assume that only extremists care to learn about what they
</I>&gt;<i> are voting for? In any case, the secret here will be in asking the right
</I>&gt;<i> questions to represent both sides of the coin, pros and cons, benefits and
</I>&gt;<i> costs.
</I>&gt;<i> I think the core extremists are less of a problem as they usually are a
</I>&gt;<i> minority &#8211; the major problem is when they become a psychological matched
</I>&gt;<i> proxy for mass niches through manipulation of perception.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>No, the problem is that these extremists are the ones who participate in
the political process. The vast majority of regular people (the
neurotypicals) just defer to them (politicians, military and industry
leaders, etc.) There currently *are* no matching leaders because they are
simply psychologically not like the majority of the neurotypicals in the
population.


&gt;<i> You will forcing proposals to provide accurate/clear information on both
</I>&gt;<i> pros and cons in order to get a valid vote and that in turn will bring in
</I>&gt;<i> better awareness &#8211; the way I see it manipulation happens where things are
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzy and essential information is omitted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I> Agreed, with the addition that The People must be the ones who decide what
is relevant and useful. If you have a committee or whatever making these
decisions (the way it works now), that committee gets populated with SDAPs
(because they're the ones that like to do this kind of work) and as a
result the evaluation is as useless as just letting the SDAPs vote on
things directly.
