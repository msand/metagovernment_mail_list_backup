Agreed: there are already lots of document management and forum systems we
can use to do these things for citizen-originated proposals.

</I>
No, we're still going to have to change the decision-making system. I
figure most proposals are actually still going to come from lawyers
representing special interests and the executive branch of government, just
as they do now. The only difference will be that you and I, or our
psychologically-match proxies, will be voting on them instead of our
corruptible SDAP &quot;representatives&quot;.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do believe that is just because we do not know how to do that.

</I>&gt;<i> A tool that let you shape collaboratively what you &quot;know&quot; and let you

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree, this is key. The problem is, in order to achieve critical mass,
you've got to lower the barriers to entry until people only have to spend a
few minutes a week running their government. *That's* where the real
engineering effort needs to be made.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some one may think that this must be done in a lab! No must be done in the
</I>&gt;<i> big lab that is your social system and turning it around so that little by
</I>&gt;<i> little the peaceful revolution take place.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed here too: Unlike Ned, I don't believe that we need to run
simulations on everything before rolling it out. We'll know it works if
people like it and use it, not by whether it meets some arbitrary metric of
success.


&gt;<i> I love you guys but sometime I think why there is so little action? the
</I>&gt;<i> tool are made but the critical mass no one knows how to mobilize. Maybe we
</I>&gt;<i> should stop thinking about the perfect self sustaining social system but
</I>&gt;<i> look for way to build unstoppable social mass.
</I>&gt;<i> We have the internet!!!!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed here too: When the right system becomes available our problem will
be that the switch will happen *too* fast and political and social
instability will occur. Fortunately we've still got lots of time before
this will happen at the very slow rate of progress we're making ;-)

    Scott
