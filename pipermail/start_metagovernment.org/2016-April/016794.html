I wouldn't want to discourage work at any level, since we'll undoubtedly
learn something in any case, but I'd be inclined to think that working at a
mid-level like this is going to be harder and more limiting than bottom up
(individual citizens, working at all scales simultaneously).


&gt;<i> Neighbourhoods often exist anyway, probably because of our cognitive limit.

</I>&gt;<i> Neighbourhoods are politically more neutral than other tribes.
</I>&gt;<i> Neighbourhoods are too small for independent politics.

All good and useful qualities, but unfortunately not scalable. In
particular you can't make most moral decisions at that level (drug use,
abortion, gay rights, etc.) or you end up with situations where
neighborhoods *will* go to war with each other. If you design your system
to handle global government it can be used at the neighborhood level, but
the reverse is definitely not true.


&gt;<i> Neighbours fight about nonsenses sometimes. Well, it happens even without
</I>&gt;<i> my focus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, why not to support them, if people like tribes so much?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Again, because we need to define policy on moral issues. Either
circumcision (and FGM) are legal or they're not: You can't have one
neighborhood or one city or even one country with one policy on these kinds
of things with a different policy everyplace else because this leads to
endless conflict, and sometimes even wars as people use these divisions to
build up their tribalism.
