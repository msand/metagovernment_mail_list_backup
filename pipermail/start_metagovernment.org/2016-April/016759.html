<PRE>Scott I contest your last statement Vilfredo is different than Airesis,
Vilfredo may be choosen as a method of reaching certain type of consensus
within the multiple decisional models of Airesis.

Unfortunately  we could not agreed with Pietro to make Vilfredo as one of
the possible system to define singularly each solutions in proposal made on
Airesis because of coding language and other issues, basically lack of
resources.

Vilfredo is open source and if any one is villing to rewrite in Ruby then
we could use Vilfredo to settle SLIGHT  differences of opinion over one
single solution that will be incorporated then in a  multiple solutions
race that Airesis will settle.

In Vilfredo a large group is unlikely ending a discussion and can be used
for example at the UN Security  Council to write a text that MUST be
accepted by tuning precice diplomatic language.

Airesis can be used by very large group where  multiple solutions can be
defined  during the proposal building periods and the contribution of the
people involved  will define the quality  of the solutions. Is a work that
at the moment is unfortunately the result of the interpretation of the
relator/s  but there is control instruments that allow the debate to be
monitored  and serious people easily understand quality of the relator/s

At a given problem we may establish any number of solutions and even very
extremely opposite solutions from one another.

The discussion is open and for the sake of this example we need to imagine
that the system is open to everyone regardless of the digital divide, ok?
All the member have access to the system!

People may participate during the debate phase but may choose not to, right
Scott?

Then we get to the point that all the possible solutions are exausted and
all of them are part of the decision that should find the winner.

Now the second phase is open and the vote by the Shulze method ,in case of
multiple solution, will be automatically applied. If only two choises are
defined, then the majority rule will be automatically applied. If only one
single choise is available then the sysrem will automatically use the
Yes,Neutral or No vote.

Is very different from Vilfredo where opposite vision must find  a
consensus.

In Airesis ve have a democratic  decision but the wisdom of the mass should
be the winner

Please do not compare Airesis and Vilfredo otherwise i doubt you understand
the tools. I really hope we can agree on that.
Airesis want to be a compendium of different decisional processes because
there is not a single method that work for every  situation, but we want to
help the people to find the best decisional tool or combine different
method to reach the smartest, easiest,  fastest  and best decision for
every single situation.

If we could all agree on this common goal and work together in this
scenario our time will be better spent that arguing on the inexistent
single decisional process.

Out there the political system is obviously flawed and we all pay the
consequence, what have we done?
I invite all of you, the Metagovernment  people that I met here to join the
Association tecnologiedemocratiche.it  to use our great joined intelligence
to work toward  this common goal BUT UNITED on the development of a global
multi methodological decisional approach where the expertise are
distributed and as a team we make a real change. No one will have to hope
to make money out of it, but must be a democratic communistic open source
not for profit approach with representatives in every country on earth.

Kind Regards

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Scott the proposal in Airesis should be discussed on the Platform to

</I>&gt;<i> the extremists. He instead should study law, social psychology, and conduct
</I>&gt;<i> surveys to find out what The People *in general* believe, and use those
</I>&gt;<i> things to tweak the proposal, not ask a bunch of extremists (who are the
</I>&gt;<i> only ones who will participate in a proposal-shaping process) what they

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If not the proposal never rich an end

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even if the proposal does reach an end, will it reflect what The People

</I>&gt;<i> nor Vilfredo actually assess what it is that the majority of The People
</I>&gt;<i> believe. Instead they just facilitate watering down a proposal until it is
</I>&gt;<i> acceptable by the extremists on both ends, and then have those same

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Here are Ned's most recent Airesis proposals, with my 2 cents after each:
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 1)  &quot;We&quot; (initially those of us interested, then The People of Earth)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wish/need to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;best&quot; global social system that we can. (The one
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that we have now is not doing so well.) To do that together, &quot;we&quot; must
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> first come up with and agree on how we will measure &quot;best&quot;. So, we need a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> list of metrics (perhaps prioritized) applicable to global social systems
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that can be *objectively*measured. (For a definition of the term
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;social system&quot; as it is being used here, see
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html</A> )
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Much as I like an engineered solution to all problems, my considered
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> opinion is that we lack the information and technology we need to to make
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the kinds of determinations this proposal requires. So, instead, I propose
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> an incremental prototype-based approach. Under the tenets of Matchism,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> there's no problem operating in a low-information environment like this, we
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just have to trust that we'll recognize a good system when we see one
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (i.e., the system we end up *will* match our (current) needs if only our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> assessment system can actually collect *all* of our opinions, rather than
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just those who traditionally speak up when decisions are being made).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Particular designs are created, then proposed, then tested and
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> compared, then selected or not. That is the way that designs are &quot;found&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> intentionally. (The other way that designs are &quot;found&quot; is unintentionally
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> -- the design just happens by accident.) So, to &quot;find&quot; new global social
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> system designs intentionally, we need a *decision system* that can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> receive and rigorously, independently, realistically test and compare
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> design proposals. Proposals are invited -- what decision system design
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> shall we use?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Majority rules. Sometimes derided as &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Rejection of that in favor of collaborative or consensus-based models is
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> actually counter to the tenets of Matchism: If the majority of humans are
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comfortable with a solution, even if it means imposing some sort of
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> discrimination against some minority or the environment or whatever, then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> *that*, by definition, is the proper decision. This of course opens up the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> possibility that we will bring back slavery, deny women the right to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> participate, etc. if that's what the majority decides. If you believe that
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> this will happen and are opposed to Matchism or a majority-rules base
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisionmaking system on that basis, you are actually a chauvinist and an
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarian: You are attempting to impose your world view on the majority
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of people who would rather do it differently. Not that there's anything
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> wrong with that, but best evidence to date is that you are in the minority
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> and that your views will therefore be discounted. Ironic, isn't it?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Basically we have two choices: build a laboratory in which we can
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> realistically test and compare competing global social systems designs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> harmlessly before inflicting one of them on the world, or not. (Armchair
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ideologue amateurs will choose to skip the laboratory testing -- amateurs
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> always do. Something to do with a variation of the Dunning&#8211;Kruger effect.)
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> As with #1, this IMHO is a recipe for inaction and so not a viable
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. We simply lack the knowledge and technology to do this. People's
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> natural conservatism will prevent USSR/Red China type disasters from
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> occurring if SDAP-based leadership can be prevented from seizing control
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (again, if The People, as a whole, are the ones actually making the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> decisions). If they make a hash of it by our current thinking, it's our
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> current thinking that's wrong.
