<PRE>&gt;<i> In Switzerland as you receive your voting envelope that you will cast via the postal service.
</I>
You can print questions on a piece of paper as well &#8211; and asking people to mark more than just one box should not really be a problem if you really care to be part of the decision system. 

However, voting should make use of 21st century technology; there is no reason not to move voting online. We have the technology and knowledge today to make this possible with a risk of fraud 1000 times less than the traditional methods and will be cheaper and faster and can provide you to with various options to eliminate noise or bias from the system.

&gt;<i>The vote value is always a one and we shall rely on better education
</I>
Absolutely agree, better education is the real answer, in the long term. But even to get there, as to provide better education along these lines, will require a major change in the socio-political scene, which consequentially requires a vote to change &#8211; so we end up are catching our tail. We need an interim solution to get us there and something like this might be good enough to motivate them learn more about issues at hand if they really want to be part of the decision system.

&gt;<i>You receive factual informations prepared by the supporter of each positions
</I>
This is prone bias/ misleading, as such any proposal has both pros and cons, and naturally a supporter of that position will see/present things more along the line of pros and less on the cons. If anything these information leaflets should be put together by neutral body &#8211; political/economical/social analyst. Even in that case, a lot of people hear/read between lines what they want to hear. 

I think getting them to mark an answer to a question will make them more aware of what they actually vote,. Say  you vote to get a fancy car, and one of the cons is that you will have to starve for a year to get that car, than one of the question should be bringing that issue/risk forward as such &#8211; do you agree to starve for a year to get that car?

Or on the line of short vs long term &#8211; do you agree to get your car knowing that there is a high that this will forfeit (in the long term) your child chance for better education?

Is an interesting method, but not very applicable by my opinion.

In Switzerland as you receive your voting envelope that you will cast via the postal service. You receive factual informations prepared by the supporter of each positions. The vote value is always a one and we shall rely on better education and these informations to make our own choice. Most of the time the choice is related to our own short term interest. This is a big problem and if you add local or national interest it can be even worst.

We, as a species, be default, don&#8217;t know much aside our basic instincts, however we learn from failure and success of some who deviate from these &#8220;core values&#8221;.

If it were for a popular vote, many of our great achievements, say space exploration,  will had never happen &#8211; as the knowledge/understanding of the masses at the time was limited. 

Sure, everyone must have the right to vote and participate in the decision making 

However everyone has the obligation/responsibility to have a very good knowledge/understanding on the subject &#8211; say a political platform they are voting on, otherwise their vote is:

a)      Lottery like random

b)      Most dangerous , easily manipulated by extreme  propaganda not on the real value

 

I think one way avoid this is to associate a knowledge factor on the issue to every vote. 
Say by default your vote has a full value of 1.

Then as a part of vote casting you will have to take a test with random question on the issue/platform you are voting on. That will provide some insurance that you understand the pros and cons. Getting only half the answers right will factor/give you 0.5 value of vote &#8211; if you get none right you vote power is zero &#8211; perhaps just count it in as  a popular vote.

Now, every proposal will have positive and negatives. Say, on a most recent issue, your vote to increase security against terrorism, might have a positive result on saving a number of lives but it will also come at a cost (negative) say that will eat in the budget allocated on other areas and will require people to give up on things like privacy.

Or maybe I am wrong? Thoughts?

Scott I contest your last statement Vilfredo is different than Airesis, Vilfredo may be choosen as a method of reaching certain type of consensus within the multiple decisional models of Airesis.

Unfortunately  we could not agreed with Pietro to make Vilfredo as one of the possible system to define singularly each solutions in proposal made on Airesis because of coding language and other issues, basically lack of resources.

Vilfredo is open source and if any one is villing to rewrite in Ruby then we could use Vilfredo to settle SLIGHT  differences of opinion over one single solution that will be incorporated then in a  multiple solutions race that Airesis will settle.

In Vilfredo a large group is unlikely ending a discussion and can be used for example at the UN Security  Council to write a text that MUST be accepted by tuning precice diplomatic language.

Airesis can be used by very large group where  multiple solutions can be defined  during the proposal building periods and the contribution of the people involved  will define the quality  of the solutions. Is a work that at the moment is unfortunately the result of the interpretation of the relator/s  but there is control instruments that allow the debate to be monitored  and serious people easily understand quality of the relator/s

At a given problem we may establish any number of solutions and even very extremely opposite solutions from one another.

The discussion is open and for the sake of this example we need to imagine that the system is open to everyone regardless of the digital divide, ok? All the member have access to the system!

People may participate during the debate phase but may choose not to, right Scott?

Then we get to the point that all the possible solutions are exausted and all of them are part of the decision that should find the winner.

Now the second phase is open and the vote by the Shulze method ,in case of multiple solution, will be automatically applied. If only two choises are defined, then the majority rule will be automatically applied. If only one single choise is available then the sysrem will automatically use the Yes,Neutral or No vote.

Is very different from Vilfredo where opposite vision must find  a consensus.

In Airesis ve have a democratic  decision but the wisdom of the mass should be the winner

Please do not compare Airesis and Vilfredo otherwise i doubt you understand the tools. I really hope we can agree on that.
Airesis want to be a compendium of different decisional processes because there is not a single method that work for every  situation, but we want to help the people to find the best decisional tool or combine different method to reach the smartest, easiest,  fastest  and best decision for every single situation.

If we could all agree on this common goal and work together in this scenario our time will be better spent that arguing on the inexistent single decisional process.

Out there the political system is obviously flawed and we all pay the consequence, what have we done?
I invite all of you, the Metagovernment  people that I met here to join the Association tecnologiedemocratiche.it  to use our great joined intelligence to work toward  this common goal BUT UNITED on the development of a global multi methodological decisional approach where the expertise are distributed and as a team we make a real change. No one will have to hope to make money out of it, but must be a democratic communistic open source not for profit approach with representatives in every country on earth.

Dear Scott the proposal in Airesis should be discussed on the Platform to be able to evaluate a construction of solution from different point of view .

The mailing list does not have a counter to approve or disapprove that everyone can evaluate. Confronting mind byreplying and evaluate. based on the evaluation Ned will incorporate the solution or the modification.

 

Again, I understand how it's *supposed* to work, I'm just saying that's not what the system you've built will actually do. If Ned needs help refining his proposals, my belief is that asking the general public to help isn't the best solution because all he'll end up receiving is feedback from the extremists. He instead should study law, social psychology, and conduct surveys to find out what The People *in general* believe, and use those things to tweak the proposal, not ask a bunch of extremists (who are the only ones who will participate in a proposal-shaping process) what they want and try to craft some compromise based on that input.

 

If not the proposal never rich an end

 

Even if the proposal does reach an end, will it reflect what The People really want and really need? My prediction is no, because neither Airesis nor Vilfredo actually assess what it is that the majority of The People believe. Instead they just facilitate watering down a proposal until it is acceptable by the extremists on both ends, and then have those same extremists (instead of the majority in the middle) be the only ones who are still around when the time comes to actually render a decision. This unfortunately is exactly how our current political systems are broken.

Here are Ned's most recent Airesis proposals, with my 2 cents after each:

 

1)  &quot;We&quot; (initially those of us interested, then The People of Earth) wish/need to &quot;find&quot; the &quot;best&quot; global social system that we can. (The one that we have now is not doing so well.) To do that together, &quot;we&quot; must first come up with and agree on how we will measure &quot;best&quot;. So, we need a list of metrics (perhaps prioritized) applicable to global social systems that can be objectivelymeasured. (For a definition of the term &quot;social system&quot; as it is being used here, see <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html">http://home.earthlink.net/~npconner/htm/BAD/BAD02.html</A> )

 

Much as I like an engineered solution to all problems, my considered opinion is that we lack the information and technology we need to to make the kinds of determinations this proposal requires. So, instead, I propose an incremental prototype-based approach. Under the tenets of Matchism, there's no problem operating in a low-information environment like this, we just have to trust that we'll recognize a good system when we see one (i.e., the system we end up *will* match our (current) needs if only our assessment system can actually collect *all* of our opinions, rather than just those who traditionally speak up when decisions are being made).

 

2) Particular designs are created, then proposed, then tested and compared, then selected or not. That is the way that designs are &quot;found&quot; intentionally. (The other way that designs are &quot;found&quot; is unintentionally -- the design just happens by accident.) So, to &quot;find&quot; new global social system designs intentionally, we need a decision system that can receive and rigorously, independently, realistically test and compare design proposals. Proposals are invited -- what decision system design shall we use?

 

Majority rules. Sometimes derided as &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Rejection of that in favor of collaborative or consensus-based models is actually counter to the tenets of Matchism: If the majority of humans are comfortable with a solution, even if it means imposing some sort of discrimination against some minority or the environment or whatever, then *that*, by definition, is the proper decision. This of course opens up the possibility that we will bring back slavery, deny women the right to participate, etc. if that's what the majority decides. If you believe that this will happen and are opposed to Matchism or a majority-rules base decisionmaking system on that basis, you are actually a chauvinist and an authoritarian: You are attempting to impose your world view on the majority of people who would rather do it differently. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but best evidence to date is that you are in the minority and that your views will therefore be discounted. Ironic, isn't it?

 

3) Basically we have two choices: build a laboratory in which we can realistically test and compare competing global social systems designs harmlessly before inflicting one of them on the world, or not. (Armchair ideologue amateurs will choose to skip the laboratory testing -- amateurs always do. Something to do with a variation of the Dunning&#8211;Kruger effect.)

 

As with #1, this IMHO is a recipe for inaction and so not a viable proposal. We simply lack the knowledge and technology to do this. People's natural conservatism will prevent USSR/Red China type disasters from occurring if SDAP-based leadership can be prevented from seizing control (again, if The People, as a whole, are the ones actually making the decisions). If they make a hash of it by our current thinking, it's our current thinking that's wrong.

    Scott
