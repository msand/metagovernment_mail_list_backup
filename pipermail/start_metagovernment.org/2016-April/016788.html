A big part of the problem is these bills are written by lawyers who in my
experience often deliberately complicate their writing to make it seem more
profound than it really is. A few months ago I ran a California state
legislature bill concerning regulation of Humane Societies through
Microsoft Word's grammar checker and it came back with a Flesch-Kincaid
reading level of 23, which works out to someone with 2 PhD's. This is
evidence to support your claim that the politician's themselves usually
don't even fully understand them. It doesn't need to be this way: The
problem now is that there is no correction for this built into the system.


&gt;<i> I propose that each bill presented in the system should answer a
</I>&gt;<i> Frequently Asked Questions section that is the same questions every time. A
</I>&gt;<i> set of questions that help break down any idea for any change. This would
</I>&gt;<i> provide a quick and easy reference that the average citizen would be able
</I>&gt;<i> to digest, then if they felt any question was not answered to the
</I>&gt;<i> truthfully or to the full extent they could prod further into the bill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Agreed: Standardizing the format with required sections for budget impact,
estimates of the delay until full implementation, etc. will help a lot. We
should also require that the proposal should also be run through a grammar
checker and ensure that it comes out with a reading level no more than 12
(high school graduate).

As for the issue of having to vote on things that few people care about,
these are almost always a case of micro-managing and shouldn't be handled
at the legislative level anyway. A strong executive branch will handle
probably 90% of this stuff without citizen intervention *provided* that
every decision is reviewable and that the executive serves at the will of
the people and can be removed from office at any time by a simple majority
vote.
