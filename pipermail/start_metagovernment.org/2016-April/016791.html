<PRE>&gt;<i>Dynamic Democracy where voted proposal can  be immediately put back in discussion, especially if social results are showing a deteriorating quality of life.
</I>
This might be a problem since most solutions don&#8217;t usually show immediate result. In most cases it usually gets worse before you start seeing any positive results; hence, I think, an expectation time frame should probably be part of proposal. Then again, you can have delays due to unexpected factors &#8211; still overall a proposal could be very successful, however a rush of change could make a mess of things. I think complete transparency from proposal to implementation and results is a must and manage expectations.



&gt;<i>I have doubt that we can gamificate a democracy platform, we have even made an analysis in Airesis but the cost of programming was to expensive
</I>


I was thinking more on the lines of incentives for participation, proposal, why not social behaviour, etc. Most forums have a rank based on the number of posts, others allow votes on comments, which can also be used to score/reward, or some other the concept of badges. This won&#8217;t be so expensive to implement and will drive engagement which is equally/even more important that recruiting.
Sure, you can add complexity of role playing, or degrees of knowledge based on some tutorials/tests, however, that, as you said, could be a little more involved.

&gt;<i>Too expensive for our association, we considered for the Meetup platform but resources was not sufficient
</I>
You can try one to start with, say facebook, the api is easy enough to implement say for a simple voting application frontend.



&gt;<i>This was on our plan but the head programmer give up last month and we are kind of desperate!
</I>


I wish I could help, unfortunately I don&#8217;t do ruby. I should advertise around for volunteers with ruby  and interest in politics/social platforms , places like user groups  <A HREF="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/user-groups/">https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/user-groups/</A> - I am sure there will be some interest. Universities might also be a good point to look for young people eager to try something new and build some professional portfolio.



&gt;<i>at least 100000 users by may 2017 the association may not be able to maintain the server
</I>


An ambitious target, however, 500k+ transactions a day(or even more) should fit on a standard hosting price, of around 100eur or so a year,  I don&#8217;t see why your hosting has to be that expensive ? Especially, in the incipient stage? 



&gt;<i>All the internationalization  effort i made over the last 3 years, 13 languages,  dozens of volunteers  translation are going to be waisted.
</I>


Do you delegate local country &#8220;managers&#8221;? say in charge with country localization language and local policies, etc ? They could help recruit local resources to improve the platform.



&gt;<i>To give you an idea of how generous are Italians: 15000 registered users have contributed last year with 1600 euros!
</I>


You could try raising money through crowd funding platforms , say in exchange for founders certificate or something like this.



&gt;<i>13 languages i including specific domains .us .eu in english 
</I>


I think multiple domains/country domains does not bring much a benefit, from experience, if anything might confuse the users. In my opinion a top level/global domain such as .org should suffice. 

 

&gt;<i>I try to do some communication outside of Italy, but there is something not very clear because I cannot explain suche little success  
</I>


For other countries, in my opinion, you need to recruit/delegate representatives &#8211; each culture/society comes with its own &#8220;particularities&#8221; especially when you are talking socio- politics, so you need insiders to drive adoption &#8211; I think this is more important than proof of being successful elsewhere.

Dynamic Democracy where voted proposal can  be immediately put back in discussion, especially if social results are showing a deteriorating quality of life.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As for strategies on how to mobilize a critical mass, how about:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Peg on current political/social issues, to draw people into the tool/system
</I>
Will try to put current issues on proposal or vote on my new criticall mass group creation an Airesis

&gt;&gt;<i> -          Gamification? To incentivize contributions/participation
</I>
I have doubt that we can gamificate a democracy platform, we have even made an analysis in Airesis but the cost of programming was to expensive, instead i know that there are virtual society games where they play acting like real public service managers and thet need to take group decisions. This could be a good promoter of democratic process  education

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Expose platform on big social systems such as facebook,linkedin etc. over their  API
</I>
Too expensive for our association, we considered for the Meetup platform but resources was not sufficient

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -          Provide an API for this system to be integrated by other online social systems
</I>
This was on our plan but the head programmer give up last month and we are kind of desperate!
I estimate that  if i do not succeed in bringing my experimental critical mass group to at least 100000 users by may 2017 the assocciation may not be able to maintain the server. All the internationalization  effort i made over the last 3 years, 13 languages,  dozens of volunteers  translation are going to be waisted.
To give you an idea of how generous are Italians: 15000 registered users have contributed last year with 1600 euros! barely sufficient to pay for the hosting.
13 languages i including specific domains .us .eu in english have accounted for 600 users only! I try to do some communication outside of Italy, but there is something not very clear because I cannot explain suche little success outside of Italy.

Many government bodies nowadays publish their agendas daily or near real-time and module/process could be implemented to import these in the system and/or represent manually.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proposal making will be an expression of individual views and combined views that will form different solution to a problem. Once there is no more to say and no other solution are expressed the proposal is considered completed. At that point there is a vote on the solutions and range voting is applied by using the shulze method.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Oh, I understand how it's *supposed* to work. I'm just saying, from a social engineering perspective, that the outcome is suboptimal because these &quot;consensus-building&quot; approaches burn out and eliminate the very people the decision-making system needs to function properly: Focusing on the proposal refining process is exactly backwards because doing so actually *prevents* the right decisions from being made because it filters out all of the people who should be the ones actually making the decisions!

In the US, things like gun control and abortion restrictions, which most people consider to be politically intractable, seem to me relatively easy to solve because

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I'm going to post another message here with my 2 cents on them, but in this post I'm going to do a &quot;meta&quot; analysis of why I'm not highly motivated to actually use Airesis, or indeed any of the other  systems that people on this list seem to be drawn toward.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The problem is that IMHO you all seem to have misjudged the actual need here. What you're designing are debating systems, not decision-making systems. The problems with our current government systems aren't that the proposals are poorly written or that they don't take into account everyone's perspectives and needs, it's simply that the wrong ones are passed. The ones that get passed reflect the needs and desires of our psychologically &quot;specialized&quot; misrepresentatives rather than that of the neurotypicals that make up the vast majority of the population.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> If this is the case, we don't need to be intimately (I might even say &quot;gruelingly&quot;, based on my experience with Vilfredo) involved in the generation of the proposals, but merely need a way to efficiently weed out large numbers of inappropriate ones. Hence my proposal to use psychologically matched proxies to do the winnowing, on an individual-proposal basis, rather than a &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; blanket abdication of responsibility that is characteristic of representative government.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Sure, I recognize that the proposal generators need some sort of sand box where they can play around with ideas and get feedback, but IMHO pretty much any sort of forum can be used for that (email, FaceBook, Google Docs, or even something more sophisticated and specialized like Airesis or Vilfredo), and so I maintain that designing debating systems is not the most efficient use of our time. We need to concentrate on the actual decision-making part of the process, not the proposal generation part. The biggest problem in our specialized domain is &quot;How do we get *everyone* to participate in making the decision, not just those with an ax to grind?&quot;. Concentrating on the proposal generation part of the process just makes that problem much worse because of the time burden it imposes. And IMHO making this kind of imposition even results in worse proposals because they end up being so watered down as to be ineffective (as I believe is clearly shown in the new Metagovernment home page statement that resulted from the most recent Vilfredo run). Better to have a few strongly worded and effective proposals approved than have a large number of weak &quot;consensus-based&quot; proposals pass that don't actually end up solving the problems they were meant to address.
