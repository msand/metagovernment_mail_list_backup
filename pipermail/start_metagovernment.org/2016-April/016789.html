This is key, though: You definitely don't want to burn out the small pool
of early adopters you'll get by forcing them try to use something that's
horribly broken. I plan to err on the side of caution: Your early testers
will give you a good clue when it's ready by spreading the word even if you
don't ask them to.


&gt;<i> In any case, best model fits best on reality and reality is changing as we
</I>&gt;<i> speak &#8211; the social dynamics of every new generation is different(even that
</I>&gt;<i> is not yet represented at the top), however any model you bring forward, if
</I>&gt;<i> to be successful, it will have to match on that and the only way to get
</I>&gt;<i> that is sync is on ongoing process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
A small-business mantra: Find your niche, then exploit it fully before
attempting to expand into other areas. To me this means making the system
work best as an app on mobile devices because those are the people who will
be most receptive to a new way of doing things.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for strategies on how to mobilize a critical mass, how about:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -          Peg on current political/social issues, to draw people into
</I>&gt;<i> the tool/system?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Definitely, and I recommend not being shy here. Having people vote on
hot-button issues like abortion/gay rights/gun control/immigration is key
to getting them hooked. This is another reason why building your own
content (proposals) is key: Most real legislative bodies are paralyzed when
trying to deal with these things, but they're things that *we* can take on
without having to worry about getting tossed out of office ;-)


&gt;<i> -          Gamification? To incentivize contributions/participation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I go back and forth on this. Multiplayer games are addicting in many cases
precisely because of the competition. But it'll be the death of any system
that tries to exploit tribalism and you end up with liberals vs
conservatives. Again.


&gt;<i> -          Expose platform on big social systems such as
</I>&gt;<i> facebook,linkedin etc. over their  API
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree this is how it will go viral. Whether this is what you want to try
right off the bat or not, I'm not sure. Again, you don't want to annoy the
early adopters by growing *too* fast or people will look at it before it's
ready and never be willing to give it a second chance after being
disappointed once.


&gt;<i> -          Provide an API for this system to be integrated by other
</I>&gt;<i> online social systems
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I don't know about an API, but the raw data and its formats definitely
should be published such that other people can do this sort of integration.


&gt;<i> One interesting approach I was thinking about will be to peg on what on
</I>&gt;<i> whatever is currently voted, by say parliament or equivalent, and offer
</I>&gt;<i> public interface to vote on in parallel or in advance. Many government
</I>&gt;<i> bodies nowadays publish their agendas daily or near real-time and
</I>&gt;<i> module/process could be implemented to import these in the system and/or
</I>&gt;<i> represent manually.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
As in my previous post, I think this is a bad idea: I get very discouraged
whenever I see a system that's unpleasant to use because the raw content is
so tedious to read.  To start I think the system developer is going to have
write *all* of the proposals to ensure that people will find them
interesting and provocative. This is another reason why I believe that all
proposal-generation-oriented systems are doomed to languish in obscurity:
You'll just never get to critical mass if you have to rely on your users to
make your content interesting.  Even FB and Twitter know this, as the
majority of what is posted on them is merely relayed from other sources,
not original content.

    Scott
