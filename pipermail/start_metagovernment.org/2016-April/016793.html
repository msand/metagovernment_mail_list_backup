This would be an example of &quot;sampling&quot;, a design that Ned's Blinap relies
on. Given your premise, it actually should work fine in practice *but* it
requires a lot of faith in statistics that most people currently don't
have. Widespread adoption would therefore be very difficult to achieve.

What about local conditions? Climate? Available technology?

In practice I'd guess that it'd be very unlikely that two &quot;neighborhoods&quot;
would have the same psychological makeup, even if most measurable factors
were similar.  I therefore would think it unlikely that one neighborhood
could serve as a proxy for another. Fortunately for my proposal this isn't
necessary because it's actually a lot easier to measure each individual and
provide proxies at that level than it would be to try to find a way to
combine them (into tribes, neighborhoods, whatever) and work the
voting/proxies at that level.
