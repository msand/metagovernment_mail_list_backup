<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Thanks for the suggestions folks. The draft I'm working on is here:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Knight">http://zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Knight</A>

Conseo, you ask for small scale and non-legal applications. I want to
keep the focus on laws, though, because legislatures are the core of
government (topic of challenge) and self-legislation is the core of
public autonomy, which seems to be the crucial deficit to correct.

conseo said:
&gt;<i> ... These practices are not bound to a particular organization, size
</I>&gt;<i> or citizenship and can be started by anybody, anywhere, anytime,
</I>&gt;<i> needing to form a rational social structure or process, no matter
</I>&gt;<i> how small or special and are never finally concluded, but still
</I>&gt;<i> actionable under agreed circumstances.&quot;
</I>
I'm counting on the pictures to say &quot;this is wonderful&quot; (I forgot to
include them in my original post). I want the text to move as quickly
as possible through statements of the problem and solution to end up
pointing to the small group on whose shoulders it all rests. I think
this is where the current draft falls down. It should say more about
the pioneering team.

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> I find it a bit confusing. Even if the readers are intelligent, many
</I>&gt;<i> of the topics you are discussing are just not familiar to most
</I>&gt;<i> people. While they can be understood with contemplation, on their
</I>&gt;<i> face they may be too difficult to grasp.
</I>
I think it leaves the reader wondering, &quot;Where do I fit in?&quot;  The
biggest source of confusion is to omit the purpose of the proposal,
which is to ask for help. So now I'm thinking to turn it (like the
&quot;free-range voting&quot; proposal) into another call for collaboration.

&gt;<i> DESCRIPTION
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy is not about a good relationship between the government
</I>&gt;<i> and the people: it is about government of, by, and for the people.
</I>&gt;<i> As long as we view government and citizens as two distinct groups,
</I>&gt;<i> we cannot have actual democracy. This means changing not the way
</I>&gt;<i> government institutions function, but rather the way governance
</I>&gt;<i> works. This proposal is to fundamentally change the means by which
</I>&gt;<i> government decisions are made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past, it has been impossible or undesirable for the people to
</I>&gt;<i> continuously participate in their own governance: people had to be
</I>&gt;<i> physically together in order to make decisions together. So we had
</I>&gt;<i> to compromise and implement a representative form of democracy:
</I>&gt;<i> basically keeping the governance structure of feudalism (lords and a
</I>&gt;<i> king), but democratizing the process how those rulers came to
</I>&gt;<i> office.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now with internet technologies, we have the ability to democratize
</I>&gt;<i> the entire decision-making process. The common reaction to this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal is that it is an attempt to bring about mob rule: a
</I>&gt;<i> horrible result of a primitive and ill-considered form of democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> We do not propose that at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, we propose to build systems where deliberation and
</I>&gt;<i> discussion are the core of decision-making. Where democracy is not
</I>&gt;<i> about 51% of the people picking one option and 49% picking the
</I>&gt;<i> opposite, but rather about building consensus through organic means
</I>&gt;<i> of dialog and deliberation.
</I>
I respect your Communitarian ethos, but you leave out the solution.
You fail to mention how to achieve the goal of self-government. Maybe
this is where you ran out of time, as you say, but a proposal to build
systems leaves everyone off the hook except a few technicians like me.
Others can safely say &quot;I agree&quot;, then walk away confident they won't
be missing a thing. But it's not systems and technicians we're hurting
for just now, it's leadership. Isn't that true?

Mike
