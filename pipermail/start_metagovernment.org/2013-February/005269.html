<PRE>Hi,

*[Problem experience]*
I'm back from a short internship at &quot;Premium Cola&quot;, which is a network of
freelancers and companys that have a consensus based approach to coordinate
the whole supplier network.
They have open sourced their method and they have open sourced the
ingredients and process of the beer they are offering. Currently they try
to solve the problem about how to pay network members, but its a hard
problem.


*[Problem]*
1. So what about work like all the things that are done in the context of
metagovernment.org?
Obviously it cannot pay for shelter, food, clothes and other things you
need in every day life.
There are projects like &quot;Open Source Ecology&quot; which also have their
problems and to my knowledge are not completely autarkic.
So, assume you have a group of people and something (not neccessarily
money) to be distributed, what principles could you use to find a fair
solution that everyone will be happy with?
I'm searching for an allocation formula. Sometimes it is easy, for example
when a task is given an one could pay a task wage. But when it comes to
open source, it starts to become very difficult. The same is true for
scientist or any other kind of work or performance which is hard to measure.

2. As long as no one is payed there is no problem, but people have to live
of something.
As soon as you introduce some kind of payment system to enable people to
live from what they are doing, you need a very good mechanism instead of a
hierarchy which decided who gets how much, in order to avoid potential
corruption of the whole &quot;ecosystem&quot;.

3. I think I do not understand the core problem and thats why i have such a
hard time imagining what direction to search for a potential solution.
Currently the problem is solved by hierarchies with a top-down-approach,
where each layer measures and decided about tha salary of the layer below.


*[My thoughts about the problem]*
1. In pure market situations, that problem does not exist, but it starts to
manifest as soon as markets evolve into oligopol or monopol markets. Then
again, the problem with pure markets is, that it only works for generic
assets, and becomes more and more difficult when assets (goods and
services) become more specific.
So in theory, a good mechanism, that would be acceptable by all people
involved in some kind of &quot;virtual economy&quot; where participants could provide
all the necessary ingredients which are important ot create a self
sustainable open economy, would enable it, right?

2. How could a mechanism be able to encourage or at least enable people to
do some kind of general work (for example metagovernment.org) without
depending on the current system (e.g. beeing paid by a government or
privatly funded university). This kind of work is hard to measure.
Even learning is some kind of work and society or parents or someone has to
pay for it to create the infrastructure (learning an scientific reasearch
are very similar)

3. So maybe you could use some kind of crowdfunding mechanisms and explain
to people why the work is important and should be funded and eventually
they will donate.
BUT: Even if you succeed with this task, the problem arrises, who of the
involved people gets what share of the Donation for what kind of work ...
and things start to become complicated.


*[What about other thoughts?]*
I wonder if there has been a discussion in the past about a good method to
distribute any kind of income or returns or earnings or how you'd like to
call it. What about price negotiation? What about a market place for jobs?
What about voting? What about exploiting karma points? What about a mix of
all of the above? What about equal &quot;wages&quot; for everyone, but then what
about free riders?
Could you elaborate on that and point me to a books/papers/other sources
which cover this topic.
And I would really like to learn about you opinions regarding this issue.
