<PRE>&quot;Would this validation practice itself be valid?&quot;

Your Votorola and my Blinap are in a sense competing solutions to the 
problem of how to make public decisions.

Having now read the Validity Seeking section, I still like the 
&quot;validation practice&quot; of Blinap better, for numerous reasons. But does 
that mean that the validation practice of Votorola is therefore invalid, 
just because one oddball capable of rational discourse does not agree 
that it is the best available?

     D: &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly 
affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;

According to Habermas's discourse principle (which I really like!), it 
does. We don't need to vote. I am a &quot;possibly affected person&quot;, and I do 
not agree, and I can present reasons for not agreeing (which may or may 
not survive rebuttals).

All we need is the rational discourse. We do not need the voting, or the 
cascading, or the examination of changes apart from the proposals 
themselves (&quot;Is the proposed change valid?&quot;), or pipe minders, or 
multiple groups working in parallel on variant consensus drafts, or any 
of that.

The cleanest, most efficient way to seek validity is to focus all 
attention and effort on each individual proposal. The decision process 
ends at the point that there are no further unresolved objections to the 
proposal. By Habermas's principle, the proposal has then been shown to 
be valid.
