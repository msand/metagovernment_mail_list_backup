<PRE>Hi Mike,

(Regarding the &quot;which listserv&quot; question: I am subscribed to the Metagov 
list, and have only seen what has appeared on the Metagov list, and 
responded to the Metagov list. My apologies if my remarks barged into 
fuller versions of the conversation occurring on other lists. :^)

    Mike: First I need to be sure I understand your reply. You seem to
    allow that, even if there's just one validation *principle* (suppose
    D), there can easily be multiple validation *practices*. No single
    practice is likely to suit everyone under all possible
    circumstances. One person's choosing practice B, therefore, does not
    *in itself* mean that he disagrees with others choosing C, nor,
    insofar as it affects him, with the practice of C itself. To each
    his own. Is this true?

Your paragraph above shows me that my understanding is very unclear 
regarding what you mean by the term &quot;validation practice&quot;. So, until my 
understanding has improved sufficiently, I will forego using the term.

I want us to have a global democratic social system. (It appears to me 
that we are headed toward having a global social system in any case, so 
that the choice is to either bury one's head in the sand of designing 
and implementing local community systems and let the global arrangements 
happen by &quot;accident&quot;, or to actively work to design and implement the 
global arrangements.)

There are three possible foundations for democracy (I would be delighted 
if someone could add more):

    * consent (veto)
    * popularity (voting)
    * rational discourse (recursive proposing)

I take Habermas to be suggesting that we use the third of these as the 
basis for our new global democracy. I heartily agree.

    D: &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected
    persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;

The Votorola decision system uses the second of these (popularity, 
voting) as its foundation. This makes it unacceptable (to me, for 
numerous reasons) as a public decision system to be used (even as just 
one of many) in the new global social system.

(The policy to use Votorola in the new social system would be an action 
norm. I would be a &quot;possibly affected person&quot; -- decisions made through 
Votorola and then implemented might affect me, and to have Votorola 
operating in the social system might affect me, by affecting the social 
system. Thus, the action norm to use Votorola would be valid only if I 
agreed to the use of Votorola. I do not agree.)

(I now know better than to list all the reasons that I find Votorola to 
be unacceptable in this email. When I give long lists in listserv 
emails, only a couple of items at best get responded to, and all the 
rest are ignored and then lost as time and the listserv move on. 
Listserves are lousy platforms for conducting *useful* rational 
discourse: listserves can't handle (receive, organize, present) 
cumulative networked evolving complexity. Every time someone tells me in 
the middle of a discussion that &quot;this matter was discussed on the 
listserv years ago&quot;, I roll my eyes. What fun, to be continually 
reinventing wheels rather than standing on the shoulders of giants. We 
could be collaboratively *creating*. Instead, we are just chatting. I 
keep trying to draw people into using networked editable wiki pages as 
the platform upon which to conduct rational discourse, so far without 
much success. Not sure why. Perhaps we should engage in some rational 
discourse to determine what platform would best serve engaging in 
rational discourse. -- And also, I am willing to bet that that topic has 
been discussed before on the listserv ... :^)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Your Votorola and my Blinap are in a sense competing solutions to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem of how to make public decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having now read the Validity Seeking section, I still like the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;validation practice&quot; of Blinap better, for numerous reasons. But does
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that mean that the validation practice of Votorola is therefore invalid,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just because one oddball capable of rational discourse does not agree
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that it is the best available?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       D: &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> According to Habermas's discourse principle (which I really like!), it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does. We don't need to vote. I am a &quot;possibly affected person&quot;, and I do
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not agree, and I can present reasons for not agreeing (which may or may
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not survive rebuttals).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> All we need is the rational discourse. We do not need the voting, or the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cascading, or the examination of changes apart from the proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> themselves (&quot;Is the proposed change valid?&quot;), or pipe minders, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple groups working in parallel on variant consensus drafts, or any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of that.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The cleanest, most efficient way to seek validity is to focus all
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> attention and effort on each individual proposal. The decision process
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ends at the point that there are no further unresolved objections to the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. By Habermas's principle, the proposal has then been shown to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be valid.
