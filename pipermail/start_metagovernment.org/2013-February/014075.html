<PRE>Hi Mike,

I followed your suggestion and did a closer reading of the &quot;Validity 
Seeking&quot; section, and then closely read the &quot;Legislative Action&quot; section 
as well.

Then I dumped all the commentary into a wiki page:
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0">http://www.wiser.org/article/7820a161960fa155bc9eaa9b30018bf0</A>
(Discourse: Seeking Validity Seeking)

You are absolutely welcome to copy any or all of the text of the wiki 
page into any other venues of your choosing, including into listserv 
emails. (Or tell me what you want, and I will do it.)

If we do bring the discourse to the listserv, we may want to create 
multiple threads to deal with the multiple sub-topics and 
sub-sub-topics. Otherwise, the discourse will predictably succumb to 
&quot;runaway complexity&quot; pretty quickly. (On a listserv, it undoubtedly will 
anyway, but at least we can try to get it past &quot;dead on arrival&quot;.)

A &quot;CliffsNotes&quot; synopsis of the commentary might be expressed thusly:

   1. Popularity (voting) is one possible public decision mechanism.
   2. Rational Discourse is another possible public decision mechanism.
   3. Popularity and Rational Discourse are antithetical. (They produce
      different outcomes.)
   4. Rational Discourse is a valid public decision mechanism, by the
      Discourse Principle.
   5. Popularity is *NOT* a valid public decision mechanism, by the
      Discourse Principle.
   6. Votorola uses popularity as its primary decision mechanism (within
      each poll).
   7. Votorola is designed to feed proposals to other (&quot;decisive&quot;)
      public decision systems that use popularity.
   8. Because Votorola uses popularity itself, and feeds to popularity
      systems, its use cannot reliably produce norms that are valid by
      the Discourse Principle.
   9. THEREFORE, the norm to use Votorola in public decision making is
      not valid by the Discourse Principle.
  10. Therefore, those who value the Discourse Principle will choose to
      not use or support Votorola, and will instead choose to use and
      support alternative public decision systems that are capable of
      *reliably* producing norms that are valid by the Discourse Principle.

Beyond that synopsis, I will leave it to you to create threads for any 
sub-topics that you find of interest.
