<PRE>Hi Ned,

&gt;<i> (This email begins a series of threads that will branch off from the
</I>&gt;<i> original thread: *Legitimation in Votorola Practice*.)
</I>
Please give an example of where the practice (validity seeking) fails
to serve its claimed purpose. I still think this is a good idea,
because otherwise you're in the awkward position of elaborating a
theory of how the practice is broken, when you cannot imagine a single
case in which it fails to guide the text closer to validity, as
claimed.  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/validity_seeking">http://zelea.com/w/Stuff:Votorola/p/validity_seeking</A>

</I>&gt;<i>     D. Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected
</I>&gt;<i>     persons could agree as participants in rational discourses. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Discourse Principle (D) specifies (proposes) the criterion that 
</I>&gt;<i> renders an action norm valid.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The criterion is *NOT* that any particular group of individuals actually 
</I>&gt;<i> *DOES* agree. The criterion is that *ALL* possibly affected persons 
</I>&gt;<i> *COULD* agree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> One can appreciate the wisdom of stating the principle in this way when 
</I>&gt;<i> one considers, for example, that for a great many action norms, future 
</I>&gt;<i> generations yet unborn are included in the set of &quot;all possibly affected 
</I>&gt;<i> persons&quot;. In large populations, it seldom happens that the set of actual 
</I>&gt;<i> participants in each particular decision comprises the full set of &quot;all 
</I>&gt;<i> possibly affected persons&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A vote count can only establish an action norm as valid if the vote 
</I>&gt;<i> count includes votes from &quot;all possibly affected persons&quot;. In instances 
</I>&gt;<i> in which the set of actual participants does not include all possibly 
</I>&gt;<i> affected persons, the vote count is irrelevant in establishing the 
</I>&gt;<i> validity of the proposal. (If 300 Neocons in Washington D.C. unanimously 
</I>&gt;<i> agree to bomb Libya, the unanimity of the vote count does not render the 
</I>&gt;<i> action norm valid.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The key difference between &quot;agreeing as voters&quot; and &quot;agreeing as 
</I>&gt;<i> participants in rational discourses&quot; is this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     * In voting, the vote count makes the decision.
</I>&gt;<i>     * In rational discourse, the &quot;last reason standing&quot; (not
</I>&gt;<i>       successfully rebutted) makes the decision.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Habermas is very careful to specify that the agreements must be &quot;as 
</I>&gt;<i> participants in rational discourses&quot;. Just as Habermas suggests, the 
</I>&gt;<i> best that we (decision participants) can do in instances involving 
</I>&gt;<i> non-participating stakeholders is to try our best to **provisionally** 
</I>&gt;<i> decide whether the action norm is valid *through rational discourse*. 
</I>&gt;<i> (Absent the participation of all stakeholders, we can never know for sure.)
