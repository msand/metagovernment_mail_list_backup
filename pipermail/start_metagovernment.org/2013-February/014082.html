<PRE>Haha :-)
YEAH!
The HEADLINE is already very flawed!!!!
Simply put: It's the WRONG QUESTION :-)

&quot;How might we improve the way citizens and governments interact?&quot;


My thoughts:
1. Why is there a need to improve it?
2. What should be improved? The interaction between &quot;citizens&quot; and
&quot;governments&quot;?
3. Whats the concept of government if not the broadest possible concept
that &quot;holds together&quot; an entity or concept?
4. Who is the entity that poses such a question as the one above? Is it a
citizen or a government? Does it govern or will it be governed?

So maybe the better way for a citizen to ask the same question (and the way
a question is stated influences the answer) is:
*&quot;How might we improve the way citizens govern themselves?&quot; (**individually
and collectively)*

&gt;<i> Hi, Michael.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I find it a bit confusing. Even if the readers are intelligent, many of
</I>&gt;<i> the topics you are discussing are just not familiar to most people. While
</I>&gt;<i> they can be understood with contemplation, on their face they may be too
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to grasp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would propose going a different route... and of course, it's possible we
</I>&gt;<i> could make two submissions, one for Votorola and one for Metagov, or
</I>&gt;<i> whatever.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My suggestion would be to directly attack the premise: that improving
</I>&gt;<i> government is a question of enabling citizens more access to the
</I>&gt;<i> government. That still treats citizens and government as two distinct
</I>&gt;<i> things, and I think that's where the fix needs to be applied.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PROJECT TITLE
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> Use internet tools to remove the distinction between government and
</I>&gt;<i> citizens.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DESCRIPTION
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy is not about a good relationship between the government and the
</I>&gt;<i> people: it is about government of, by, and for the people. As long as we
</I>&gt;<i> view government and citizens as two distinct groups, we cannot have actual
</I>&gt;<i> democracy. This means changing not the way government institutions
</I>&gt;<i> function, but rather the way governance works. This proposal is to
</I>&gt;<i> fundamentally change the means by which government decisions are made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the past, it has been impossible or undesirable for the people to
</I>&gt;<i> continuously participate in their own governance: people had to be
</I>&gt;<i> physically together in order to make decisions together. So we had to
</I>&gt;<i> compromise and implement a representative form of democracy: basically
</I>&gt;<i> keeping the governance structure of feudalism (lords and a king), but
</I>&gt;<i> democratizing the process how those rulers came to office.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now with internet technologies, we have the ability to democratize the
</I>&gt;<i> entire decision-making process. The common reaction to this proposal is
</I>&gt;<i> that it is an attempt to bring about mob rule: a horrible result of a
</I>&gt;<i> primitive and ill-considered form of democracy. We do not propose that at
</I>&gt;<i> all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead, we propose to build systems where deliberation and discussion are
</I>&gt;<i> the core of decision-making. Where democracy is not about 51% of the people
</I>&gt;<i> picking one option and 49% picking the opposite, but rather about building
</I>&gt;<i> consensus through organic means of dialog and deliberation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...I would continue from here, but I have hit a time-deadline and must
</I>&gt;<i> stop now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Opinions?
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's a draft of something I'd like to propose:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PROJECT TITLE
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Public autonomy based on the discourse principle
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DESCRIPTION
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -----------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We aren't quite free if we're obeying laws we haven't discussed and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agreed with. Our autonomy in a social world that regulates itself by
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; laws and other norms of action (public autonomy) depends on being able
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to understand and agree with those norms that we're affected by. As
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the social theorist and philosopher Habermas puts it, &quot;Just those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; action norms are valid to which all possibly affected persons could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Taking this *discourse principle* as our guiding star, we aim to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; develop and disseminate practices of public autonomy based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transitive voting, recombinant text, and a relentless exposure of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evolving drafts to those who have reason for dissent. We'll
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; simultaneously run open electoral primaries based on transitive voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to put our most qualified drafters on the ballot and into assemblies,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where they'll continue to work with us, their un-elected peers.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We'll use MediaWiki for the drafting medium; Semantic MediaWiki as an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; open database and voter registry (streetwiki); existing public forums
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as discussion media; Votorola's prototype toolset for transitive
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; voting and inter-draft patching; plus any other suitable tools and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects we discover along the way. These should be sufficient to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support a crude practice. Our immediate task is to assemble a good
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; team to debug and refine that practice, especially its crucial public
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interface. It looks like small, team-like groups will not only conduct
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the day-to-day core of the practice, but also serve as teachers and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; role models behind its dissemination. In any case, we don't want the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; design of the tools to harden till we understand the hands-on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; practice. Nobody's ever done this before.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT? [1 sentence max]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To develop and disseminate practices of public autonomy based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; transitive voting, recombinant text, and a relentless exposure of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evolving drafts to those who have reason for dissent.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Comments are welcome. It's not a thumbs-up/down thing, it'll be read
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by intelligent people. But is it fairly clear? Or are parts confusing?
