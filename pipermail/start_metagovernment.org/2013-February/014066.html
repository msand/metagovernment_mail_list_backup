&gt;<i> Hi everyone,
</I>&gt;<i>   I thought I might contribute my two cents here. Legitimacy is something
</I>&gt;<i> I've found to contain two completely differing objectives for two roughly
</I>&gt;<i> different bodies in society: there's legal legitimacy, and there's
</I>&gt;<i> legitimacy among people. If we want to change the world, in a way where the
</I>&gt;<i> starving are fed and today's status quo is disrupted, remember that they
</I>&gt;<i> system always responds to this by first not only NOT giving you any credit,
</I>&gt;<i> but actually, once they're done ignoring you, next is their attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> discredit you. Obviously we want to not give them any excess ammunition but
</I>&gt;<i> even abiding by the law, I believe they will do everything possible to deny
</I>&gt;<i> you legitimacy in their terms. However, them and their system is the
</I>&gt;<i> disease and what we really need is to build up our own system, in which
</I>&gt;<i> case the only 'legitimacy' we're really concerned with is the kind which
</I>&gt;<i> comes with people, common people. Craiglist is useful and people in my life
</I>&gt;<i> consider it a 'legit' way to get a new housemate or other things, it's
</I>&gt;<i> functional legitimacy. My point? A) in the big picture, the gov is here to
</I>&gt;<i> drain do-good-ers energy into an endless and ineffective coil of wasted
</I>&gt;<i> will for real change. and in the smaller picture, B) language more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated than the average person understands, is the bane of your most
</I>&gt;<i> vital target audience. Wikipedia pages that are too wordy are useless to
</I>&gt;<i> the developing minds young and old, and Open Source Governance will need a
</I>&gt;<i> massive portion of the population to peacefully replace existing, corrupt
</I>&gt;<i> forms of governance. I'm a total nerd and even I'm wishing the language
</I>&gt;<i> around metagov could get more simplistic/straightforward, but I also see
</I>&gt;<i> myself as some 'random person' checking up on your good work so everything
</I>&gt;<i> with a grain of salt eh? Oh, and C) After a group's made a decision, you
</I>&gt;<i> want as little resentment as possible, which is a complicated thing. Did I
</I>&gt;<i> tell anyone here about my idea for open debate tokens?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ALso, I really wanted to check out this Blinap project, but I can't find it
</I>&gt;<i> online. Can I get a link? Thoughts?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks all,
</I>&gt;<i> Tony
