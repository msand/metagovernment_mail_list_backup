<PRE>Hey Mike,

&gt;<i> The Knight News Challenge this year is, &quot;How might we improve the way
</I>&gt;<i> citizens and governments interact?&quot;  <A HREF="https://www.newschallenge.org/">https://www.newschallenge.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's a draft of something I'd like to propose:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> PROJECT TITLE
</I>&gt;<i> -------------
</I>&gt;<i> Public autonomy based on the discourse principle
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DESCRIPTION
</I>&gt;<i> -----------
</I>&gt;<i> We aren't quite free if we're obeying laws we haven't discussed and
</I>&gt;<i> agreed with. Our autonomy in a social world that regulates itself by
</I>&gt;<i> laws and other norms of action (public autonomy) depends on being able
</I>&gt;<i> to understand and agree with those norms that we're affected by. As
</I>&gt;<i> the social theorist and philosopher Habermas puts it, &quot;Just those
</I>&gt;<i> action norms are valid to which all possibly affected persons could
</I>&gt;<i> agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Taking this *discourse principle* as our guiding star, we aim to
</I>&gt;<i> develop and disseminate practices of public autonomy based on
</I>&gt;<i> transitive voting, recombinant text, and a relentless exposure of
</I>&gt;<i> evolving drafts to those who have reason for dissent. We'll
</I>&gt;<i> simultaneously run open electoral primaries based on transitive voting
</I>&gt;<i> to put our most qualified drafters on the ballot and into assemblies,
</I>&gt;<i> where they'll continue to work with us, their un-elected peers.
</I>
Maybe we should emphasize the grassroots/bootstrapping aspect of organizing 
low-level community duties as well. In other words frame the structuring of a 
rational discourse more universally. For me at least the &quot;primaries&quot; analogy 
sounds very specific to the electoral process. I would keep it in there though 
and I also wouldn't make it a lot longer. Maybe:

&quot;... their un-elected peers. These practices are not bound to a particular 
organization, size or citizenship and can be started by anybody, anywhere, 
anytime, needing to form a rational social structure or process, no matter how 
small or special and are never finally concluded, but still actionable under 
agreed circumstances.&quot;

Probably not very precise or pretty, maybe you can melt that better and 
shorter?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll use MediaWiki for the drafting medium; Semantic MediaWiki as an
</I>&gt;<i> open database and voter registry (streetwiki); existing public forums
</I>&gt;<i> as discussion media; Votorola's prototype toolset for transitive
</I>&gt;<i> voting and inter-draft patching; plus any other suitable tools and
</I>&gt;<i> projects we discover along the way. These should be sufficient to
</I>&gt;<i> support a crude practice. Our immediate task is to assemble a good
</I>&gt;<i> team to debug and refine that practice, especially its crucial public
</I>&gt;<i> interface. It looks like small, team-like groups will not only conduct
</I>&gt;<i> the day-to-day core of the practice, but also serve as teachers and
</I>&gt;<i> role models behind its dissemination. In any case, we don't want the
</I>&gt;<i> design of the tools to harden till we understand the hands-on
</I>&gt;<i> practice. Nobody's ever done this before.

</I>&gt;<i> WHAT IS YOUR PROJECT? [1 sentence max]
</I>&gt;<i> ---------------------
</I>&gt;<i> To develop and disseminate practices of public autonomy based on
</I>&gt;<i> transitive voting, recombinant text, and a relentless exposure of
</I>&gt;<i> evolving drafts to those who have reason for dissent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Comments are welcome. It's not a thumbs-up/down thing, it'll be read
</I>&gt;<i> by intelligent people. But is it fairly clear? Or are parts confusing?
</I>
The rest sounds good to me. Maybe you should underscore that the tools are 
open-source under MIT license.
