<PRE>Hi everyone,
  I thought I might contribute my two cents here. Legitimacy is something
I've found to contain two completely differing objectives for two roughly
different bodies in society: there's legal legitimacy, and there's
legitimacy among people. If we want to change the world, in a way where the
starving are fed and today's status quo is disrupted, remember that they
system always responds to this by first not only NOT giving you any credit,
but actually, once they're done ignoring you, next is their attempts to
discredit you. Obviously we want to not give them any excess ammunition but
even abiding by the law, I believe they will do everything possible to deny
you legitimacy in their terms. However, them and their system is the
disease and what we really need is to build up our own system, in which
case the only 'legitimacy' we're really concerned with is the kind which
comes with people, common people. Craiglist is useful and people in my life
consider it a 'legit' way to get a new housemate or other things, it's
functional legitimacy. My point? A) in the big picture, the gov is here to
drain do-good-ers energy into an endless and ineffective coil of wasted
will for real change. and in the smaller picture, B) language more
complicated than the average person understands, is the bane of your most
vital target audience. Wikipedia pages that are too wordy are useless to
the developing minds young and old, and Open Source Governance will need a
massive portion of the population to peacefully replace existing, corrupt
forms of governance. I'm a total nerd and even I'm wishing the language
around metagov could get more simplistic/straightforward, but I also see
myself as some 'random person' checking up on your good work so everything
with a grain of salt eh? Oh, and C) After a group's made a decision, you
want as little resentment as possible, which is a complicated thing. Did I
tell anyone here about my idea for open debate tokens?

ALso, I really wanted to check out this Blinap project, but I can't find it
online. Can I get a link? Thoughts?

Thanks all,
Tony

&gt;<i> Hi Mike,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Regarding the &quot;which listserv&quot; question: I am subscribed to the Metagov
</I>&gt;<i> list, and have only seen what has appeared on the Metagov list, and
</I>&gt;<i> responded to the Metagov list. My apologies if my remarks barged into
</I>&gt;<i> fuller versions of the conversation occurring on other lists. :^)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Mike: First I need to be sure I understand your reply. You seem to
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    allow that, even if there's just one validation *principle* (suppose
</I>&gt;<i>    D), there can easily be multiple validation *practices*. No single
</I>&gt;<i>    practice is likely to suit everyone under all possible
</I>&gt;<i>    circumstances. One person's choosing practice B, therefore, does not
</I>&gt;<i>    *in itself* mean that he disagrees with others choosing C, nor,
</I>&gt;<i>    insofar as it affects him, with the practice of C itself. To each
</I>&gt;<i>    his own. Is this true?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your paragraph above shows me that my understanding is very unclear
</I>&gt;<i> regarding what you mean by the term &quot;validation practice&quot;. So, until my
</I>&gt;<i> understanding has improved sufficiently, I will forego using the term.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I want us to have a global democratic social system. (It appears to me
</I>&gt;<i> that we are headed toward having a global social system in any case, so
</I>&gt;<i> that the choice is to either bury one's head in the sand of designing and
</I>&gt;<i> implementing local community systems and let the global arrangements happen
</I>&gt;<i> by &quot;accident&quot;, or to actively work to design and implement the global
</I>&gt;<i> arrangements.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are three possible foundations for democracy (I would be delighted
</I>&gt;<i> if someone could add more):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    * consent (veto)
</I>&gt;<i>    * popularity (voting)
</I>&gt;<i>    * rational discourse (recursive proposing)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I take Habermas to be suggesting that we use the third of these as the
</I>&gt;<i> basis for our new global democracy. I heartily agree.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    D: &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected
</I>&gt;<i>    persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Votorola decision system uses the second of these (popularity, voting)
</I>&gt;<i> as its foundation. This makes it unacceptable (to me, for numerous reasons)
</I>&gt;<i> as a public decision system to be used (even as just one of many) in the
</I>&gt;<i> new global social system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The policy to use Votorola in the new social system would be an action
</I>&gt;<i> norm. I would be a &quot;possibly affected person&quot; -- decisions made through
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola and then implemented might affect me, and to have Votorola
</I>&gt;<i> operating in the social system might affect me, by affecting the social
</I>&gt;<i> system. Thus, the action norm to use Votorola would be valid only if I
</I>&gt;<i> agreed to the use of Votorola. I do not agree.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I now know better than to list all the reasons that I find Votorola to be
</I>&gt;<i> unacceptable in this email. When I give long lists in listserv emails, only
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of items at best get responded to, and all the rest are ignored
</I>&gt;<i> and then lost as time and the listserv move on. Listserves are lousy
</I>&gt;<i> platforms for conducting *useful* rational discourse: listserves can't
</I>&gt;<i> handle (receive, organize, present) cumulative networked evolving
</I>&gt;<i> complexity. Every time someone tells me in the middle of a discussion that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this matter was discussed on the listserv years ago&quot;, I roll my eyes. What
</I>&gt;<i> fun, to be continually reinventing wheels rather than standing on the
</I>&gt;<i> shoulders of giants. We could be collaboratively *creating*. Instead, we
</I>&gt;<i> are just chatting. I keep trying to draw people into using networked
</I>&gt;<i> editable wiki pages as the platform upon which to conduct rational
</I>&gt;<i> discourse, so far without much success. Not sure why. Perhaps we should
</I>&gt;<i> engage in some rational discourse to determine what platform would best
</I>&gt;<i> serve engaging in rational discourse. -- And also, I am willing to bet that
</I>&gt;<i> that topic has been discussed before on the listserv ... :^)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> disagreeing with the practice. Do I grok? Or did I miss something?

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Would this validation practice itself be valid?&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Your Votorola and my Blinap are in a sense competing solutions to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem of how to make public decisions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Having now read the Validity Seeking section, I still like the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;validation practice&quot; of Blinap better, for numerous reasons. But does
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that mean that the validation practice of Votorola is therefore invalid,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> just because one oddball capable of rational discourse does not agree
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> that it is the best available?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       D: &quot;Just those action norms are valid to which all possibly
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> According to Habermas's discourse principle (which I really like!), it
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> does. We don't need to vote. I am a &quot;possibly affected person&quot;, and I do
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not agree, and I can present reasons for not agreeing (which may or may
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> not survive rebuttals).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> All we need is the rational discourse. We do not need the voting, or the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> cascading, or the examination of changes apart from the proposals
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> themselves (&quot;Is the proposed change valid?&quot;), or pipe minders, or
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> multiple groups working in parallel on variant consensus drafts, or any
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> of that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The cleanest, most efficient way to seek validity is to focus all
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> attention and effort on each individual proposal. The decision process
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ends at the point that there are no further unresolved objections to the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal. By Habermas's principle, the proposal has then been shown to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> be valid.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> .
