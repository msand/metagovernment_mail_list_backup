<PRE>Alex, Hi!

Here is a list of 150 or so proposals, that together deal with all of 
the problems that you have raised.
<A HREF="http://www.wiser.org/article/8eb6b81a94491ee91d2b004aa2727966">http://www.wiser.org/article/8eb6b81a94491ee91d2b004aa2727966</A>

(Comments, questions, criticisms are all welcome, here and/or over there)

It appears to me that you are up against the &quot;How much change is 
enough?&quot; question. Good on you!

A social system is an organic whole. Everything is connected.

</I>&gt;<i> *[Problem experience]*
</I>&gt;<i> I'm back from a short internship at &quot;Premium Cola&quot;, which is a network 
</I>&gt;<i> of freelancers and companys that have a consensus based approach to 
</I>&gt;<i> coordinate the whole supplier network.
</I>&gt;<i> They have open sourced their method and they have open sourced the 
</I>&gt;<i> ingredients and process of the beer they are offering. Currently they 
</I>&gt;<i> try to solve the problem about how to pay network members, but its a 
</I>&gt;<i> hard problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[Problem]*
</I>&gt;<i> 1. So what about work like all the things that are done in the context 
</I>&gt;<i> of metagovernment.org &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;?
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously it cannot pay for shelter, food, clothes and other things 
</I>&gt;<i> you need in every day life.
</I>&gt;<i> There are projects like &quot;Open Source Ecology&quot; which also have their 
</I>&gt;<i> problems and to my knowledge are not completely autarkic.
</I>&gt;<i> So, assume you have a group of people and something (not neccessarily 
</I>&gt;<i> money) to be distributed, what principles could you use to find a fair 
</I>&gt;<i> solution that everyone will be happy with?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm searching for an allocation formula. Sometimes it is easy, for 
</I>&gt;<i> example when a task is given an one could pay a task wage. But when it 
</I>&gt;<i> comes to open source, it starts to become very difficult. The same is 
</I>&gt;<i> true for scientist or any other kind of work or performance which is 
</I>&gt;<i> hard to measure.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. As long as no one is payed there is no problem, but people have to 
</I>&gt;<i> live of something.
</I>&gt;<i> As soon as you introduce some kind of payment system to enable people 
</I>&gt;<i> to live from what they are doing, you need a very good mechanism 
</I>&gt;<i> instead of a hierarchy which decided who gets how much, in order to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid potential corruption of the whole &quot;ecosystem&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. I think I do not understand the core problem and thats why i have 
</I>&gt;<i> such a hard time imagining what direction to search for a potential 
</I>&gt;<i> solution. Currently the problem is solved by hierarchies with a 
</I>&gt;<i> top-down-approach, where each layer measures and decided about tha 
</I>&gt;<i> salary of the layer below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[My thoughts about the problem]*
</I>&gt;<i> 1. In pure market situations, that problem does not exist, but it 
</I>&gt;<i> starts to manifest as soon as markets evolve into oligopol or monopol 
</I>&gt;<i> markets. Then again, the problem with pure markets is, that it only 
</I>&gt;<i> works for generic assets, and becomes more and more difficult when 
</I>&gt;<i> assets (goods and services) become more specific.
</I>&gt;<i> So in theory, a good mechanism, that would be acceptable by all people 
</I>&gt;<i> involved in some kind of &quot;virtual economy&quot; where participants could 
</I>&gt;<i> provide all the necessary ingredients which are important ot create a 
</I>&gt;<i> self sustainable open economy, would enable it, right?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. How could a mechanism be able to encourage or at least enable 
</I>&gt;<i> people to do some kind of general work (for example metagovernment.org 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org">http://metagovernment.org</A>&gt;) without depending on the current system 
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. beeing paid by a government or privatly funded university). This 
</I>&gt;<i> kind of work is hard to measure.
</I>&gt;<i> Even learning is some kind of work and society or parents or someone 
</I>&gt;<i> has to pay for it to create the infrastructure (learning an scientific 
</I>&gt;<i> reasearch are very similar)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. So maybe you could use some kind of crowdfunding mechanisms and 
</I>&gt;<i> explain to people why the work is important and should be funded and 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually they will donate.
</I>&gt;<i> BUT: Even if you succeed with this task, the problem arrises, who of 
</I>&gt;<i> the involved people gets what share of the Donation for what kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> work ... and things start to become complicated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[What about other thoughts?]*
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder if there has been a discussion in the past about a good 
</I>&gt;<i> method to distribute any kind of income or returns or earnings or how 
</I>&gt;<i> you'd like to call it. What about price negotiation? What about a 
</I>&gt;<i> market place for jobs? What about voting? What about exploiting karma 
</I>&gt;<i> points? What about a mix of all of the above? What about equal &quot;wages&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> for everyone, but then what about free riders?
</I>&gt;<i> Could you elaborate on that and point me to a books/papers/other 
</I>&gt;<i> sources which cover this topic.
</I>&gt;<i> And I would really like to learn about you opinions regarding this issue.
