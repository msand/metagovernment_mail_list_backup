&gt;<i> Hi Alex.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> About framing the problem:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem you are seeing with wages/exchange is an old one, you can have
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> look at the economical classics Locke, Adam Smith, esp. Ricardo and his
</I>&gt;<i> toughest critic Marx (as well as anarchist approaches like Proudhon [which
</I>&gt;<i> won't help you to clarify the role of economics and exchange imo]). The
</I>&gt;<i> core
</I>&gt;<i> problem is that you cannot let the force of human labour float in an
</I>&gt;<i> exchange
</I>&gt;<i> system without alienation, exactly because you cannot regulate it fairly
</I>&gt;<i> afterwards, but it starts to live a life of its own (hence Capital as dead
</I>&gt;<i> (past) labour).
</I>&gt;<i> You suggest just different exchange mechanisms (Karma points, voting,
</I>&gt;<i> etc.),
</I>&gt;<i> but then as also on wiser.org was mentioned, abandoning money (or
</I>&gt;<i> exchange)
</I>&gt;<i> without solving it, doesn't help, because it communicates the material
</I>&gt;<i> social
</I>&gt;<i> needs and they have to be addressed always first.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think that you can frame an abstract solution (e.g. some
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism/scheme/fund/fixed value), without causing worse alienation
</I>&gt;<i> (because
</I>&gt;<i> as you pointed out markets have at least some reflective behaviour, which
</I>&gt;<i> fixed schemes (e.g. feudal systems), have not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-Solution:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hence if you want a consensual process you might not do anything with users
</I>&gt;<i> data except for what they express themselves. All collective mechanisms
</I>&gt;<i> have
</I>&gt;<i> to be explicit (in data and mechanism(s)) and individually controllable.
</I>&gt;<i> This means you should be able to both frame your needs and contributions
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> plan and then the collective has to address all issues for a plan to become
</I>&gt;<i> implementable (think of a Vote as a vector of these features). As this
</I>&gt;<i> guarantees a high degree of transparency, it allows to address all issues
</I>&gt;<i> surrounding a problem and not only those implied by division of labour
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. a
</I>&gt;<i> particular business). While people might have problems with privacy or
</I>&gt;<i> coercion, I don't think that you can have a smart safety net, which
</I>&gt;<i> outsmarts
</I>&gt;<i> people (e.g. smart money). In fact you then will get a shadow economy
</I>&gt;<i> addressing issues beyond your system again, rendering it obsolete or at
</I>&gt;<i> least
</I>&gt;<i> superficial. (1) You can still allow to anonymize or generalize parts of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> plan to allow people some &quot;privacy&quot; from it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To break that down in an example, you would describe your whole needs in
</I>&gt;<i> regard to a certain project or plan (e.g. getting shelter, food or some
</I>&gt;<i> other
</I>&gt;<i> benefits you like to have and you think are reasonably addressable) and the
</I>&gt;<i> plan has to reflect the needs of all participants. A good approach would
</I>&gt;<i> be a
</I>&gt;<i> monetary fund in the beginning and then making more and more basic needs
</I>&gt;<i> (like
</I>&gt;<i> shelter) explicit (without money) imo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense to you? Any objections or practical recommendations?
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> entails blocking of votes likely, because otherwise you can boykot plans by
</I>&gt;<i> making unrealistic demands with your vote. It also means that you have
</I>&gt;<i> control
</I>&gt;<i> over the resource flow (2). But this is likely a good thing, because it
</I>&gt;<i> gives
</I>&gt;<i> everybody control of being voted (and allows to moderate the framing of the
</I>&gt;<i> electorate instead of official divisions). It might create elitist
</I>&gt;<i> collectives
</I>&gt;<i> though.
</I>&gt;<i>

No, doesnt make any sense. I read your words, but i dont understand what
you are saying.
I dont want a &quot;macro mechanism&quot;, I would only like to have a solution for a
small potentially growing group of people.
A firm sells goods and services and buys input from suppliers.
The firm should not have workers but only equal partners, so its more like
a network of freelancers grouped together in some kind of collective.
&gt;<i>From the outside, it functions like a firm, but as soon as a supplier or a
</I>customer joins the collective, it will have access to the mechanism that
organizes the collective.
So the mechanism has to be scalable, but its ok if it only works for the
collective.
All members of the economy who are not part of the collective, because they
choose to not join, will interact with the collective like with any other
company.

So how do you allocate earnings between members of the collective of
freelancers.
in the beginning there might be only a single freelancer, but soon there
might be 3 and then maybe 5 and then 10.
...eventually, it grows bigger and then it will have 50 freelancers in a
network collective and it might grow to 100 or 500 or even more.
The bigger it grows, the more formalized it has to be.

So it will not only need mechanisms for distributing the income of the
collective, but also organize the work and it should not grow into a
classic hierarchy.
Its ok if hierarchies build ad hoc in order to accomplish a project, but it
should stay flexible and be able to reaorganize at any time.
The collective should be able to help its members to learn and share
knowledge and skills.

If some members of the collective invest in capital goods and rent them to
the collective, that might be ok. But its important, that the collective is
able to buy back the capital good from the part of the collective that owns
it, so that its not possible to gain power from it beyond what would have
been in a perfect market.

</I>&gt;<i> (1) This is also the reason why the Berlin wall was a bad idea for so
</I>&gt;<i> called
</I>&gt;<i> marxists. They tried to keep the well-educated workers in, without
</I>&gt;<i> addressing
</I>&gt;<i> their economical interests and problems. This lead to shadow markets and
</I>&gt;<i> implicit service exchanges and a lack of economical adjustability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (2) Some thoughts on counting and the possibility to define the resource
</I>&gt;<i> flow
</I>&gt;<i> through your own node (everybody is always in control of all her/his
</I>&gt;<i> resources) (the rest is rather technical about scalability in general and
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> finished):
