<PRE>Hi Alex.

About framing the problem:

The problem you are seeing with wages/exchange is an old one, you can have a 
look at the economical classics Locke, Adam Smith, esp. Ricardo and his 
toughest critic Marx (as well as anarchist approaches like Proudhon [which 
won't help you to clarify the role of economics and exchange imo]). The core 
problem is that you cannot let the force of human labour float in an exchange 
system without alienation, exactly because you cannot regulate it fairly 
afterwards, but it starts to live a life of its own (hence Capital as dead 
(past) labour).
You suggest just different exchange mechanisms (Karma points, voting, etc.), 
but then as also on wiser.org was mentioned, abandoning money (or exchange) 
without solving it, doesn't help, because it communicates the material social 
needs and they have to be addressed always first.

I don't think that you can frame an abstract solution (e.g. some 
mechanism/scheme/fund/fixed value), without causing worse alienation (because 
as you pointed out markets have at least some reflective behaviour, which 
fixed schemes (e.g. feudal systems), have not.

Anti-Solution:

Hence if you want a consensual process you might not do anything with users 
data except for what they express themselves. All collective mechanisms have 
to be explicit (in data and mechanism(s)) and individually controllable. 
This means you should be able to both frame your needs and contributions to a 
plan and then the collective has to address all issues for a plan to become 
implementable (think of a Vote as a vector of these features). As this 
guarantees a high degree of transparency, it allows to address all issues 
surrounding a problem and not only those implied by division of labour (e.g. a 
particular business). While people might have problems with privacy or 
coercion, I don't think that you can have a smart safety net, which outsmarts 
people (e.g. smart money). In fact you then will get a shadow economy 
addressing issues beyond your system again, rendering it obsolete or at least 
superficial. (1) You can still allow to anonymize or generalize parts of the 
plan to allow people some &quot;privacy&quot; from it.

To break that down in an example, you would describe your whole needs in 
regard to a certain project or plan (e.g. getting shelter, food or some other 
benefits you like to have and you think are reasonably addressable) and the 
plan has to reflect the needs of all participants. A good approach would be a 
monetary fund in the beginning and then making more and more basic needs (like 
shelter) explicit (without money) imo.

Does this make sense to you? Any objections or practical recommendations? It 
entails blocking of votes likely, because otherwise you can boykot plans by 
making unrealistic demands with your vote. It also means that you have control 
over the resource flow (2). But this is likely a good thing, because it gives 
everybody control of being voted (and allows to moderate the framing of the 
electorate instead of official divisions). It might create elitist collectives 
though.

conseo

(1) This is also the reason why the Berlin wall was a bad idea for so called 
marxists. They tried to keep the well-educated workers in, without addressing 
their economical interests and problems. This lead to shadow markets and 
implicit service exchanges and a lack of economical adjustability.

(2) Some thoughts on counting and the possibility to define the resource flow 
through your own node (everybody is always in control of all her/his 
resources) (the rest is rather technical about scalability in general and not 
finished):
