<PRE>Hi Mitch,

I missed your original post on LiberationTech.

I'm afraid your image links fail in Firefox 16 and Chrome 25.  After
following your first link, the others have no effect; the image stays
the same regardless of the image number in the fragment.
<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8</A>
<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#9">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#9</A>  etc.

&gt;<i> EveryVote.org&#8217;s mission ... 2) to make all EveryVote tools
</I>&gt;<i> federation-compatible with as many other government monitoring tools
</I>&gt;<i> as possible, so that a monopoly over government monitoring tools
</I>&gt;<i> cannot form.
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> 1) A tentative name for a collaboration of federation-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> government monitoring tools could be OpenGov Federation
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8</A>&gt;.  #opengovfed
</I>
If I load this from scratch, it takes me to a page about Sarah Moore.
Is the Activity Tracker there meant to illustrate how the federation
might work?  Like a cross-site news aggregator in this case?

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Metagov,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you've read the LibTech listserv recently you may have already seen this
</I>&gt;<i> message below, but I'm submitting it here as well since Michael has offered
</I>&gt;<i> insights and been supportive of this effort in the past. I also would like
</I>&gt;<i> to share it here because I think metagov is on the same page as we are with
</I>&gt;<i> regard to the importance of the successful federation of government
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring tools to avert a monopoly on them from forming.

</I>&gt;<i> (link to this message in blog

</I>&gt;<i> )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> EveryVote.org&#8217;s mission is to improve crowd wisdom and government efficacy
</I>&gt;<i> by providing open source (AGPL) tools that 1) allow people to learn about
</I>&gt;<i> and interact with all of their candidates and officials using one
</I>&gt;<i> convenient web page, and 2) to make all EveryVote tools
</I>&gt;<i> federation-compatible with as many other government monitoring tools as
</I>&gt;<i> possible, so that a monopoly over government monitoring tools cannot form.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some notes about the UI diagrams:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1) A tentative name for a collaboration of federation-compatible government
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring tools could be OpenGov Federation &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#8</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> #opengovfed
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2) EV News &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#16">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#16</A>&gt; is basically reddit, except users
</I>&gt;<i> can filter upvotes and downvotes based on whether those votes were cast by
</I>&gt;<i> supporters &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#17">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#17</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> opposers&lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#19">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#19</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> or undecideds &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#18">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#18</A>&gt; on a topic. I can&#8217;t wait for
</I>&gt;<i> the day this tool becomes available. I love reddit, but its biggest
</I>&gt;<i> drawback is that it necessarily forms a hivemind that prevents minority
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoints from being heard, so it is not a fair platform for civil
</I>&gt;<i> discourse. EV News would do all the same things as reddit, except minority
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoints could be heard.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3) The Consensus Tracker &lt;<A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#5">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#5</A>&gt; is a way for you to
</I>&gt;<i> learn at-a-glance how everyone you &#8216;support&#8217; (your trusted advisors) or
</I>&gt;<i> &#8216;oppose&#8217; (your distrusted advisors) are voting on any site entity
</I>&gt;<i> (candidates, officials, bills, etc.). To our knowledge, no available
</I>&gt;<i> government monitoring tools are using this technology yet. That&#8217;s a shame,
</I>&gt;<i> because if a person understands how the Consensus Tracker works, then they
</I>&gt;<i> basically understand how liquid
</I>&gt;<i> democracy&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy</A>&gt;works, and
</I>&gt;<i> can begin participating in it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To illustrate, if 7 groups you support have voted on Bill A, and 5 of those
</I>&gt;<i> groups voted to support Bill A, while 2 voted to oppose Bill A, then the
</I>&gt;<i> corresponding box in the Consensus Tracker would display a green +43%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Or, if 1 group you support has voted to support Bill A, while 6 groups have
</I>&gt;<i> voted against it, then the corresponding box in the Consensus Tracker would
</I>&gt;<i> display a red -71%.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Algebraically, if:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> X = # of groups you support that are supporting the bill
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Y = # of groups you support that are opposing the bill
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Then the Consensus among groups you support on the bill = (X - Y)/(X + Y)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4) If there was ever an argument that we should consider
</I>&gt;<i> liquid/networked/delegative democracy to support or replace the US current
</I>&gt;<i> representative democracy, I personally think this image speaks
</I>&gt;<i> volumes&lt;<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png">http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5) If you do not think comprehensive US candidate and official databases
</I>&gt;<i> are one of (if not the) highest priority needs in the US today, again please
</I>&gt;<i> take a look at this image &lt;<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png">http://i.imgur.com/aWB2UL2.png</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Average US voters are responsible for the oversight of well over 50 elected
</I>&gt;<i> representatives, and that does not include the judges (I had to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> over 30 in Nov. 2012). It should not surprise us that the American
</I>&gt;<i> government is not representing the will of the people (Congressional
</I>&gt;<i> approval = 15% &lt;<A HREF="http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx">http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx</A>&gt;), nor
</I>&gt;<i> that Americans seem so unwilling to do anything about it. Given our current
</I>&gt;<i> technologies, comprehensive oversight of our elected officials by average
</I>&gt;<i> citizens is completely impractical, so we should expect Americans to be
</I>&gt;<i> cynical yet apathetic about their government.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Fortunately there are logical steps we must take to change that. Before we
</I>&gt;<i> can expect Americans to become active, well-informed citizens, we need to
</I>&gt;<i> provide them with sufficient government monitoring tools. The first steps
</I>&gt;<i> to making sufficient government monitoring tools is *1* completing the free,
</I>&gt;<i> publicly downloadable comprehensive candidate database, and *2* completing
</I>&gt;<i> the free, publicly downloadable comprehensive official database, so
</I>&gt;<i> independent developers can create comprehensive government monitoring
</I>&gt;<i> tools. EveryVote hopes you will become active, outspoken advocates for
</I>&gt;<i> goals *1* and *2*, if you are not already.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ---
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since EveryVote is a small, student and volunteer-driven project, our first
</I>&gt;<i> goal is to create an open source app to help university students learn
</I>&gt;<i> about and interact with all of their student government candidates in one
</I>&gt;<i> convenient location (EVmini). A prototype is
</I>&gt;<i> available&lt;<A HREF="https://apps.facebook.com/everyvote">https://apps.facebook.com/everyvote</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> and you can watch a 60 second video intro to the EveryVote Facebook
</I>&gt;<i> app here&lt;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ55iNwx6Ow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ55iNwx6Ow</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any questions or feedback for us, or you may want to help this
</I>&gt;<i> Summer in any capacity (coding, web design, outreach, mentoring, anything),
</I>&gt;<i> we&#8217;d really appreciate hearing from you at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">contactus at everyvote.org</A>, or
</I>&gt;<i> please follow or tweet @EveryVoteOrg &lt;<A HREF="http://www.twitter.com/everyvoteorg">http://www.twitter.com/everyvoteorg</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for reading! Please let us know what you think so you can help this
</I>&gt;<i> project evolve.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sincerely,
</I>&gt;<i> Mitch &lt;<A HREF="http://www.twitter.com/mdowney84">http://www.twitter.com/mdowney84</A>&gt;*
