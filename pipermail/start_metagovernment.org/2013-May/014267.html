<PRE>Pietro and Ed,

Pietro asked:
&gt;<i> &gt; In particular can someone trace back the exact author and the date
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the idea that voting should not be linked with a specific
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform? Although this intuition has not yet reached full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maturation I think it deserves a place as one of the ideas that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; might come up in the future.
</I>
Ed answered:
&gt;<i> &gt; I believe Thomas von der Elbe came up with free range voting:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Michael can confirm and give a date.
</I>
Mark Murphy speaks of aggregation in his 2008 essay [1].  That same
year he wrote in an email, &quot;Anybody can cast their vote on the issue,
again by publishing a POSH-enhanced Web page.&quot; [2] He seems to have
wanted the votes to be free of central servers and instead in the
hands of self-publishing voters.  That's a beautiful idea.  The
servers become just aggregators, or what today I'd call &quot;vote mirrors&quot;
- except they're tied to a single standard for the vote form [3].
That's one problem.  Another is that few people would actually be
inclined to host their own votes, most would instead come to rely on
vote-servers.  So it's impractical as envisioned.

Thomas's first post to Metagov (May 2009) takes a different approach.
He's trying to get the vote-servers that already exist and already
host votes to cooperate [4].  At one point in the thread, I suggest
vote pooling [5].  But pooling embraces centralization, which is the
opposite of putting the vote in the voter's hands; it's unattractive.

The key to the problem turns out to be translation across vote forms.
That's the basis of vote mirroring, which Thomas invented in December
2009 [6].  It effectively puts the *form* of the vote in the voter's
hands because he/she can now choose any vote-server or voting method,
including (if need be) his/her own.

So Murphy was the first to go chasing after platform freedom (that I
know of), but Thomas was the first to actually catch it.

Pietro asked:
&gt;<i> What were the differences between Votorola and Candiwi?
</I>
Both support distributed drafting based on diff/patch tools.  The main
differences are probably in the voting and discussion media.  But I
don't remember Candiwi's design for those.

&gt;<i> I know Votorola has a nice tree structure of changes to a page. Has
</I>&gt;<i> this been implemented or it is only theorethical (i.e. should I put
</I>&gt;<i> it down as theorethical result)
</I>
What we have are tree structures of *extant* differences, as opposed
to historical changes.  For example, here's Frank's draft:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/w/User:Frank-FlippityNet/Sys/p/sandbox">http://zelea.com/w/User:Frank-FlippityNet/Sys/p/sandbox</A>
Here's the current difference vs. his voter Georgina:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=5339&amp;b=6054&amp;s">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/D?a=5339&amp;b=6054&amp;s</A>
And here's the social tree structure that relates Georgina and Frank:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=Sys!p!sandbox&amp;u=Frank-FlippityNet">http://zelea.com:8080/v/w/Votespace?p=Sys!p!sandbox&amp;u=Frank-FlippityNet</A>

That's not a realistic example, of course, and not very instructive.
The practice docs indexed on the home page are more instructive:
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/home.html</A>

&gt;<i> Then Free Range Voting (this was how it was called), Michael starts
</I>&gt;<i> speaking about it on the 22/12/2009.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Now what is its relation with Votorola?
</I>
Free-range voting is the primary use case for vote mirroring.  It's
shown here: (see FRV) <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht">http://zelea.com/project/outcast/_overview.xht</A>
The three vote-servers in that cluster (V) are supplied by different
providers.  Users may freely range from server to server (vote form to
vote form); they can never be captured by a dominant provider, even
one that had 99.9% of the users.  The relation with Votorola is that
we might be one of the providers.  That would be unlikely without vote
mirroring, because it would be a dog-eat-dog race to the bottom.
