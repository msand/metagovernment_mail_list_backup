<PRE>Hi Michael,

Thanks for the follow up. I think your work is clearer to me now. Could I
say you are advocating for all of our votes (and opinions?) to be made
publicly accessible, and in compatible machine-processible formats? If yes,
I definitely support that goal, and would like to support the culture shift
needed for everyday people to voluntarily move in that direction.

EveryVote's focus is on government monitoring and not elected officials,
but everyday people &lt;<A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/I5X20xG.png">http://i.imgur.com/I5X20xG.png</A>&gt; would have our own
profile in the system. Maybe they could have the ability to opt-in to have
their profile data feed into the Metagov vote sharing system?

I would not want to force everyday people to make their votes/opinions
publicly accessible (although I am open to forcing elected officials and
candidates by law to do so), but I would like to encourage them to move in
that direction. I think we are all wiser when we have the ability to pool
our information together as easily as possible, and furthermore that we
everyday people need to demonstrate and serve as role models for the
transparency we want to see from our government officials.

In other news, EveryVote is the P2P Foundation's featured project of the
day.

Also the EveryVote home page has been updated as of last night. I think the
design and content is substantially improved. If you have a minute, please
check out www.everyvote.org to see the changes, especially the OpenGov
Federation post &lt;<A HREF="http://www.everyvote.org/opengovfed/">http://www.everyvote.org/opengovfed/</A>&gt;. I am not very
technical and not an expert, so if I say anything inaccurate, your comments
and corrections would be appreciated.

All the best,
Mitch

</I>&gt;<i> Thank you.  No, it's probably not.  The URLs differ only by fragment
</I>&gt;<i> (#), meaning they point to the same page.  I've seen this kind of
</I>&gt;<i> thing before.  Probably the page runs a script that sets the image
</I>&gt;<i> according to the fragment, and probably it has a bug tied to
</I>&gt;<i> particular versions of Firefox.  My version is older, so I guess I
</I>&gt;<i> need to upgrade soon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ... Discussion of Metagov's vote sharing would certainly belong
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; there too, although as I understand it vote sharing as you describe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is not quite federation as I am conceiving it. ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there's no direct connection.  I think you have at least one
</I>&gt;<i> foot in the field of e-government, specifically in the area of
</I>&gt;<i> transparency.  A big list for transparency in the US is:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sunlightlabs">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sunlightlabs</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You also want to level the playing field for different tools/sites.
</I>&gt;<i> Our interests overlap here, but from different fields.  I'm more in
</I>&gt;<i> the field of e-democracy.  The information we want to make transparent
</I>&gt;<i> comes from everyday people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You speak of monitoring.  I think that we (everyday people) need also
</I>&gt;<i> to monitor ourselves.  We're already in control of the government, but
</I>&gt;<i> like in a dream or a neurosis, we're unconscious of it.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks for letting me know. Hmm...I have no idea why that is happening.
</I>&gt;<i> The
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; links work in Google Chrome 26 for me, and they are standard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imgur.comlinks, so I would think they should work in previous Chrome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; editions. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the links below work in my Firefox version 7...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I am using Windows 7, could this be a Linux related issue?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In any case, I think you should be able to scroll through the images in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; imgur album by clicking along the images on the top of the page. (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#0">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#0</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The Activity Tracker is just meant to help people realize a federated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; newsfeed, that would aggregate all of our social network activity into
</I>&gt;<i> one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; newsfeed, is possible (others have done it), and that it would be
</I>&gt;<i> valuable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for tracking the public activity of our elected representatives and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; candidates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Since we don't have the manpower/money to implement all of the tools in
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; design diagrams, the point of making and sharing them is to help average
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folks imagine these tools, so they start to want them, so they start to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; support #opengov, so this industry can finally attract the
</I>&gt;<i> manpower/funding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it needs to thrive.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The diagrams received very encouraging support on the
</I>&gt;<i> PoliticalDiscussions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; reddit (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e8buh/its_2013_shouldnt_we_be_able_to_contact_all_of/">http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e8buh/its_2013_shouldnt_we_be_able_to_contact_all_of/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I responded to about 30 comments throughout that discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think there's latent potential for government monitoring tools to take
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; off in the public imagination. Whenever I tell people &quot;learn about and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contact all of your candidates and officials on a single web page,&quot; they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; say &quot;of course I want that&quot;, and/or &quot;you mean we don't have that
</I>&gt;<i> already?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we need to keep chipping away and passing on memes so they
</I>&gt;<i> become a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; national (well, global) priority. Furthermore, I think we need to clearly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; express how these tools should be most ethically provided, so they are
</I>&gt;<i> not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; proprietized and/or manipulated for exploitation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; #opengovfed link should take you to this image (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/uHzBOBV.png">http://i.imgur.com/uHzBOBV.png</A>). I am thinking of OpenGov Federation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the hashtag #opengovfed as a tentative name for a voluntary collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of government monitoring tools to make their tools federation-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (allow users to easily transfer or sync their data between 'competing'
</I>&gt;<i> govt
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; monitoring tools in a compatible format), settle on the open standards
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; necessary to do so. Discussion of Metagov's vote sharing would certainly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; belong there too, although as I understand it vote sharing as you
</I>&gt;<i> describe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is not quite federation as I am conceiving it. I bought
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opengovfed.comand .org. If I can get a window of time this next week
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll try to at least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; setup a forum there.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Btw, a meme-like advocacy for federation I've been using (that I believe
</I>&gt;<i> is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; true) is that federation is what's best for our *freedom*, *convenience*,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and *capacity for innovation*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here's the download link for the zipped UI diagrams in case you have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; trouble accessing them on imgur (<A HREF="http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip">http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Sorry for the scattered email, I'm really ridiculously busy right now as
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just graduated and I'm trying to land a job to keep up with rent :/
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; All the best,
