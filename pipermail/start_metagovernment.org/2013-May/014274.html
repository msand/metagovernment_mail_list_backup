<PRE>Hi Mitch,

&gt;<i> I am using Windows 7, could this be a Linux related issue? ...
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the download link for the zipped UI diagrams in case you have
</I>&gt;<i> trouble accessing them on imgur (<A HREF="http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip">http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip</A>)
</I>
Thank you.  No, it's probably not.  The URLs differ only by fragment
(#), meaning they point to the same page.  I've seen this kind of
thing before.  Probably the page runs a script that sets the image
according to the fragment, and probably it has a bug tied to
particular versions of Firefox.  My version is older, so I guess I
need to upgrade soon.

&gt;<i> ... Discussion of Metagov's vote sharing would certainly belong
</I>&gt;<i> there too, although as I understand it vote sharing as you describe
</I>&gt;<i> it is not quite federation as I am conceiving it. ...
</I>
Maybe there's no direct connection.  I think you have at least one
foot in the field of e-government, specifically in the area of
transparency.  A big list for transparency in the US is:
<A HREF="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sunlightlabs">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/sunlightlabs</A>

You also want to level the playing field for different tools/sites.
Our interests overlap here, but from different fields.  I'm more in
the field of e-democracy.  The information we want to make transparent
comes from everyday people.

You speak of monitoring.  I think that we (everyday people) need also
to monitor ourselves.  We're already in control of the government, but
like in a dream or a neurosis, we're unconscious of it.

Mike

&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for letting me know. Hmm...I have no idea why that is happening. The
</I>&gt;<i> links work in Google Chrome 26 for me, and they are standard
</I>&gt;<i> imgur.comlinks, so I would think they should work in previous Chrome
</I>&gt;<i> editions. Also,
</I>&gt;<i> the links below work in my Firefox version 7...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am using Windows 7, could this be a Linux related issue?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, I think you should be able to scroll through the images in the
</I>&gt;<i> imgur album by clicking along the images on the top of the page. (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#0">http://imgur.com/a/iha6o#0</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Activity Tracker is just meant to help people realize a federated
</I>&gt;<i> newsfeed, that would aggregate all of our social network activity into one
</I>&gt;<i> newsfeed, is possible (others have done it), and that it would be valuable
</I>&gt;<i> for tracking the public activity of our elected representatives and
</I>&gt;<i> candidates.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since we don't have the manpower/money to implement all of the tools in the
</I>&gt;<i> design diagrams, the point of making and sharing them is to help average
</I>&gt;<i> folks imagine these tools, so they start to want them, so they start to
</I>&gt;<i> support #opengov, so this industry can finally attract the manpower/funding
</I>&gt;<i> it needs to thrive.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The diagrams received very encouraging support on the PoliticalDiscussions
</I>&gt;<i> reddit (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e8buh/its_2013_shouldnt_we_be_able_to_contact_all_of/">http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1e8buh/its_2013_shouldnt_we_be_able_to_contact_all_of/</A>).
</I>&gt;<i> I responded to about 30 comments throughout that discussion.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think there's latent potential for government monitoring tools to take
</I>&gt;<i> off in the public imagination. Whenever I tell people &quot;learn about and
</I>&gt;<i> contact all of your candidates and officials on a single web page,&quot; they
</I>&gt;<i> say &quot;of course I want that&quot;, and/or &quot;you mean we don't have that already?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> I think we need to keep chipping away and passing on memes so they become a
</I>&gt;<i> national (well, global) priority. Furthermore, I think we need to clearly
</I>&gt;<i> express how these tools should be most ethically provided, so they are not
</I>&gt;<i> proprietized and/or manipulated for exploitation.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> #opengovfed link should take you to this image (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://i.imgur.com/uHzBOBV.png">http://i.imgur.com/uHzBOBV.png</A>). I am thinking of OpenGov Federation and
</I>&gt;<i> the hashtag #opengovfed as a tentative name for a voluntary collaboration
</I>&gt;<i> of government monitoring tools to make their tools federation-compatible
</I>&gt;<i> (allow users to easily transfer or sync their data between 'competing' govt
</I>&gt;<i> monitoring tools in a compatible format), settle on the open standards
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to do so. Discussion of Metagov's vote sharing would certainly
</I>&gt;<i> belong there too, although as I understand it vote sharing as you describe
</I>&gt;<i> it is not quite federation as I am conceiving it. I bought
</I>&gt;<i> opengovfed.comand .org. If I can get a window of time this next week
</I>&gt;<i> I'll try to at least
</I>&gt;<i> setup a forum there.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Btw, a meme-like advocacy for federation I've been using (that I believe is
</I>&gt;<i> true) is that federation is what's best for our *freedom*, *convenience*,
</I>&gt;<i> and *capacity for innovation*.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the download link for the zipped UI diagrams in case you have
</I>&gt;<i> trouble accessing them on imgur (<A HREF="http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip">http://s.imgur.com/a/iha6o/zip</A>)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry for the scattered email, I'm really ridiculously busy right now as I
</I>&gt;<i> just graduated and I'm trying to land a job to keep up with rent :/
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All the best,
</I>&gt;<i> Mitch
