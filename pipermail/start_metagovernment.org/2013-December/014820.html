<PRE>Ned, I don't think we risk becoming an organization that makes secret decisions in &quot;smoke-filled rooms.&quot; But I do take to heart your point that there's no reason to stop the global group from seeking more organization. I just don't think it needs to necessarily precede the organization of the US corporation.

The latter will take well over a year to achieve 501c3 status, so I'd like to get it kicked off as soon as possible to get it started on that grind. But to start it off, it should still have a governance structure that is in accordance with the group's goals.

Separately, we should continue to approach organization for the global group. We have a well-stated mission and vision, and we have defined basic principles:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

Where we take it from there is a good question. This page is where we had last formally discussed it:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>
but it has not really been updated in nearly four years. Perhaps the next step is to update this page and see if we can take it from there?

&gt;<i> Hi Ed, Paul, Stephen, Max, Pete, Alex,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is how global decisions were being made in 1974:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974">http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is still how global decisions are being made now: &quot;informally&quot;, in secrecy, by a handful of mostly old white guys that are well-placed and well-connected and utterly ruthless in their commitment to narrow zero-sum self interest. Currently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated and decided in just this way.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I for one am interested in humanity having a better system for making global decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Creating a more formal organization for the Metagovernment global group is indeed much more complex than continuing with our informal no-decisions &quot;business as usual&quot; at the global scale. And we (members of the community) are indeed not all on the same page at this point regarding decision rules and such.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, ... we should set up yet another network of national corporate entities (corresponding to the existing network of nations) that will make global decisions basically the same way that such decisions are being made now? I suspect that potential donors would probably not find that approach very inspiring: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we wish a global decision system that reliably makes good-for-all decisions, and in which there is no distinction between governors and governed, we are going to need to create that decision system ourselves, and be the first users of it, ourselves. I do not see any way around that, however complex and difficult the undertaking may be.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Max and Alex, a US 501c3 non-profit has unique advantages because many different foundations will only give money to such an entity. (I am not in any way suggesting it should be the organization that runs this group, but rather one that serves this group, as a sort of subsidiary.) Getting those sorts of funds would have significant benefits to many of us. For a lot of us (myself certainly included), this is random, part-time volunteer work. I would love to be able to spend eight-plus hours a day on this project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But Ned to your point, creating a more formal organization for this global group is much more complex. You had proposed a set of bylaws initially, and immediately hit resistance based on the decision-making rule you proposed. As a group of people and projects working on diverse decision-making systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am somewhat fond of Alex's proposal that we see if we can keep this group as a less formal community (though I am certainly open to suggestion if there's a better way).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance -- once we have some specific instructions for that lawyer. I suppose I could spend some money on one now and see what some realistic options are. But I think it would be really helpful to have some idea of what sort of governance we would like to have instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a lawyer to help us to not have a board of directors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be overkill for the specific question I have in front of us. I am asking not what system we should use for governance, but what paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit, please correct me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this happen. It would be a long process, but if someday we had some money to pay for our time, I can only imagine positive results.
