<PRE>Hey max,
I am from Canada actually, which is why you might notice extra &quot;u&quot;'s in
places and other weird spelling like that.
As far as I know I imagined the posting order, the whole idea actually
festered from me over time, I hadn't had any connection to this idea
previous, which is why it was cool to see the same thing reciprocated here.
I'm unsure what you mean by web framework. I think the style that's on
display in my site is a good one, it allows for a real flow of ideas that
can be presented easily and stay organized by itself.
Again love for anyone's opinion, I'm interested to see how many people
actually check this thing.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Up until now I was kind of under the impression there wasn't much of

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website to try to replicate the idea haha. Finding this place gives me hope
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I am on to something and that I might not have to do it alone.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One direction I took that was a little different from what I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> discovered looking around the site was there's a lot of focus going towards
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the voting aspect of it, I focused more closely on the debate side of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> policy making. I think that proper discussion and understanding is vital
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for the success of a good policy so that's currently what my site focuses
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on. It's a fully threaded forum that works to balance popular opinions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> along with controversial ones on a particular subject and lets all threads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be easily visible and sorted, if this idea is to grow at all it will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important to keep everything organized, that's what the site focuses on,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allowance of input from everyone but still keeping the best points to an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> issue at the forefront and keeping the discussion on track. I think we need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to first establish a good line of conversation before we work on things
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> like proper voting mechanisms. I'd be very happy and interested to hear
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your guys opinion of the site, either here or on the site would be even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better to get the idea of how it works. www.theinternetswebsite.com it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fairly basic now but the plans for the future are there as well, let's get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some conversations going. Looking forward to any responses, much love and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> glad I found you guys.
