<PRE>Ned et al,

I think your conclusion is well done.  I am a little sad that I end up
usually thinking critically.  On the other hand I can allow hope to exist.
I think you did at the end express sort of a wish/hope/purpose.  I think
phrased that way then it can be better worked.

Suppose you were to focus on a purpose and pick a short term goal that you
hope serves your purpose.  And since you are on this mailing list, perhaps
the purpose is less important than that the goal is seen by others here as
supporting their purposes.  And what would that goal be?

I am surely biased but people do think the current mailing format might be
improved.  In fact, I tried getting testers for the ambitious mediathread
and failed at least in terms of real testers.  Further I never got to my
goal of updating the MG associated spreadsheets.  I need to think about how
to do better.

What goal would you propose for yourself?  Short term.  Have a component
that you can do on your own.  Something that people you do know would find
useful.

Blessings,

Max

&gt;<i> Hi Ed, Paul, Stephen, Max, Pete, Alex,

</I>&gt;<i> This is how global decisions were being made in 1974:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is still how global decisions are being made now: &quot;informally&quot;, in
</I>&gt;<i> secrecy, by a handful of mostly old white guys that are well-placed and
</I>&gt;<i> well-connected and utterly ruthless in their commitment to narrow zero-sum
</I>&gt;<i> self interest. Currently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated
</I>&gt;<i> and decided in just this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I for one am interested in humanity having a better system for making
</I>&gt;<i> global decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Creating a more formal organization for the Metagovernment global group is
</I>&gt;<i> indeed much more complex than continuing with our informal no-decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;business as usual&quot; at the global scale. And we (members of the community)
</I>&gt;<i> are indeed not all on the same page at this point regarding decision rules
</I>&gt;<i> and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Therefore, ... we should set up yet another network of national corporate
</I>&gt;<i> entities (corresponding to the existing network of nations) that will make
</I>&gt;<i> global decisions basically the same way that such decisions are being made
</I>&gt;<i> now? I suspect that potential donors would probably not find that approach
</I>&gt;<i> very inspiring: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we wish a global decision system that reliably makes good-for-all
</I>&gt;<i> decisions, and in which there is no distinction between governors and
</I>&gt;<i> governed, we are going to need to create that decision system ourselves,
</I>&gt;<i> and be the first users of it, ourselves. I do not see any way around that,
</I>&gt;<i> however complex and difficult the undertaking may be.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Max and Alex, a US 501c3 non-profit has unique advantages because many

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> rather one that serves this group, as a sort of subsidiary.) Getting those
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sorts of funds would have significant benefits to many of us. For a lot of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> us (myself certainly included), this is random, part-time volunteer work. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would love to be able to spend eight-plus hours a day on this project.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But Ned to your point, creating a more formal organization for this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> global group is much more complex. You had proposed a set of bylaws
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> initially, and immediately hit resistance based on the decision-making rule
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you proposed. As a group of people and projects working on diverse
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decision-making systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am somewhat fond of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alex's proposal that we see if we can keep this group as a less formal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> community (though I am certainly open to suggestion if there's a better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> way).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance -- once we have some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific instructions for that lawyer. I suppose I could spend some money
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on one now and see what some realistic options are. But I think it would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really helpful to have some idea of what sort of governance we would like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to have instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a lawyer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> help us to not have a board of directors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be overkill for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> specific question I have in front of us. I am asking not what system we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should use for governance, but what paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> please correct me.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this happen. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be a long process, but if someday we had some money to pay for our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time, I can only imagine positive results.
