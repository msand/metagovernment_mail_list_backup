<PRE>I'd like to respond to all of you at once, so I'm not quoting anyone directly.

Max and Alex, a US 501c3 non-profit has unique advantages because many different foundations will only give money to such an entity. (I am not in any way suggesting it should be the organization that runs this group, but rather one that serves this group, as a sort of subsidiary.) Getting those sorts of funds would have significant benefits to many of us. For a lot of us (myself certainly included), this is random, part-time volunteer work. I would love to be able to spend eight-plus hours a day on this project.

But Ned to your point, creating a more formal organization for this global group is much more complex. You had proposed a set of bylaws initially, and immediately hit resistance based on the decision-making rule you proposed. As a group of people and projects working on diverse decision-making systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am somewhat fond of Alex's proposal that we see if we can keep this group as a less formal community (though I am certainly open to suggestion if there's a better way).

Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance -- once we have some specific instructions for that lawyer. I suppose I could spend some money on one now and see what some realistic options are. But I think it would be really helpful to have some idea of what sort of governance we would like to have instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a lawyer to help us to not have a board of directors.

Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be overkill for the specific question I have in front of us. I am asking not what system we should use for governance, but what paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit, please correct me.

Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this happen. It would be a long process, but if someday we had some money to pay for our time, I can only imagine positive results.
</PRE>
