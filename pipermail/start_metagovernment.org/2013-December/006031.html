<PRE>Hi Max,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Max&gt; Suppose you were to focus on a purpose and pick a short term
    goal that you hope serves your purpose. And since you are on this
    mailing list, perhaps the purpose is less important than that the
    goal is seen by others here as supporting their purposes. And what
    would that goal be?

Ned&gt; Every email that I post to the list manifests at least one 
purpose/goal that I have focused on (generally several purposes/goals). 
You are looking for things that are right in front of you (like looking 
for one's spectacles only to find them on top of one's head).

In my email to which you have just responded, I was focused on trying to 
help Ed brainstorm the global/corporate governance structure topic. That 
is what he is asking for in that thread. (You wandered off-topic for 
that thread in your response to my email. I have now started a new 
thread for the new topic that you have introduced. Feel free to clarify 
what the new topic of this thread is -- it is your topic.)

</I>&gt;<i>     Hi Ed, Paul, Stephen, Max, Pete, Alex,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     This is how global decisions were being made in 1974:
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974">http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It is still how global decisions are being made now: &quot;informally&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>     in secrecy, by a handful of mostly old white guys that are
</I>&gt;<i>     well-placed and well-connected and utterly ruthless in their
</I>&gt;<i>     commitment to narrow zero-sum self interest. Currently, the
</I>&gt;<i>     Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated and decided in just
</I>&gt;<i>     this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I for one am interested in humanity having a better system for
</I>&gt;<i>     making global decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Creating a more formal organization for the Metagovernment global
</I>&gt;<i>     group is indeed much more complex than continuing with our
</I>&gt;<i>     informal no-decisions &quot;business as usual&quot; at the global scale. And
</I>&gt;<i>     we (members of the community) are indeed not all on the same page
</I>&gt;<i>     at this point regarding decision rules and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Therefore, ... we should set up yet another network of national
</I>&gt;<i>     corporate entities (corresponding to the existing network of
</I>&gt;<i>     nations) that will make global decisions basically the same way
</I>&gt;<i>     that such decisions are being made now? I suspect that potential
</I>&gt;<i>     donors would probably not find that approach very inspiring:
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     If we wish a global decision system that reliably makes
</I>&gt;<i>     good-for-all decisions, and in which there is no distinction
</I>&gt;<i>     between governors and governed, we are going to need to create
</I>&gt;<i>     that decision system ourselves, and be the first users of it,
</I>&gt;<i>     ourselves. I do not see any way around that, however complex and
</I>&gt;<i>     difficult the undertaking may be.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Max and Alex, a US 501c3 non-profit has unique advantages
</I>&gt;<i>         because many different foundations will only give money to
</I>&gt;<i>         such an entity. (I am not in any way suggesting it should be
</I>&gt;<i>         the organization that runs this group, but rather one that
</I>&gt;<i>         serves this group, as a sort of subsidiary.) Getting those
</I>&gt;<i>         sorts of funds would have significant benefits to many of us.
</I>&gt;<i>         For a lot of us (myself certainly included), this is random,
</I>&gt;<i>         part-time volunteer work. I would love to be able to spend
</I>&gt;<i>         eight-plus hours a day on this project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         But Ned to your point, creating a more formal organization for
</I>&gt;<i>         this global group is much more complex. You had proposed a set
</I>&gt;<i>         of bylaws initially, and immediately hit resistance based on
</I>&gt;<i>         the decision-making rule you proposed. As a group of people
</I>&gt;<i>         and projects working on diverse decision-making
</I>&gt;<i>         systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble
</I>&gt;<i>         picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am
</I>&gt;<i>         somewhat fond of Alex's proposal that we see if we can keep
</I>&gt;<i>         this group as a less formal community (though I am certainly
</I>&gt;<i>         open to suggestion if there's a better way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance -- once we
</I>&gt;<i>         have some specific instructions for that lawyer. I suppose I
</I>&gt;<i>         could spend some money on one now and see what some realistic
</I>&gt;<i>         options are. But I think it would be really helpful to have
</I>&gt;<i>         some idea of what sort of governance we would like to have
</I>&gt;<i>         instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a lawyer
</I>&gt;<i>         to help us to not have a board of directors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be overkill
</I>&gt;<i>         for the specific question I have in front of us. I am asking
</I>&gt;<i>         not what system we should use for governance, but what
</I>&gt;<i>         paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit, please correct me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this
</I>&gt;<i>         happen. It would be a long process, but if someday we had some
</I>&gt;<i>         money to pay for our time, I can only imagine positive results.
</I>&gt;<i>
