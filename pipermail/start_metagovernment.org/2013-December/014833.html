<PRE>Hi Reid,

Welcome ;o)

Just a short note from my side: I am member of a working group (AG MFT)
focused on discussion systems. We divide the decision-making process into
three disjunct systems: 1) Information System, 2) Discussion System and 3)
Resolution System

The following &quot;Big Picture&quot; tries to visualise the dependencies between
these systems:
<A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/7/72/MFT_BigPicture_v01.jpg">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/7/72/MFT_BigPicture_v01.jpg</A>

Since we focus on discussion systems, our aim is to enable discussion
systems to cooperate using a unified common interface and an ontology for
discussion inside a P2P network. Hence the next picture tries to explain
more details on this:
<A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/3/37/DiscussionSystem-Overview.jpg">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/3/37/DiscussionSystem-Overview.jpg</A>

Currently the working group is developing some proof of concept (PoC)
implementations to verify if our idea of a common discussion ontology (we
call it d!sco) holds. The following picture tries to focus on what the PoC
is all about:
<A HREF="http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/0/01/TheDiscoNetwork-Components-PoC.jpg">http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/wiki/images/0/01/TheDiscoNetwork-Components-PoC.jpg</A>

As you can see, we also try to cooperate with the guys from eDialogos
(<A HREF="http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/">http://www.imc.com.gr/ontologies/eDialogos/consensus/</A>) regarding the
discussion ontology.

There is maybe an interesting listening (even if we had some audio problems)
of the first meeting between AG MFT and the eDialogos team:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=TjNMS1QD7WI&amp;list=PL_LMx-f1yd_ORCWOVrJqrR8r7avobXGEq#t=3659">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=TjNMS1QD7WI&amp;list=PL_LMx-f1yd_ORCWOVrJqrR8r7avobXGEq#t=3659</A>

I would suggest to start listening around the timecode 01:01:00


Some more information can be found on our project home at

Still unsure of the protocol of this place but the participation page told
me to introduce myself so here I am. I hope there's a good number of active
member on this list because I share the same sentiments that you guys do and
am looking build upon them with some interested participants.


Up until now I was kind of under the impression there wasn't much of
community working on this idea, which is weird because it holds a lot of
potential in my mind. I was so sure I was alone I went ahead and created a
website to try to replicate the idea haha. Finding this place gives me hope
that I am on to something and that I might not have to do it alone.

One direction I took that was a little different from what I've discovered
looking around the site was there's a lot of focus going towards the voting
aspect of it, I focused more closely on the debate side of policy making. I
think that proper discussion and understanding is vital for the success of a
good policy so that's currently what my site focuses on. It's a fully
threaded forum that works to balance popular opinions along with
controversial ones on a particular subject and lets all threads to be easily
visible and sorted, if this idea is to grow at all it will be important to
keep everything organized, that's what the site focuses on, allowance of
input from everyone but still keeping the best points to an issue at the
forefront and keeping the discussion on track. I think we need to first
establish a good line of conversation before we work on things like proper
voting mechanisms. I'd be very happy and interested to hear your guys
opinion of the site, either here or on the site would be even better to get
the idea of how it works. www.theinternetswebsite.com it's fairly basic now
but the plans for the future are there as well, let's get some conversations
going. Looking forward to any responses, much love and glad I found you
guys.
