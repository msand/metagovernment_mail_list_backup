<PRE>Hi Max,

I did not and do not hold the view that you &quot;hijacked the thread&quot;. I do 
hold the view that you asked me a question that belonged on its own 
different thread. So, I created a new thread for that question.

The examples of your short-term goals that you provide (improve mailing 
format, provide ambitious mediathread, update spreadsheets) suggest that 
you are a &quot;code first, think about things later&quot; kind of guy. I used to 
be that way, but got tired of throwing away code. Now I much prefer to 
think things through, and try to reach agreement-in-principle with as 
many others as possible, before plunging into coding.

So, my short-term goal in the &quot;Corporate Governance Structure&quot; thread is 
for us (the participants) to reach agreement (actually settle the 
matter, so that we can then build on the settlement) concerning whether 
to vest decision-making power in the global group, or in national 
corporate entities. (This is one way to frame the issue; there are also 
other ways to frame it.)

That short-term goal does not involve coding; it involves reaching 
agreement-in-principle, through discourse (with or without occasional 
group hugs).

In this thread, I guess you want me to pick and present one or more 
short-term goals that involve coding or some such. If so, then my 
response is that I don't think that we (the community) are far enough 
along yet in our thinking things through and agreeing in principle to be 
ready to start substantive development projects that would serve the 
purposes that I value. (Over on the Isonomea wiki, there are lots of 
development projects sitting on the runway. So, on this list, my work is 
-- through discussions -- to eventually make those development projects 
of interest.)

</I>&gt;<i>        Max&gt; Suppose you were to focus on a purpose and pick a short term

</I>&gt;<i>        mailing list, perhaps the purpose is less important than that the
</I>&gt;<i>        goal is seen by others here as supporting their purposes. And what
</I>&gt;<i>        would that goal be?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ned&gt; Every email that I post to the list manifests at least one
</I>&gt;<i>     purpose/goal that I have focused on (generally several
</I>&gt;<i>     purposes/goals). You are looking for things that are right in
</I>&gt;<i>     front of you (like looking for one's spectacles only to find them
</I>&gt;<i>     on top of one's head).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     In my email to which you have just responded, I was focused on
</I>&gt;<i>     trying to help Ed brainstorm the global/corporate governance
</I>&gt;<i>     structure topic. That is what he is asking for in that thread.
</I>&gt;<i>     (You wandered off-topic for that thread in your response to my
</I>&gt;<i>     email. I have now started a new thread for the new topic that you
</I>&gt;<i>     have introduced. Feel free to clarify what the new topic of this
</I>&gt;<i>     thread is -- it is your topic.)

</I>&gt;<i>         I think your conclusion is well done.  I am a little sad that

</I>&gt;<i>         I think you did at the end express sort of a

</I>&gt;<i>         I am surely biased but people do think the current mailing

</I>&gt;<i>         for the ambitious mediathread and failed at least in terms of
</I>&gt;<i>         real testers.  Further I never got to my goal of updating the
</I>&gt;<i>         MG associated spreadsheets.  I need to think about how to do
</I>&gt;<i>         better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         What goal would you propose for yourself?  Short term.  Have a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             This is how global decisions were being made in 1974:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             It is still how global decisions are being made now:
</I>&gt;<i>         &quot;informally&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>             in secrecy, by a handful of mostly old white guys that are
</I>&gt;<i>             well-placed and well-connected and utterly ruthless in their
</I>&gt;<i>             commitment to narrow zero-sum self interest. Currently, the
</I>&gt;<i>             Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated and decided
</I>&gt;<i>         in just
</I>&gt;<i>             this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             I for one am interested in humanity having a better system for
</I>&gt;<i>             making global decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Creating a more formal organization for the Metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i>         global
</I>&gt;<i>             group is indeed much more complex than continuing with our
</I>&gt;<i>             informal no-decisions &quot;business as usual&quot; at the global
</I>&gt;<i>         scale. And
</I>&gt;<i>             we (members of the community) are indeed not all on the
</I>&gt;<i>         same page
</I>&gt;<i>             at this point regarding decision rules and such.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Therefore, ... we should set up yet another network of
</I>&gt;<i>         national
</I>&gt;<i>             corporate entities (corresponding to the existing network of
</I>&gt;<i>             nations) that will make global decisions basically the
</I>&gt;<i>         same way
</I>&gt;<i>             that such decisions are being made now? I suspect that
</I>&gt;<i>         potential
</I>&gt;<i>             donors would probably not find that approach very inspiring:
</I>&gt;<i>             &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             If we wish a global decision system that reliably makes
</I>&gt;<i>             good-for-all decisions, and in which there is no distinction
</I>&gt;<i>             between governors and governed, we are going to need to create
</I>&gt;<i>             that decision system ourselves, and be the first users of it,
</I>&gt;<i>             ourselves. I do not see any way around that, however
</I>&gt;<i>         complex and
</I>&gt;<i>             difficult the undertaking may be.

</I>&gt;<i>                 But Ned to your point, creating a more formal
</I>&gt;<i>         organization for
</I>&gt;<i>                 this global group is much more complex. You had
</I>&gt;<i>         proposed a set
</I>&gt;<i>                 of bylaws initially, and immediately hit resistance
</I>&gt;<i>         based on
</I>&gt;<i>                 the decision-making rule you proposed. As a group of
</I>&gt;<i>         people
</I>&gt;<i>                 and projects working on diverse decision-making
</I>&gt;<i>                 systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble
</I>&gt;<i>                 picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am
</I>&gt;<i>                 somewhat fond of Alex's proposal that we see if we can
</I>&gt;<i>         keep
</I>&gt;<i>                 this group as a less formal community (though I am
</I>&gt;<i>         certainly
</I>&gt;<i>                 open to suggestion if there's a better way).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance --
</I>&gt;<i>         once we
</I>&gt;<i>                 have some specific instructions for that lawyer. I
</I>&gt;<i>         suppose I
</I>&gt;<i>                 could spend some money on one now and see what some
</I>&gt;<i>         realistic
</I>&gt;<i>                 options are. But I think it would be really helpful to
</I>&gt;<i>         have
</I>&gt;<i>                 some idea of what sort of governance we would like to have
</I>&gt;<i>                 instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a
</I>&gt;<i>         lawyer
</I>&gt;<i>                 to help us to not have a board of directors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be
</I>&gt;<i>         overkill
</I>&gt;<i>                 for the specific question I have in front of us. I am
</I>&gt;<i>         asking
</I>&gt;<i>                 not what system we should use for governance, but what
</I>&gt;<i>                 paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit, please correct me.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this
</I>&gt;<i>                 happen. It would be a long process, but if someday we
</I>&gt;<i>         had some
</I>&gt;<i>                 money to pay for our time, I can only imagine positive
</I>&gt;<i>         results.
