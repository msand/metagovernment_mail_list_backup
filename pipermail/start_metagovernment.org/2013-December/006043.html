<PRE>Still unsure of the protocol of this place but the participation page told
me to introduce myself so here I am. I hope there's a good number of active
member on this list because I share the same sentiments that you guys do
and am looking build upon them with some interested participants.

Up until now I was kind of under the impression there wasn't much of
community working on this idea, which is weird because it holds a lot of
potential in my mind. I was so sure I was alone I went ahead and created a
website to try to replicate the idea haha. Finding this place gives me hope
that I am on to something and that I might not have to do it alone.

One direction I took that was a little different from what I've discovered
looking around the site was there's a lot of focus going towards the voting
aspect of it, I focused more closely on the debate side of policy making. I
think that proper discussion and understanding is vital for the success of
a good policy so that's currently what my site focuses on. It's a fully
threaded forum that works to balance popular opinions along with
controversial ones on a particular subject and lets all threads to be
easily visible and sorted, if this idea is to grow at all it will be
important to keep everything organized, that's what the site focuses on,
allowance of input from everyone but still keeping the best points to an
issue at the forefront and keeping the discussion on track. I think we need
to first establish a good line of conversation before we work on things
like proper voting mechanisms. I'd be very happy and interested to hear
your guys opinion of the site, either here or on the site would be even
better to get the idea of how it works. www.theinternetswebsite.com it's
fairly basic now but the plans for the future are there as well, let's get
some conversations going. Looking forward to any responses, much love and
glad I found you guys.
