<PRE>Ed,

In my world, mission/vision is a prerequisite to IRS tax-exempt filing and
even Incorporation.  So, you seem to say that goverance structure is first
on the ToBeDone for the US corporation but mission/vision is first for the
global structure.  I leave aside basic principles further down the wiki
page.  Please elaborate.

Blessings,

Max

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Ed, Paul, Stephen, Max, Pete, Alex,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is how global decisions were being made in 1974:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974">http://www.ingoldwetrust.ch/minutes-of-kissinger-meeting-on-gold-1974</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is still how global decisions are being made now: &quot;informally&quot;, in
</I>&gt;<i> secrecy, by a handful of mostly old white guys that are well-placed and
</I>&gt;<i> well-connected and utterly ruthless in their commitment to narrow zero-sum
</I>&gt;<i> self interest. Currently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is being negotiated
</I>&gt;<i> and decided in just this way.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I for one am interested in humanity having a better system for making
</I>&gt;<i> global decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Creating a more formal organization for the Metagovernment global group
</I>&gt;<i> is indeed much more complex than continuing with our informal no-decisions
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;business as usual&quot; at the global scale. And we (members of the community)
</I>&gt;<i> are indeed not all on the same page at this point regarding decision rules
</I>&gt;<i> and such.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Therefore, ... we should set up yet another network of national
</I>&gt;<i> corporate entities (corresponding to the existing network of nations) that
</I>&gt;<i> will make global decisions basically the same way that such decisions are
</I>&gt;<i> being made now? I suspect that potential donors would probably not find
</I>&gt;<i> that approach very inspiring: &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If we wish a global decision system that reliably makes good-for-all
</I>&gt;<i> decisions, and in which there is no distinction between governors and
</I>&gt;<i> governed, we are going to need to create that decision system ourselves,
</I>&gt;<i> and be the first users of it, ourselves. I do not see any way around that,
</I>&gt;<i> however complex and difficult the undertaking may be.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Max and Alex, a US 501c3 non-profit has unique advantages because many
</I>&gt;<i> different foundations will only give money to such an entity. (I am not in
</I>&gt;<i> any way suggesting it should be the organization that runs this group, but
</I>&gt;<i> rather one that serves this group, as a sort of subsidiary.) Getting those
</I>&gt;<i> sorts of funds would have significant benefits to many of us. For a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> us (myself certainly included), this is random, part-time volunteer work. I
</I>&gt;<i> would love to be able to spend eight-plus hours a day on this project.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But Ned to your point, creating a more formal organization for this
</I>&gt;<i> global group is much more complex. You had proposed a set of bylaws
</I>&gt;<i> initially, and immediately hit resistance based on the decision-making rule
</I>&gt;<i> you proposed. As a group of people and projects working on diverse
</I>&gt;<i> decision-making systems/paradigms, it's not surprising we'd have trouble
</I>&gt;<i> picking a single decision-making rule for all of us. I am somewhat fond of
</I>&gt;<i> Alex's proposal that we see if we can keep this group as a less formal
</I>&gt;<i> community (though I am certainly open to suggestion if there's a better
</I>&gt;<i> way).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Max, I would like to hire a lawyer to get guidance -- once we have some
</I>&gt;<i> specific instructions for that lawyer. I suppose I could spend some money
</I>&gt;<i> on one now and see what some realistic options are. But I think it would be
</I>&gt;<i> really helpful to have some idea of what sort of governance we would like
</I>&gt;<i> to have instead of a board of directors, before I go telling a lawyer to
</I>&gt;<i> help us to not have a board of directors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Pete, if I understand Holocracy right, it might be overkill for the
</I>&gt;<i> specific question I have in front of us. I am asking not what system we
</I>&gt;<i> should use for governance, but what paradigm. If it is an appropriate fit,
</I>&gt;<i> please correct me.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thank you all. I am really looking forward to making this happen. It
</I>&gt;<i> would be a long process, but if someday we had some money to pay for our
</I>&gt;<i> time, I can only imagine positive results.
