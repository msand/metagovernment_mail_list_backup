</I>&gt;<i> 1.Let us be vague at first and say that the goal of existence is goodness (

</I>&gt;<i> (animal happiness)
</I>
Maybe it's a translation issue I'm not sure &quot;happiness&quot; is what you
want to use here. There's lots of research in this area that shows
that &quot;happiness&quot; is relatively rare, very hard to measure (all kinds
of reporting biases), and not generally considered to be a reasonable
goal. I think we can learn something from the popularity of religions
here: Do they all promise &quot;happiness&quot;? No, they generally promote
peace, harmony, and well-being. I'd even put political and economic
ideals (freedom, power, success, satisfaction of desires, etc.) or
even simple stress reduction ahead of &quot;happiness&quot; as goals.

I'm also increasingly tending to discount &quot;future generations&quot; as an
issue because it's generally an example of replism
(<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/matchism-code/">http://www.matchism.org/matchism-code/</A>) and so not a worthy goal in
itself. People should work to protect the future that *they* will
have, but worrying about their genetic descendants is at best a waste
of time and at worst counterproductive because it results in failure
to solve *today's* problems because you've piled on tomorrow's as
well.

&gt;<i> 3. Measuring happiness!: How are you? Answer on a scale from 0-10. Happiness
</I>&gt;<i> is measurable!
</I>
Not counting reporting bias, of course, which is a *huge* problem,
especially if you want to compare success toward achieving the goal
across cultures.

&gt;<i> 4. Now we have a variable that we would like to maximize, but we need to
</I>&gt;<i> find some independent variables that maximize it.
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Any data may be useful, but some are more likely to be useful, like data
</I>&gt;<i> from your smartphone sensors, your selected search results etc. = big data
</I>&gt;<i> 6. So, we got dependent variable and independent variables. Now, we need a
</I>&gt;<i> way to intervene. Here comes the mediacentric theory. It is not bulletproof,
</I>&gt;<i> but it has a power.
</I>&gt;<i> 7. We need a smaller sector than the whole media to start with. Let's find
</I>&gt;<i> the most effective. I suggest it is the Internet and on the Internet *search
</I>&gt;<i> engines*.
</I>&gt;<i> 8. There is a way how to build Goodness search engine (for marketing
</I>&gt;<i> purposes I call it Happiness Search Engine). Would you like to build it?
</I>
I'm not sure I follow this, but it looks to me like it runs right
smack into the cross-cultural problem above.

&gt;<i> I hope you will ask for more. Imagine that I would write it in detail, who
</I>&gt;<i> would read it? :D
</I>
I'm inclined to consider this issue in the &quot;how many angels can dance
on the head of a pin&quot; category: We don't need to measure any of these
things, we just need to empower individuals to make public policy
decisions. What they choose is what's important, not the label you
might try to attach to it.
  Regards,
    Scott
