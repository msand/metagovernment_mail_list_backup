<PRE>Scott,
I am glad you wrote, good ideas. But for me, some meaningful interaction
after a longer time. The rest is in text...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi everybody,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I went too far, I do not know if we still understand each other. Anyway I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hope somebody will find this interesting.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1.Let us be vague at first and say that the goal of existence is
</I>&gt;<i> goodness (
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8-| , 8D )
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. &quot;definition&quot;:   goodness = happiness  + future generations happiness +
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (animal happiness)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's a translation issue I'm not sure &quot;happiness&quot; is what you
</I>&gt;<i> want to use here.
</I>
With happiness I refer to &quot;subjective well-being&quot; to this collection
<A HREF="https://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/">https://worlddatabaseofhappiness.eur.nl/</A>
As a method of measurement I like smartphone Experince Sampling Method.
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_sampling_method</A>



&gt;<i> There's lots of research in this area that shows
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;happiness&quot; is relatively rare, very hard to measure (all kinds
</I>&gt;<i> of reporting biases),
</I>
I some sense you are right, but I hope this article will calm your worries
<A HREF="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300332706_What_We_Have_Learnt_About_Happiness">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300332706_What_We_Have_Learnt_About_Happiness</A>


&gt;<i> and not generally considered to be a reasonable
</I>&gt;<i> goal.
</I>
True, not a good goal for an individual, the intention of happiness ruins a
lot of happiness ;). But as a measure it should be ok.


&gt;<i> I think we can learn something from the popularity of religions
</I>&gt;<i> here: Do they all promise &quot;happiness&quot;? No, they generally promote
</I>&gt;<i> peace, harmony, and well-being. I'd even put political and economic
</I>&gt;<i> ideals (freedom, power, success, satisfaction of desires, etc.) or
</I>&gt;<i> even simple stress reduction ahead of &quot;happiness&quot; as goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. Happiness is generaly ment individualistically. But if you measure it
</I>for society, it is not the same happiness and it includes a lot from peace,
harmony, well-being, freedom, success, satisfaction.

I'm also increasingly tending to discount &quot;future generations&quot; as an
&gt;<i> issue because it's generally an example of replism
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/matchism-code/">http://www.matchism.org/matchism-code/</A>) and so not a worthy goal in
</I>&gt;<i> itself. People should work to protect the future that *they* will
</I>&gt;<i> have, but worrying about their genetic descendants is at best a waste
</I>&gt;<i> of time and at worst counterproductive because it results in failure
</I>&gt;<i> to solve *today's* problems because you've piled on tomorrow's as
</I>&gt;<i> well.
</I>
Sure, it is not so much important as it seems in the equation. Still it has
some secondary importance, IMHO.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Measuring happiness!: How are you? Answer on a scale from 0-10.
</I>&gt;<i> Happiness
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is measurable!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not counting reporting bias, of course, which is a *huge* problem,
</I>&gt;<i> especially if you want to compare success toward achieving the goal
</I>&gt;<i> across cultures.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>As far as I know there is only a few possible reporting biases.
Misunderstanding question. Forced answer (somebody answering on one's
bahalf). Inability to admit unhappiness, ego issue. But that is not ruining
it, these are acceptable biases.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Now we have a variable that we would like to maximize, but we need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; find some independent variables that maximize it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5. Any data may be useful, but some are more likely to be useful, like
</I>&gt;<i> data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from your smartphone sensors, your selected search results etc. = big
</I>&gt;<i> data
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 6. So, we got dependent variable and independent variables. Now, we need
</I>&gt;<i> a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to intervene. Here comes the mediacentric theory. It is not
</I>&gt;<i> bulletproof,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but it has a power.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7. We need a smaller sector than the whole media to start with. Let's
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the most effective. I suggest it is the Internet and on the Internet
</I>&gt;<i> *search
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; engines*.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8. There is a way how to build Goodness search engine (for marketing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; purposes I call it Happiness Search Engine). Would you like to build it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure I follow this, but it looks to me like it runs right
</I>&gt;<i> smack into the cross-cultural problem above.
</I>

&gt;<i> &gt; I hope you will ask for more. Imagine that I would write it in detail,
</I>&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would read it? :D
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm inclined to consider this issue in the &quot;how many angels can dance
</I>&gt;<i> on the head of a pin&quot; category: We don't need to measure any of these
</I>&gt;<i> things, we just need to empower individuals to make public policy
</I>&gt;<i> decisions.
</I>
No, to do it properly, we do need to measure it :D Not just believe we are
doing it correct :)


&gt;<i> What they choose is what's important, not the label you
</I>&gt;<i> might try to attach to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
What they choose is not the best :/. And there is the voting mehtod issue :/


&gt;<i>   Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>     Scott

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers
