<PRE>The Global Challenges competition finalists and their abstracts and
author bios have been published at:
<A HREF="https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/finalists">https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/the-new-shape-prize/finalists</A>

The only one I found sort of interesting was the one that proposes to
use AI to augment the proposal generation process. You can read more
at the product web site:
<A HREF="http://www.swae.io/">http://www.swae.io/</A>

Of course I think that one too has the wrong end of the stick: Our
main problem isn't with the proposal generation process, it's with the
decisionmaking (voting) process, particularly the unequal
participation rate issue. Exactly none of the entries even address
this, although a couple do use the term &quot;liquid democracy&quot; as if it
were some sort of magic wand (and of course we all know by now that
not only is it not magic, it doesn't even work at all).

A lot of them also seem to violate the &quot;acceptable to the powers that
be&quot; rule that I struggled so much with, but I guess we'll have to read
the full proposals to see how they finesse their way around this.

Anyone think any of these have any chance of even getting implemented,
let alone working as promised?
  Regards,
    Scott
