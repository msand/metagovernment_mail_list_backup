<PRE>Hi, Zohar, and welcome.

Perhaps you can have a little flexibility here? ;) Many of the projects here are very committed to flexibility, but they are also being realistic in their approach: sometimes you need to develop something, and then worry about building it out.

With that said... Michael has not yet mentioned the Crossforum which is built to allow the ultimate flexibility. It allows users to participate (vote, discuss, etc.) where they want, when they want, and it aggregates that participation. You can get an introduction here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>
and note that the black bar at the top of our site is a spinoff of the corssforum: allowing you to migrate between different systems (or it will: at the moment, only Votorola is enabled). Click the tiny triangle in the very upper-left of any page on the site.

As for anonymity, that has been a hotly-debated topic on this forum. There are many reasons for it and many against it. Here's part of a summary:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment</A>

It is my understanding that several of the projects participating here allow anonymity as an option, or at least as something that an admin can hack on/off. (P.S. We've even looked into flexibility of administration itself, though it's a tricky idea: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Distributed_Administration_Network">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Distributed_Administration_Network</A> .)

</I>&gt;<i> There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different goals and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it). Lack of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support, and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting scheme. What I mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real person, it is just unclear who they are. I do not think this would make results less credible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and server admins can choose what voting scheme to use(public private etc). Developers can create new voting schemes that can be added to the system as modules. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type of group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you like to talk on the phone?
