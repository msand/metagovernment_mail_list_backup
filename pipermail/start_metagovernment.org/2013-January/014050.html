<PRE>@Michael Allan


This implies that the people were once in power, then parliaments came
along and took that power away. Or do I misunderstand?

--
Michael Allan


In my view this is indeed a misunderstanding .

Some time ago some Greek people invented and used &#8220;democracy&#8221; (Demos Kratia) for government.
After that &#8220;representative democracy&#8221; was developed while in other countries and states &#8220;direct democracy&#8221; was developed.
Then &#8220;Particracy&#8221; took over the power some decades ago in most of the representative democracies (with one exception to my knowledge, the state of Nebraska)
Particracy is a typical implication of the &#8220;Iron law of olygarchy)

@Pietro,

Your development of the different aims for the voting system when the number of voters increases was very interesting.
But there is something else missing in my view and that is the different level of involvement of people with every &#8220;system&#8221;.

Lets look at an existing system in Switzerland (indirect system of direct democracy because there is still a right for the representative democracy to launch a counter proposal when citizens are launching an initiative)

1. Someone, or a small group of people finds themselves around a specific subject (abolition of the Swiss army)
2. In that group of activists there is discussion of the formulation of the proposal.
3. Once the group activists reach an agreement around the text of the proposal they start gathering signatures in order to prove that there is enough social support for having the right to put the whole population at work.
4. If they can prove enough social support for their proposal (signatures) they can start working to &#8220;sell&#8221; their proposal and try to find a majority when the votes are cast.
5. In this case the proposal was not accepted but had enough support to make politicians worrying for a second attempt and they proposed laws to take the opposition the wind out of their sails. (refuse to bear arms, alternative civil service,..) . There was no referendum raised against those laws and they got in effect.

This system works, as you know, in a lot of states and some countries. (sometimes, as in some states in the US the parliament has no right to propose counter proposals and is therefore a &#8220;direct system of direct democracy&#8221;.

Good, where do we think we can improve this working system. It has a lot of known flaws but most of all we want to improve collaboration of the people and that way try to reach a greater consensus in order to avoid the &#8220;dictatorship of the majority&#8221; criticism without falling in the opposite, the &#8220;dictatorship of the minority&#8221;. 

I did some work in a communal referendum here in Belgium (they are not binding and therefore only informative, the formulation of the proposal can be changed by the politicians, and so on ) about a bridge near Antwerp. <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oosterweelconnection">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oosterweelconnection</A>
I noticed that the &#8220;hard core&#8221; who works for many years on this one subject is not a lot of people. Maybe 20 active members in his peak and this for a city of more than 500.000 citizens. Then there are some people who want to cooperate by internet (blogs, forum,..) and some occasional helping hands.

We succeeded to write a proposal that was in line with general criteria and what we wanted.

Some Criteria: 
- No double barrelled question (we want this and also that)
- No negative formulation (we don&#8217;t want a bridge ) The answer Yes has to give a positive result and NO is a rejection
- Only one interpretation 
- Spontaneous associations
and so on. 

We got 10% of the population of Antwerp behind the proposal (signatures), the referendum was launched and more than 10% of citizens with voting rights voted. The trajectory for the bridge was rejected by the majority. (about 20% of the votes were rejected by the counting officials, the quorum, or threshold of participation, was 10% of the population of Antwerp). 
This was 2009 and the battle between the citizens and politicians and special interests is still going on. The &#8220;active group&#8221; is still active.
This means that we have an intense activity for nearly 5 years now, and as far as I know referenda and initiatives, this is very short yet. 

Suppose now that we use the technology at hand to improve what we can.
What would we do and how to do it if we could start again, all the soft and hardware we can imagine is available.

I think that phase 2 comes in to mind. 
Let us suppose that we can solve the problem of amendments, counter proposals, ranking secret/open voting  and that we invite all the people of Antwerp to develop our referendum proposal (crowd sourcing).

What happens if the &#8220;active group&#8221; finds themselves with a proposition that they don&#8217;t support?  Then this initiative is abandoned. 
The new proposition has to find an active group to start working and campaigning on that new proposal for several years. 

For the moment we think to keep the ultimate right for acceptance of amendments and counter proposals to the &#8220; active group &#8221; who started the idea because this are the people who have to do it. Not those who spend some minutes with launching an idea (it might even be a good idea). There are yearly hundreds of conventions of inventers of good ideas but these are not the people who make or sell them. It needs more.

An other possibility is what we developed while gathering signatures for our proposal. We also asked people willing to sign if they were interested to actively support our work and sometimes they gave their e-mail address. We could not loose more time for more information but this was enough to start with a CiVi CRM system <A HREF="http://civicrm.org/">http://civicrm.org/</A> . 
So there has to be more involved than the possibility to make an amendment or a counter proposal. There has to be also &#8220;active&#8221; support if necessary. A good proposal without active support is worthless. And there is no guarantee that the original active group will put himself behind the &#8220;best&#8221; proposal.
This may result in the starting up of several proposals next to each other and supported by several active groups. This is in se no problem, In Switzerland they had already 3 proposals next to each other about the same issue (water rights). In their system the proposal with the most yes votes wins (if it has a majority of course)

  Do you have any documentation for your project?  Something to help
  folks judge whether they can be of help?

We have not gotten to that point yet. All we have are the minimum requirements for the software which I already sent. 

  Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
  I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have
  a particular design (e.g. your own) that you're already committed to.
  Is that true?

There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different goals and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it). Lack of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support, and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered. 

I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting scheme. What I mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real person, it is just unclear who they are. I do not think this would make results less credible.

But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and server admins can choose what voting scheme to use(public private etc). Developers can create new voting schemes that can be added to the system as modules. 


Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type of group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.


It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you like to talk on the phone?

  Hi Zohar,

  Do you have any documentation for your project?  Something to help
  folks judge whether they can be of help?

  &gt; ... Shockingly i have not been unable to find a single platform hat
  &gt; satisfies my reirements, which I believe are pretty basic. ...

  Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
  I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have
  a particular design (e.g. your own) that you're already commited to.
  Is that true?

  Two other requirements to consider:

    (i) Voting results are actually trusted. (you imply this, but don't
        explictly mention it)
  (ii) Participation is meaningful to the ordinary individual.  It is
        fulfilling, or fun, or otherwise holds his/her attention vs.
        other media, especially rival voting media.

  The design of Votorola satisfies the requirements you mention, plus
  these two above.  But the current implementation isn't quite up to
  speed.  Specifically:

  &gt; - Anonymous as well as non-anonymous voting

  In trusted polls (trust level &gt; 0), anonymous votes are accepted but
  not counted for the default results.  All votes are published however,
  so anyone can tally and post a more inclusive result set.  They can
  use Votorola for this, or another count engine, as they please.

  Private voting is a lower priority for us.  Where it conflicts with
  public voting, we tend to put the development on hold.  For example,
  if anonymous participants were able to sway the results or dominate
  the social interactions, then requirements (i) and (ii) would be
  threatened.  Results would be less credible and participation less
  attractive.  We'd start losing the most motivated users.  They'd
  migrate to social media (including voting media) that better reproduce
  familiar, trusted social interactions.

  &gt; - Verified voters (must verify that a voter exists, has only voted
  &gt; once, and can vote for that election)

  Currently only for public votes.  We have a design sketch for
  verifying private votes, but it's on slow track (per above).

  &gt; - Web and mobile

  Our UI design (Crossforum theatre) allows for it, but we have no
  mobile implementations as yet.

  &gt; - Extremely secure. Designed to be protected from all categories of
  &gt; attacks.

  Only for public votes and results, per above.

  &gt; A system that has the ability to replace parliments and bring power
  &gt; back to the people.

  This implies that the people were once in power, then parliaments came
  along and took that power away.  Or do I misunderstand?
