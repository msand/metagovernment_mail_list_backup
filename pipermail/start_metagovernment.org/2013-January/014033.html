<PRE>Hi Zohar,

Do you have any documentation for your project?  Something to help
folks judge whether they can be of help?

&gt;<i> ... Shockingly i have not been unable to find a single platform hat
</I>&gt;<i> satisfies my reirements, which I believe are pretty basic. ...
</I>
Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have
a particular design (e.g. your own) that you're already commited to.
Is that true?

Two other requirements to consider:

  (i) Voting results are actually trusted. (you imply this, but don't
      explictly mention it)
 (ii) Participation is meaningful to the ordinary individual.  It is
      fulfilling, or fun, or otherwise holds his/her attention vs.
      other media, especially rival voting media.

The design of Votorola satisfies the requirements you mention, plus
these two above.  But the current implementation isn't quite up to
speed.  Specifically:

&gt;<i> - Anonymous as well as non-anonymous voting
</I>
In trusted polls (trust level &gt; 0), anonymous votes are accepted but
not counted for the default results.  All votes are published however,
so anyone can tally and post a more inclusive result set.  They can
use Votorola for this, or another count engine, as they please.

Private voting is a lower priority for us.  Where it conflicts with
public voting, we tend to put the development on hold.  For example,
if anonymous participants were able to sway the results or dominate
the social interactions, then requirements (i) and (ii) would be
threatened.  Results would be less credible and participation less
attractive.  We'd start losing the most motivated users.  They'd
migrate to social media (including voting media) that better reproduce
familiar, trusted social interactions.

&gt;<i> - Verified voters (must verify that a voter exists, has only voted
</I>&gt;<i> once, and can vote for that election)
</I>
Currently only for public votes.  We have a design sketch for
verifying private votes, but it's on slow track (per above).

&gt;<i> - Web and mobile
</I>
Our UI design (Crossforum theatre) allows for it, but we have no
mobile implementations as yet.

&gt;<i> - Extremely secure. Designed to be protected from all categories of
</I>&gt;<i> attacks.
</I>
Only for public votes and results, per above.

&gt;<i> A system that has the ability to replace parliments and bring power
</I>&gt;<i> back to the people.
</I>
This implies that the people were once in power, then parliaments came
along and took that power away.  Or do I misunderstand?

</I>&gt;<i>    - Verified voters (must verify that a voter exists, has only voted once,
</I>&gt;<i>    and can vote for that election)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Support for multiple voting methods such as Schulze and Ranked pairs

</I>&gt;<i>    - Extremely secure. Designed to be protected from all categories of

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; platform. A platform that enables groups as small as co-ops and as large

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; A system where political parties can be created as easily as podcasts.
