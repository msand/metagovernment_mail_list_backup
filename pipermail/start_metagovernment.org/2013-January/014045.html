Many of the projects which participate here, including Votorola, are open source. Are you a programmer, Zohar? Since Votorola seems to match many of your parameters, might I suggest that you join them in their effort? That way, you can help them build it up more quickly and at the same time influence its development in ways that you think a platform should be developed. If at any point you find you differ with their development philosophy, you can fork the project and build your ideal on its foundation.

If instead you decide to start from scratch, please do continue to participate here (you can even turn off digest-mode, since usually our volume is fairly low). This community would be glad to hear how you are developing and to help with any issues you may have. Additionally, if you make your own project, please consider joining into the plugin framework, so that your project can be showcased on the Metagov site. It's free publicity, and a great way for people to try out your system and provide feedback.
