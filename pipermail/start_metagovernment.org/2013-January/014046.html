<PRE>Ed and Pietro,

Pietro, my sketch of a consensus-making practice (bottom) may interest
you.  It relates to scaling and tool mixes.

Ed Pastore said:
&gt;<i> The dial is nice, though of course has scalability issues. I guess
</I>&gt;<i> that's a problem we won't mind having though, right?
</I>
Exactly. :-)

&gt;<i> The switch, the tiny triangle in the upper-left (it used to be
</I>&gt;<i> right, right?), is very important to the interface and very
</I>&gt;<i> difficult to notice. I guess my suggestion would be twofold. First,
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps a brighter color tan grey? Second, in an ideal world, the
</I>&gt;<i> hover text (&quot;Click to show toolset switch&quot;) would appear on page
</I>&gt;<i> load, then fade away or shrink (ie, animated) into the triangle. Ah,
</I>&gt;<i> now that I look back on the thread, I think both these suggestions
</I>&gt;<i> were already brought up by you, no? Are they possible?
</I>
The full banner (Introduction) is initially visible for new users.
The switch is embedded in it.  There's no way to hide the switch
except by switching it to a actual toolset - switch now floats
separately - then explcitly dismissing it.  At *that* point, the
animation carries the switch into the corner triangle.

I'm hoping users will remember that when they need it again.  If not,
we might emphasize the triangle itself, as you say.  Anyway, I've
flagged this thread for when I resume work on it.

&gt;<i> But what I think it needs most is another participating project. Do
</I>&gt;<i> you have one in mind, and what is needed to get them onboard?
</I>
It'll cost them.  I guess they'll be calculating on a return, e.g.
potential users or other contributors.  Maybe when the practice picks
up on site, it'll be more attractive to them.

&gt;<i> On a perhaps-related note, what does anyone think of my proposed
</I>&gt;<i> homepage rework to incorporate the switch?

</I>
Looking back (the switch was only a prototype then), we were still
mooting the graphical design.  I replied here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-November/005209.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2012-November/005209.html</A>
Then we got thinking about the consensus-making practice, which we
never really had a handle on before.

I have a new proposal for the practice.  It isn't documented yet, but
I'll sketch how we might apply it in this case.  We'd first construct
a minimal tree in Votorola, which might look like this: *

    (Ed) (Mi) ...
      \   |
       \  |
        \ |
        (v2) ...
         |
         |
   (c1) (c2) (c3) ...
     \   |   /
      \  |  /
       \ | /
        (v1) ...
         |
         |
         |
        (a1) ...


   (a1) Abstract variation.  A short summary of the plan that
        distinguishes it from other possible plans, plus an
        abstraction disclaimer.  For example, I think you intend
        something roughly like this:

           The homepage introduces Metagovernment by describing its
           typical activities and pointing to instances of them.  (The
           actual composition of the homepage is unspecified here.)

        This will never (as a rule) be made concrete, and never grow
        long.  It may, however, be modified.

Earlier, you said:
&gt;<i> I started thinking about what the Introduction banner should say,
</I>&gt;<i> and I realized I was seeing a lot of redundancy with the proposed
</I>&gt;<i> new homepage text, e.g.:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Ed_Pastore/redesign/draft2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wouldn't it make sense to combine these two?
</I>
Yes, I agree.  So we'd express the gist of it in (v1):

   (v1) Variant.  Minimal (to begin with) description of a proposed
        composition for the plan.  That's just the composition of the
        homepage itself, for now.  Here we fill in the abstract
        &quot;hotspot&quot; from (a1) with something concrete:

           The homepage introduces Metagovernment by describing its
           typical activities and pointing to instances of them.  The
           components are (c1) summary blurb, (c2) showcasing of tools
           and (c3) discussion.

           ==Summary blurb==

           ==Showcasing of tools==

           ==Discussion==

        That's roughly all to begin with.  We deliberately leave the
        details open till we get solid agreement on them.

   (c1), (c2), (c3)  Component pipes.  These have no draft content.
        They are for rationalization and scalability only.

&gt;<i> Here's a rough first draft:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Metagovernment project is developing the public tools and
</I>&gt;<i> practices to enable everyone to have full and meaningful
</I>&gt;<i> participation in governance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Participating projects are showcasing their tools on this site!
</I>&gt;<i> Click the triangle in the very upper-right corner of any page to try
</I>&gt;<i> out different tools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And please join our active discussion in our mailing list. There you
</I>&gt;<i> can provide feedback on these tools, help us develop them and their
</I>&gt;<i> supporting ideas, and/or showcase your own project on this site.
</I>
We'd like some content like that, but we're not allowed to edit (v1)
as we'd please.  It's like the homepage itself, belonging to everyone,
and we're just a small group.  So we create our own variant draft:

   (v2) A variant that you and I (and possibly others) are working on.
        It's the same as (v1), except we can freely add some content.
        But we add the minimum that could *independently* be accepted.
        For example:

           The homepage introduces Metagovernment by describing its
           typical activities and pointing to instances of them.  The
           components are (c1) summary blurb, (c2) showcasing of tools
           and (c3) discussion.

           ==Summary blurb==

           ==Showcasing of tools==

           ''The page content for this component is as follows:''

           Participating projects are showcasing their tools on this
           site!  Click the triangle in the very upper-right corner of
           any page to try out different tools.

           ==Discussion==

You and I (and whoever joins us) would try to make this little bit
agreeable to everyone who's potentially concerned.  (This is where it
might interest Pietro.  I'm reminded of Vilfredo.)  If we succeed,
then our variation will get adopted *throughout* the tree.  Otherwise
it will go nowhere.  In any case, we will eventually move on to work
on other variants.

All layed out this is complex, but two crucial things are easy to
understand in isolation: First, there's a small, formal group of
people (you and I here) in dialogue with a much larger informal
community (Metagov).  We're trying to make an improvement that is
generally acceptable to all.  We ask for opinions and advice.

    anyone else who
   might be concerned        (informal leaves)

         |
         | dialogue
         |

     (Ed) (Mi) ...            (formal)
       \   |                   
        \  |
         \ |
         (v2) ...
          |
          |

Basically that's just your own practice from all these years, with
some formal structure injected beneath.

Second, gross scalability.  The practice scales indefinitely.  The
issue might be a budget for Congress, a world constitution, or just a
homepage.  There might be a single group of formal participants in
dialogue with a community of 100, or 100,000 in dialogue with the
whole world.  No matter, it's the same practice regardless. **


  * The practice in this sketch stems from Thomas's idea of impersonal
    candidates, which we've formalized as &quot;pipe positions&quot; or &quot;pipes&quot;.
    All the nodes in the tree I drew are pipes, except (Ed) and (Mi)
    in the leaves.

  ** Not to say it's the same tools throughout, or even from person to
     person.  I agree with Pietro that we need a mix of different
     tools.  Many tools.
