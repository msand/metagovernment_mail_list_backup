<PRE>Hi Zohar,

maybe Helios ,end to end auditable voting system, can serve as a plug in for secret voting. It is up and running and open source. <A HREF="http://heliosvoting.org/">http://heliosvoting.org/</A>

Regarding spam on the wiki. See <A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6748633/how-to-prevent-mediawiki-spam">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6748633/how-to-prevent-mediawiki-spam</A> 

Mike, 

Votorala seems to be a promising platform. The good documentation is impressive.

  Well, trust declines when information is hidden.  Nothing beats full
  disclosure - all the cards on the table.  Anonymous voting (private
  voting) makes the results *comparatively* less credible.
  More important are the social aspects of voting.  We don't easily
  trust people who hide behind masks.  Leaders will tend to vote in
  public (non-anonymous) and others will tend to follow.  So the bulk of
  initial development resources (which are scarce) must go to public
  voting, or else the users will go to the competition.


I agree with what you say. If you want to focus on public voting that's fine but I think the platform should be built in such a way to eventually allow private voting. Is Votorola built this way?

  Hi Ed,

  &gt; Michael, did I get that right ... ?

  I think only admins can edit that blacklist.  So only they can add
  links just now, and only by fiddling with the blacklist.

  &gt; ... and... any ideas for a less drastic fix?

  A possible stopgap (not a fix): Someone volunteers to help me patrol
  the recent changes at least once a day.  It's tedious and depressing
  work, so this can only be a stopgap.

  (1) A possible longer term fix:
  <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:NotEvil#Cleaned-up_code">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:NotEvil#Cleaned-up_code</A>
    * New and anonymous users cannot post links.
    * There's a new group of &quot;trusted&quot; users.  Only they (and admins and
      such) can post links.
    * Admin adds new users to &quot;trusted&quot; group when they prove themselves
      human, or when they request it.  (So this is not a permanent fix
      if we start to grow.)
  I'd need to test this on the pollwiki first.  If it works as promised,
  then it might enable us to drop some (maybe all?) the other defences.

  (2) Or cooperate with other victims:
  <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Anti-spam_features#Bad_Behavior_and_Project_HoneyPot">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Anti-spam_features#Bad_Behavior_and_Project_HoneyPot</A>
  This looks more difficult to set up, but seems the right way to go.

  (3) If all else fails, we could add a custom hurdle to fool spambots.
  E.g. all edit comments must begin with 'notspam' or some such token,
  which we supply pre-written along with an explanation, then strip away
  internally.  But that's kind of intrusive.

  Should I look into (1) or (2)?

  Mike

  &gt; Sorry, Michael. My RSS feed into my mail client got broken, so I hadn't noticed the posts coming in. It does look like the bots have *really* ramped up recently, eh?

  &gt; 1. go to <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist</A>

  &gt; 2. edit it, and remove the . at the beginning of this line:

  &gt; and save the page.
  &gt;
  &gt; 3. make the edits you want to the page you intend to edit

  I like (3) the most.
  I'd like to write something anonymously without having to register first.
  But I don't have problems with Turing Tests :-)
  Maybe a distorted picture of a word or number i have to type into a box or
  a simple question with an obvious hint that has to be answered... and so
  forth.

  Hi Zohar,

  &gt; ... the platform should be very flexible. This will allow many
  &gt; projects with different goals and requirements to be able to use our
  &gt; platform (and contribute to it). Lack of flexibility seems to be a
  &gt; big problem facing all the current voting projects. This prevents
  &gt; any single project from gaining support, and causes the open-source
  &gt; voting community to remain quite splintered.

  It's quite splintered, I agree.  But I can only repeat that Votorola's
  design meets the requirement of flexibility as you describe it.  There
  must be another reason for the splintering.

  Maybe it's what Ed suggests.  Requirements are one thing, but then you
  have to develop something.  It takes time.

  &gt; I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting
  &gt; scheme. What I mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real
  &gt; person, it is just unclear who they are. I do not think this would
  &gt; make results less credible.

  Well, trust declines when information is hidden.  Nothing beats full
  disclosure - all the cards on the table.  Anonymous voting (private
  voting) makes the results *comparatively* less credible.

  More important are the social aspects of voting.  We don't easily
  trust people who hide behind masks.  Leaders will tend to vote in
  public (non-anonymous) and others will tend to follow.  So the bulk of
  initial development resources (which are scarce) must go to public
  voting, or else the users will go to the competition.

  &gt; But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and
  &gt; server admins can choose what voting scheme to use (public private
  &gt; etc). Developers can create new voting schemes that can be added to
  &gt; the system as modules.

  The design of Votorola supports this, and more.  We don't require that
  voting modules be coded for any particular platform (such as ours, or
  yours).  Instead votes are mirrored across platforms.

  &gt; Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type
  &gt; of group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.

  Yes, our design supports that.

  &gt; It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you
  &gt; like to talk on the phone?

  Thanks Zohar.  You offer to explain the requirements?  I think I
  understand them.  I just wanted to defend our project.

  Mike

  &gt; &gt; Do you have any documentation for your project?  Something to help
  &gt; &gt; folks judge whether they can be of help?
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; We have not gotten to that point yet. All we have are
  &gt; the minimum requirements for the software which I already sent.
  &gt;
  &gt; Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
  &gt; &gt; I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have
  &gt; &gt; a particular design (e.g. your own) that you're already committed to.
  &gt; &gt; Is that true?
  &gt;
  &gt;
  &gt; There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I
  &gt; am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform
  &gt; should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different goals
  &gt; and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it). Lack
  &gt; of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting
