<PRE>I have looked at all the projects on metagov's site as well as a few more
such as civitas &lt;<A HREF="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas/">https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/civitas/</A>&gt;. Shockingly
i have not been unable to find a single platform that satisfies
my requirements, which I believe are pretty basic. See below.

*Uses (what is the platform designed to be used for)

   - Any type of voting from small groups to the worlds population


Requirements

   - Anonymous as well as non-anonymous voting
   - Verifiable voting (users can check their vote counted)
   - Delegated voting (allowing users to subscribe and create parties)
   - Modular (allowing developers and server admins to add or remove
   features)
   - Verified voters (must verify that a voter exists, has only voted once,
   and can vote for that election)
   - Support for multiple voting methods such as Schulze and Ranked pairs
   - Web and mobile
   - Extremely secure. Designed to be protected from all categories of
   attacks.
   - Multi-lingual

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For the sake of mankind we need a secure, scaleable opensource voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; platform. A platform that enables groups as small as co-ops and as large
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as nations to get together and vote on their issues and leaders.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A system where political parties can be created as easily as podcasts.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Where the community can discuss with each other the merits of new
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legistaltion.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A system that has the ability to replace parliments and bring power back
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to the people.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are currently 2 of us dedicated to working on the project. If you
