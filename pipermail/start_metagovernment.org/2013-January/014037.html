I'm still quite preoccupied unfortunately, but can give some feedback.

The dial is nice, though of course has scalability issues. I guess that's a problem we won't mind having though, right?

The switch, the tiny triangle in the upper-left (it used to be right, right?), is very important to the interface and very difficult to notice. I guess my suggestion would be twofold. First, perhaps a brighter color tan grey? Second, in an ideal world, the hover text (&quot;Click to show toolset switch&quot;) would appear on page load, then fade away or shrink (ie, animated) into the triangle. Ah, now that I look back on the thread, I think both these suggestions were already brought up by you, no? Are they possible?

But what I think it needs most is another participating project. Do you have one in mind, and what is needed to get them onboard?

On a perhaps-related note, what does anyone think of my proposed homepage rework to incorporate the switch?
