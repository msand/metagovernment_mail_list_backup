<PRE>Hi Zohar,
I wrote a long message explaining how some requirements contraddicts others.

Let me make here an example:

You ask for Anonimity AND Schultz voting.

But Shultz voting is not anonymous. Shultz voting can never be fully
anonymous. To use Shultz voting users must present an ordered list of all
the options. Ordering them from the one they like more to the one they like
least. This kind of vote, the vote itself, will act as a signature.

Suppose you strike a deal with someone that you will vote for him in
exchange for some favours. Then that person will tell you how you should
vote (the exact sequence). Then he checks in the voting ballot if someone
voted in the exact way he asked. And if that pattern is missing he knows
you did not follow your end of the deal.

The Mafia used to do something like this in the south of Italy. Usually the
deal was vote in exchange for work. Before them the fascist party would do
something similar. Unfortunately the only anonymous type of voting are
usually the simpler ones. The one that are more subject to strategic
voting. I think you should read some good introductory texts on Voting
theory.

Regards,
Pietro
