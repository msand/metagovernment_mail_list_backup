&gt;<i> I wrote a long message explaining how some requirements contraddicts
</I>&gt;<i> others.
</I>

What I mean is that the system should be able to handle many different
types of voting. Not that all types need to be enabled at the same time.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi Zohar,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to add something to all that have been said.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my experience it is unrealistic to expect the same platform to work
</I>&gt;<i> equally well for 7, 70, 700, 7000, 70.000, 700.000, 7.000.000, 70.000.000,
</I>&gt;<i> 700.000.000, 7.000.000.000 people. And I listed explicitly all the scale to
</I>&gt;<i> make a point on how different they are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You go from a group of friends to the whole of humanity. It's not just a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of numbers, the interaction changes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The TYPE of interactions change, what can you do with them changes as well.
</I>&gt;<i> In Vilfredo we analyse the vote of every person, and compare it with the
</I>&gt;<i> vote of every other person, so we join together people that vote in the
</I>&gt;<i> same way. We also use the way a person vote to decide who should be asked
</I>&gt;<i> to rewrite a proposal. This kind of analysis would hardly be possible for
</I>&gt;<i> groups that are too big (and I leave undefined what does &quot;big&quot; mean in this
</I>&gt;<i> context). If you have 70 people you can probably let people write what the
</I>&gt;<i> options are. With 700 or more you must add a filter to avoid two people
</I>&gt;<i> writing the same idea. But people can still rewrite ideas. And so one as
</I>&gt;<i> groups become bigger the kind of interaction that the site will permit will
</I>&gt;<i> either become simpler. Or less universal. What do I mean by less universal?
</I>&gt;<i> In a small group, the site can analyse all the participants vote, and
</I>&gt;<i> organise groups based on this. If you did this on a site the size of
</I>&gt;<i> facebook (maybe based on the &quot;like&quot; vote) you probably would find emerging
</I>&gt;<i> groups to be too big to handle. Then you are forced (as FB does) to simply
</I>&gt;<i> extend the people you know based on your choice. And suddenly the site is
</I>&gt;<i> not universal. Two people can be nearer or farther apart. Their interaction
</I>&gt;<i> is not im-mediate anymore. It is mediate-d. Mediated by all the people that
</I>&gt;<i> are in between them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand if you have 7 billion people (the whole of humanity), you
</I>&gt;<i> probably can easily make a system where everybody can vote. But the issues
</I>&gt;<i> will be very simple. Cultural issues start to raise where people with
</I>&gt;<i> different cultures, different educations will have gross difficulties to
</I>&gt;<i> interact and participate in the same network. And surely will not
</I>&gt;<i> participate with the same power.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now if you take a system that can handle 7 billion people and you use it
</I>&gt;<i> for 7 people you will get an extremely boring and practically useless
</I>&gt;<i> system. You will not use all the magic that can instead be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This regarding the size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Ed, maybe on the list of projects we should add a column that clarifies
</I>&gt;<i> the size of the group it addresses.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is a matter regarding what kind of questions can be asked. Some
</I>&gt;<i> questions are different than others. Some questions require a single
</I>&gt;<i> solution, some other can be solved by multiple solutions. What shall we do
</I>&gt;<i> to fix the economy can have multiple solutions. How shall we build this car
</I>&gt;<i> looks for a single solution (or several, but mutually exclusive).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another issue has to do with the complexity of the answers. The more
</I>&gt;<i> complex the answers are the more technical the people need to be. The
</I>&gt;<i> smaller the group will be. The more you will need to permit to people to
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite proposals (with all the mathematical difficulties involved to make
</I>&gt;<i> this fair).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Systems that can handle simple questions, with multiple answers, that
</I>&gt;<i> cannot be rewritten. That we already have, they call them petitions. And
</I>&gt;<i> they could already handle 7 billion of people. The White House uses one.
</I>&gt;<i> The UK another, and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to let people rewrite proposals you are facing a tough problem.
</I>&gt;<i> Because what shall you do with all the votes that have been already given
</I>&gt;<i> to the previous versions of the proposal? You can ignore them, move them
</I>&gt;<i> over, make the graph of the versions of a proposals, and just keep them for
</I>&gt;<i> the earlier branch, ask everybody to vote again, poll the users and if
</I>&gt;<i> enough people like the new version, move everybody to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is no &quot;right&quot; answer. Each of those approach has some positive and
</I>&gt;<i> some negative elements. And most of those approaches has been used for some
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Of course this is also intimately tied with the size. You can ask
</I>&gt;<i> 7 people to vote again. You cannot do this for 7 billion. And this is why
</I>&gt;<i> the more a project addresses bigger groups, the more it become
</I>&gt;<i> mathematically unfair. Fairness has a cost and the bigger a group the more
</I>&gt;<i> will it cost to keep it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My main projects are Vilfredo (which addresses 5-15 people. We are moving
</I>&gt;<i> to 25) and Bubbling around (adresses thousands of people but with no
</I>&gt;<i> rewriting).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other projects you should consider are Votorola, Mixed Ink, White House 2
</I>&gt;<i> (aka nationbuilder, the one used by Iceland now), and LiquidFeedback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each of those projects, yes also mine, are good in some sense and weak in
</I>&gt;<i> others. And it is often an inherent unavoidable weakness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Writing the &quot;perfect&quot; system is an illusion. But you can write a system
</I>&gt;<i> that is perfect for a specific situation. And then when we have a series of
</I>&gt;<i> systems, each for a very clear, different, situation we can chose which one
</I>&gt;<i> to use depending on the situation we face.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi, Zohar, and welcome.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps you can have a little flexibility here? ;) Many of the projects
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; here are very committed to flexibility, but they are also being realistic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in their approach: sometimes you need to develop *something*, and then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; worry about building it out.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; With that said... Michael has not yet mentioned the Crossforum which is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; built to allow the ultimate flexibility. It allows users to participate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (vote, discuss, etc.) where they want, when they want, and it aggregates
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that participation. You can get an introduction here:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and note that the black bar at the top of our site is a spinoff of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; corssforum: allowing you to migrate between different systems (or it
</I>&gt;<i> will:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the moment, only Votorola is enabled). Click the tiny triangle in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; very upper-left of any page on the site.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As for anonymity, that has been a hotly-debated topic on this forum.
</I>&gt;<i> There
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; are many reasons for it and many against it. Here's part of a summary:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is my understanding that several of the projects participating here
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow anonymity as an option, or at least as something that an admin can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hack on/off. (P.S. We've even looked into flexibility of administration
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; itself, though it's a tricky idea:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Is that true?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different
</I>&gt;<i> goals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it).
</I>&gt;<i> Lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting scheme. What
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real person, it is just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unclear who they are. I do not think this would make results less
</I>&gt;<i> credible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admins can choose what voting scheme to use(public private etc).
</I>&gt;<i> Developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can create new voting schemes that can be added to the system as modules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to talk on the phone?

</I>&gt;<i> anonymous. To use Shultz voting users must present an ordered list of all
</I>&gt;<i> the options. Ordering them from the one they like more to the one they like
</I>&gt;<i> least. This kind of vote, the vote itself, will act as a signature.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Suppose you strike a deal with someone that you will vote for him in
</I>&gt;<i> exchange for some favours. Then that person will tell you how you should
</I>&gt;<i> vote (the exact sequence). Then he checks in the voting ballot if someone
</I>&gt;<i> voted in the exact way he asked. And if that pattern is missing he knows
</I>&gt;<i> you did not follow your end of the deal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Mafia used to do something like this in the south of Italy. Usually the
</I>&gt;<i> deal was vote in exchange for work. Before them the fascist party would do
</I>&gt;<i> something similar. Unfortunately the only anonymous type of voting are
</I>&gt;<i> usually the simpler ones. The one that are more subject to strategic
</I>&gt;<i> voting. I think you should read some good introductory texts on Voting
</I>&gt;<i> theory.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different
</I>&gt;<i> goals
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it).
</I>&gt;<i> Lack
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting scheme. What
</I>&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real person, it is just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unclear who they are. I do not think this would make results less
</I>&gt;<i> credible.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and server
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; admins can choose what voting scheme to use(public private etc).
</I>&gt;<i> Developers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can create new voting schemes that can be added to the system as modules.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to talk on the phone?
