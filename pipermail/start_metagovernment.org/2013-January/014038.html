<PRE>Hi Zohar,

I would like to add something to all that have been said.

In my experience it is unrealistic to expect the same platform to work
equally well for 7, 70, 700, 7000, 70.000, 700.000, 7.000.000, 70.000.000,
700.000.000, 7.000.000.000 people. And I listed explicitly all the scale to
make a point on how different they are.

You go from a group of friends to the whole of humanity. It's not just a
matter of numbers, the interaction changes.

The TYPE of interactions change, what can you do with them changes as well.
In Vilfredo we analyse the vote of every person, and compare it with the
vote of every other person, so we join together people that vote in the
same way. We also use the way a person vote to decide who should be asked
to rewrite a proposal. This kind of analysis would hardly be possible for
groups that are too big (and I leave undefined what does &quot;big&quot; mean in this
context). If you have 70 people you can probably let people write what the
options are. With 700 or more you must add a filter to avoid two people
writing the same idea. But people can still rewrite ideas. And so one as
groups become bigger the kind of interaction that the site will permit will
either become simpler. Or less universal. What do I mean by less universal?
In a small group, the site can analyse all the participants vote, and
organise groups based on this. If you did this on a site the size of
facebook (maybe based on the &quot;like&quot; vote) you probably would find emerging
groups to be too big to handle. Then you are forced (as FB does) to simply
extend the people you know based on your choice. And suddenly the site is
not universal. Two people can be nearer or farther apart. Their interaction
is not im-mediate anymore. It is mediate-d. Mediated by all the people that
are in between them.


On the other hand if you have 7 billion people (the whole of humanity), you
probably can easily make a system where everybody can vote. But the issues
will be very simple. Cultural issues start to raise where people with
different cultures, different educations will have gross difficulties to
interact and participate in the same network. And surely will not
participate with the same power.

Now if you take a system that can handle 7 billion people and you use it
for 7 people you will get an extremely boring and practically useless
system. You will not use all the magic that can instead be used.

This regarding the size.

(Ed, maybe on the list of projects we should add a column that clarifies
the size of the group it addresses.

Then there is a matter regarding what kind of questions can be asked. Some
questions are different than others. Some questions require a single
solution, some other can be solved by multiple solutions. What shall we do
to fix the economy can have multiple solutions. How shall we build this car
looks for a single solution (or several, but mutually exclusive).

Another issue has to do with the complexity of the answers. The more
complex the answers are the more technical the people need to be. The
smaller the group will be. The more you will need to permit to people to
rewrite proposals (with all the mathematical difficulties involved to make
this fair).

Systems that can handle simple questions, with multiple answers, that
cannot be rewritten. That we already have, they call them petitions. And
they could already handle 7 billion of people. The White House uses one.
The UK another, and so on.

If you want to let people rewrite proposals you are facing a tough problem.
Because what shall you do with all the votes that have been already given
to the previous versions of the proposal? You can ignore them, move them
over, make the graph of the versions of a proposals, and just keep them for
the earlier branch, ask everybody to vote again, poll the users and if
enough people like the new version, move everybody to it.

There is no &quot;right&quot; answer. Each of those approach has some positive and
some negative elements. And most of those approaches has been used for some
projects. Of course this is also intimately tied with the size. You can ask
7 people to vote again. You cannot do this for 7 billion. And this is why
the more a project addresses bigger groups, the more it become
mathematically unfair. Fairness has a cost and the bigger a group the more
will it cost to keep it.

My main projects are Vilfredo (which addresses 5-15 people. We are moving
to 25) and Bubbling around (adresses thousands of people but with no
rewriting).

Other projects you should consider are Votorola, Mixed Ink, White House 2
(aka nationbuilder, the one used by Iceland now), and LiquidFeedback.

Each of those projects, yes also mine, are good in some sense and weak in
others. And it is often an inherent unavoidable weakness.

Writing the &quot;perfect&quot; system is an illusion. But you can write a system
that is perfect for a specific situation. And then when we have a series of
systems, each for a very clear, different, situation we can chose which one
to use depending on the situation we face.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps you can have a little flexibility here? ;) Many of the projects
</I>&gt;<i> here are very committed to flexibility, but they are also being realistic
</I>&gt;<i> in their approach: sometimes you need to develop *something*, and then
</I>&gt;<i> worry about building it out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With that said... Michael has not yet mentioned the Crossforum which is
</I>&gt;<i> built to allow the ultimate flexibility. It allows users to participate
</I>&gt;<i> (vote, discuss, etc.) where they want, when they want, and it aggregates
</I>&gt;<i> that participation. You can get an introduction here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Crossforum</A>
</I>&gt;<i> and note that the black bar at the top of our site is a spinoff of the
</I>&gt;<i> corssforum: allowing you to migrate between different systems (or it will:
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment, only Votorola is enabled). Click the tiny triangle in the
</I>&gt;<i> very upper-left of any page on the site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for anonymity, that has been a hotly-debated topic on this forum. There
</I>&gt;<i> are many reasons for it and many against it. Here's part of a summary:

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Anonymous_interactions_within_the_metagovernment</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is my understanding that several of the projects participating here
</I>&gt;<i> allow anonymity as an option, or at least as something that an admin can
</I>&gt;<i> hack on/off. (P.S. We've even looked into flexibility of administration
</I>&gt;<i> itself, though it's a tricky idea:

</I>&gt;<i> There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I

</I>&gt;<i> of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting
</I>&gt;<i> projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support,
</I>&gt;<i> and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting scheme. What I
</I>&gt;<i> mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real person, it is just
</I>&gt;<i> unclear who they are. I do not think this would make results less credible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and server
</I>&gt;<i> admins can choose what voting scheme to use(public private etc). Developers
</I>&gt;<i> can create new voting schemes that can be added to the system as modules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type of
</I>&gt;<i> group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you like
