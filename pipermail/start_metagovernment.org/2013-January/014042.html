<PRE>Hi Zohar,

&gt;<i> ... the platform should be very flexible. This will allow many
</I>&gt;<i> projects with different goals and requirements to be able to use our
</I>&gt;<i> platform (and contribute to it). Lack of flexibility seems to be a
</I>&gt;<i> big problem facing all the current voting projects. This prevents
</I>&gt;<i> any single project from gaining support, and causes the open-source
</I>&gt;<i> voting community to remain quite splintered.
</I>
It's quite splintered, I agree.  But I can only repeat that Votorola's
design meets the requirement of flexibility as you describe it.  There
must be another reason for the splintering.

Maybe it's what Ed suggests.  Requirements are one thing, but then you
have to develop something.  It takes time.

&gt;<i> I don't understand your private/public and anonymous voting
</I>&gt;<i> scheme. What I mean by anonymous is that the voter must be a real
</I>&gt;<i> person, it is just unclear who they are. I do not think this would
</I>&gt;<i> make results less credible.
</I>
Well, trust declines when information is hidden.  Nothing beats full
disclosure - all the cards on the table.  Anonymous voting (private
voting) makes the results *comparatively* less credible.

More important are the social aspects of voting.  We don't easily
trust people who hide behind masks.  Leaders will tend to vote in
public (non-anonymous) and others will tend to follow.  So the bulk of
initial development resources (which are scarce) must go to public
voting, or else the users will go to the competition.
 
&gt;<i> But like I said flexibility is the key. In our design users and
</I>&gt;<i> server admins can choose what voting scheme to use (public private
</I>&gt;<i> etc). Developers can create new voting schemes that can be added to
</I>&gt;<i> the system as modules.
</I>
The design of Votorola supports this, and more.  We don't require that
voting modules be coded for any particular platform (such as ours, or
yours).  Instead votes are mirrored across platforms.

&gt;<i> Verification of voters would also be a module. Depending on the type
</I>&gt;<i> of group voting different verification methods would be appropriate.
</I>
Yes, our design supports that.

&gt;<i> It is a bit difficult to discuss these things over email. Would you
</I>&gt;<i> like to talk on the phone?
</I>
Thanks Zohar.  You offer to explain the requirements?  I think I
understand them.  I just wanted to defend our project.

Mike


Zohar Jackson said:
&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have any documentation for your project?  Something to help
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folks judge whether they can be of help?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have not gotten to that point yet. All we have are
</I>&gt;<i> the minimum requirements for the software which I already sent.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Don't be too hard on us.  We try, but we don't get paid overtime. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess you're in the &quot;requirements gathering&quot; phase.  You don't have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a particular design (e.g. your own) that you're already committed to.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that true?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no specific design that we are committed to. The only thing I
</I>&gt;<i> am committed to(which I stated in the requirements) is that the platform
</I>&gt;<i> should be very flexible. This will allow many projects with different goals
</I>&gt;<i> and requirements to be able to use our platform(and contribute to it). Lack
</I>&gt;<i> of flexibility seems to be a big problem facing all the current voting
</I>&gt;<i> projects. This prevents any single project from gaining support,
</I>&gt;<i> and causes the open-source voting community to remain quite splintered.
