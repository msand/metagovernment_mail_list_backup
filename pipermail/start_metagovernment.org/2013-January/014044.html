</I>
Votorola is modular in its design. People can sign-up just with one of their 
E-Mail addresses and are free to vote and put positions/polls/areas on the 
wiki. Certain polls and plans can be set up to require a certain trust level 
(by users) for the vote-count.
The identity verification is a problem in all anonymous systems structurally. 
Some back-channel needs to be applied to block sock-puppets, as one can see 
for instance in CACert, or by digital id-cards put out by states like Germany 
recently (you need a central identity service then as the state registry has 
always been for anonymous public votes). Votorola's design includes a trust-
network (1) which allows to deal with this issue in a grass-roots way (similar 
to CACert). It is not strictly necessary for such a process to expose user's 
real identities, instead they could be trusted by a local trustee in the 
network if they need to. This person (or some other random voter) can also act 
as a neutral proxy to raise controversial proposals (now as pipe, right 
Mike?). If you can solve the anonymity and sock puppet problem more easily, 
let us know.

A deeper concern with anonymity lies in the fact that coercion can on all 
levels (including education and current zeitgeist) be a problem in the 
process, but it has to be made explicit in the discourse to be dealt with in a 
democratic (integral) part of the process and to constantly deal with its 
effects. People can always be manipulated by real world interests different 
than the ones discussed in the poll even without recognizing it. Exposing 
identity reveals the skews in the poll itself (for instance in anonymous 
votes, is everybody allowed to vote on everything?) and makes its expression 
permanent by rooting it in real social structure.

Our perspective on the process is that people are in control of it constantly, 
involving all simple details of the process, including economics (2). In such 
a concept trust is part of the process and strengthens the electorate's fiber. 
It can be expanded through the amount of contributions and real world 
engagement. It is difficult to cooperate in a completely anonymous constraint 
(for instance are users allowed to expose other anonymous users? what happens 
if they accidentially do so, for example in a social network?). Pseudonyms put 
the power back in the local structure of the process away from the 
administrators of the server and into the hands of those who understand what 
kind of anonymity a local voter needs. An open question is whether similar 
trust can be expanded for pseudonyms over the internet (to avoid sock 
puppets)? My bet is no, since virtual realities when representing the real 
world need to be anchored somewhere to force practical realism.
