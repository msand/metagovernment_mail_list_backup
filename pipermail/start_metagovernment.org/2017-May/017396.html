Hmm: it seems survivalist has a completely different meaning here in
the US. Here a survivalist, often called a &quot;prepper&quot;, is someone
preparing for the end of civilization (guns, bunkers, long-term food
storage, developing hunting and fighting skills, hording gold, etc.)

</I>
&quot;sostenibilism&quot; is another problematic term: There doesn't seem to be
any English equivalent for that, but it seems to translate to being a
proponent of sustainable economics.

But it looks to me like the opposite is happening: The left,
especially in the US, is dying and as I said a few posts ago there are
very few people actively working on new ideas or systems to replace
those that arose out of the civil rights and antiwar movements of the
1960s. Trump's inability to function I think will push the pendulum
back toward that a bit (e.g. Fox News has fallen behind both CNN and
MSNBC for the first time), but overall the movement seems to be toward
nationalism (tribalism) just about everywhere. You may not live to see
the new order, but unfortunately you (we) may all live long enough to
experience the chaos that will lead to it...

    Scott
