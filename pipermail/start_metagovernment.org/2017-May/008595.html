To some extent this seems to me to be mostly a moral question: Is it
worth making changes to your model or somehow misrepresenting it
(e.g., by obscuring or omitting conflicting principles) in order to
&quot;win&quot;, the idea being that the ends (the possibility of a better
society living under your system) justifies the means? I wouldn't rule
this out (it's human nature to do this and there is very little risk
of any sort of backlash), but it's not the route I'm going to take:
I'd rather have them realize the rules they've specified can't produce
a working system and so are just incompetent social engineering in
hopes they'll fix them for the next time they run the competition.

Assuming there is a next time: Based partly on Teo's negativity and my
general disillusionment with the MetaGovernment wiki I've spend a few
hours reviewing the linked projects and do find there is support for
Teo's position: This field is positively littered with failures and
otherwise abandoned projects. Worse, the peak seems to have long since
passed and there are very few new ones being proposed to keep any of
the ideas alive. This is sad in a way, but also good news for those of
us still persisting, especially if we're doing something different
from what's been tried before. In particular I find the obsession with
secret voting and working with existing government systems rather than
proposing to just replace them to be the social engineering equivalent
of volunteering to compete in a boxing match with one arm tied behind
your back.

I therefore plan to attack the GCF-rules issue head on, including a
strong argument about why any system that complies with their rules is
doomed to failure (albeit with millions to blow on the project it may
take 5-10 years for them to realize it) . This probably means I won't
win, but that's one less competitor for you all to worry about ;-) On
the other hand, maybe this is an opportunity: If we *all* complain
about the rules and ignore the one about being compatible with
governments run by dictators, maybe it will give all of us an
advantage over those proposals that restrict themselves to thinking
inside the box...

    Scott
