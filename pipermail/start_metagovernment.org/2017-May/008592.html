<PRE>We need a new word. The definition is something like &quot;The belief,
often implicit, that there is inherent value in behavior that evolved
to facilitate gene transmission&quot;. It's highly correlated with racism,
nationalism, protectionism, imperialism, tribalism, etc. and of course
with conservatism in general. But it also covers beliefs and behaviors
related to child rearing (i.e., children as possessions, inheritance,
high birth rates, etc.) insofar as it's clear that particular beliefs
and behaviors are designed not so much to promote the well-being of
the child or the parent, but merely to facilitate propagation of the
genes for which they are the vehicles (a la Dawkins' The Selfish
Gene): For example, adoption is rare in small-scale societies and in
most animal species because it specifically works *against* the
propagation of one's own genes. The new term would also would cover
acceptance of a large range of anti-social behaviors (discrimination,
violence, lying/cheating/stealing, etc.) that facilitated replication
of one's own genes over those of competitors during EEA.

It's sort of an antonym for humanism and rationalism, but applies at a
lower level (i.e., it applies to the genetics, not culture).
Curiously, there aren't any antonyms listed in the thesaurus for
either of those either, although I'd have listed &quot;barbarism&quot; and maybe
&quot;spiritualism&quot; in that category (What is the opposite of &quot;humanism&quot;?)

I'm aware that there are some Clinations that we will probably choose
to retain (parent/child bonding, expressions of romantic love,
competitiveness in general, etc.) that will be examples of this
concept, but the crucial distinction is that we will *choose* to
retain them rather than keep them merely as a result of some inherent
value we ascribe to them.

So far I've come up with propagism (or propism), replism
(replicationism?), and geneism (or genism), though the latter only
captures half of the meaning. Vestigialism also partially overlaps
with this concept but doesn't really capture the &quot;value&quot; part of it
(and vestigialism is barely a word itself, since there are only about
400 hits on google for it). Any other suggestions or root words we
should look at?
  Regards,
    Scott
