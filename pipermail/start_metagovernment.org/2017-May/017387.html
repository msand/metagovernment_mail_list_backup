Not at all: They fail because they're way too much work. I also don't
believe in NWO/Illuminati/Deep State conspiracies, but I do understand
why people might be confused into thinking that those exist:
Oligarchies *do* exist, as do SDAP behavior patterns. They *are* the
ones with the real power in our societies and so dealing with this
issue has got to be a key component of any proposed new system. DD is
ideally suited solving these problem, though, so as long as we can
build one that doesn't require everyone to spend hours every day doing
public policy, all we really have to do is avoid the pitfalls (like
designing a system that relies on SDAP leadership voluntarily giving
up power).

I look forward to debating again when you've plugged some of the holes
in your proposal...
