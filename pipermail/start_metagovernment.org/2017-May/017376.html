Hi Scott

And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it.

-&gt; I see we are rapidly advancing to the point of insulting each other
I have no interest in taking part to this discussion
Airesis failed as noone is using it today
No government, no major institution
If the goal of a platform is to be used for DD and it is not being used, this is a failure
If you think that Airesis, or proxyforme will be successful in 60 years, good luck with it.
People with problems today need solutions today, not in 60 years
In 60 years or more you will not be here probably nor me
I have now memorized your mail in my agenda
If we will both be here in 2018, I will write you on the 1st of July 2018 a mail
In this mail there will be a question, the question is &quot;why no major institution is using your software&quot;?
You will then claim that the people were bad, the governments were bad, etc etc.
Like every other person does as they do not want to understand why they are failing.
Remember my words.
I have said the same words to Nicola Giulietti in 2011, to Ed and to everybody else
They wasted time and money for nothing
Look at where is Votorola today:  <A HREF="http://reluk.ca/project/votorola/genealogy.xht">http://reluk.ca/project/votorola/genealogy.xht</A>
Look at where is Airesis today
Ask Jacopo Tolja how many times I have told him they were on the wrong path
They did not listen and they had to close the project after having invested years or work and tens of thousands of $
How sad.
And now some of them is blaming the evil govenrment who is allegedly boycotting the project
How sad..
I believe there WILL be soon a DD system that will be widely used, as soon as some one does not daydream like you and the rest of the people
And creates something useful and easy

After that, I have nothing else to say
After all, the time you are wasting is only yours
You are living in the zone, my friend..
Just do not become sad or angry against the world when you will see that your project has failed
