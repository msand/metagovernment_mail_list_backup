I just discovered Mussolini's manifesto, which I hadn't run across
before. Not a great piece of work (maybe a bad translation?) but I
think it is worth dissecting:
<A HREF="http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm">http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm</A>

It certainly fits with your claim of it being anti-humanist, at least
so far as it applies to the cultural/political level. In a sense
fascism is a derivative of replism at least as far as you could claim
that the social and organizational directives of replism that
benefited genes in the EEA still apply in the modern world. That
manifesto even treads into social engineering territory a bit, with a
strong prescription for conditioning to ensure that The People are
properly shaped cogs to be working components in the fascist machine.

Unfortunately it's less useful when you try to apply it to individual
behavior that doesn't directly relate to support for the State. For
example, that manifesto contains strong support for religion
(Catholicism) but primarily as an organizational tool, not as a source
of moral code. To the extent the chosen religion conflicts with the
needs of the State, the religion is the one that would have to change.
To the extent that it's directives don't concern an individual's
relationship to the State, *any* religion would work as an organizing
mechanism. In that sense fascism is agnostic WRT the source of a moral
code that would apply to relationships between people rather than
between the individual and the state.

That manifesto has a lot of confusing, contradictory, and even
provably wrong things in it, though. I had to laugh at this one, for
example, which is a weak (and totally wrong) analysis of what is
sometimes called &quot;group selection theory&quot;:
&quot;The maxim that society exists only for the well-being and freedom of
the individuals composing it does not seem to be in conformity with
nature's plans, which care only for the species and seem ready to
sacrifice the individual.&quot;

I also had to scratch my head at the coining of the term
&quot;authoritarian democracy&quot;, which is possibly an oxymoron but at the
very least is not at all the decisionmaking system he seems to be
proposing: Fascism as he describes it, and as it has always been
implemented, is a form of oligarchy, not democracy.

But back to the main topic: I don't think fascism is the opposite of
humanism. In fact if you read the humanist manifesto, there's only
thing in there that is actually directly contradictory to fascism
(humanism contains a prohibition on violence whereas fascism would
seem to endorse the use of violence against targets outside the
State):
<A HREF="https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/">https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/</A>

This I think says more about the amateur social engineering
foundations of humanism than anything about its relationship to
fascism. It's an exclusive (as opposed to inclusive) philosophy
because it lacks any mention of individual differences (some of which
cause people to have different goals and to exhibit behavior
incompatible with the &quot;rules&quot;), the source or source of control over
individual behavior (i.e. who decides what is &quot;good&quot;, and how, and
what are the consequences of failing to do &quot;good&quot;), any specificity
about the form of government or decisionmaking, or what the Goals of
the People should be, how they should be determined, and what
compromises are allowed in achieving them. Mussolini's fascism at
least takes a stab at all of these things, even though in most cases
it's SDAPs that end up making the decisions to suit themselves (as
&quot;Democratic Authoritarians&quot;, I guess ;-)
