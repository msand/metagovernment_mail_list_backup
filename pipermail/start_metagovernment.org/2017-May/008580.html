On Sun, May 21, 2017 at 1:44 PM, Matteo Martini&lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">teo at teo72.com</A>&gt;  wrote:

Much more complete than the last time I reviewed it. Unfortunately,
now I have a bunch of new criticisms
1) I repeat my criticism of last time that the &quot;listicle&quot; at the
beginning is not only not necessary, but counterproductive. Everybody
already knows how screwed up our current systems are, but
unfortunately they all disagree as to exactly*how*. This
Chomsky-esque list is going to be a huge turnoff for conservatives,
for example, and if you lose them, your entire system loses legitimacy
as a platform suitable for representing*all*  The People.
REPLY)  If people have a problem with *facts* is Their problem, not mine
Everything I have written is the truth and facts are easily checkable in the net

2) The political party requirement is a non-starter IMHO for the same
reason: You can't allow bundling people together who all agree on some
subset of issues because by doing so you're eliminating the majority
of people who don't agree on the &quot;party platform&quot; for those issues.
Again, legitimacy goes away when you do this.
REPLY)  There is no political party requirement

3) I considered and rejected the multiple choice option for individual
issues because there is no practical way to combine votes into
majority opinion in most cases. It fails even in your &quot;death penalty&quot;
example: What is the decision if equal numbers of people choose each
option?
REPLY)  This is a quite stupid objection
Assuming we have hundreds or thousands of votes, how frequently can we have exactly the same number of votes for 2 different options?

4) Of course it also doesn't deal with the SDAP/activert
participation-rate issue, the one issue I believe is the key to
success and the one thing <A HREF="thathttps://www.proxyfor.me/">thathttps://www.proxyfor.me/</A>  handles
properly that no other system that I've heard of does.
REPLY)  Ah, here we go..
You took the time to write a reply to me only as a sneaky way to promote your little system
So sad.
Anyway, I will have a look at it, even if it looks to me as it will never work
Same as the Airesis group, Pietro di Fenizio, the guys of Votorola you seem to be driven by your gigantic ego and looking at the software of your own dreams instead of looking at what people need
And therefore, <A HREF="yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/">yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/</A>  is deemed to fail
I predicted the failure of Votorola and I was right
I predicted the failure of Airesis (just ask Jacopo and Marino) and I was right
I predicted nobody would use Vilfredo and I was right
I now predict that nobody will use <A HREF="yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/">yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/</A>
Too complicated

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
AFAIK.
REPLY)
My delegation system has nothing to do with Liquid Feedback and Liquid Feedback failed for internal strives and not for the delevation system

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong with
proxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with implementing
this proposal[..more self promotion..]
REPLY)
I will work with any software, any one, which is simple and easy to use and I predict will be used by the masses
Your software is just driven by your gigantic ego and will fail
Like Liquid Feedback
Like Airesis
Like Votorola
Like Vilfredo
