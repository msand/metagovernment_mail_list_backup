&gt;<i> We need a new word. The definition is something like &quot;The belief,
</I>&gt;<i> often implicit, that there is inherent value in behavior that evolved
</I>&gt;<i> to facilitate gene transmission&quot;. It's highly correlated with racism,
</I>&gt;<i> nationalism, protectionism, imperialism, tribalism, etc. and of course
</I>&gt;<i> with conservatism in general. But it also covers beliefs and behaviors
</I>&gt;<i> related to child rearing (i.e., children as possessions, inheritance,
</I>&gt;<i> high birth rates, etc.) insofar as it's clear that particular beliefs
</I>&gt;<i> and behaviors are designed not so much to promote the well-being of
</I>&gt;<i> the child or the parent, but merely to facilitate propagation of the
</I>&gt;<i> genes for which they are the vehicles (a la Dawkins' The Selfish
</I>&gt;<i> Gene): For example, adoption is rare in small-scale societies and in
</I>&gt;<i> most animal species because it specifically works *against* the
</I>&gt;<i> propagation of one's own genes. The new term would also would cover
</I>&gt;<i> acceptance of a large range of anti-social behaviors (discrimination,
</I>&gt;<i> violence, lying/cheating/stealing, etc.) that facilitated replication
</I>&gt;<i> of one's own genes over those of competitors during EEA.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's sort of an antonym for humanism and rationalism, but applies at a
</I>&gt;<i> lower level (i.e., it applies to the genetics, not culture).
</I>&gt;<i> Curiously, there aren't any antonyms listed in the thesaurus for
</I>&gt;<i> either of those either, although I'd have listed &quot;barbarism&quot; and maybe
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;spiritualism&quot; in that category (What is the opposite of &quot;humanism&quot;?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm aware that there are some Clinations that we will probably choose
</I>&gt;<i> to retain (parent/child bonding, expressions of romantic love,
</I>&gt;<i> competitiveness in general, etc.) that will be examples of this
</I>&gt;<i> concept, but the crucial distinction is that we will *choose* to
</I>&gt;<i> retain them rather than keep them merely as a result of some inherent
</I>&gt;<i> value we ascribe to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So far I've come up with propagism (or propism), replism
</I>&gt;<i> (replicationism?), and geneism (or genism), though the latter only
</I>&gt;<i> captures half of the meaning. Vestigialism also partially overlaps
</I>&gt;<i> with this concept but doesn't really capture the &quot;value&quot; part of it
</I>&gt;<i> (and vestigialism is barely a word itself, since there are only about
</I>&gt;<i> 400 hits on google for it). Any other suggestions or root words we
</I>&gt;<i> should look at?
</I>&gt;<i>   Regards,
