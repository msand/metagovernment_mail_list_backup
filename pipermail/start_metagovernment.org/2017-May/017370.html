My wife and I were actually talking about this WRT marketing just last
night: The easiest way to get something unfamiliar adopted by people
who don't have the time or inclination to explore is to have a
celebrity endorse it. It's a Clination, to be sure, but in my opinion
as a social engineer one that we should be actively working to
suppress (in my experience celebrities model bad behavior more often
than good, and many of them are just manipulating psychopaths). That
said, I'm inclined to use &quot;the ends justifies the means&quot; rule,
particularly since the &quot;means&quot; are techniques that people are already
being manipulated by on a vast scale (i.e., advertising) and so one
more instance can't do them any significant additional harm...
  Regards,
    Scott
