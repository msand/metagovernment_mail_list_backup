Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.

</I>
Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his &quot;Death Penalty&quot;
example. The only reason techniques like that *appear* to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at &quot;representing&quot; us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.

&gt;<i> Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt

</I>&gt;<i> my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative proposal

</I>&gt;<i> There is not a single &quot;way&quot; to address world problem and IMHO there will

</I>
Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what *doesn't* work in the
various projects as we gain by &quot;borrowing&quot; the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.
