Much more complete than the last time I reviewed it. Unfortunately,
now I have a bunch of new criticisms ;-)
1) I repeat my criticism of last time that the &quot;listicle&quot; at the
beginning is not only not necessary, but counterproductive. Everybody
already knows how screwed up our current systems are, but
unfortunately they all disagree as to exactly *how*. This
Chomsky-esque list is going to be a huge turnoff for conservatives,
for example, and if you lose them, your entire system loses legitimacy
as a platform suitable for representing *all* The People.

2) The political party requirement is a non-starter IMHO for the same
reason: You can't allow bundling people together who all agree on some
subset of issues because by doing so you're eliminating the majority
of people who don't agree on the &quot;party platform&quot; for those issues.
Again, legitimacy goes away when you do this.

3) I considered and rejected the multiple choice option for individual
issues because there is no practical way to combine votes into
majority opinion in most cases. It fails even in your &quot;death penalty&quot;
example: What is the decision if equal numbers of people choose each
option?

4) Of course it also doesn't deal with the SDAP/activert
participation-rate issue, the one issue I believe is the key to
success and the one thing that <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A> handles
properly that no other system that I've heard of does.

5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
(i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
AFAIK.

I'd therefore recommend you follow your own suggestion WRT
collaboration and figure out what, if anything, is wrong with
proxyfor.me and help fix that instead of proceeding with implementing
this proposal. The &quot;real world&quot; has kept me very busy the past few
weeks and so I haven't had time to do much work on the next phase of
proxyfor.me: marketing (the technical parts all seem to be working
well, and with pleasingly low CPU and bandwidth requirements). But
things look to be opening up for me in a couple/few weeks and I look
forward to getting any suggestions any of you may have as to how to
get people to start signing up and using this new system.
  Regards,
    Scott
