At least in theory what they're funding is actual
development/deployment rather than handwaving, the specialty of the
Next System Project. But I'm having a little trouble conceiving of a
system that would meet their criteria, the sticking point being that
the system has to work with dictators as major participants (because
they rule out changing local decisionmaking as part of the process).
This always leads me back to coercive techniques, something that as a
social engineer I generally reject as being ineffective in the long
term because they create large incentives to invest in ways of gaming
the system. As such I'm starting to consider the Global Challenges
Prize as an exercise in developing barn-door-closing mechanisms that
work after the horse has already bolted.
