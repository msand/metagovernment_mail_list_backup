<PRE>The source code for proxyfor.me has been released:
<A HREF="https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me">https://github.com/metamerman/proxyfor.me</A>

Installation instructions included, and should be more complete than
anything else I've downloaded from GitHub: Most of those projects seem
to go out of their way to make actually building the packages obscure
and error prone, as if wasting a couple of hours on config issues is
some sort of test to assess whether or not you're actually worthy of
contributing. Proxyfor.me should only take half an hour for a novice
to set up the environment to build and run it, half that if you've
done that kind of thing before or already have some of the tools
installed.

For this group's purposes (validating matches and voting) the
interesting stuff is probably all at the top of db.ts. It's written in
TypeScript but because all my professional experience has been as a
C/C++ programmer it probably mostly looks like that and so should be
readable by anyone who knows those or any derivative language. You've
probably got to be a pretty hard-core MEAN stack programmer to
understand most of the rest of it, though.

Let me know if I've missed anything.
  Regards,
     Scott
