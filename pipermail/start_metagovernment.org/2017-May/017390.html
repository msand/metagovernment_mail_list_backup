There is something related to this in there, but
individualism/collectivism I tend to see as an orthogonal dimension to
what I'm talking about. What I'm trying to get at is the acceptable
*sources* of behavior, not its ultimate benefactor:

spiritualism/deism: you're supposed to abdicate control to god/fate

humanism: decisions should be made based on rationality but the
philosophy also relies on some sort of innate goodness

replism: it's OK to go with what your genes tell you to do

Replism is definitely not the same as individualism because protection
of the group and even sacrifice for the group is a common outcome
(tribalism). And humanism is not necessarily incompatible with
individualism either: individual achievement is certainly encouraged
by most humanists.

Spiritualism/deism is only selectively incompatible with replism with
rules coming from prophets and other amateur social engineers about
which replism-derived behaviors must be suppressed. The problem being
that those amateur social engineers are usually more concerned with
preserving their own power than in what's best for The People overall
and so they let things like replism-based tribalism run free and even
encourage it in many cases.

Humanism and replism are also only partially incompatible because
replism assumes these innate sources are naturally good whereas
humanism would at least impose some constraints based on rational
decisionmaking on them. Most Humanists do seem to assume that most of
these innate behaviors are &quot;good&quot;, though, mostly I think because
humanists are just another variety of amateur social engineers and so
don't even consider all the ramifications of allowing each Clination
to be expressed unimpeded.

Matchism would therefore be classified between spiritualism/deism and
humanism: It takes from the former a definite concept that &quot;good&quot; is
to be defined independently of instinctive behavior and enforced by
establishing a set of rules (laws and policies) that people must
follow. It takes from the latter that the rules should be derived from
rational analysis (albeit collective rational analysis) rather than
the proclamations of amateur social engineer religious leaders.
Matchism doesn't make the assumption of innate goodness that humanism
(and even deism to some extent) relies on: Everything is subject to
negotiation depending on the environmental and technological
conditions under which the decisions will be made. It is therefore the
only philosophy that fully rejects the &quot;innate good&quot; aspect of
replism.

I think this means I'm settling on &quot;replism&quot; as the name for this
concept. What does &quot;replism&quot; mean to you?
  Regards,
    Scott
