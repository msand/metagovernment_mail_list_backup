<PRE>Apologies to the list: The formatting of his message was all screwed
up and I missed his using &quot;REPLY&quot; as a marker. I'll try again.

</I>&gt;<i> 1) I repeat my criticism of last time that the &quot;listicle&quot; at the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning is not only not necessary, but counterproductive. Everybody
</I>&gt;<i> already knows how screwed up our current systems are, but
</I>&gt;<i> unfortunately they all disagree as to exactly *how*. This
</I>&gt;<i> Chomsky-esque list is going to be a huge turnoff for conservatives,
</I>&gt;<i> for example, and if you lose them, your entire system loses legitimacy

</I>&gt;<i> REPLY)  If people have a problem with *facts* is Their problem, not mine
</I>&gt;<i> Everything I have written is the truth and facts are easily checkable in the
</I>&gt;<i> net
</I>
Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin.

&gt;<i> 2) The political party requirement is a non-starter IMHO for the same
</I>&gt;<i> reason: You can't allow bundling people together who all agree on some
</I>&gt;<i> subset of issues because by doing so you're eliminating the majority
</I>&gt;<i> of people who don't agree on the &quot;party platform&quot; for those issues.
</I>&gt;<i> Again, legitimacy goes away when you do this.
</I>&gt;<i> REPLY)  There is no political party requirement
</I>
Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
Did you even write this thing?

&gt;<i> 3) I considered and rejected the multiple choice option for individual
</I>&gt;<i> issues because there is no practical way to combine votes into
</I>&gt;<i> majority opinion in most cases. It fails even in your &quot;death penalty&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> example: What is the decision if equal numbers of people choose each
</I>&gt;<i> option?
</I>&gt;<i> REPLY)  This is a quite stupid objection
</I>&gt;<i> Assuming we have hundreds or thousands of votes, how frequently can we have
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same number of votes for 2 different options?
</I>
You missed the point: Your death penalty example (#15) has 7 possible
responses. How do you combine votes for each of them to reach a
decision?

&gt;<i> 4) Of course it also doesn't deal with the SDAP/activert
</I>&gt;<i> participation-rate issue, the one issue I believe is the key to
</I>&gt;<i> success and the one thing that <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A> handles
</I>&gt;<i> properly that no other system that I've heard of does.
</I>&gt;<i> REPLY)  Ah, here we go..
</I>&gt;<i> You took the time to write a reply to me only as a sneaky way to promote
</I>&gt;<i> your little system
</I>
No, but given that mine came before yours you should at least be
familiar with it before spouting off. Clearly you're not.

&gt;<i> So sad.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I will have a look at it, even if it looks to me as it will never
</I>&gt;<i> work
</I>&gt;<i> Same as the Airesis group, Pietro di Fenizio, the guys of Votorola you seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be driven by your gigantic ego and looking at the software of your own
</I>&gt;<i> dreams instead of looking at what people need.
</I>
I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable
with turning control over to the People. Until you get rid of the
screed that makes up the first half of your proposal it appears to be
more about how to manipulate them into achieving the outcomes *you*
specify.

&gt;<i> And therefore, your <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A> is deemed to fail
</I>&gt;<i> I predicted the failure of Votorola and I was right
</I>&gt;<i> I predicted the failure of Airesis (just ask Jacopo and Marino) and I was
</I>&gt;<i> right
</I>&gt;<i> I predicted nobody would use Vilfredo and I was right
</I>&gt;<i> I now predict that nobody will use your <A HREF="https://www.proxyfor.me/">https://www.proxyfor.me/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Too complicated
</I>
Says the guy who hasn't invested even a few minutes to understand how
it works...

&gt;<i> 5) Your delegation system can't work any better than the Liquid
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback system which the data clearly showed failed miserably to
</I>&gt;<i> properly represent the people. Again, only the proxyfor.me design
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e., automatic delegate/proxy assignment) can reliably do this
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK.
</I>&gt;<i> REPLY)
</I>&gt;<i> My delegation system has nothing to do with Liquid Feedback and Liquid
</I>&gt;<i> Feedback failed for internal strives and not for the delevation system
</I>
I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
*didn't* work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the
system. If a system really does manage to capture The Will of The
People no amount of conflict in the SDAP leadership of the movement
will be able to stop it.

    Scott
