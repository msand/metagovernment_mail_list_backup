</I>
It's a good list of proximate problems, and at least doesn't include
handwaving about things like &quot;income inequality&quot; or other red
herrings. Of course I also believe that he's missed the true
underlying cause, and you see it in his repeated expressions of
deference to &quot;politicians&quot; and &quot;leaders&quot;. It's ironic, and a little
surprising that he cites Einstein at the start of Chapter 6: &#8220;We can&#8217;t
solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
created them&quot; and yet blindly plows on assuming the next system will
be structured almost exactly the same as our current system with a
hierarchy of politicians who we will have to trust to make decisions
for us...

&gt;<i> He published his book for free online, and the very style of it suggests to
</I>&gt;<i> me he's a man trying to leave a legacy his descendants can respect. It's not
</I>&gt;<i> 'intellectualist' or elite at all, he basically squeezed a lifetime of UN
</I>&gt;<i> analysis into a roughly 100 page book about the scientifically-established
</I>&gt;<i> threats to humanity, written in plain English.
</I>
Certainly props due for the attempt, but is publishing this paper
really part of the process of solving any of the problems discussed in
it? I.e., is the problem simply that we don't know these things, or is
it really that we have no decisionmaking system capable of actually
dealing with any of them?

&gt;<i> He does mention one of the problems as an excess in state sovereignty, and
</I>&gt;<i> openly proposes globalism, but only because he sees self-interest as a
</I>&gt;<i> threat to world peace.
</I>
True, but he also specifically rules out any changes to existing
political boundaries because &quot;This is impractical because there are
simply too many and too
great differences among nations&#8217; languages, cultures, economies and
political systems.&quot; Which IMHO is factually inaccurate (what is the
EU, chopped liver?!?). It's also a recipe for failure, something he
later even directly acknowledges:

&quot;Leaders of undemocratic nations, who place
their own personal interests above those of their people, would
naturally be on the list of losers. That list would also include
politicians who strive for special positions of power, for their
nations or themselves.&quot;

Which is a fatal flaw in his proposal: Does he actually expect
dictators and other authoritarian states to volunteer to become
&quot;losers&quot;? If not, then the entire proposal is unworkable because it
*requires* this to happen, and yet &quot;voluntarily&quot; (no wars, no defense
budgets, etc.)

&gt;<i>  And he's very open about that. I personally agree we
</I>&gt;<i> should have a few strong international agreements in place to ensure
</I>&gt;<i> countries can take responsible measures without seeing their businesses just
</I>&gt;<i> move to shittier countries so they can abuse people and pollute out there.
</I>
But will international agreements written and then approved by
politicians have any chance of achieving this? We The People I think
could do this, but IMHO we'll have to do it ourselves.

&gt;<i> I think it's a good read, here's a link to it if anyone wants.
</I>
I agree it's worth reading, especially if you plan to enter the
competition. But I also think it's important to understand that there
are large loopholes and unsupported assumptions, some of which are
even unstated, in the paper that you'll have to deal with (or exploit,
depending on your requirements ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>  As always let me know if you see any bugs but also remember I only wanna
</I>&gt;<i> hear it if it's credible. No Illuminati shit for me : )
</I>
That there are missing bits is understandable given that's it's
primarily intended as a call to action rather than as a specific
social engineering design. The latter is our job to provide ;-)
