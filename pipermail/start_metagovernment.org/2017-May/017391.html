<PRE>Science fiction is often useful.

In one story, we did not be allowed to be &quot;wild humans&quot; (since we had
pretty much killed ourselves)

In another all rhe original style humans were kept in a planet sized zoo
and left not quite unsupervized.  I think we would call them heirloom
humans.  Not very nice but the winners really really knew they were the
best most flexible smartness most rurhless and unbeatable and also  knew
that just maybe they were wrong.

In any case I think you are ignoring data that human evolution has speeded
up at when we became civilized.  Even without GMO humans and without
considering lamarcism influences, the selection pressure is intense.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We need a new word. The definition is something like &quot;The belief,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often implicit, that there is inherent value in behavior that evolved
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to facilitate gene transmission&quot;. It's highly correlated with racism,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nationalism, protectionism, imperialism, tribalism, etc. and of course
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with conservatism in general. But it also covers beliefs and behaviors
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> related to child rearing (i.e., children as possessions, inheritance,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> high birth rates, etc.) insofar as it's clear that particular beliefs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and behaviors are designed not so much to promote the well-being of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the child or the parent, but merely to facilitate propagation of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> genes for which they are the vehicles (a la Dawkins' The Selfish
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Gene): For example, adoption is rare in small-scale societies and in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> most animal species because it specifically works *against* the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> propagation of one's own genes. The new term would also would cover
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceptance of a large range of anti-social behaviors (discrimination,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> violence, lying/cheating/stealing, etc.) that facilitated replication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of one's own genes over those of competitors during EEA.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's sort of an antonym for humanism and rationalism, but applies at a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lower level (i.e., it applies to the genetics, not culture).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Curiously, there aren't any antonyms listed in the thesaurus for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either of those either, although I'd have listed &quot;barbarism&quot; and maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;spiritualism&quot; in that category (What is the opposite of &quot;humanism&quot;?)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm aware that there are some Clinations that we will probably choose
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to retain (parent/child bonding, expressions of romantic love,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> competitiveness in general, etc.) that will be examples of this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept, but the crucial distinction is that we will *choose* to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> retain them rather than keep them merely as a result of some inherent
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value we ascribe to them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So far I've come up with propagism (or propism), replism
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (replicationism?), and geneism (or genism), though the latter only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> captures half of the meaning. Vestigialism also partially overlaps
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with this concept but doesn't really capture the &quot;value&quot; part of it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and vestigialism is barely a word itself, since there are only about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 400 hits on google for it). Any other suggestions or root words we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should look at?
