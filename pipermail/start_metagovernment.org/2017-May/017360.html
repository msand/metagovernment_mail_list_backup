<PRE>I definitely hear what you're both saying about hardship, it's one hell of
a double edged sword isn't it?


 I get a good feeling about this Lazslow guy. He saw what ethnic violence
looks like as a kid when he had to flee his own country, and through his
experience in business has seen how necessary this kind of work really is.

He published his book for free online, and the very style of it suggests to
me he's a man trying to leave a legacy his descendants can respect. It's
not 'intellectualist' or elite at all, he basically squeezed a lifetime of
UN analysis into a roughly 100 page book about the
scientifically-established threats to humanity, written in plain English.

He does mention one of the problems as an excess in state sovereignty, and
openly proposes globalism, but only because he sees self-interest as a
threat to world peace. And he's very open about that. I personally agree we
should have a few strong international agreements in place to ensure
countries can take responsible measures without seeing their businesses
just move to shittier countries so they can abuse people and pollute out
there.

I think it's a good read, here's a link to it if anyone wants.

 As always let me know if you see any bugs but also remember I only wanna
hear it if it's credible. No Illuminati shit for me : )

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Looks like hardship always brings out the best from humans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sure, but it also brings out the psychopaths: Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and
</I>&gt;<i> Pol Pot *all* came to power exactly because the people were
</I>&gt;<i> experiencing severe resource deprivation and so were inspired to
</I>&gt;<i> revolution. Taking this as a lesson will only result in you creating a
</I>&gt;<i> system that psychopaths will use to exploit The People. For example,
</I>&gt;<i> you can learn a lot more about &quot;cooperatives&quot; by studying how the
</I>&gt;<i> Soviets and the Asian communists figured out how to exploit them than
</I>&gt;<i> by studying some fresh new example that only hasn't had time to
</I>&gt;<i> promote a psychopath that has figured out how to game that particular
</I>&gt;<i> system.
