<PRE>Finally got around to reading the winning essays. What a complete load
of horse shit! No wonder my entry didn't win: These essays are look
just like word-blended versions of all the stuff they've already
published. No real insight into *why* and *how* our current systems
fail to work (nothing on decisionmaking *at all* in *any* of the
winners!) and countless examples of amateur social engineering
(although to be fair the ratio of handwaving to actual social
engineering is at least 10 to 1). It's just sad.

And to make matters worse, their whole setup seems *designed* to
prevent criticism or debate on any of the articles: There's no
comments section, no forum, no mailing list, none of the authors
include their email addresses in their articles, and none of their
websites have &quot;contact&quot; links. So I've taken the opportunity to create
a forum for them and posted my criticism of the &quot;big&quot; winner (first
place in the unrestricted category) there:
<A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=15">http://www.matchism.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=15</A>

I can't say I'm recommending wasting time reading the original article
because I'm sure you'll learn exactly nothing useful from it, but
maybe it's worth doing merely as exercise in criticism and
competition...
  Regards,
    Scott
