Yeah, right: A &quot;revolution&quot; that's a few years old and which governs a
population the size of a small city is a shining beacon? I think you
would be far better served studying how the soviet system, which
started out a lot like Rojava, eventually failed when the SDAPs
transitioned it to totalitarianism. &quot;libertarian municipalism&quot; is just
another variant of the same kind of amateur social engineering we've
seen repeatedly fail: You either understand how psychopaths create and
control hierarchies or you repeat the mistakes of the past.

&gt;<i> Looks like hardship always brings out the best from humans.
</I>
Sure, but it also brings out the psychopaths: Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and
Pol Pot *all* came to power exactly because the people were
experiencing severe resource deprivation and so were inspired to
revolution. Taking this as a lesson will only result in you creating a
system that psychopaths will use to exploit The People. For example,
you can learn a lot more about &quot;cooperatives&quot; by studying how the
Soviets and the Asian communists figured out how to exploit them than
by studying some fresh new example that only hasn't had time to
promote a psychopath that has figured out how to game that particular
system.
