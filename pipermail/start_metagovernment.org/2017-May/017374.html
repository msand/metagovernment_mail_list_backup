<PRE>
Hi all,

thank you for your answers, despite I see many people disagreeing with 
me here

The newsletter system is not, IMHO, the best system to work with as it 
is quite difficult to quote someone in a clear and easy way

This said, I will reply in one mail to criticisms by both Jacopo and Scott

1)

Spoken as someone who has an agenda *other* than implementing
democracy: Your statements may indeed be factual (though I suspect
that most contain at least exaggerations if not outright falsehoods),
but again make it clear that your agenda is reigning in the US and
other superpowers, not doing anything for The People. They're just
tools for you to use in achieving your goals. This is exactly the kind
of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin. (by Scott)
=&gt;  My statements are factual and you can check any of them in Wikipedia.
I have no agenda reigning in anyone. I just stated facts.
I criticized mostly the US and the West as, IMHO, they are the richest and most powerful people on the planet so they have the moral duty to behave well.
Islamic terrorists and crimes by Russians and Chinese have also be pointed out when they commit crimes
Telling me that the desire to pointing out war crimes and to promote direct democracy is the kind of thinking that brought us Mao and Stalin is an utterly moronic statement
In fact, one of the most moronic statements I have heard in my life (and I have heard many of them)

2)
This is a textbook example of an ad-hominem attack: If you lack the
facts or intellectual chops to criticize a proposal, criticize the
person who promotes it.
And I note that you didn't respond to any of the specific criticisms:
*That*  is the real recipe for failure.  (by Scott)

=&gt;  I criticized the proposals for one single reason: they failed
Airesis failed. This is a fact. Nobody really uses Airesis today. It 
failed, Simple as that. Money, time and resources all wasted, so far.
Vilfredo failed. Same reason above
Am I attacking someone by saying the facts? I do not think so.
I also replied to your criticisms for as much as I could

3)

Really, I'm doing him a huge favor: Taking the time to read and find
the flaws (and pointing out how some other system doesn't have them)
is the best way to help the creator make it better. IMHO the cruelest
thing is to allow people to continue to waste time on something that
you can easily find the flaws in that they seem to be blind to.
(by Scott)
-&gt;  Thank you for the favour, but let me ask you..
If you know the flaws of the systems well, why have not you promoted a successful direct democracy system so far?
You have been here much longer than me, and you are talking with many people.
More than me.
If you are so smart to find the flaws in my system, can you please tell me how many governments and/or organizations are using <A HREF="yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/?">yourhttps://www.proxyfor.me/?</A>
Your system is already online, the one I am proposing is just an idea.
So there should be already tens if not hundreds of governments interested in working with you today.
Can you tell me who they are?
Since you are talking and discussing with Jacopo, Pietro and others, and they too have been promoting DD systems for years, could you tell me who is using any of their systems?
Airesis took years and the work of many many people to be brought to life. How many people are using it in the government today?
I have been hearing about Vilfredo for years. Same question

4)
Yeah, and it's not about frequency anyway: There's just no way to do
Condorcet-type combinations on things like his &quot;Death Penalty&quot;
example. The only reason techniques like that*appear*  to work when
choosing representatives is because misrepresentative government is so
bad at &quot;representing&quot; us that we consider even getting it marginally
better a big improvement.  (by Scott)

-&gt;  I am looking for marginally better improvements.
There are usually the ones which work.
I would not ask Pietro and Jacopo and you for designing the best system that solves ALL the problems in the world as you have all tried to do so
And failed
And you have yet to understand this simple point, apparently.
So I set the bar for any system a little bit lower
As I do not like failures

5)
Agreed, and we learn as much from seeing what*doesn't*  work in the
various projects as we gain by &quot;borrowing&quot; the best parts. That paper
describing the failure of the LQFB delegation system I consider to be
the single greatest influence in my conception of how direct democracy
can be implemented.  (by Scott)

-&gt;  You are talking about your own system again here.
Fine with that.
How many people are using it today?
Millions? Not yet?
Thousands? Not yet?
Hundreds? Not yet?
I hereby officially predict how many people will be using your system one, five and ten years from now.
Reply: Zero
Why I say so?
As it is too complicated and too unnecessarily complicated
People will never use it

6)
Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
Did you even write this thing?
(by Scott)

-&gt; I also wrote that a political party may not be needed at the beginning

7)
You missed the point: Your death penalty example (#15) has 7 possible
responses. How do you combine votes for each of them to reach a
decision?
(by Scott)

-&gt;  You do not
You just take the two responses who got the largest number of votes and have a vote on those two
Simple as that.
Got the word?
Simple

8)
No, but given that mine came before yours you should at least be
familiar with it before spouting off. Clearly you're not.
(by Scott)
-&gt;  I started this thread speaking about a proposed system which is not yours and you used the replies in this thread to write the URL of your system quite a few times so far
Fine with that, I am not jealous
Now, let me ask you
Since as you have pointed out you have been here longer than me, please tell me how many governments/organizations are using your software (which is already in beta stage) now.
Or even consider doing it
Is it 1000?
Is it 100?
Is it 10?
Is it 1?
Is it noone?

9)
I submit you have it exactly backwards: At least we're comfortable
with turning control over to the People. Until you get rid of the
screed that makes up the first half of your proposal it appears to be
more about how to manipulate them into achieving the outcomes*you*
specify.
(by Scott)
-&gt; I just stated facts
Plain facts and the reasons why I believe it is important to be engaged with DD
If people do not like facts, this is their problem
Not mine

10)
Says the guy who hasn't invested even a few minutes to understand how
it works...
(by Scott)
-&gt;  Slowly but surely you are getting there
I DO NOT want to invest more than 5 minutes to read your proposal as PEOPLE will not spend more than 5 minutes to read your proposal
Why is it so difficult to understand?
People in general are not ego-driven guys who are looking to have the best system in the world
They just need something simple which works
This is why your complicated system will fail
Same as Airesis
Same as Vilfredo
Same as Votorola
Same as LQFB

11)
I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
*didn't*  work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the
system. If a system really does manage to capture The Will of The
People no amount of conflict in the SDAP leadership of the movement
will be able to stop it.
(by Scott)
-&gt; This is your opinion. I respect but disagree with it.
At least we can agree that LQFB failed. As Airesis and as Vilfredo

12)
Matteo this kind of answer really turn me off, because it is not in any way
educate to address other opinion as stupid or criticize someone to promote
their own project.
(by Jacopo)
  -&gt;  Well, I always prefer to be honest and straightforward than to be false.
We discussed this before with you, I think. And I did not call anyone as stupid here

13)  Objection to the statement &quot;how frequently&quot;. It is probably  not frequent
that someone win the lottery but sure someone do.
(by Jacopo)
  -&gt;  True
But you do not take a huge loan on the grounds that one day you may win the lottery and pay it off, right?
And exceptions like having two proposals with the exact number of votes can always be handled somehow
Right?

14)
Now let me tell you that if you consider proxyfor.me too complicate i doubt
in your intelligence, so far the proxy vote that the system have given
match my vote so I see it as a promising addendum to a collaborative
proposal making software.
(by Jacopo)
-&gt;  Please be welcome and doubt of my intelligence!! :)
Along with the intelligence of 100% of the world population who is not using proxyforme and never will


15)  In the same way I see Vilfredo as potential
method for collaborative paragraph editing of a proposal making software.
(by Jacopo)
-&gt;  And I see Vilfredo as a total failure.
Nobody is using it.
Nobody is using a system derivative from Vilfredo to govern
The only thing Vilfredo may have been useful for is for Pietro to have his name in some trendy journal article

16)  Voting multiple choice is not considered in proxyfor.me so far so the
voting in Airesis can be used where this may be necessary.
There is not a single &quot;way&quot; to address world problem and IMHO there will
never be one, but a network of interlaced and integrated intelligent
methods is the answer.
(by Jacopo)
  
-&gt;  Airesis failed so far and will never be used
Why then even mention it?
Do you remember how many times, when we had those calls at night, I told you airesis was too complicated and would never work?
Do you remember that?
Do you remember when I told this to Alessandro and he replied to me that there were thousands of users and hundreds of organizations working on Airesis so far?
Where are they now?
I first told Nicola giulietti they had to make a simple system back in 2011
He did not listen to me
you did nor listen
You failed
Are not you unhappy to have spent so much money and time and then got out with nothing?
