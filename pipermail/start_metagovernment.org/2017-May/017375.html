That's a problem with your mail program, not email lists in general.
Most email programs, including gmail and all popular UNIX mail
programs, do quotes as above (with &gt; signs, one per level of quoting).

&gt;<i> This said, I will reply in one mail to criticisms by both Jacopo and Scott
</I>
Yeah, that's a bad idea too: You should respond to messages as they
come in to properly record the context.

&gt;<i> =&gt;  My statements are factual and you can check any of them in Wikipedia.
</I>&gt;<i> I have no agenda reigning in anyone. I just stated facts.
</I>
And if I claim that you're an idiot that doesn't have any idea what
you're doing, that may be a fact too but it certainly doesn't advance
the case of any of us understanding exactly how and why you fail to
understand why your proposal is generating this response, nor help us
decide what to do about it. Your agenda is revealed by the examples
you provide, which aren't examples of the failure of government
decisionmaking, but rather failures of SDAP personalities in
decisionmaking positions. And then you fail to even deal with that
issue by creating a party and and a new &quot;elite&quot; that will apparently
be responsible for the actual decisionmaking because The People can't
be bothered to spend 5 minutes researching an issue before voting on
it.

&gt;<i> =&gt;  I criticized the proposals for one single reason
</I>&gt;<i> they failed
</I>
That is not a criticism, that's merely a statement of your opinion. A
valid criticism would include an analysis of *why* they failed.

&gt;<i> -&gt;  Thank you for the favour, but let me ask you..
</I>&gt;<i> If you know the flaws of the systems well, why have not you promoted a
</I>&gt;<i> successful direct democracy system so far?
</I>
Umm, I'm working on it: proxyfor.me was just recently released for
beta test and as yet has no marketing plan. I also haven't finished
the open-source release yet which is something I need to get done
before I can actually promote it as an open source project which is I
consider to be an essential feature of any new public policy
decisionmaking system.

&gt;<i> -&gt;  I am looking for marginally better improvements.
</I>
And yet you've proposed nothing that is even marginally better than
anything that has come before, nor even demonstrated that you
understand *why* any of the other systems &quot;failed&quot; (as you call it).
Just a few data points to put the timeframe of adoption process of
things like this in perspective:
It was 60 years between the publication of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot;
and the Bolshevik revolution
The number of Christians didn't break 10000 until over a hundred years
after Jesus died
The American Colonies were established (and immediately began feuding
with the Brits) 170 years before the American Revolution

I.e., it's way too early to call any of the projects you cite as failures...

&gt;<i> 6)
</I>&gt;<i> Please read your proposal again, specifically item 2.1, 4, 9, and 22.
</I>&gt;<i> Did you even write this thing?
</I>&gt;<i> (by Scott)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; I also wrote that a political party may not be needed at the beginning
</I>
OK, so your proposal is just confusing and internally inconsistent, not wrong.

&gt;<i> -&gt;  Slowly but surely you are getting there
</I>&gt;<i> I DO NOT want to invest more than 5 minutes to read your proposal as PEOPLE
</I>&gt;<i> will not spend more than 5 minutes to read your proposal
</I>
Lord help us if they're all as thick-headed and superficial as you,
but fortunately proxyfor.me will work to provide good representation
even if 99.99% of the population turns out to be this way. How does
your system provide this?

&gt;<i> 11)
</I>&gt;<i> I think again you're missing the point: The delegation system in LQFB
</I>&gt;<i> *didn't* work and therefore was a deal breaker for the adoption of the
</I>&gt;<i> system. If a system really does manage to capture The Will of The
</I>&gt;<i> People no amount of conflict in the SDAP leadership of the movement
</I>&gt;<i> will be able to stop it.
</I>&gt;<i> (by Scott)
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; This is your opinion. I respect but disagree with it.
</I>
It's not an opinion that the LQFB delegation system didn't work, it's
a fact (read the paper). And your delegation system works exactly the
same way: Why won't it fail in exactly the same way?
  Regards,
    Scott
