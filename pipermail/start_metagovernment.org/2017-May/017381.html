<PRE>What are your perceptions on how to handle this contradiction then of
asking for a system to redefine how we organize and yet hoping that this
system can also cater to dictators? I know my model does not scale well for
dictators, very much a direct democracy. Do you think it's important to
justify the position of not allowing dictators ultimate control? Should I
adjust my proposal to allow for this feature? Something that would
contradict my view but fit the criteria. Or should I simply plow through
ignoring it and hope this aspect was more just thrown in there to appease
some people and ultimately it won't matter in the final decision?
