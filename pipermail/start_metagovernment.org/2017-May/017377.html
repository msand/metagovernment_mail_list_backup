It is worth calling out this assumption as another fatal problem with
your proposal (not that I expect you to respond: You've not addressed
any of the other criticisms with the exception of calling for doubling
the workload when a multiple-choice option is desired):

If you expect any existing organization to adopt your alternative,
especially if that alternative *reduces* their power, you're
delusional. Any new system either stands alone or it will never be
more than a curiosity that will be forcefully shut down just as soon
as it gains any traction. Granted this makes the marketing problem
harder (you have to basically market &quot;revolution&quot; as a product, which
is a hard sell, especially to conservatives) and exposes us to the
risk of a messy transition (many states that already teeter on the
edge of totalitarianism will have to go there first). But if The
People want power, they're going to have to take it, not just beg the
existing power structure to voluntarily release it to them.
  Regards,
     Scott
