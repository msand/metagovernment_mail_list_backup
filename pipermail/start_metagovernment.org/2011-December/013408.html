Hi Michael,

Regarding the distinctions between the &quot;normative&quot; and &quot;executive&quot; systems.....or.....the difference between &quot;(what *is* to be)&quot; and &quot;(what *ought* to be)&quot;.

Would it be possible for the &quot;normative&quot; system to come to a point of *action* without an &quot;executive&quot; decision system to *finalize* it's proposal?  Some of the pivotal actions or protests that arose in Egypt last Spring were informally developed and *agreed to* without any formal (executive) decision-making process. These were potent expressions of a self-organizing (normative) body that created significant change without any final (executive) vote...or approval.  It seems they made no real distinction between &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;what is to be&quot;.    <A HREF="http://blog.ted.com/2011/03/04/inside-the-egyptian-revolution-wael-ghonim-on-ted-com/">http://blog.ted.com/2011/03/04/inside-the-egyptian-revolution-wael-ghonim-on-ted-com/</A>

If a proposal reaches a certain level of development and agreement/consensus...couldn't that alone empower and (in)form some framework of requisite action? Could the consensus/agreement itself BE the *executive* vote for...or approval of...force...as you say?   In my mind, a truly self-organizing body may no longer find it useful to expend the time and energy necessary to develop, maintain, and petition some form of *representative voting system*.  In my mind, a well-developed and thoroughly discussed proposal might alone be *representation* enough....and a broadly based consensus/agreement might alone be a sufficient *vote* of approval. 

For me the question is... Could normative (or formative) processes alone be trusted to develop a reasonable *mandate* for ordering the administration of our human enterprise?  Could the equation be....Formative [proposal development and agreement] ---- Executive [administration (or &quot;execution&quot;) of the agreement or mandate]?

When I look at the profusion of critical issues we are now facing and the narrow window we have to adjust our current momentum, the preponderant question for me is...&quot;do we have the time, patience, and collective will to push &quot;legislation&quot; through the existing structures?&quot;   Personally, I don't think so.  The entrenched polarities/obstructions are too great and I wonder whether we're at the crossroads where we need to let go of the embedded or existing &quot;administrative decision systems&quot; entirely....or nearly so...to begin anew.. [The...&quot;You just can't put new wine into old skins&quot;...kinda thing.] 

I believe we need to create (or seed) and empower a large (global), self-organizing, synthesis/consensus based network/movement...and do so very quickly. I don't understand why Votorola, working in tandem with similar systems (through an OVN), couldn't provide the means for developing such a system/movement...on it's own? 

I really appreciate your tolerance with my (trying) to articulate this question....again.  I know I'm a little slow on the uptake with all of this. 

I'm grateful for your patience,
Steve
