Thats true, one has to think about it, ...how to measure the degree of
change?
I think that a simple mechanism might work that could be refined. maybe
levenshtein distance? or hamming distance?
or something more advanced?
<A HREF="http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/1595/how-to-compute-the-semantic-distance-between-two-text-documents">http://metaoptimize.com/qa/questions/1595/how-to-compute-the-semantic-distance-between-two-text-documents</A>
 ??

The thing is, that people who vote directly or even indirectly for
someone's proposal should be notified and probably there should also be a
feed or something attached to the proposal, where all supporters of a
proposal could communicate.

so waht would happen with your berlusconi facebook example?
people would argue about it and people would sooner or later be informed
about such a &quot;minor change&quot; when it comes to the change distance in regard
to algorithmic calculation, ...but YES, it would only slightly increase the
rusting, because in terms of algorithm, it was only a minor change, but
they will also receive all the complains from other supporters...

so what's next?
Dont forget about the tree nature of votorola. the representatives with
many supporters that build subtrees of the &quot;corrupted&quot; proposal could
easily cummunicate to each other, one of them adapts their proposal to the
last valid orignal proposal that was corrupted by its &quot;admin&quot; and then they
vote for each other, ...thus, the corrupted &quot;root node&quot; will be excluded
and the non-corrupted subtrees will join to create a new uncorrupted tree.
This cannot be done in facebook, because every member of a facebook group
has to take action, but not in votorola.

so yes, someone could take a picture of the corrupted version and show it
off on his blog or somewhere else, but as soon as someone wants to confirm
it, votorola might already repaired itself and routes around the corrupted
&quot;root node&quot;.

Thats my understanding of votorla, maybe Thomas could confirm this? :-)

&gt;<i> Thanks for the clarification Paul.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed it would stop people from throwing away their votes, but it
</I>&gt;<i> would also introduce a different power for rich people versus poor
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe an internal economy could work here, or a reputation system.
</I>&gt;<i> Although some could argue that an intuitive reputation system is what
</I>&gt;<i> we have in society and look what came out... So, hmmmm. :-/
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks again for the clarification,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
