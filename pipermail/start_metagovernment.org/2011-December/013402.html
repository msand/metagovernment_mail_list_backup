<PRE>Dear Ed,

&gt;<i> &gt; If the &quot;rust filter&quot; is personal (as I think you suggested) and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not central, then I agree with the solution.  Here again, it's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; socially mediated solution (free interpretation) as opposed to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; systematic one.  The raw, unfiltered results are still visible to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; everyone else.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would a partially-systemic solution necessarily be bad? What about
</I>&gt;<i> employing a &quot;ping&quot; of some kind on polls which are long-lived and/or
</I>&gt;<i> on ones in which the front-runners are shifting positions. So under
</I>&gt;<i> certain circumstances, such as a leading delegate radically changing
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, everyone voting in the poll is asked to affirm their
</I>&gt;<i> current position or have it deprecated? The ping could be on-demand
</I>&gt;<i> only, sort of like when a status quo political candidate candidate
</I>&gt;<i> asks for a recount.
</I>
I think it depends on the purpose.  For the purpose of decision making
by an administrative system (like government), such a mechanism could
be beneficial.  It could prevent a vote shift by a delegate from
having immediate and irreversible consequences in society.  But here
people are bolting themselves directly to a powerful administrative
machine, so to speak, and should expect to be mechanized in turn.

Where the purpose is public consensus, however, there should be no
direct connection to power.  Power is force and threat of force, while
consensus making is all about communication aimed at agreement or
mutual understanding.  A public delegate who acts rightly or wrongly
in shifting his vote (or changing the content of his draft, or in any
other public expression) will quickly be answered by people who speak
up in agreement or opposition.  In either case, the vote standings
(and text content and running discussions) will remain the true
expression of public opinion.  The only way to prevent this is by
force, so I still think the general rule is *no moving parts except
people*; people may personally put machines to work for their own
purposes (tools), but no machine puts people to work.
