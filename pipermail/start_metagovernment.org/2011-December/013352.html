<PRE>I'd love to cooperate.  Although it might be difficult to get that
started, I feel certain that a technical monopoly is *impossible* in
this field.  So *some* kind of cooperation is in the future.

Or if we can't make it happen alone, then maybe Occupy can help us.
Stephen and I were discussing how to kick-start alpha trials (another
need Occupy can meet), and we had the idea of housing both initiatives
under a single workgroup (? or something) in Occupy itself.  See:
<A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/?topic_page=5&amp;num=15#post-12578">http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/?topic_page=5&amp;num=15#post-12578</A>

I bet just the *idea* of avoiding a Facebook/Twitter-like monopoly of
e-democracy will be enough to attract a few motivated activists (lots
of them in Occupy, naturally).  With their help, we could use the
tools (even as they are) to get *all* technical projects to cooperate,
just enough to ensure the survival of *each*.

What do you think?  It would be great if you guys could help, because
we'd definitely hit the ground running.

&gt;<i> Pietro and Michael, when we spoke at the last meeting via Skype, I got the strong impression that each of you does not have a good understanding of the others' systems. Michael was referring to Vilfredo as a brainstorming system, and Pietro has been referring to Votorola as a representation system. I think both of those are underestimations of the capabilities and ideologies of those systems. In my mind, I see the possibility of great synergies between them... but you would each need a better understanding first.

</I>&gt;<i> Can I ask the two of you (and others) to help educate each other about the finer points of your systems? Clearing up these misunderstandings may lead to some really cool interoperability.
