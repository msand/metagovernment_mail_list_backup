At them moment it is like you say, Pietro. But it would be a relativly 
easy feature to include: &quot;My vote gets automatically withdrawn, when you 
change your postion a bit/ a lot/ completely ...&quot; So this is no question 
of concept.

&gt;&gt;<i> So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for them each time.

I agree with Ed here.

Cheers,
Thomas
