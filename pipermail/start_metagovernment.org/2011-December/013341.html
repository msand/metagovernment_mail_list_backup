<PRE>This has been an excellent discussion which I have only been able to catch up on now. I hope you don't mind me interjecting comments to posts over the past couple of weeks.

Most of us on this list are not developers, Stephen. It is very much an idea-shating marketplace, not just a code-development forum. Please be welcome to participate as much as you wish!

What would be the problem with discussion always being optionally anonymous? There is value to requiring identity in voting, but there is certainly value to allowing people to discuss without identification.

Pietro, in some ways this reminds me of the value-organization system used in DemocracyLab. Unfortunately, I don't see a pointer to it on the website. Mark, if you see this, would you care to comment?

Would a partially-systemic solution necessarily be bad? What about employing a &quot;ping&quot; of some kind on polls which are long-lived and/or on ones in which the front-runners are shifting positions. So under certain circumstances, such as a leading delegate radically changing proposals, everyone voting in the poll is asked to affirm their current position or have it deprecated? The ping could be on-demand only, sort of like when a status quo political candidate candidate asks for a recount.
