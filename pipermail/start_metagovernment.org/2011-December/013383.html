</I>
nearly... :-)
But I would rewrite it as: &quot;The slower a person is in his voting, the
faster the algorithm should ignore it.&quot;
That means, a person doesnt have to change his position, it could also
reinforce it. (That's important!)


&gt;<i> Also, it is offering the flank to people who gather brownie points by
</I>&gt;<i> voting a lot, to then just set the course on something, and go to
</I>&gt;<i> sleep at the wheel. Somehow the algorithm should notice when a person
</I>&gt;<i> changes their behavior. Again noticing this cannot be both precise and
</I>&gt;<i> timely.
</I>
Is that really a problem? A person that votes a lot spends his time on the
voting system in might actually know what he is doing and that is &quot;voting
around&quot; ;-)
People should have that kind of freedom, right? By the way, rusting should
not count per person but instead per vote.

Actually, all votes should rust slowly over time until they vanish if not
reinforced manually.
Vote Rusting is accelerated, if the &quot;content&quot; that was voted for has
changed since then. The acceleration is given by the degree of change.

So, if i vote for something and it doesnt change, my vote should ruste very
very slowly, but it should rust, because if i turn out to be a lazy person
that does not reinforce its vote maybe once per year?? ..then chances are,
that i have evolved and changed my mind about a policy, but did not express
this by changnig my vote. Maybe i forgot about my voting behavior.
If many lazy people exist, that could really hinder society as a whole to
adapt to its suroundings.

So, if i vote for something and it DOES change, because the owner of the
proposal changed it slightly... or maybe he even changed it a lot... that
means my vote should rust faster and probably a subscription service should
tell me about changes of policies i voted for :-)

This mechanism will prevent people who gathered many voters to use their
power effectively in a way that people did not vote for, because changes
will increase the speed of rusting until accepted or reinforced by voters
by voting again for the changed issue, that might be still owned by the
same proposal-owner.

&gt;<i> What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without
</I>&gt;<i> voting before his votes start rusting? (this is a number)
</I>&gt;<i> How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)
</I>
1. rusting starts immediately and the speed depends on the degree of change
since the original voting took place. (so your number is 0)
2. i'm not sure about that function. i think it should be very very slowly.
(maybe every year? or every couple of years?) ..so this becomes irrelevant
if the proposal/issue is about the execution of something that happens
within upcoming weeks ;-)
The rusting speed is increased dramatically if changes are made to the
proposal. The speed of rusting might also depend on the time frame of a
proposal.
it is a permanent issue? (like &quot;The dignity of men is unimpeachable&quot;) or is
it more like &quot;build a new airport near city xy&quot;, where the first is
something that should be active as long as people continue to reinforce it
with their votes, while the latter should rust a bit faster... maybe...

&gt;<i> Hi Paul,

</I>&gt;<i> That is:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting idea. It has several weakness, but maybe they could be amended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all people that are only voting once should have their vote

</I>&gt;<i> (enough) before it needs to notice that the person is not changing his

</I>&gt;<i> And there is a minimum time that cannot be crossed. The more precise
</I>&gt;<i> you want the algorithm to be the later it will be. Sounds like we
</I>&gt;<i> found a modern equivalent to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we can expect that the system is somehow always having some
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inertia&quot; either because of the heavy votes that the algorithm has not
</I>&gt;<i> noticed, or the people who were light voters, and then started to gain
</I>&gt;<i> weight. This kind of inertia is similar to what we experience in
</I>&gt;<i> modern democracies, but it would of course be not so bad (we would not
</I>&gt;<i> have to wait 4 years, but much less). Still I hope we can do better
</I>&gt;<i> than this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also the system seem to require a number of &quot;constants&quot;, &quot;thresholds&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;functions&quot;. All that should be decided, and each that would have
</I>&gt;<i> an effect on the democracy that would come out.

</I>&gt;<i> What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without

</I>&gt;<i> How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any implementation of this idea would require the coder to take
</I>&gt;<i> decisions to clarify all this. But any such decision would be hard to
</I>&gt;<i> defend, and would ultimately represent a liability for the system. And
</I>&gt;<i> all this to save a concept that I am not sure we should save: the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of having someone vote for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the idea is interesting and gave rise to interesting
</I>&gt;<i> consequences, I am still unconvinced that this would solve the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of people who lazily delegate their power. Sorry.
