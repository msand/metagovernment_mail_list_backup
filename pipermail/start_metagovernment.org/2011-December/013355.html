Michael, can you be more clear about who you are asking to help, and what help you are asking for? Is this directed at Vilfredo or at the whole Metagov community?

Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It also requires fresh proposals for each issue.

So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for them each time.

Granted, that is still possible. In my part of the world, any time Oprah Winfrey makes a proposal, she would get overwhelming support. But that is inevitable anyway isn't it? Even in an anonymous system, if Oprah endorses a particular issue, people would vote for it in droves. That's just human nature and we can't program it out. We can only make something as fair as possible in the face of it.
