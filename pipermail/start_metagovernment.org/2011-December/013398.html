</I>
No, i think each vote rustes individually. So if a voter votes for hundreds
of proposals, he has to refresh each one seperately.
The acceleration of rusting also depends on the amount of change.

&gt;<i> Yes, exactly! So how, if we would make this a social desicion right from
</I>the start ... and not an automatic one?

I dont get you. Whether a change is huge or not or whether a poll is
corrupted or not should be a social decision and people will realize the
corruption and change the tree structure to exclude the corrupted node at
the top of the tree. The rusting mechanism is just a fallback mechanism.

Chosen proposals should be reinforced on a regular basis aand rusts away
otherwise. The rusting should be very very slow, but should accelerate as
soon as the proposal is changed.
This means, that when the path from me to the root node of the tree i voted
for (&lt;= maybe read that twice ;)) changes, a voter should confirm this
change.
If he doesnt, the rusting accelerates by the degree of difference between
the proposal he initially voted for compared to the proposal that is active
after a change took place. (e.g. by the delegate editing his proposal OR by
the delegate delegating his vote to someone else)
The acceleration can be undone as soon as changes are confirmed by the
voter.

What do you think? Is it clear what i mean?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, refreshing a vote would be the direct way to reverse rusting that

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Vote Rusting is accelerated, if the &quot;content&quot; that was voted for has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; changed since then. The acceleration is given by the degree of change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I like that!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about the issue of measuring the degree of change of a proposal:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; so yes, someone could take a picture of the corrupted version and show
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; it off on his blog or somewhere else, but as soon as someone wants to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; confirm it, votorola might already repaired itself and routes around
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the corrupted &quot;root node&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Thats my understanding of votorla, maybe Thomas could confirm this? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, exactly! So how, if we would make this a social desicion right from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the start ... and not an automatic one? The users would have to decide,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it was a minor, a big or a huge change. Maybe it is enough, if the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; delegate (author) himself decides this and if he cheats, his voters will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; turn away?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> +1 If it becomes an issue we can develop an algorithm (maybe for vote
</I>&gt;<i> space),
</I>&gt;<i> to mark rusted vote(r)s. An algorithm is always less flexible than a social
</I>&gt;<i> solution and is in that sense always undemocratic and therefore unfair. As
</I>&gt;<i> soon as it alters the weight of a vote or includes/excludes contributions
</I>&gt;<i> it
</I>&gt;<i> is an issue of the Poll/Position itself and has to be democratically
</I>&gt;<i> decided
</I>&gt;<i> upon, so opposing users can form their own position and express
</I>&gt;<i> non-consent of
</I>&gt;<i> this mechanism as well. I don't think activity might change the weight of
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> vote. Either we do respect each of us as a free individual/modern subject
</I>&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;<i> we corrupt our efforts from the start. We cannot force people to behave
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;right&quot; in voting, so we shouldn't statically fix our tools for problems we
</I>&gt;<i> don't have yet. We can always plug algorithms in for that, because our
</I>&gt;<i> social
</I>&gt;<i> model only relies on consensual trees for polls. This is the only fixed
</I>&gt;<i> social
</I>&gt;<i> preassumption about how consent is communicated. How these trees organize
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> be adjusted in a zillion ways.
