Yes. And if you explicitly were for the previous candidate of your switching 
endcandidate, then you should have voted for her in the first place, because 
you always take the closest position (can be due to social connections also). 
If the switch happens because of some corruption, then there will be enough 
time to realize the change. A single voter can already wake up the other 
&quot;rust&quot; ones, so a hard shift is unlikely. But corruption has to be found by 
the voters themselves, because it does not lie in the formal voting process, 
but in the content and subject of the position and plan where the corruption 
of this very plan can happen. This cannot ultimately be fixed by voting 
mechanisms, they only allow to form a collective will to deal with these 
issues and form a social structure including voting on issues to avoid them. 

We can also mail all voters before the final deadline of the vote to check 
their position and if they don't confirm then ignore them (not mechanical 
solution compared to the rust algorithm, which assumes inactive users are 
uninterested users in the end and then bug the inactive/occupied user with 
confirmation requests). 

Instead of making this issue a core one and impose a specific technological 
concept on it, I would rather focus on what keeps the active users involved, 
because this is the real drive behind fair participation and social mechanism 
to clean up the rust voters. If somebody is not interested, you cannot 
formally force him/her to be that or to leave, you can only define a mechanism 
to sort him/her out in the plan itself. This is already a bad scenario and 
shouldn't be standard on a successful e-democracy platform imho. As I said, a 
single voter recognizing the corruption is enough.
