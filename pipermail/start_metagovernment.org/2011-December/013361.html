Sorry, I wasn't sure myself.  But I was speaking with Stephen today
and we hit on the idea of simply asking for advice on how to bootstrap
this kind of thing... so probably that's what I was stumbling after.

Maybe an RFC is the best form...  I'll post a first draft separately.
Could you guys comment if you have time?  Others too, please?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It seem to me that Votorola is more similar to the genetic algorithm

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Vilfredo counterpart. But I don't think it is mathematically fair. In
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fact (and this is my greatest problem with this) it looks to me as a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sort of proxy/liquid democracy type of system. And I find those system
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to be deeply unfair as very soon people will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) support people that they like (i.e. actors) - and not people more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; technical that they seem to agree with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (b) forget who they have lent their support.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;snip&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe a sort of proxy voting where people must renew their decision to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; let a particular person EACH time would take care of the (b) problem.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But still it would have the (a) problem.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It also requires fresh proposals for each issue.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for them each time.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, that is still possible. In my part of the world, any time Oprah Winfrey makes a proposal, she would get overwhelming support. But that is inevitable anyway isn't it? Even in an anonymous system, if Oprah endorses a particular issue, people would vote for it in droves. That's just human nature and we can't program it out. We can only make something as fair as possible in the face of it.
