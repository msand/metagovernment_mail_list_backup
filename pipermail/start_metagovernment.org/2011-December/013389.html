<PRE>As far as i know, if you shift your vote from ur proposal to the proposal
of someone else, u take all ur voter with you.

Thats why &quot;Vote Rusting&quot; or I think even better &quot;Change-dependent
accelerated vote rusting&quot; would make sense.
Your voters might be informed that you shifted your vote and so they
hopefully reinforce their vote or else the accelerated vote rusting,
depending on the amount of change between ur proposal and the proposal that
you shifted to, will sooner or later melt your support away.

thats also an additional incentive for you to negotiate with the person you
want to shift to, because you dont only should take your oppinion into
account, but also the oppinion of the supporters of your proposal.

2011/12/11 Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;

&gt;<i> First a meta-question, particularly for the Votorola folks, since we have
</I>&gt;<i> a real-world example of what Pietro has been criticizing:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with almost everything Pietro proposes below. If this were a
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola poll and I expressed that agreement by shifting my vote to Pietro
</I>&gt;<i> or by changing my proposal to be almost the same as his, then would all the
</I>&gt;<i> support I had received from others (note several people supported my
</I>&gt;<i> original proposal) then shift to Pietro? My proposal is now substantially
</I>&gt;<i> different, so is it right that that support shifts?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now a few questions/comments for Pietro (and anyone else, of course).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning the 100%, I am always leery of something that requires absolute
</I>&gt;<i> unanimity when we are trying to build something that can scale up to
</I>&gt;<i> something extremely large. However, if we are talking about the core
</I>&gt;<i> principles of the group, then of course the barrier should be extremely
</I>&gt;<i> high. In that case, I do prefer your 96% over the 100%.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning how we decide who is a member, participation in the project
</I>&gt;<i> seems like a fair measure. Since we are talking about an organizational
</I>&gt;<i> charter, this question of membership definition is going to become a
</I>&gt;<i> central question. But how do we determine participation programmatically?
</I>&gt;<i> We would need some software mechanism which would be able to determine who
</I>&gt;<i> is a member at any moment, wouldn't we?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Concerning a Shulze vote, as you may know we have a member project which
</I>&gt;<i> employs that method. Would the Indaba network work for this?

</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Indaba_Application_Network">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Indaba_Application_Network</A>
</I>&gt;<i> My concern is whether or not it is open source. Note the reference in
</I>&gt;<i> principle number 2. Craig, can you comment?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; thanks for the invitation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I wrote my version of the Draft, as I would be willing to support. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is quite different, so I made it into another page:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let me explain the differences:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (1) The rules on how to modify the Mission and Principles have been
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; moved to inside the mission and principles, to avoid someone being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; able to change them, as a shortcut to change the mission and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; principle.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (2) the 98% has been taken out, and was instead substituted by a 100%
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of the voting members, and 80% of all the members. In the previous
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; version there was no reference to the difference between voting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; members and members. In other words a small group of people could vote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a change, without anyone else noticing. That is why for something like
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this we need that at least x% of the people must be involved.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also the 98% seemed a joke.  Why 98%? 100% had a sense (full
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus). Maybe 96% also could have a sense, as the number of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sociopath in society is about 4%. But 98%?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Rulemaking.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Here is where I made the biggest change.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; First of all MG is a meta community. Is a community fo communities.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And we are going to test and try different systems in our evolution.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It is important that each decision taken is official, but is also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; important that we never freeze in using a single system. Mostly the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; key issue in metagovernment is how to solve open questions. But we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also stand on the shoulders of giants. And those are all those who
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; made research on how to solve closed questions. Now deciding how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide is an open question. But once we have defined a set of options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it becomes a closed question. So my suggestion is that for each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision we (a) decide how we decide and (b) decide. And since we are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; going to test new systems all the time it is possible that from time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to time something truly horrible comes out. SO we need to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; go back one decision.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So my suggestion is:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (a) any person can suggest a way to decide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once all the proposals have been presented, (and only then!), we set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; up a shultz voting system. That is about the best technology there is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; around for taking closed decisions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (b) Then the metagovernment members decide how we shall decide.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not that the MG members here have a special status. Anyone can suggest
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a decision method, but only the MG members can then decide how to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decide. This is to avoid that a group of people just come, suggest,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vote for themselves, and then implement the decisions and go away with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the money. What is still missing are the rules that decide how a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person becomes a member. It could be done that anyone asking can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become a member, but in general I think no one can participate in any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision who have been started before they joined. In fact I would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also add a little time frame (say 3 months), so no one can just come
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with all his friends and decide.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (c) Then the decision method is applied, and we decide.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (d) after the decision, it is still possible to overturn the decision.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is done in a simple, way. If 50%+1 of the MG members feel that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the decision did not represent the community or did not respect the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mission and Principles they can impose to re-implement the whole
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; process from the beginning (a).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; NOTE: this substitutes the: &quot;No decision shall have force if it is in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contradiction to the Mission and Principles.&quot; which I found to be too
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; vague to be useful.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e) Then the result is applied.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I took away references to other decision rules mostly because it does
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not make sense to say that something &quot;resembles&quot;. Either something is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identical or not. Something that resembles for me does not for you.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Changes in the Charter, but not on the Mission and Principles are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to do. They are done as normal decisions, but need to be done
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; twice, at a distance of at least 1 month.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The new version I am presenting is at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Because if it does, then I vote NO, if it does not then I vote YES.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If I understand it correctly (and others, please correct me as
