<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> It seem to me that Votorola is more similar to the genetic algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> part of Vilfredo. It probably can be used by more people than the
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo counterpart. But I don't think it is mathematically fair. In
</I>&gt;<i> fact (and this is my greatest problem with this) it looks to me as a
</I>&gt;<i> sort of proxy/liquid democracy type of system. And I find those system
</I>&gt;<i> to be deeply unfair as very soon people will
</I>&gt;<i> (a) support people that they like (i.e. actors) - and not people more
</I>&gt;<i> technical that they seem to agree with
</I>&gt;<i> (b) forget who they have lent their support.
</I>
I did answer to your concerns and also to your proposed solutions for a) 
and b) in a previous post (in the thread: Talk at FET11 ...). So far you 
did not reply yet.

I wrote:

@ Pietro

&gt;<i> Regarding the idea of using a Votorola like system, that is a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> voting, I think this is not really acceptable.
</I>
In regard to the cluster-forming my suggestion was not to use proxy 
voting, but to simply let the users decide what cluster they want to 
belong to. Votorolas proxy-voting has this as a side-effect, but there 
might be other ways.

&gt;<i> First of all a problem with proxy voting is that people give support
</I>&gt;<i> to someone, then they forget, and that person remains with an
</I>&gt;<i> inherited power. This is very dangerous.
</I>
There are solutions for that. My favorite is from the german 
&quot;Liquid-Democracy-e.V.&quot;. They call it &quot;rusting of the votes&quot;, i.e. votes 
gradually melt away over time if they don't get refreshed by the voters.


&gt;<i> Also an important principle that I am following is a principle of Fair
</I>&gt;<i> participation, which require that proposals are all evaluated only by
</I>&gt;<i> the content. This means that people enter this system without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> who else is there. They do not know the others.
</I>
The issue of anonymity is not bound to proxy-voting, is it? The problems 
of anonymity and its possible solutions apply to all e-dem-systems, 
don't they?

&gt;<i> Indeed every voter has the right to participate to both a clarity
</I>&gt;<i> working group and a compromise working group. But, as you pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> it is probably unfeasible if the groups are too big, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> some groups can be split, and have two groups work in parallel on the
</I>&gt;<i> same cluster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also remember that work groups usually require extra effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Although everybody is welcome to participate, on average less than
</I>&gt;<i> everybody will participate in the workgroups.
</I>
Ok, but since it is all about politics and sometimes about really 
important decisions you can still expect thousands of participants in a 
european-wide poll, can't you? Not to mention a global poll. And then 
the question comes up, which brought us all here in the first place: How 
can we technically support thousands of participants which try to reach 
a consensus on something? How can they all communicate with each other, 
bargain with each other, ... ? I feel this needs to be structured, since 
more than 20 people can not talk to each other directly.


&gt;<i> Have you seen the two taks I gave on Fair Participation and on  System
</I>&gt;<i> Generated Requests for Rewriting Proposals
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8Ty-E9xlDA</A>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_odnkfaH5c</A>
</I>
I saw the first. One thought of mine that I remember: I don't think it 
is technically possible to prevent someone pointing his friends to his 
proposal.

&gt;<i> you mention the system of groups within groups that is present in
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola. I am not sure I believe that will actually work. I mean, yes
</I>&gt;<i> you can have a fractal system of split groups, into smaller and smaller
</I>&gt;<i> units. But then I am not sure you can so easily come back and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate proposals in the bigger groups.
</I>
Well, each group is represented by its candidate. Those candidates form 
another group which is represented by their candidate ...
So you are right, it won't be easy for a group of candidates to form a 
consensus, because they all have to get their voters to agree. But this 
is politics, isn't it? It's not easy, thats for sure.

Best Regards,
Thomas
