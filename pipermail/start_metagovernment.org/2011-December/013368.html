<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In regard to the cluster-forming my suggestion was not to use proxy voting,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> but to simply let the users decide what cluster they want to belong to.
</I>&gt;<i> I am sorry, I still don't get it. There are some proposals, people can
</I>&gt;<i> decide to vote for them, or to let someone else decide for them. Is
</I>&gt;<i> this not correct. What are those clusters you speak of?
</I>
In Vilfredo clusters are formed according to some algorithm, which uses 
certain data. In Votorola the users themselves decide which cluster (or 
call it group or delegation tree) they want to belong to. (Just to 
mention: delegation does not only allow for letting others decide for 
you, but also for letting others work for you in the sense of: letting 
others implement **your** decisions.)

&gt;&gt;<i> There are solutions for that. My favorite is from the german
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Liquid-Democracy-e.V.&quot;. They call it &quot;rusting of the votes&quot;, i.e. votes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gradually melt away over time if they don't get refreshed by the voters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks but I don't think this would satisfy me as a security mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i> People can do a lot of damage while they hold the power.
</I>
How about my suggested feature from the previous post? I.e. include: &quot;My 
vote gets automatically withdrawn, when you change your postion a bit/ a 
lot/ completely ...&quot; Together with &quot;rusting&quot; no damage possible, right?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, but since it is all about politics and sometimes about really important
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions you can still expect thousands of participants in a european-wide
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> poll, can't you?
</I>
&gt;<i> I was presenting three tools:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) a tool to aggregate proposals in clusters
</I>&gt;<i> (2) a tool to let some people in a cluster clarify it
</I>&gt;<i> (3) a tool to integrate different clusters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is possible that the number of clusters grow slower than the
</I>&gt;<i> number of proposals, with the effect that the second tool does not
</I>&gt;<i> scale up. This might be balanced by making smaller clusters, for
</I>&gt;<i> example. Or having multiple groups work in parallel for each cluster.
</I>
I was talking about (3), about integration. This is were the real 
political/social/communicative effort lies IMO. To find consensus 
between thousands or millions of participants. Consensus not just about 
the clearest expression of a proposal as in (2), but about real content. 
(BTW, I doubt, that you can seperate this in (2) and (3)). How can that 
many people talk to each other in a constructive way? I feel, this is 
the question we need to answer.

&gt;<i> The global poll is made on closed questions. As such it can scale up
</I>&gt;<i> quite well.
</I>
How? How do people find consensus?

&gt;<i> 20 people cannot talk to each other directly, but millions of
</I>&gt;<i> people vote in modern democracies for the same candidates.
</I>
With the results you and I suffer from for years now.

&gt;<i> The fact is that setting up those fractal system is an old solution.
</I>&gt;<i> It has been used pretty much in any political system in the world. But
</I>&gt;<i> even when they tried to avoid them to become a source of centralized
</I>&gt;<i> power (like in communist Russia) it did not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A group of people discussing works fine. A group of group of people
</I>&gt;<i> often leads to bad decisions.
</I>
What has never been tried so far (because of a lack of technical 
possibilies) to do this in complete openness and transparency and allow 
everybody to withdraw his support for his delegate with just one click 
of the mouse-button. The power those people have, only lasts as long as 
you don't press this one button. Very different from Russia, 
East-Germany, ... and even democracies today, where you can not withdraw 
your vote for 4 years ... (and have only very very few candidates to 
choose from).

Best,
Thomas
