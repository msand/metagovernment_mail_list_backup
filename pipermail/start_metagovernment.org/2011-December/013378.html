Instead of (or in addition to) concealing the URL of proposals, why not conceal the URL of people? In other words, eliminate the possibility of people finding their favorite politicians and always voting for that person. People could still have a trust signature so you could know that they are who they say they are, but you wouldn't be able to find them just by looking for them.

But one core purpose of collaborative governance is the empowerment of the individual. Random voting is not nearly as empowering as the ability to vote on anything anytime. If people do not feel that sense of empowerment, they are less likely to take responsibility for their own governance. They would still be prone to feel like government is something that happens to them, not that they control.

Legislation is a push process while adjudication is a pull process. This is because adjudication is (simplistically) about deciding if something in the past was right or wrong. Legislation is (also simplistically) about deciding if something in the future is or is not to be permitted. That difference decides the push/pull nature. It is reasonable that past things should be push because they are a limited set. Future things are pull because they are an open set.

And as a corollary of the above: if someone sees a proposal they like but they are not empowered to vote for it, would they still not be empowered to make a new proposal similar to it? That sounds like a fragmentation of the process instead of a consensus-builder.
