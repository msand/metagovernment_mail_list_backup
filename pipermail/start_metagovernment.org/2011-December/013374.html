<PRE>Hi all,

the delegation to the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters should be questioned faster then for &quot;low power&quot; voters?  This can be an automatic algorithm and does not depend on an interpretation of such a thing as a &quot;fundamental policy&quot;.

  Hm, I think I got the issue and I support Pietro's point of view.
  I'd like to comment on....

  &gt; My idea is that the right of vote should be proportional to how
  &gt; willing is a person to be bothered to let his voice be heard.

  &gt; If you a better suggestion that satisfies my need not to be governed
  &gt; by the people who are too lazy to update their vote, I would be happy
  &gt; to hear it. But not a rusting system, that only limits the damage, but
  &gt; does not eliminate it.

  People may no always be lazy, sometimes they are very busy, but passively follow politics very close.
  Such people might delegate their vote, because they dont want to argue about issues, but they always follow the outcomes and will act as soon as things change in a way they dont like.
  I think:

  1. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters who move their votes slowly for whatever reason (might be laziness, but could be anything), votes for a proposal (e.g. Human dignity shall be inviolable.) ... vote rusting should be very very slow, because you dont want such fundamental policy's to &quot;rust away&quot; because of people beeing lazy, dont you? ;-)

  2. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters votes for a proposal and that proposal changes, ....the more it changes the more accelerated vote rusting should become.

  3. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters decided to accept money or anything in order to give away his power, what could you do about it? How could you even be sure this has been done? Blame the monetary system!  In my view, the monetary system is nothing else but a &quot;voting system&quot; where people's voices are not equal and which coexists with democracy.
  If our monetary system would be a fair system, i think money wouldnt matter that much, but its not fair (that's why Ron Paul wants to end the FED), so i think the argument is valid :-)

  So whats a solution?
  A. You dont want policy's such as &quot;Human dignity shall be inviolable&quot; to rust away because of laziness or because people are paid to move their votes
  B. You want &quot;bad&quot; policy's such as.... (think of an example for yourself) ... to rust away fast, so they have to be refreshed on a regular basis in order to note give &quot;heavy power&quot; to demagogues.

  Shouldn't it be a duty of voters to care for their fellow voters, and thats everyone, so shouldn't it be a responsibility of a voter to argue with their lazy fellows? The demagogue did the same. He invested a lot of time to motivate &quot;heavy power&quot; to move and maybe people should respect that &quot;heave power&quot; has moved as it pleases...
  So maybe a voter who doesnt like this shouldinvest a similar amount of energy? If one thinks that its not fair, this could be interpreted as disrespect for the will of &quot;heavy power&quot; which is heavy for a hodge-podge of reasons i guess ;-)

  So what do you think of &quot;change-dependent accelerated vote rusting&quot; ?

  PS.: If you look close enough, the concept of vote's is not comlpetely different from the concept of money. Maybe, in order to solve issues like &quot;paying someone for his vote&quot;, we should discuss alternative &quot;seed mechanisms&quot; and &quot;control structures&quot; for money?





  2011/12/11 Pietro Speroni di Fenizio &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">metagovernment at pietrosperoni.it</A>&gt;

    Dear Thomas,

    Let me answer your suggestion:


    &gt;&gt;&gt; Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It also
    &gt;&gt;&gt; requires fresh proposals for each issue.
    &gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt; Thanks, this is good to know. Could Michael or Thomas confirm it?
    &gt;&gt; Because what I saw in respect to the metagovernment rules question was
    &gt;&gt; that Thomas could move his 5 votes as he liked.
    &gt;&gt; The 5 people did not have to give him the vote again.
    &gt;
    &gt; At them moment it is like you say, Pietro. But it would be a relativly easy
    &gt; feature to include: &quot;My vote gets automatically withdrawn, when you change
    &gt; your postion a bit/ a lot/ completely ...&quot; So this is no question of
    &gt; concept.


    I am afraid it would not be enough. Let me explain:

    The problem in a democracy is two fold. On the one side you want that
    your vote is counted, that you can change it, that you can collaborate
    in the drafting and so on.
    On the other side you want that also the vote of other people is
    counted and represents correctly what they feel/believe/think.

    If my vote is correctly counted, but the other people vote is not
    because they are too lazy to keep track of it, now the problem raises
    is what happens to all this power left untaped.

    If that power remains attached to someone (because they simply could
    not be bothered to update it), the result is that I will live in a
    democracy dominated by the people that have convinced the lazy buggers
    to vote for them, and then forget about it. This is not a democracy I
    want to live in, and I bet is not a democracy where YOU would want to
    live in either.

    So what should happen with the heavy power of the lazy voters?
    (It's heavy because it takes a lot to move it.  But it's also heavy
    because once it has moved it is hard to change it again.)
    My idea is that the right of vote should be proportional to how
    willing is a person to be bothered to let his voice be heard.
    If you a better suggestion that satisfies my need not to be governed
    by the people who are too lazy to update their vote, I would be happy
    to hear it. But not a rusting system, that only limits the damage, but
    does not eliminate it.

    As such I am not just having a requirement about my voice, but also
    about how others should be allowed to organise between them. In this I
    am stepping beyond my direct circle. I am saying: not only I want my
    voice to be heard, but I do not want that Ed (for example) is allowed
    (legally or technically) to give to Thomas the right to vote for him
    more than one time. If Ed wants someone else to vote for him he should
    repeat his desire each time.

    I know this sounds unfair, what right do I have to discuss the way Ed
    and Thomas organise between them?

    But, you see, I do have to live in the society generated also by
    Thomas and Ed interaction. So their relation is effectively touching
    me. And if the result of their relation is that I will be governed by
    people only because some other people are too lazy to follow what is
    going on, I oppose such organization.

    And this is why I also cannot support a system that counts voting
    independently on how they are gathered. As my understanding is that
    Outcast does.

    But I am willing to change my position once someone convinces me of a
    better option.



    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a
    &gt;&gt;&gt; proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for
    &gt;&gt;&gt; them each time.
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; I agree with Ed here.


    Let's say that I am an actor with a vast support. I support a certain
    very popular position (rape is illegal even between married couples in
    muslim countries). I in this way gather million of people supporting
    me supporting that position. As the position slightly changes (is sex
    by surprise rape?), people keep on supporting me, not to have to work
    in following that position. Eventually I gather a lot of people who
    are willing to support me on any issue (&quot;I like this guy, he sings
    such a KOOL songs, and I totally DIG him when he was ..., and my
    supporting him I can also support the really cool social fight he is
    participating in&quot;). Then I (actor) receive an offer, someone offers me
    a million dollar if I give my support for their proposal (and
    subsequent drafts). I secretly accept, I support them, and with me
    come most of my supporters.

    Yes, this would happen;
    yes, often this would lead to an uproar from the public;
    no, the uproar would not happen all the time;
    (Is the time when it does not happen that worries me)

    So a proxy voting is essentially a system where people by default will
    give their vote away, and then have to work each time to make sure it
    was used wisely. Instead we need a system where by default the vote is
    nil. And people need to work (by voting) to make themselves be heard.



    Regards,
    Pietro
