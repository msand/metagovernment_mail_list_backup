<PRE>Hey Thomas,

&gt;<i> Yes, but in the case of poll-zombies this means, you try to reach
</I>&gt;<i> them in this regard and they dont answer. You might even go to their
</I>&gt;<i> house, they are alive and healthy but as soon as you ask about the
</I>&gt;<i> poll, they say &quot;Go away! Now!&quot; ... lol. What to do with their vote?
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say, let it rust away ... dont let it sit there for 25 years.
</I>
If the &quot;rust filter&quot; is personal (as I think you suggested) and not
central, then I agree with the solution.  Here again, it's a socially
mediated solution (free interpretation) as opposed to a systematic
one.  The raw, unfiltered results are still visible to everyone else.

As long as the system doesn't hide or distort the truth, then I think
we'll be OK.  It's only when the machine starts making the decisions
for us that we get into trouble.  I think that's the status quo:
society is a machine out of control and we have no say in it.  We
pretend that we do because it makes us feel better, but it's untrue.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thomas, are you following?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we need to automate draft creation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for new users, kind of like we did for remote drafts here in Metagov.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Maybe also automate registration in the pollwiki, making it part of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; login to the vote-server.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Both would be great!
