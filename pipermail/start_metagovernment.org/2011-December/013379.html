<PRE>Hi Paul,

thanks for your comment.

Alex, thanks for your support.

That is:
The slower a person is in changing his vote the faster the algorithm
should ignore it.

Interesting idea. It has several weakness, but maybe they could be amended.

First of all people that are only voting once should have their vote
ignored very very soon. But the algorithm cannot do this too soon
(enough) before it needs to notice that the person is not changing his
position anymore. So in a sense the algorithm would always be &quot;late&quot;.
And there is a minimum time that cannot be crossed. The more precise
you want the algorithm to be the later it will be. Sounds like we
found a modern equivalent to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. ;-)

Also, it is offering the flank to people who gather brownie points by
voting a lot, to then just set the course on something, and go to
sleep at the wheel. Somehow the algorithm should notice when a person
changes their behavior. Again noticing this cannot be both precise and
timely.

So we can expect that the system is somehow always having some
&quot;inertia&quot; either because of the heavy votes that the algorithm has not
noticed, or the people who were light voters, and then started to gain
weight. This kind of inertia is similar to what we experience in
modern democracies, but it would of course be not so bad (we would not
have to wait 4 years, but much less). Still I hope we can do better
than this.

Also the system seem to require a number of &quot;constants&quot;, &quot;thresholds&quot;,
and &quot;functions&quot;. All that should be decided, and each that would have
an effect on the democracy that would come out.

What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without
voting before his votes start rusting? (this is a number)
How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)

Any implementation of this idea would require the coder to take
decisions to clarify all this. But any such decision would be hard to
defend, and would ultimately represent a liability for the system. And
all this to save a concept that I am not sure we should save: the
concept of having someone vote for you.

Although the idea is interesting and gave rise to interesting
consequences, I am still unconvinced that this would solve the problem
of people who lazily delegate their power. Sorry.

Best Regards,
Pietro
