<PRE>Hi George,

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Most importantly however, going through Metagovernance material and the
</I>&gt;<i> mailing list archives i found out that there is a topic under
</I>&gt;<i> discussion&lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2011</A>
</I>&gt;<i> -December/004640.html&gt;, apparently primarily among the recipients of this
</I>&gt;<i> message, that is very much in line with things i was planning for myself.
</I>&gt;<i> In order to keep this message short, i would like to point you to an
</I>&gt;<i> outline published recently on my
</I>&gt;<i> blog&lt;<A HREF="http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-pr">http://ganadiotis.wordpress.com/the-peer-to-peer-work-group-toolkit-pr</A>
</I>&gt;<i> oject/&gt;and on
</I>&gt;<i> MixedInk &lt;<A HREF="http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS">http://www.mixedink.com/#/DecisionMakingP2PFOSS</A>&gt; and to give you
</I>&gt;<i> a little bit of background. The page was published as part of an
</I>&gt;<i> effort to attain
</I>&gt;<i> a lightning talk slot for the upcoming
</I>&gt;<i> fosdem&lt;<A HREF="http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks">http://fosdem.org/2012/call-for-lightningtalks</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> It was set up rather hastily in order to meet a deadline, so unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i> i did not research as thoroughly as i could have - otherwise i would have
</I>&gt;<i> already found this group. It seems to me however that my goal of setting up
</I>&gt;<i> an open source project and standards to produce software for collective
</I>&gt;<i> decision making, integrating relevant existing efforts is very much aligned
</I>&gt;<i> with your goals and work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you also feel the same way, what i would suggest is to integrate this
</I>&gt;<i> proposal somewhere under the Metagovernment group and to present this -if
</I>&gt;<i> finally granted the slot- as a representative of the group. Apparently,
</I>&gt;<i> this would also increase the chances of being given the slot in the first
</I>&gt;<i> place. Regardless of this however, there is already a sort of
</I>&gt;<i> mini-unconference being organised among myself and some of my contacts
</I>&gt;<i> (such as Marko Rodriguez &lt;<A HREF="http://markorodriguez.com/writings/">http://markorodriguez.com/writings/</A>&gt;, Ronny
</I>&gt;<i> Siebes&lt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ronny/">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~ronny/</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> Eidrien Perreau &lt;<A HREF="http://eidrienontech.blogspot.com/">http://eidrienontech.blogspot.com/</A>&gt; and Manuel
</I>&gt;<i> Waeckerle&lt;<A HREF="http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/waeck/staffmember.php">http://www.econ.tuwien.ac.at/waeck/staffmember.php</A>&gt;),
</I>&gt;<i> where the idea is to get together on fosdem and try to establish a roadmap
</I>&gt;<i> and specific technical and organizational steps for moving forward. I have
</I>&gt;<i> an approach in mind already - on the technical level it involves Apache
</I>&gt;<i> Shindiq and OpenSocial, but most importantly on the organizational level it
</I>&gt;<i> also involves some sort of legal entity to support this, for all the good
</I>&gt;<i> reasons and in the spirit you have also discussed.

Quoting your blog: 
&quot;To facilitate coordination and organisation so that these systems may become 
robust, usable and interoperable in order to form the basis for grass-roots 
decision making and organisation. It appears that the technology and the 
momentum are building, and the time has come to act and be the change we want 
to see, by building the tools and putting the practices to the test.&quot;

We have tried to address this problem for the voting infrastructure with (1) 
and in general with (2). If you look besides communication media like diaspora 
or friendica, you will find that voting mechanisms in itself fit in between 
these. No reason to duplicate, but also no reason to directly hardwire some 
voting system in each communication medium. Instead we propose to address the 
issue of (delegated) voting in a modular open network approach. This allows 
different decision systems to coexist even in the same communication or 
drafting media, fitting to the grass roots nature of social movements. To make 
decision mechanisms interesting, a common network is necessary, otherwise the 
small user base of a specific tool quickly limits the audience.
