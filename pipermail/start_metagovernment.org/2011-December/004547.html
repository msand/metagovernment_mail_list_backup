INTRODUCTION

METAPOLITICS [m&#603;t&#601; p&#594;l&#618;t&#618;ks] (sometimes written
meta-politics) is metalinguistic talk about the analytic, synthetic, and
normative language of political inquiry and politics itself. _In simple
words, it is talk about the way we talk about politics._ 

EXAMPLE: If
one studies, analyzes, and describes a language, the language used for
studying, analyzing, and describing the object language is a
_metalanguage_. 

In current usage and praxis, the term metapolitics is
often used in relation to postmodern theories of the Subject and their
relation to political theory. In its broadest definition, metapolitics
is a discipline that studies the relationship between the State and the
Individual. 

 <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapolitics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapolitics</A> [26]


METAPOLITIK.ORG grew out of my strong desire to start a _'Deep Green
Social Democratic Revolution'_ [27]. As others [28] have noted,
Capitalism as we know it is no longer sustainable and as such, cannot
continue it's current trajectory of greed, cronyism and environmental
destruction. To quote Alex Knight [29]: 

_&quot;Capitalism requires growth.
A system that requires growth cannot last forever on a planet that is
defined by ecological and social limits. Capitalism is therefore
fundamentally unsustainable - sooner or later it will run up against
those limits and the system will stop functioning. At this moment we are
in the midst of a crisis which is calling into question the future of
this system. Now is a perfect opportunity to envision a new way of
living in the world that can meet human needs while also respecting the
needs of the planet. It is time to build this new world.&quot;_ [30] 

Thus,
METAPOLITIK  is based on the understanding that modern 'Capitalism'
(Corporate Socialism or Corporatocratic Fascism) is what author Douglas
Rushkoff [31] would call _&quot;legacy software&quot;_ -- that is to say, an
outdated, societal _'operating system'_ that no longer continues to
serve it's intended purpose. While 'Capitalism' did great things for us
back in the 20th Century (helped defeat the Nazis and rebuild Europe,
etc...) ...It's pretty much out of steam. It cannot continue on it's
current trajectory without dire consequences -- both ecological and
economic. In many ways, it seems insulting to even call it 'capitalism'
any more. More like: _Corporate Socialism_ a quasi-fuedal, quasi-fascist
corporatocracy in which the lobbyists who spend the most get the
legislation that they want passed and in which dramatic condensation of
wealth in the hands of a tiny minority of people have rendered our
economy completely dysfunctional and utterly incapable of serving the
needs of the body-politic. Not only is this a thoroughly un-democratic
situation, it is not in the spirit of true capitalism. If it were pure
capitalism -_ free market capitalism_ - we would all be independent
contractors. 

THE BODY POLITIC, in any developed country - tends to be
a vibrant and diverse mix of people, cultures, colors, creeds and ideas.
While this diversity makes the twenty-first century among the most
interesting times in history to be alive, it also makes open discussion
and analysis of our differing socio-political views incredibly
challenging. 

METAPOLITIK.ORG seeks to address this by formulating,
exploring and codifying new methods of charting, mapping and analyzing
aggregated data sources and displaying this political data at a glance
in an easy to read format. As well as to create a collaborative platform
for interaction that allows us to share, disseminate and decipher this
data in as holistic, non-authoritarian and thoroughly decentralized a
manner as possible. 

'DEEP': is a reference to the term
'deep-democracy', coined by psychiatrist _Arny Mindell_ to describe a
political system that enables a deeper, more democratic level of
socio-political interaction. In a deep democracy, citizens will have
direct influence over public policy, without the need for the parasitic
political class that we have grown so accustomed to. It is now possible
to achieve this with the aid of the Internet. 


<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_democracy</A> [32] 

'GREEN': of course,
refers to the concept of 'green politics' - which is to say - a
political ideology which places high importance on environmental goals,
while achieving these goals through broad-based, grassroots,
participatory democracy (thus, 'green politics' are inherently 'deep
democracy' politics by virtue of their grass-roots approach). Green
politics are advocated by supporters of the Green movement, which has
been active through Green parties in many nations since the early 1980s.


 <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics</A> [33] 

SOCIAL: simply
describes the inherently _social_ aspects of _soc_iety. Though the term
_'socialism'_ has been demonized and vilified by the right, we already
live in a socialist economy in many ways. All societies socialize some
resources and capitalize others depending on an essentially arbitrary
set of values that are ascribed to each respectively. In the US,
examples of socialized resources include _bailouts_ for banking cartels,
_Social Security_, _Medicare_, _Medicaid_, _Workers Compensation_ and
_Unemployment Insurance_. Just as communism is - at it's core - about
_commun_ity.

OPEN SOURCE DEMOCRACY

The term 'open source' comes to us from
the world of software development and refers to a set of production and
documentation standards that promote access to the end product's source
materials or 'code'. Some consider open source a philosophy, others
consider it a pragmatic methodology. Before the term open source became
widely adopted, developers and producers used a variety of phrases to
describe the concept. 

'Open source' eventually gained hold with the
rise of the Internet, and the corresponding need for a massive retooling
of computing source code. This in-turn enabled a self-enhancing
diversity of production models, communication paths, and interactive
communities. A new, three-word phrase: _&quot;open source software_ &quot; was
born to describe the environment that the new copyright, licensing,
domain, and consumer issues created. 

Douglas Rushkoff [36] defines an
open source democracy [37] as 'what happens when the open source
development model is applied to the economy'. In 'Applying the Theory'
he observes: 

&gt;<i> _&quot;...It would mean coming to appreciate the rules of
</I>the economic game for what they are: [arbitrary] rules. Operating in a
closed source fashion, the right to actually produce currency is held
exclusively by the Federal Reserve. Quietly removed from any
relationship to real money such as gold or silver by Richard Nixon in
the early 1970s, US currency now finds its value in pure social
construction._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ___&quot;Whether or not we know it, we all participate
</I>in the creation of its value by competing for dollars against one
another. For example, when a people or businesses borrows money from the
bank (an agent, in a sense, of the Federal Reserve) in the form of a
mortgage they must eventually pay the bank back two or three times the
original borrowed amount. These additional funds are not printed into
existence, but must be won from others in the closed source system.
Likewise, every time a student wants to buy one of my books, he must go
out into the economy and earn or win some of these arbitrarily concocted
tokens, US currency, in order to do it. Our transaction is brokered by
the Federal Reserve, who has a monopoly on this closed source currency._

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;Meanwhile, the actual value of this currency, and the effort
</I>required to obtain it, is decided much more by market speculators than
its actual users. Speculation accounts for over 90 percent of US
currency transactions in any given day. By this measure, real spending
and the real economy are a tiny and secondary function of money: the dog
is being wagged by its tail._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;What if currency were to become
</I>open source? In some communities it already is. They are not printing
counterfeit bills but catalyzing regional economies through the use of
local currencies, locally created 'scrip' that can be exchanged
throughout a particular region in lieu of Federal Reserve notes or real
cash. The use of these currencies, as promoted by organizations such as
the E.F. Schumacher Society, has been shown to accelerate the exchange
of goods and services in a region by increasing the purchasing power of
its members. There is no Federal Reserve surcharge on the creation and
maintenance of cash, and no danger of government currency depreciation
due to matters that have nothing to do with actual production and
consumption._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;Like any other bottom-up system, the creation of
</I>local currency develops transactional models appropriate to the scale of
the actual transactions and the communities in which they occur. While
Federal notes, or Euros for that matter, might be appropriate for a
merchant to use across state or national boundaries, local currencies
make for greater fluidity and accountability between members of the same
community._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;Thanks to the dynamic relationships permitted in a
</I>networked society, we need not choose between local and closed
currencies. A post-renaissance perspective on economic issues has room
for both to exist, simultaneously functioning on different orders of
magnitude._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;In a society modeled on open source ideals, 'think
</I>globally, act locally' becomes more than just a catch phrase. The
relationship of an individual or local community's action to the whole
system can be experienced quite readily. For example, an open source
software developer who writes just a few useful lines of code, say the
protocol for enabling infrared communications to work on the Linux
operating system, will see his or her contribution interpolated into the
kernel of the operating system and then spread to everyone who uses it.
He has done more than distributed a line of computer code. He has also
enabled thousands of people using Linux to connect cell phones, PDA's
and other devices to their computers for the first time. And he did it
from his home, in his spare time._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;Likewise, a developer who
</I>leaves a security hole open in a piece of software quite dramatically
sees the results of his action when a software 'worm', written by a
computer criminal, penetrates the mail files of thousands of users,
sending replicates of itself throughout the internet, sometimes for
years to come.09_ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;Members of an open source community are able
</I>to experience how their actions affect the whole. As a result, they
become more conscious of how their moment-to-moment decisions can be
better aligned with the larger issues with which they are concerned. A
programmer concerned with energy consumption and the environment might
take time to consider how a particular screen-saver routine impacts the
total energy consumption pattern of a particular monitor. The programmer
already understands that if the code is used on millions of machines,
each effort to reduce energy consumption by a minuscule amount can
amplify into tremendous energy savings. (Indeed, it has been calculated
that the energy required to power all the televisions and computers in
America that are currently in sleep mode equals the output of an entire
average-size power plant.)_ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;The experience of open source
</I>development, or even just the acceptance of its value as a model for
others, provides real-life practice for the deeper change in perspective
required of us if we are to move into a more networked and emergent
understanding of our world. The local community must be experienced as a
place to implement policies, incrementally, that will eventually have an
effect on the whole. For example, the environmental advocate who worries
about the Brazilian rainforest will quit smoking himself before racing
off to the next rally held to save the lungs of the planet. The woman
organizing against genetic engineering in agriculture will refuse to let
her children eat at McDonalds, even if it requires them to bring their
own lunch to a friend's birthday party. A consistency between belief and
behavior becomes the only way to make our designs on reality real._ 
&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> _&quot;Closed source: no justice, no power_ 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;An open source model
</I>for participatory, bottom-up and emergent policy will force us, or allow
us, to confront the issues of our time more directly. Using the logic of
a computer programmer, when we find we can't solve a problem by
attacking one level of societal software, we proceed to the next level
down. If necessary we dig all the way down to the machine language. _ 
&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> _&quot;For instance, today's misunderstood energy crisis provides a
</I>glaring example of the liability of closed source policy-making. The
Western World is unnecessarily addicted to fossil fuels and other energy
commodities not because alternative energy sources are unavailable, but
because alternative business models for energy production cannot be
fully considered without disrupting the world's most powerful
corporations and economies._ 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _&quot;It really is as simple as
</I>that.&quot;_

MEANWHILE, KEVIN KELLY OF  WRITES: 

&gt;<i> _&quot;Rather than viewing
</I>technological socialism as one side of a zero-sum trade-off between
free-market individualism and centralized authority, it can be seen as a
cultural OS that elevates both the individual and the group at once. The
largely unarticulated but intuitively understood goal of communitarian
technology is this: to maximize both individual autonomy and the power
of people working together. Thus, digital socialism can be viewed as a
third way that renders irrelevant the old debates.&quot;_

_THUS,_ In a true,
'free-market' economy (just like in a true democracy) all participants
would be given equal legal protections and equal access to information
and resources. In a truly democratic society (a deep democracy) the
corporation is replaced by the community and members of that community
are permitted to contract with one another for the goods and services
that they need to prosper. Thus, Capital is itself, a social construct.


 [38] 

IN THE SAME ISSUE OF , Chris Anderson WRITES:  

&quot;Imagine an
AT&amp;T that breaks up into not two or three different companies but two or
three hundred thousand different companies,&quot; Malone told Wired [39] in a
July 1998 interview. &quot;This sort of voluntary, radical disaggregation is
an attractive alternative for some large organizations.&quot;

DEMOCRACY 2.0

In April of 2010 - while mourning my father's death and
in the midst of deep personal crisis - I envisioned METAPOLITIK.ORG, an
open, transparent framework for 'deep democratic dialogue'. The idea was
simple, to create an accessible, inclusive, online-forum and
polling-system where real working people could determine the issues and
view opinions of their peers in a real-time manner, similar to Facebook
or Google Analytics. 

The vision was to create a viable alternative to
the skewed two-party media debate as well as an online voting framework
that would call into question the basic assumptions underlying our
two-party electoral system, the electoral college and perhaps even the
assumed need for 'representatives', who of course, only seem to ever
represent their own interests. I for one, have always questioned
'representational' government and have always wondered what the world
might be like if we could represent ourselves in politics the way we do
on our Facebook pages and our blogs? 

Imagine what our democracy might
look like if it were designed today using modern technology and security
safeguards: No electoral college, no closed primaries forcing candidates
to bend to powerful special interests, no antiquated voting booths and
arcane mechanical devices, no long 

&gt;<i> owerful media corporations
</I>putting their spin on things in a top-down, one-way dialogue aimed more
at spreading corporate propaganda than at telling the truth, we would
all chime-in on the issues of the day via video, blogs, and powerful,
secure-polling software that all of us carried in the palm of our hands.
Modern defenders of pluralist government would no doubt devise a process
that was open, citizen-driven, and capable of producing policy that
truly reflected the Will of The People. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Like most
</I>however, this
one was a lot easier to dream up than it was to implement. Building the
software and the proper secure server environment for an actual
techno-democracy had (to the best of my knowledge) never been done
before and all sorts of difficult questions had to be answered first
like: Who would host it? Who would administer the server? How would we
insure against hacking and virus-based attempts to defraud the system?
How would we insure against a technocracy run by system administrators?
In other words, how could we ensure that we did not recreate the very
problems that we sought to solve in the first place? 

These are
important questions for any thinking person to ask themselves, much less
anyone engaged in any level of civic discourse or in developing a next
generation voting engine. For as any historian can tell you, as cultures
evolve and the meanings of words change, a political system set up to
nurture people's liberty may one day later be subverted to take those
liberties away. This meant, that in order for me to responsibly pursue
such an endeavor I was going to need to do a lot of research first.
Perhaps more importantly, I would need to know if anyone had already
tried anything similar or was already thinking along these lines. This
led me to the rediscovery of Rushkoff's work in promoting what he calls
'Open Source Democracy', a real-time, networked democratic process which
is both thoroughly transparent and thoroughly inclusive across
boundaries of class and race.

HOLLYWOOD BABYLON -
RE-EXAMINING THE RED / BLUE ORTHODOXY

Even a cursory examination of
American politics immediately reveals the bizarre red/blue color-coding
and groupings used to discuss the issues and to push people into
positions along party-lines. While analyzing these red/blue,
conservative/liberal dichotomies that the entire debate seems inevitably
framed in, I eventually came to the observation that our 2 1/2 party
political system, in which one party - the party of the rich - always
manages to get it's way, is in it's essence a deliberate cybernetic
mechanism which is systematically used to undermine and short circuit
the democratic process in various, nefarious ways. 

Like an old set of
1950's red &amp; blue 3D-glasses stuck over our eyes, we are expected to
believe that one of these two puppet-parties have our interests
at-heart, when in-fact, they are both funded by Madison Ave., Wall
Street, Hollywood and the criminal Drug/Oil/Military/Industrial Cartels.
They are more interested in promoting Globalism, exploiting cheap
foreign-labor and busting unions than they are in protecting the
American people. 

And much like the visual-effect that one gets using a
pair of 3D glasses, this stilted red/blue debate is really an illusion
designed by wealthy political think tanks to take our attention away
from the most important issues in this country, which of course, are
those of unemployment, class-warfare and the horribly uneven
distribution of wealth. Issues which go hand-in-hand with the equally
important issues of the environment, our dependence on foreign oil, our
truly, unapologetic imperialist foreign-policy and our economic
dependence on China. The US seems hell-bent on destroying itself with
outmoded economic and military policies that have absolutely no place in
the civilized world. 

The cognitive dissonance is beyond schizophrenic:
We claim to be against slavery when we tolerate and support a corporate
culture of wage slavery in our workplaces every day. We claim to be
against totalitarian dictatorships but we tolerate and support
totalitarianism in third world countries and prop-up foreign dictators
with frightening regularity. 

Rick Moody of the Guardian.uk [42]
informs us - in spite of Hollywood's reputation for being a largely
'liberal' industry - in reality, the entertainment industry is an
increasingly crypto-fascist propaganda mill. 

Ultimately, as Michael
Moore [43], Alex Knight  [44]and (many) others have repeatedly observed,
what really is called into question is the economic system of capitalism
and what it needs to be replaced with is a system that is truly
democratic. Just as the slavery so common in the early Americas needed
to be replaced, yet still echoes throughout our society in the form of
poverty and ravaged communities. 

But what does a true democracy look
like? Especially in a networked world where entire social movements like
the Egyptian uprising can happen in a matter of days or even hours with
the help of web technology? And what shape does this democracy take? If
a two-party electoral system isn't working, then what sort of system
would? And of course, in order for all of this to be_ truly democratic_,
won't 'THE PEOPLE' have to answer these questions themselves? 

_Well,
first we've got to get them talking to each other._ 

 All people
(unless they suffer from severe emotional damage) want essentially the
same things for themselves and their fellow humans: peace and
prosperity. However, different political parties and ideologies have
very differing ideas about how to achieve these goals. 

&gt;<i>From a
</I>&quot;conservative&quot; (red/republican/libertarian) perspective, the economy is
a zero-sum game in which we all must compete against each other for
resources. Whereas from a &quot;liberal&quot; (blue / democrat) perspective, the
economy is a state-administered zero-sum game in which order must be
maintained via the rule of law. In the US, these two polar economic
views monopolize the debate and make it nearly impossible for creative,
divergent viewpoints to get involved in the political process. Thus, the
green party is currently atrophied and desperately in need of an influx
of political capital (people. not money). 

The map below is a
&quot;cartograph&quot;, or visualization of the political maps of the US, based on
the 2008 Presidential election. Notice that all of the color fields are
entire districts and that all districts are filled with completely solid
colors. 

While it may not be obvious to the casual observer, this map
is actually lacking in a great deal of statistical data to the extent
that it does not have a high degree of granularity. By applying the
winner-take-all effect of the map to show which parties won which
districts, the map fails to reveal an accurate picture of the public's
leanings, in that the map gives the visual impression that a district
won by a Republican Party candidate has no Democratic Party or Green
Party voters. 

The cartographs below on the other hand, were published
by Mark Newman, from the University of Michigan. These visualizations
provide more accuracy than the traditional red-state/blue-state mapping
system, this is done by county, using Red, Blue or shades of Purple,
based on their percentage of vote. The Map on the right uses the same
color scheme, but with each of the counties scaled to visually show
their population size. The idea is to help us see the voter breakdown by
population more accurately. Producing an oddly shaped but recognizable
map.

THE RADICAL CENTER - A THIRD WAY

The THIRD WAY
[46] refers to various political positions which try to reconcile
right-wing [47] and left-wing politics [48] by advocating a varying
synthesis of right-wing economic and left-wing social policies. 

Third
Way approaches are commonly viewed from within the first- and second-way
perspectives as representing a centrist [49] reconciliation between
capitalism [50] and state socialist [51] command economy [52]. Less
often, the phrase _&quot;Third Way&quot;_ is used to refer to Distributism [53].
or similar Populist [54] or Progressive [55] policies such as FDR's New
Deal or (more recently) ideas such as Resource Based Economics (RBE)
[56]. 

Another example of Third Way politics would be the &quot;Radical
Center [57]&quot; - or: a philosophy [58] as well as an associated political
movement [59] and position on the political spectrum. Adherents of this
philosophy claim to improve policy and general politics by not harboring
a bias toward the precedence of either markets or the state, as can be
characterized of right-wing politics [60] and left-wing politics [61]
respectively. 

Various groups have adopted _radical center_ as a term
to describe a philosophy which includes their belief that, in affirming
the core principles involved on both sides of a dilemma, the dilemma or
disagreement can be rendered moot [62]. The terms _radical center_ and
_radical middle_ are often used interchangeably, although the former
more often refers to a political movement or current and the latter to a
political philosophy. 

The latter use reflects an emphasis on epistemic
virtue [63], by resolving false dilemmas [64], finding the _excluded
middle_. As a relatively grassroots [65] movement, especially in the
United States [66], there is no definitive statement of radical middle
politics. A primary recurring theme, however, might be the idea of
&quot;sustainably improving choices.&quot; As is often the case with centrism
[67], it can be said that the radical middle or center is an ideology
broadly analogous with the ideas, principles and values of progressivism
[68].

SOCIAL THREEFOLDING

SOCIAL THREEFOLDING [70] is
a sociological [71] theory that suggests increasing the independence of
society's three primary realms (economy [72], politics [73] and culture
[74]) in such a way that those three realms can mutually correct each
other in an ongoing process. The movement aims for equality of rights in
political life, freedom in cultural life, and associative cooperation in
economic life. It originated out of the philosophy of Anthroposophy [75]
founded by Rudolf Steiner [76]. 

Steiner held that it is socially
destructive when one of the three spheres attempts to dominate the
others; for example, theocracy means a cultural impulse dominates
economy and politics; conventional shareholder capitalism means economic
life dominates the polity and culture; and state socialism means
government dominates culture and economy. 

A more specific example:
Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter [77] has suggested that governments
frequently fail when they begin to give &quot;discretionary, particularly
preferential privileges to competitive industry.&quot; Steiner said the three
social spheres had very gradually, over thousands of years, been growing
independent of each other, and would naturally tend to continue to do
so. Consciously effecting stages of this independence thus works in
accordance with society's natural evolution, and gradually leads society
beyond the three forms of domination mentioned. 

Steiner distinguished
three realms of society: 

 	* the economy [78];
 	* politics [79] and
human rights [80]; and
 	* cultural institutions [81], including
science, education, arts and religion.

He suggested that the three
would only function together harmoniously when each was granted
sufficient independence. This has become known as &quot;social threefolding&quot;.


Many institutions have striven to realize a relative independence of
the three spheres within their own structures; the Waldorf schools [82]
deserve special mention in this regard. Another application has been the
creation of various socially-responsible banks and foundations. Though
many concrete reform proposals to advance a &quot;threefold social order&quot; at
various scales have been advanced, Steiner emphasized that the specifics
of how this could best be done are contingent on the particular
situation. Bernard Lievegoed [83] incorporated significant aspects of
social threefolding in his work on organizational development [84].

JOIE DE VIVRE

Jason Farago [86] over at The Guardian UK
has written a salient post regarding [87] the strategically brilliant
location chosen for the protests:  

 [88]&quot;As many as 2,000 people have
attended the twice-daily general assemblies, and thousands upon
thousands of passers-by have read the cardboard signs - many eloquent,
some bonkers - lining the entrance on Broadway. But nobody has craned
his neck upward: the entire protest [89] is going down under a 20-ton
steel sculpture that reaches 70ft in the air and, by the way, is painted
a _bright proletarian [90] red_. Even in New York, that should be hard
to miss. 

The sculpture is &quot;Joie de Vivre&quot;, by Mark di Suvero [91], and
its simultaneous predominance and invisibility at Occupy Wall Street
carries a biting irony. Di Suvero is one of the great artists of the
American left, a member of the city's crane operators' union, who went
into exile to protest the Vietnam war. Its irrelevance to the young
folks down at Occupy Wall Street may be of a piece with their chant on
the Brooklyn Bridge last weekend that &quot;the whole world is watching&quot; - a
phrase that a few of them must realise dates all the way back to the
demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Or the
sculpture's erasure may have a darker meaning: high capital has already
absorbed one generation of protesters into its logic, and this one
probably won't fare much better.&quot;

SYNERGETICS

&gt;<i> Jason Farago, or the other 99%
</I>know it, this sculpture has stronger, deeper and more meaningful
connotations than any of them seem to be aware. I'm pretty sure that the
artist, Mark di Suvero, understands these implications perfectly well...
But alas, he doesn't seem to be talking. That is, except for this single
paragraph in the interview: 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> _&quot;It's not an X,&quot; the sculptor no
</I>less genially- explosively corrected this writer during a telephone
interview. &quot;There's no X in it! It's a series of TETRAHEDRONS that are
open at the ends. Yes, of course I call it a piece. A sculpture. Yes, of
course IT CAN BE TAKEN APART AND PUT BACK TOGETHER. That's what's unique
about these pieces [his life's work]: They can be disassembled.&quot;
_[emphasis mine]
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _TETRAHEDRAL MODULARITY__. _Sounds like the work
</I>of the late _MR. R. BUCKIMINSTER FULLER_ (_July 12, 1895 - July 1,
1983_), or _&quot;Bucky&quot;_ as he's known to his fans and friends. Bucky, as
some of you may know - was responsible for a grand and brilliant body of
work and a very unique legacy. Like his contemporary, _Jaques Fresco_
[1], he was a champion of ideas addressing the needs of_ all people _and
was an en
neer in his day with 28 US patents bearing his name. The most
famous of these is perhaps the 'geodesic dome' or 'geodesic sphere' like
the one seen at _Disneys Epcot Center_ [94] in south Florida. 

 [95]But
what is less well know is that - much like Jaques Fresco's 'Venus
Project' and 'resource Based Economy', Bucky had his own body of work
known as _&quot;Synergetics [96]&quot;_ - a cross-disciplinary approach to systems
thinking and as such: a metaphoric language for communicating
experiences using geomet

&gt;<i> e the empirical study of systems in
</I>transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by
the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long
before the term _'synergy [2]'_ became popular in corporate jargon.]

alt=&quot;Sphere Packing&quot; /&gt;_&quot;SYNERGETICS is the empirical study of systems
in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted
by the behavior of any isolated components, including humanity's role as
both participant and observer. Since systems are identifiable at every
scale from the quantum level to the cosmic, and humanity both
articulates the behavior of these systems and is composed of these
systems, synergetics is a very broad discipline, and embraces a broad
range of scientific and philosophical studies including tetrahedral and
close-packed-sphere geometries, thermodynamics, chemistry, psychology,
biochemistry, economics, philosophy and theology.&quot;_  

 [97]...Thus,
Synergetics is a legitimate branch of Cybernetics [98]. , also known as
Generalized Systems Theory. Synergetics defines the primary unit of
space as a tetrahedron (as opposed to the cube) and - in Design Science 
[99]- is more oriented toward round, circular, spherical enclosures.
This is in direct contrast and opposition to much of so-called
'civilized society' which by and large prefers the cube as it's basic
unit of enclosing space. 

(This is evident when looking at the way that
city streets are typically laid-out, how buildings are typically
constructed and how much of our society is - in general - based on
squares, cubes and right-angles). 

Fuller also observed that the
natural analytic geometry of the universe  -- which he termed
'synergetics [100]' -- was invariably based on arrays of tessellating,
interlocking and nesting tetrahedra [101] e: 100%;&quot;&gt;. He developed this
idea in several ways, from the idea of close-packing spheres (like cells
in an organism) to the number of compressive or tensile members required
to stabilize an object in space (spaceframe [3]). This is an apt
metaphor for our interconnectedness on this planet - be it environmental
or economic. 
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Buckminster Fuller was one of the first to propagate
</I>a systemic worldview, exploring principles of energy and ma
ency in the
fields of architecture, engineering and design. He cited geologist
Fran&#231;ois de Chardenedes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of
its replacement cost out of our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially,
the net incoming solar flux), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot;
per U.S. gallon (US $300,000 per liter) to produce. From this point of
view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work
represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings. 

Sounding like a
Zen master with a PhD, Fuller once wrote: _&quot;...I am not a thing -- a
noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process - an integral
function of the universe.&quot; _The ancient figure below illustrates the
timeless permanence of Fuller's insight. So called primitive societies
_intuitively_ understood the interdependent, cyclic nature of the
Earth's ecology. How did we forget? 

Fuller was concerned about
sustainability and about human survival under the existing
socio-economic system, yet he remained optimistic about humanity's
future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the _&quot;technological
ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs
of life&quot;_, his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth [102]&quot;
caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity
had attained an unprecedented state. 

He was convinced that as a result
of our accumulated knowledge, combined with the vast quantities of
_recyclable_ resources we had already extracted from the earth, we'd
attained a critical level of progress that rendered competition for
resources largely unnecessary. Cooperation had instead become the
optimum survival strategy. _&quot;Selfishness,&quot;_ he declared, _&quot;is
unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete.&quot;_
While this may sound overly idealistic or 'pie in the sky', it should be
noted that the corporations that succeed in today's economy, often do so
by virtue of their ability to cooperate with one another.

RESOURCE BASED ECONOMICS

While Bucky Fuller was busy developing
and championing the philosophy of Synergetics, _Jaques Fresco_ [104],
was busy dreaming up:_ &quot;The Venus Project [105]&quot;:_  

_&quot;THE VENUS
PROJECT is an organization that advocates American futurist Fresco's
vision of the future with the aim of improving society by moving towards
a global sustainable social design that they call a &quot;resource-based
economy [106]&quot;. Such a system incorporates sustainable cities and
values, energy efficiency, collective farms, natural resource management
and advanced automation, focusing on the benefits that these
developments will bring to humanity. The name of the organization
originates from Venus, Florida, where its research center is located,
near Lake Okeechobee. Within the center are ten buildings, designed by
Fresco, which showcase the architecture of the project. Future by
Design, a film about the life and work of Jacque Fresco, was produced in
2006.&quot;_  

 [107]Interesting... &quot;_sustainable social design&quot; ...
&quot;sustainable cities and values&quot;...&quot;energy efficiency&quot; ... &quot;collective
farms&quot;... &quot;natural resource management&quot;... &quot;advanced automation_&quot;...
Sounds like if you combined these with _FDR'S &quot;Second Bill of Rights
[108]&quot;_, it might make a good list of DEMANDS for the protesters at
Occupy Wall St.. Also, by an interesting bit of synchronicity, Venus
Florida is not that far from Epcot Center. I wonder if that was a
deliberate decision?

In a
'resource-based economy', resources are held in a public trust as the
property of the people, moving beyond the need for the artificial
boundaries that separate individuals in a community._ Ideally_, in a
global, resource-based economy, all of the planet's resources are held
as the common heritage of Earth's people, transcending the need for the
artificial boundaries that separate all individuals and cultures. This
is the unifying imperative. 

The term '_resource-based economy_' was
originated by designer and futurist, Jacque Fresco [109]. It is a system
in which all goods and services are available without the use of money,
credits, barter or any other system of debt or servitude. All resources
become the common heritage of all of the inhabitants, _not just a select
few._ 

A resource-based economy will utilize existing resources from
the land and sea, physical equipment, industrial plants, etc. to enhance
the lives of the total population. In an economy based on resources
rather than money, we will easily produce all of the necessities of life
and provide a high standard of living for all while simultaneously
reducing our levels of consumption and waste by stream-lining the
production, distribution and organization of resources.  

Consider the
following examples: At the beginning of World War II the US had a mere
600 or so first-class fighting aircraft. We rapidly overcame this short
supply by turning out more than 90,000 planes a year. The question at
the start of World War II was: _Do we have enough funds to produce the
required implements of war?_ The answer:_ No_, we did not have enough
money, nor did we have enough gold; but we did have more than enough
resources. It was the available _resources_ that enabled the US to
achieve the high production and efficiency required to win the war. 


Unfortunately this approach only seems to be considered in times of
war or national emergency. Between the state of the economy and the
current crisis in the Gulf, we'd say a state of national emergency
exists.  

A resource-based economy will overcome scarcity by using
renewable sources of energy, food and materials, as well as
computerized, semi-automated manufacturing and inventory and the
limitless resource of human potential and collective will. It will
maintain safe, energy-efficient cities featuring advanced,
ecologically-sound transportation systems, and will provide universal
health care, relevant education and universal access to employment. This
can be accomplished by creating a new set of economic incentives based
on _humane values_ and environmental concerns and which negate the
shallow, self-centered goals of individual wealth, property, power and
privilege. 

As Comedian __ recently pointed out while brandishing an
iPhone: _&quot;This thing has more power than a cold war supercomputer and I
can't have clean energy?!&quot; _Black also thinks we should _&quot;Invade BP&quot;_.
Not a bad idea. They could use some wealth-redistribution right about
now. And they call themselves a socialized industry.

SYNERGETIC ECONOMY

Of course, the question inevitably gets asked:
_&quot;Who will pay for it?&quot;_ ...A question loaded with so many false basic
assumptions, so riddled with shaky logic and so indicative of the
complete cluelessness that capitalist society has indoctrinated us
with... That it hardly seems to warrant consideration. However, since
this is the first question the average US Citizen will probably ask, I
will spell it out for you: 

The entire premise of currency or of
_&quot;money&quot;_ is a deeply flawed construct and a complete legal fiction that
enables a non-working leisure class to parasitically feed off of the
lower and middle class in our society. The institution of our modern
monetary system has been deliberately put in place to ensure that those
at the top stay at the top (_as do their offspring_) while everyone else
gets the shaft. This spans the spectrum from the (_privately-owned_)
Federal Reserve Banking System to the fact that many private bankers get
cushy, powerful appointments in the Treasury Department and various
Federal economic oversight committees where they proceed to further
pillage our economic system with wild abandon. 

Unlike the hyperbolic
ravings from the right over the years about the _&quot;Red Threat&quot;_ (_in the
1950's_) and _&quot;Terrorists&quot; _(_now_)... These ideas are not simply
ideological islands or the work of fringe thinkers - they are
thoughtful, deliberate attempts to solve very real, complex problems by
seasoned, articulate, educated people with concise goals and precise
objectives. _AND WE NEED THEM._ _Why? _Because between global warming
and the rapid expansion of the Earth's population - these ideas
constitute the best hope for survival that we have as a species. If we
don't stop collectively marshaling these insights as a culture, we
aren't going to make it into the _22nd Century or beyond_. 

 [111]Much
like _Nikola Tesla's_ [112] work nearly 100 years ago, mavericks and
brilliant, creative thinkers like Fuller and Fresco have left an
important body of (_largely unfinished_) work that is still being
studied, explored and modeled-after by creative thinkers to this day. A
great example is: __, an art collective in the Netherlands the have
adapted these ideas - Fuller's work in particular - to create a variety
of brilliant, minimalist conceptual frameworks and paradigms for almost
anything you can think of. From their _&quot;Manuals [113]&quot;_ on basic
concepts like _&quot;Land [114]&quot;,_ _&quot;Work [115]&quot;_ and _&quot;Movement [116]&quot;_ to
more complex projects like the _&quot;N55 Spaceframe [117]&quot;_ and the
_&quot;Floating Platform [118]&quot;_, N55 has taken Fuller's 'Synergetic' ideas
to their logical conclusion and beyond. Developing sustainable,
low-impact solutions for travel, play, labor and life that could be
deployed rapidly and cheaply to solve many of the issues that are facing
our society. 

_&quot;All truth passes through three stages. First, it is
ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as
being self-evident.&quot;_ 

_~Schopenhauer_

THE MYTH OF
'RATIONAL SELF INTEREST'

In a society who's primary economic philosophy
consists of stating flatly: _&quot;self interest IS rational&quot;_, any form of
altruism or desire to help others becomes ipso-facto: _irr_ational. We
now know that this somewhat bizarre line of reasoning (known as:
'social-Darwinism') is a _deeply_ flawed relic from some former,
harsher, more patriarchal period of history that we have thankfully
stepped out of. Clearly, markets_ do not_, cannot and _will not_
regulate themselves effectively. 

On a small planet with finite
resources -- where we all breathe the same air, drink the same water and
eat the same food from the same oceans and farms -- there is simply no
logic in competitive behavior. Thus, the cultural meme of so-called
'rational self-interest' will be inoculated - as ignorance always is,
eventually - by a deep, shared understanding of 'Enlightened Self
Interest [120]' or: '_SUSTAINABLE ALTRUISM_
t-966&quot;&gt;'. Examples of
sustainable altruism range from micro finance to crowd-sourcing and even
include collaborative technologies such as Wikipedia [121] and Drupal
[122]. 

This will be a difficult task, but worth it in every way. The
real challenge comes from our own cherished, unexamined beliefs about
the world. We are collectively inundated by the doctrine of rational
self interest on a daily basis by every pundit, politician, product
placement and PowerPoint presentation we come into contact with. The
American establishment spends billions of dollars keeping that steady
drumbeat of propaganda rhythmically and ceaselessly pounding into our
collective head. 

In order to effectively inoculate ourselves against
this 'thought virus' that has infected the body politic, we must learn
to identify it and attack it at every opportunity. It is a Jingoistic
hook designed to keep things exactly the way that they are... Until
recently, it's worked pretty well.  

We're talking about sacrificing
principles based on greed, waste and 'rational self interest' for
principles based on efficiency and shared resources, equality and
rational fairness... 

What could be any more &quot;rational&quot;or 'fiscally
sound' than that?

MAPPING THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM


[124] 

While analyzing the problem of Red/Blue Orthodoxy in light of
Buckminster Fuller's concept of Synergetics: It became clear to me that
the traditional 2-dimensional / 2-axis map of the political-spectrum
(such as the Nolan Chart [125] for example) was insufficient for mapping
the complex ways that people think about and discuss politics. While it
outlines the difference between &quot;authoritarianism&quot; and &quot;individualism&quot;
and attempts to show us where these concepts seem to intersect with
&quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; ideals, it does not address:
corporatism, labor, or the staggering impact of technology. 

Since just
about everyone I have ever met falls-into or defines themselves
politically by one of several 'camps', it seemed suitable _(for the time
being at least)_ to let the labels lay where they may and to use the
existing red/green/blue party-affiliation labels to define where a
person stood on any particular issue.  

I envisioned a color-coding
system, or 'color-wheel' - utilizing a Venn diagram [126] of the parties
- that would allow a person to map their political 'colors' (above,
left), based on their stance on various issues ranging from health-care
to the environment, foreign-policy to economics, you name it. Based on
their answers to these questions, a person's 'political colors' would
become apparent and they could then use this information to find other
people in the network that they shared their values with and could then
use the platform as a communications-tool for open discussion with that
person or persons. 

Thus, 'greens' could network with other 'greens',
'blues' with 'blues' and so on. More importantly, it would allow users
to find common-ground or areas of agreement with people in other parties
based on where their interests _intersected_. This could all be tied-in
with the Google Maps API so that geographic maps of public opinions
could be generated and people could finally get a handle on American
politics without the 'camera obscura' of mainstream media putting it's
childish, dualistic spin on everything. 

This three-party political map
where certain interests overlap is - in some respects - a lot easier to
communicate to someone than say, the Nolan Chart [127], which is
basically two-sided and thus, only reflective of the old red/blue
dichotomy. Ironically our only remotely viable third-party in this
country happens to be labeled 'green', which is about the same color as
the money that we collectively don't have to compete in Federal
elections. Thus, a democracy that truly respects the will of 'The
People' will not be controlled simply be red or blue interests at any
one time, but will be an open forum in-which red,green and blue
perspectives all have an equal voice and an equal-access to direct
democracy through real-time participation. 

The interesting thing about
this approach is that by sheer coincidence, the colors red, green and
blue also happen to be the three constituent-colors of all light that is
visible to humans. This is why color TVs and computer monitors were
called 'RGB' for years _(Sony branded theirs the 'Trinitron' but it was
the same basic concept)_, as they are capable of reproducing all three
colors and thereby, the entire visible spectrum.

3-AXIS HEXADECIMAL MAPPING |+|AMP|+| NON-LINEAR THINKING

 [129] 

A
more accurate mapping of the body politic would probably more closely
resemble a sphere, a hexagon, or an isometrically-projected 3D-cube,
depicted as a gradient color-wheel - similar to what one sees when
choosing a color in a graphics program such as Photoshop or Gimp. 

This
hexadecimal color-chart that web-developers use to quickly find the
color codes that they are looking for is also a great example: 

The
very word 'spectrum' evokes the idea of linearity (lines). However, this
one-dimensional approach leaves a lot to be desired in that it polarizes
all political discourse into one of two competing groups and proceeds to
ignore and marginalize various viewpoints that do not necessarily fit
into the red/blue framing of the political debate. 

As observed
elsewhere in this article, this is not unlike looking at the world
through a set of old 1950s 3D glasses with their red and blue celluloid
lenses.

SOFTWARE

[_AUTOR'S NOTE: THIS IS ALL VERY
MUCH IN THE 'VAPORWARE' STAGES AND MANY - IF NOT ALL - OF THE DETAILS
HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED._] 

METAPOLITIK is basically software
designed to ascribe a hexadecimal [131] (RGB) additive [132] color-value
to various people, organizations, or ideas based on their views on
various social, economic and environmental issues. These views are then
expressed by an individual's level of &quot;Red [133]&quot; (Right, Republican,
'Conservative', etc...), &quot;Green [134]&quot; (Green, Radical, Anarchist,
etc...) or &quot;Blue [135]&quot; (Liberal, Democrat, etc...) ideals. In so-doing,
it creates corresponding 'value-categories' or 'collusion-factors' -
colors that are ascribed to each group's bones of contention. 

THUS...


&quot;REDS&quot; correspond to the color: CYAN (labor / worker's-rights) - since
the Republican Party is so often opposed to populist or progressive
legislation or anything else that compromises economic prosperity for
the rich. 

[ _IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS MAP PERTAINS LARGELY TO US
POLITICS. FOR INSTANCE, THIS IS THE ONLY COUNTRY ON THE PLANET__ (that I
know of) __WERE 'RED' HAS COME TO MEAN CAPITALIST / CONSERVATIVE INSTEAD
OF COMMUNIST / SOCIALIST_ ] 

&quot;GREENS&quot; are ascribed: MAGENTA (economy:
state-power / monetary-control / economic-regulation) for their
opposition to what they perceive as &quot;fascist&quot; (state-centered) political
ideologies and/or: greed, mercantilism and imperialism. 

&quot;BLUES&quot; are
assigned: YELLOW (liberty: personal-responsibility: individual autonomy,
freedom, etc...) since &quot;Blues&quot; are so often centered on expansion of
government, legislation, taxes, etc... and since they typically support
limiting certain freedoms such as gun ownership, etc... 

All of these
secondary colors (CMYK) are - within this context also known as
_'collusion-factors'_ because - in addition to illustrating contrast or
conflict, they also constitute areas where each camp finds the
opportunity for common ground and as a result - progressive
policymaking. 

An area where everyone is in agreement has no color and
is considered 'clear'. If this is at all confusing, please see the
images below: 

   [136] 

If you've forgotten how additive color [137]
works (_the _RGB _technology behind a TV set_), check out:


<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model</A> [138]


<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color</A> [139] 

Thus, the basic
premise of Metapolitik is that the two-party red / blue politics in this
country (conservative / liberal, capitalist / socialist, privatized /
public, etc...) are hopelessly skewed without the influx of green ideas
and policies. 

[We are currently seeing these &quot;Green&quot; ideas expressed
en masse at the protests in New York and around the world [140]] 

Thus,
a balanced political discourse would be an RGB (red, green, blue)
political discourse. This makes sense from a socio-biological
perspective as-well. Humans are biologically programmed to see (and
probably even to think) in terms of red, green and blue as a direct
result of the red, green and blue photoreceptors [141] in our eyes that
allow us to perceive the various colors in nature. The result will be a
dynamic, isometric, three-dimensional (four-dimensional, if you count
the forward motion of time) mapping of the political-spectrum in
real-time, as opposed to the traditional, static, two-dimensional
political maps such as the Nolan Chart, etc....

DIRECT
DIGITAL DEMOCRACY (D3GA)

_An Online General Assembly and Transparent,
Open-Source, Online Voting and Policy Development Engine_ 

Utilizing
the principles set-forth in the Occupy Wall St. General Assemblies
(digital hand signals, via keyboard shortcuts and flashing icons),
participants would be able to effect real-time Deep Democratic Dialogue
(3D) via live multicast General Assemblies replete with video feeds and
a digital log of participant's voting activity culminating in
time-stamped line graphs and pie-charts. Using streaming-video
technology, participants would be able to see each other and interact in
real time video-conferences using the same technology that powers Skype
(picture a screen with lots of little video windows - similar to
'Hollywood Squares') serving to the public a sort of _Global Digital
Roundtable._ 

The engine should be capable of _BOTH__ mapping a users
general political &quot;color&quot;__, AS WELL AS__ to map the user's political on
a particular issue_. The user should be able to view 3 maps (_or 3
versions / renderings of one map_): 

1) How they (user/object) perceive
their political leanings (chosen colors)
2) How other users perceive
their political leanings (colors chosen by other users)
3) What their
views on individual (subject) issues says about their political
leanings. 

Please excuse any vagueness on this. As I stated previously,
all of this is very much in the 'vaporware' stages. 

While the
tripartite political chart outlined here is already usable as-is, the
software version envisions several 'stages': 

1) [perceived views -
internal] User selects his or her 'camp' (red, green or blue) based on
political affiliation. In other words, if someone has always voted
Republican or typically considers themselves a &quot;conservative&quot;, they
would choose 'red'. This doesn't really mean much, but provides an idea
of what the user considers his/her political leanings and as-such, a
statistical 'baseline' from which the software will attempt to
infer/ascertain certain things about them. 

2) [actual views] User
completes a questionnaire consisting of various multiple-choice
questions, which the software then uses to plot their actual views
against what it already knows about their political affiliation (from
#1, above).

3) [perceived views - external] How other users perceive
your views.

HEXADECIMAL MAPPING

(_if you already
understand 'hex' color-mapping, feel free to skip this_) 

In case you
are unfamiliar with 'Hex', it basically refers to a numbering system
that uses 16 as it's base (instead of 10, which would be decimal). It
does this by assigning a letter (A-F) to any number above 10. Example:
15 (in hex) = 1E. (_see attachment:_ &quot;Hex-Colorchart&quot;) This is how
computers typically communicate and store color-information, with 3
columns of 2-hex-digits each (1 for each component color). 

THIS IS
ILLUSTRATED AS FOLLOWS: 

 0 = 0 4 = 4 8 = 8 12 = C 

 1 = 1 5 = 5 9 = 9
13 = D 

 2 = 2 6 = 6 10 = A 14 = E 

 3 = 3 7 = 7  11 = B 15 = F


Thus, the Red, Green and Blue Values of each color are mapped
mathematically using three sets of two-digit hexadecimal-values.


EXAMPLES: 

#FFFFFF = White (_all maxed_)
#000000 = Black (_no
colors_)
#FF0000 = All RED (_no other colors_)
#00FF00 = All GREEN (_no
other colors_)
#0000FF = All BLUE (_no other colors_)
#CC6600 = THIS
COLOR (_parts red and green with no blue_)
#6600CC = THIS COLOR (_parts
red and blue with no green_) 

...Thus, there are a possible 256 colors
(16x16) that can define a person's political stance. Technically there
are 4096 (16x16x16) - but that level of granularity seems like overkill.

SPATIAL / CHROMATIC - MAPPING

Colors attributions are
as follows: 

BLACK - _Anarchy _(Apolitical / Lack of Opinion /
&quot;Political Agnosticism&quot; / etc...) 

 Motto: _&quot;Let's keep politics out of
this.&quot;_ 

RED - _Conservative__ _(Republican / Capitalist / Pro-Business
/ Anti-State / etc...) 

 Motto: _&quot;Fiscal Responsibility.&quot;_ 

YELLOW -
_Libertarian _(Individual Rights / Anti-Authoritarian / Anti-State /
etc...) 

 Motto: _&quot;Don't tread on me.&quot;_ 

GREEN - _Green Party_
(Grass-Roots / Environment / Anti-Corporate / etc...) 

 Motto: _&quot;Earth
First.&quot;_ 

CYAN - _Labor, _(Worker's Rights / Unions) 

 Motto: _&quot;People
before profits.&quot;_ 

BLUE - _Democrat_ (Pro-State / Pro-Regulation /
etc...) 

 Motto: _&quot;The rule of law.&quot;_ 

MAGENTA - _Corporatist
_(Pro-State/Corporate-Collusion / Entitlement / Ruling Class) 

 Motto:
_&quot;Corporations create jobs.&quot;_ 

WHITE / &quot;CLEAR&quot; - _Synergy / Overlap _(a
balanced perspective between all 3/6 camps) 

 Motto: _&quot;Consensus.&quot;_


The basic mechanism of the map lies in the hexadecimal color-coding
along three interdependent axis as-follows. 

AXIS 1: BLUE / YELLOW
(Govt. / State Interests VS. Individual Liberties) 

AXIS 2: GREEN /
MAGENTA (Ecological Interests VS. Corporatist Interests) 

AXIS 3: RED /
CYAN (Private / Corporate Interests VS. Labor / Worker Interests)

LEXICAL MAPPING

Since all of this is mixed up in how we
define words and label concepts regarding our political leanings, the
software should furnish an array of words, laid-out on an RGB / CMYK
map, that allows the user to see at-a-glance which concepts are in-play
at any given time. (_see attachments:_ &quot;Model-1&quot; &amp; &quot;Model-2&quot;). The idea
is that you enter a word into a field and the software automatically
generates corresponding words that are 60, 120 and 180 degrees &quot;away&quot;
from that word:

EXAMPLE: 

If I typed &quot;conservative&quot; into the 'Red'
field, the software would automatically fill-in the other fields as
follows: 

CONSERVATIVE
PROGRESSIVE
LIBERAL
EMPLOYMENT 
PRIVILEGE

FREEDOM 

One should be able to type-over any one of these words
in-order to re-populated the other fields with their corresponding
terms. Thus, if I replaced the word _&quot;Liberal&quot;_ in the list above with
the word _&quot;State&quot;_, the software would re-populate the list as follows:


CORPORATE
ECOLOGY
STATE
LABOR
ECONOMY
INDIVIDUAL

 ... The challenge
here lies in organizing these terms into 'classes' that define different
vocabularies and what 'scope' those taxonomies refer-to.
 Since the
colors themselves are essentially _arbitrary - _and the true distinction
lies in their geospatial relationship to one-another - this list cound
just as easily come out like this: 

STATE

CORPORATE
ECOLOGY
INDIVIDUAL
LABOR
ECONOMY  

...Part of the purpose of
all this is to demonstrate that the colors (in-and-of-themselves) have
no _inherent _meaning, but rather are used to 'frame', 'label' and
communicate various concepts.

VRDB

When discussing
'eDemocracy', 'voter registration databases' are an important
consideration. These are repositories used for identifying users and
authenticating them as voters. The distinction between voters and users
and the ability to authenticate them cannot be understated. Such a
database requires a framework defining things like registration and
authentication in electoral districts; proof of residence or
organizational membership; the compilation of voter lists; and so forth.
It does not define registration and authentication of users, as such.
Thus, it is not comparable to OpenID or OAuth. 

It seemed logical to me
that there would already be some sort of Open Source 'VRDB' (Voter
Registration Database) Software being used in various projects. Google
begs to differ however - informing me that VRDB is the acronym most
commonly used for _''Variable Rated Demand Bonds&quot; _(a financial
instrument) and to Avast Software's _&quot;Virus Repository Database&quot;_. Only
Wikipedia had ever heard of such a thing, where it is referred-to simply
as a _'Voter Database' _- a page containing some surprising (and
revealing) information on the subject:  

_&quot;The United States has no
state or federal election agency, and thus no central lists. In 2002,
the United States Congress passed HAVA, the Help America Vote Act. HAVA
required that each state compile an official state voter database by
January 2006. Most states complied with HAVA by gathering the voter
files available from each individual county. States decided what
information to include, what restrictions to place on the use of their
voter database, and how much the database would cost. In the United
States, several companies have merged state voter information with
commercially obtained data to create comprehensive voter databases that
include a plethora of personal details on each voter. These companies
often provide United States Voter Files to statutorily permitted or
otherwise non-restricted users.&quot;_  

 ...Thus, there are numerous
state-wide databases to be found, but no centralized repository of voter
data. 

At first glance this is kind of staggering to me considering how
vast the Federal Government is. But upon further inspection, it makes
perfect sense, as the potential for abuse of such a repository would be
so great, that mustering the political will to create one would probably
have been quite difficult. Thus, such a resource has (apparently,
ostensibly, &quot;officially&quot; and to the best of our knowledge) never been
built. - I qualified that statement as I am almost willing to bet that
_private _repositories have indeed been secretly compile by the likes of
_Diebold_, et al. The fact that this has never been done is is a double
edged sword with a lot of implications. From a security / privacy-risk
standpoint (concerns that are not without precedent [147]), it is
encouraging in the sense that it indicates our collective values in
rejecting totalitarianism and abuse of power. However, it is also a bit
discouraging in the sense that it seems to indicate a lack of
cooperation or coordination in protecting democratic freedoms. 

SO,
FROM WHERE I'M STANDING, THE WHOLE ISSUE OF VRDBS IS SEGMENTED THUS: 


1) Ensuring a reliable, accurate means of securing and authenticating
voter identities. (_logistic_)

 2) The software that #1 (above) would
need to run under (_technical_) 

My thoughts on #1 are outlined above.
As for #2, while there does not appear to be an existing Open Source
solution, there are numerous commercial packages available. With
politics these days being so thoroughly clouded by money, special
interests and lobbyists, it almost goes without saying that a 'private'
solution is the worst possible approach. Here are the ones that I've
unearthed:

 - VOTEBUILDER [148] from: 
 -  from PREMIER ELECTION
(_front for Diebold_)
 -  from ELECTION SYSTEMS |+|AMP|+| SOFTWARE INC.


_...THERE ARE MORE, BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE LISTING THEM BECAUSE - AS
FAR AS I'M CONCERNED - THEY ARE ALL PART OF THE PROBLEM._ 

To sum all
of this up, some sort of shared / collaborative VRDB WILL BE REQUIRED.
THE SAME GOES FOR MIRRORING AND SHARED ISSUE-IDENTIFIERS. 

The biggest
concern about any of this would be the potential for developing another
political 'monoculture' such as the one we seem to have now. I
personally believe that the best hope for protecting democratic freedoms
lies in nurturing debate and offering a voice to divergent points

</I>&gt;<i> SOFTWARE SUMMARY
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> _As
</I>stated, _all of this is in the 'vaporware' stages. Also, I would like to
somehow _&quot;crowd-source&quot;_ the development of this - thereby making the
development of it as open, inclusive and Democratic as possible. I have
set up an account on Sourceforge, but I am pretty new to Github and SVG
so it will take some time to get the development rolling.

COLLABORATIVE EFFORT

Metapolitik is a collaborative effort.
Which is to say that the development of Metapolitik the software, will
be crowdsourced. While we are still working out how exactly this
crowdsourcing and collaboration will take place - an inclusive process
that is still being researched and discussed - expect to see more from
us in the very near future. 

_ANY THOUGHTS OR FEEDBACK ARE WELCOME._
