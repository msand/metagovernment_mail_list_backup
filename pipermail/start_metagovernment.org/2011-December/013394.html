<PRE>Hello,

@ Alex

Yes, refreshing a vote would be the direct way to reverse rusting that 
has happend already.

No, I don't think it is good to reward voters, who vote in many polls. 
The old lady, which cares just about one issue, but so strongly, that 
she refreshes her vote constantly should not be punished for that. 
Because OTOH someone who votes in hundreds of polls might even be more 
likely to have forgotten about his vote in this one poll. Right?

&gt;<i> Vote Rusting is accelerated, if the &quot;content&quot; that was voted for has 
</I>&gt;<i> changed since then. The acceleration is given by the degree of change.
</I>
I like that!

about the issue of measuring the degree of change of a proposal:
&gt;<i> so yes, someone could take a picture of the corrupted version and show 
</I>&gt;<i> it off on his blog or somewhere else, but as soon as someone wants to 
</I>&gt;<i> confirm it, votorola might already repaired itself and routes around 
</I>&gt;<i> the corrupted &quot;root node&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats my understanding of votorla, maybe Thomas could confirm this? :-)
</I>
Yes, exactly! So how, if we would make this a social desicion right from 
the start ... and not an automatic one? The users would have to decide, 
if it was a minor, a big or a huge change. Maybe it is enough, if the 
delegate (author) himself decides this and if he cheats, his voters will 
turn away?
