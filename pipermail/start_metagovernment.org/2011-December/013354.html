<PRE>I also think that the Occupy wall street is a great opportunity.
We have tried to see if the new system inside Vilfredo could be used.
So we aksed a question in this regard.

The question is at:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?qb=5">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?qb=5</A>
with the &quot;question&quot;:
We are the 99% and those are our requests

It is very easy to use:
each bubble is a proposal. You go over it, and you read it.
You click and you vote/unvote it.

Bubbles come from the right and go toward the left.
Top bubbles are bubbles the system recognises as better than bubbles below.

This is a new system, different from the previous human based genetic
algorithm. It is not studied to integrate different proposals (for
now), but to compare them and select all the proposals accepted.

On the other side Vilfredo as a Human Based Genetic Algorithm worked
well when it was trying to look for a single proposal. So the best
work we have done so far was the &quot;wall of text&quot; question.
The good part of Vilfredo (both systems) is that they are fair, older
proposals are not in an advantage.

The not so good part is that the genetic algorithm since it uses a
genetic algorithm with a pareto front it requires everybody to read
all proposals. And have not too many people voting. As a result it
only works when there are not too many people voting. Which is why we
then developed the new &quot;bubble&quot; system.

It seem to me that Votorola is more similar to the genetic algorithm
part of Vilfredo. It probably can be used by more people than the
Vilfredo counterpart. But I don't think it is mathematically fair. In
fact (and this is my greatest problem with this) it looks to me as a
sort of proxy/liquid democracy type of system. And I find those system
to be deeply unfair as very soon people will
(a) support people that they like (i.e. actors) - and not people more
technical that they seem to agree with
(b) forget who they have lent their support.

I would rather have a system where people who cannot be bothered to go
to vote do not vote. And people who do not know what to vote don't
vote. Which is also why I support the idea that proposals should be
anonymous. So people need to vote the idea, not the person.

In Vilfredo we had a similar problem to (b) at some point. As Vilfredo
works through several generations, a question we had was, what if a
person just wants to vote each generation for the same proposals.
Should we not automatise this, making it easy for people to do so. And
we came to the conclusion that this was a really bad idea. This
because in Vilfredo people can impose that at least one of the
proposal they voted MUST pass. So by just voting for that proposal,
and then setting the system in automatic they are essentially imposing
to the whole community their view... and then they move on. It is fair
that people have a view, and are passionate about it, but they should
at least pay with their presence if they want to hold the community on
that. It is some sort of personal sacrifice that makes people aware
that in fact they are pushing the community in their direction.

Maybe a sort of proxy voting where people must renew their decision to
let a particular person EACH time would take care of the (b) problem.
But still it would have the (a) problem.

I really do not see how this can be overcome without rethinking the
whole system, sorry.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro and Michael, when we spoke at the last meeting via Skype, I got the strong impression that each of you does not have a good understanding of the others' systems. Michael was referring to Vilfredo as a brainstorming system, and Pietro has been referring to Votorola as a representation system. I think both of those are underestimations of the capabilities and ideologies of those systems. In my mind, I see the possibility of great synergies between them... but you would each need a better understanding first.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can I ask the two of you (and others) to help educate each other about the finer points of your systems? Clearing up these misunderstandings may lead to some really cool interoperability.
