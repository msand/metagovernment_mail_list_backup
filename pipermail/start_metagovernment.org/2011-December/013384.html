<PRE>Hi Alex,
how do you measure how much change happened in a proposal?

True story:
on facebook there were people who would make groups attacking
Berlusconi, they would gather a huge support. Then they would switch
the name of the group to something pro-Berlusconi, and take a picture
of a HUGE group supporting Berlusconi.

Sometimes even adding or deleting a NOT can switch the whole meaning.

&quot;BERLUSCONI IS NOT MY PRESIDENT&quot;
&quot;BERLUSCONI IS MY PRESIDENT&quot;.

&quot;THE WAR: NOT IN MY NAME!&quot;
&quot;THE WAR IS IN MY NAME!&quot;

Is this the democracy we want to build?

Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, it is offering the flank to people who gather brownie points by

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;changes their behavior. Again noticing this cannot be both precise and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;timely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is that really a problem? A person that votes a lot spends his time on the
</I>&gt;<i> voting system in might actually know what he is doing and that is &quot;voting
</I>&gt;<i> around&quot; ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> People should have that kind of freedom, right? By the way, rusting should
</I>&gt;<i> not count per person but instead per vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, all votes should rust slowly over time until they vanish if not
</I>&gt;<i> reinforced manually.
</I>&gt;<i> Vote Rusting is accelerated, if the &quot;content&quot; that was voted for has changed
</I>&gt;<i> since then. The acceleration is given by the degree of change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if i vote for something and it doesnt change, my vote should ruste very
</I>&gt;<i> very slowly, but it should rust, because if i turn out to be a lazy person
</I>&gt;<i> that does not reinforce its vote maybe once per year?? ..then chances are,
</I>&gt;<i> that i have evolved and changed my mind about a policy, but did not express
</I>&gt;<i> this by changnig my vote. Maybe i forgot about my voting behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> If many lazy people exist, that could really hinder society as a whole to
</I>&gt;<i> adapt to its suroundings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if i vote for something and it DOES change, because the owner of the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal changed it slightly... or maybe he even changed it a lot... that
</I>&gt;<i> means my vote should rust faster and probably a subscription service should
</I>&gt;<i> tell me about changes of policies i voted for :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This mechanism will prevent people who gathered many voters to use their
</I>&gt;<i> power effectively in a way that people did not vote for, because changes
</I>&gt;<i> will increase the speed of rusting until accepted or reinforced by voters by
</I>&gt;<i> voting again for the changed issue, that might be still owned by the same
</I>&gt;<i> proposal-owner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;voting before his votes start rusting? (this is a number)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>&#160;How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. rusting starts immediately and the speed depends on the degree of change
</I>&gt;<i> since the original voting took place. (so your number is 0)
</I>&gt;<i> 2. i'm not sure about that function. i think it should be very very slowly.
</I>&gt;<i> (maybe every year? or every couple of years?) ..so this becomes irrelevant
</I>&gt;<i> if the proposal/issue is about the execution of something that happens
</I>&gt;<i> within upcoming weeks ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> The rusting speed is increased dramatically if changes are made to the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal. The speed of rusting might also depend on the time frame of a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>&gt;<i> it is a permanent issue? (like &quot;The dignity of men is unimpeachable&quot;) or is
</I>&gt;<i> it more like &quot;build a new airport near city xy&quot;, where the first is
</I>&gt;<i> something that should be active as long as people continue to reinforce it
</I>&gt;<i> with their votes, while the latter should rust a bit faster... maybe...

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hi all,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; the&#160;delegation to the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters should be questioned faster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; for &quot;low power&quot; voters?&#160; This can be an automatic algorithm and does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; depend on an interpretation of such a thing as&#160;a &quot;fundamental policy&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The slower a person is in changing his vote the faster the algorithm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should ignore it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Interesting idea. It has several weakness, but maybe they could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> amended.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all people that are only voting once should have their vote
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ignored very very soon. But the algorithm cannot do this too soon
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (enough) before it needs to notice that the person is not changing his
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> position anymore. So in a sense the algorithm would always be &quot;late&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And there is a minimum time that cannot be crossed. The more precise
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want the algorithm to be the later it will be. Sounds like we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> found a modern equivalent to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, it is offering the flank to people who gather brownie points by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting a lot, to then just set the course on something, and go to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sleep at the wheel. Somehow the algorithm should notice when a person
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> changes their behavior. Again noticing this cannot be both precise and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> timely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So we can expect that the system is somehow always having some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;inertia&quot; either because of the heavy votes that the algorithm has not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> noticed, or the people who were light voters, and then started to gain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> weight. This kind of inertia is similar to what we experience in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modern democracies, but it would of course be not so bad (we would not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have to wait 4 years, but much less). Still I hope we can do better
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than this.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also the system seem to require a number of &quot;constants&quot;, &quot;thresholds&quot;,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and &quot;functions&quot;. All that should be decided, and each that would have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> an effect on the democracy that would come out.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voting before his votes start rusting? (this is a number)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Any implementation of this idea would require the coder to take
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decisions to clarify all this. But any such decision would be hard to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> defend, and would ultimately represent a liability for the system. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> all this to save a concept that I am not sure we should save: the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> concept of having someone vote for you.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Although the idea is interesting and gave rise to interesting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consequences, I am still unconvinced that this would solve the problem
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of people who lazily delegate their power. Sorry.
