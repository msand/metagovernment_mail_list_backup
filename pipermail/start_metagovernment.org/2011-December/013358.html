<PRE>Dear Thomas, dear Ed,

first of all an answer to both of you.

As you both question me on this.

I am fully convinced that it is possible, if there are enough
proposals, to make a system where it is technically unfeasible to
point your proposals to your friends.

Here are some possible solutions:
(1) we have been educated that everything on the internet bust have
its URL (actually URI). But this is not so. You can have material that
does not have an URL. Many systems only show some content to a person
when he is logged in. And another content to another person for the
same URL.

(2) most system let you vote as soon as you see a proposal. This is
not necessary. You can have systems where you can read a proposal, but
not vote there and then. You can have a systems that gives you random
proposals, to evaluate. Then you can look for a specific proposal
(make a search), and you can read it, but you cannot vote for it. Or
you can look for all the most voted proposals, but you cannot vote for
them. In other words you cannot chose the proposal you are voting on.
Think how judges are different from politicians. Politicians more or
less can chose what they work on. Not so judges. In general in modern
democracies judges wait for the system to give them the cases they
need to arbiter. They cannot chose to judge the cases they want to.
Yes, it is possible for a person to say, please if you see a proposal
that says: ... vote for it. But (a) other proposals can be similar.
(b) the effort that people need to make to do it is MUCH more. and (c)
in looking for that proposal people will read other proposal, and they
might actually think that they are better.


And of course hiding the name of the author of a proposal while you
are voting is entirely possible. But so far only Vilfredo is doing it
(that I know of). Transparency will still be honored by showing all
this information AFTER a vote has happened.

So I think that it is possible to work hard to make sure that
proposals should be evaluated on the base of the content only. That is
at least the base on which we are building Vilfredo.

I will now answer the other points in separate emails.

Cheers,
Pietro
