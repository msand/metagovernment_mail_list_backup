<PRE>Dear Pietro,

&gt;<i> But what if people don't &quot;vote&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> proposal, but have to &quot;judge&quot; them like a Judge. And like a judge they
</I>&gt;<i> can read the cases that are open but can only judge the ones that the
</I>&gt;<i> system assigns to them. When people realize that this system is in
</I>&gt;<i> place to permit them to have their own proposals fairly evaluated they
</I>&gt;<i> will accept it.
</I>
Ok, I understand. Maybe you are right and people will accept their role 
as a judge instead of a voter. Very different feel to democracy though 
than we are used to ...

And still my main question: Even if the judging system works: where does 
collaboration and consensus building come in? This is the heart of what 
we work on, right? IMO it is not about choosing the *best* out of many 
proposals, but it is about creating *consensus* out of many proposals. 
Because the consensus is going to be much better than this best. 
(Condorcet or any other method might be useful for the first, but it is 
of no big use for the second.)

Do you see, what I mean? Submitting propoals and judging them (in 
whatever sophisticated way) is one thing. But communicating, bargaining, 
arguing over them and finally finding consensus is essential too ... It 
is a very important part of our social behaivior ... how can it be 
technically supported if there are millions of participants at the same 
time? IMO this is our most important question.

Regarding the problem of actors I share your wish. But I don't think it 
can be solved technically. Those people are just part of our society. 
They will always try to get as much influence as possible. Within our 
systems or outside doesn't really matter imho. Hitler convinced many 
Germans of being superior without e-dem. If these Germans were 
e-dem-judges they would find &quot;their&quot; proposals in any case.

Delegate voting per se also doesn't solve this but doesn't worsen it 
either. Maybe the best remedy is to allow the actors and to let it 
happen in public. Plus with delegate voting one can decide for himself 
the distance he wants to have to such an actor. He can vote for X who 
votes for Hitler. But X is slightly better than Hitler.

Concerning the &quot;bad&quot; power accumulation over time because of lazy voters 
who forgot their votes ... rusting is the solution. In your proposed 
system a vote also has a certain duration. This is natural. (The rusting 
function can be decided democratically.)

&gt;<i> So a proxy voting is essentially a system where people by default will
</I>&gt;<i> give their vote away, and then have to work each time to make sure it
</I>&gt;<i> was used wisely. Instead we need a system where by default the vote is
</I>&gt;<i> nil. And people need to work (by voting) to make themselves be heard.
</I>
There are two different types of delegation voting. One is delegation 
across potentially many polls ... the other is delegation just within 
one poll. ATM Votorola is only about the second. So the danger of the 
actor, who jumps from poll to poll doesn't exist. He can not take his 
votes with him.

If he changes his position in the one poll step by step ... again, the 
solution is rusting. So as you say: people need to work (by refreshing 
their votes) to make themselves be heard.

Cheers,
Thomas
