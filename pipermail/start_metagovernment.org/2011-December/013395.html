+1 If it becomes an issue we can develop an algorithm (maybe for vote space), 
to mark rusted vote(r)s. An algorithm is always less flexible than a social 
solution and is in that sense always undemocratic and therefore unfair. As 
soon as it alters the weight of a vote or includes/excludes contributions it 
is an issue of the Poll/Position itself and has to be democratically decided 
upon, so opposing users can form their own position and express non-consent of 
this mechanism as well. I don't think activity might change the weight of the 
vote. Either we do respect each of us as a free individual/modern subject or 
we corrupt our efforts from the start. We cannot force people to behave 
&quot;right&quot; in voting, so we shouldn't statically fix our tools for problems we 
don't have yet. We can always plug algorithms in for that, because our social 
model only relies on consensual trees for polls. This is the only fixed social 
preassumption about how consent is communicated. How these trees organize can 
be adjusted in a zillion ways.
