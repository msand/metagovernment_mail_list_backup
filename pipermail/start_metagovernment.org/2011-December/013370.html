<PRE>Dear Thomas,

Let me answer your suggestion:

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It also
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> requires fresh proposals for each issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks, this is good to know. Could Michael or Thomas confirm it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because what I saw in respect to the metagovernment rules question was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that Thomas could move his 5 votes as he liked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The 5 people did not have to give him the vote again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At them moment it is like you say, Pietro. But it would be a relativly easy
</I>&gt;<i> feature to include: &quot;My vote gets automatically withdrawn, when you change
</I>&gt;<i> your postion a bit/ a lot/ completely ...&quot; So this is no question of
</I>&gt;<i> concept.
</I>
I am afraid it would not be enough. Let me explain:

The problem in a democracy is two fold. On the one side you want that
your vote is counted, that you can change it, that you can collaborate
in the drafting and so on.
On the other side you want that also the vote of other people is
counted and represents correctly what they feel/believe/think.

If my vote is correctly counted, but the other people vote is not
because they are too lazy to keep track of it, now the problem raises
is what happens to all this power left untaped.

If that power remains attached to someone (because they simply could
not be bothered to update it), the result is that I will live in a
democracy dominated by the people that have convinced the lazy buggers
to vote for them, and then forget about it. This is not a democracy I
want to live in, and I bet is not a democracy where YOU would want to
live in either.

So what should happen with the heavy power of the lazy voters?
(It's heavy because it takes a lot to move it.  But it's also heavy
because once it has moved it is hard to change it again.)
My idea is that the right of vote should be proportional to how
willing is a person to be bothered to let his voice be heard.
If you a better suggestion that satisfies my need not to be governed
by the people who are too lazy to update their vote, I would be happy
to hear it. But not a rusting system, that only limits the damage, but
does not eliminate it.

As such I am not just having a requirement about my voice, but also
about how others should be allowed to organise between them. In this I
am stepping beyond my direct circle. I am saying: not only I want my
voice to be heard, but I do not want that Ed (for example) is allowed
(legally or technically) to give to Thomas the right to vote for him
more than one time. If Ed wants someone else to vote for him he should
repeat his desire each time.

I know this sounds unfair, what right do I have to discuss the way Ed
and Thomas organise between them?

But, you see, I do have to live in the society generated also by
Thomas and Ed interaction. So their relation is effectively touching
me. And if the result of their relation is that I will be governed by
people only because some other people are too lazy to follow what is
going on, I oppose such organization.

And this is why I also cannot support a system that counts voting
independently on how they are gathered. As my understanding is that
Outcast does.

But I am willing to change my position once someone convinces me of a
better option.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> them each time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Ed here.
</I>
Let's say that I am an actor with a vast support. I support a certain
very popular position (rape is illegal even between married couples in
muslim countries). I in this way gather million of people supporting
me supporting that position. As the position slightly changes (is sex
by surprise rape?), people keep on supporting me, not to have to work
in following that position. Eventually I gather a lot of people who
are willing to support me on any issue (&quot;I like this guy, he sings
such a KOOL songs, and I totally DIG him when he was ..., and my
supporting him I can also support the really cool social fight he is
participating in&quot;). Then I (actor) receive an offer, someone offers me
a million dollar if I give my support for their proposal (and
subsequent drafts). I secretly accept, I support them, and with me
come most of my supporters.

Yes, this would happen;
yes, often this would lead to an uproar from the public;
no, the uproar would not happen all the time;
(Is the time when it does not happen that worries me)

So a proxy voting is essentially a system where people by default will
give their vote away, and then have to work each time to make sure it
was used wisely. Instead we need a system where by default the vote is
nil. And people need to work (by voting) to make themselves be heard.



Regards,
Pietro
