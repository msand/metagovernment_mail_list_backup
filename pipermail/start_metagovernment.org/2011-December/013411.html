<PRE>Ok :-) I think this is a very important discussion right now, and i try to
comment on your input :-)


&gt;<i> the idea that rusting should change depending on the changes done seem
</I>&gt;<i> to me based on an unsolved (and maybe unsolvable) problem if you do it
</I>&gt;<i> from a semantic point of view.
</I>
Yes, and even if it will become possible, i strongly oppose it, because
people will never trust such an approach in the forseeable future and even
I am not sure if I could accept it, even though I'm a bit into NLP (natural
language processing), Semantic Web and Ontologies (e.g. OWL through
Protege).

&gt;<i> Seems to me unreasonable if done on a
</I>&gt;<i> non semantically base (hamiltonian distance).
</I>
No i think it's not, i will explain why later...

&gt;<i> But also the idea that the person that suggests a new idea should
</I>&gt;<i> declare how much does it differ from the original proposal seem to me
</I>&gt;<i> like a non-practical solution.
</I>
Yes, i think its not practical, because that will always be subjective,
especially if the person who made a change should evaluate the importance
of it.
For that person it might not be a big deal at all (e.g. cow meat vs. swine
meat?) ...but for others it could make or break the deal :)


&gt;<i> But on the base of all this, I have to admit I cannot find the moral,
</I>&gt;<i> ethical or pragmatic reason why we need to let people delegate their
</I>&gt;<i> power at all. In any shape manner or form.
</I>
A. There is one pragmatic reason and it has to do with the concept of TRUST.
 If you think of the concept of &quot;all the knowledge in the world&quot; it refers
to a huge body of information of which you can only learn a tiny fraction
during your lifetime, that's what i believe is true. (You trust the water
you buy in the supermarket to be not poisoned, you trust a close friend of
yours, not to put a knife in your back, you trust your accountant that he
knows what he is doing, you trust your doctor to give you the right
medication)
Sure, you should also create many heuristics for yourself under which
circumstances you will trust and under which you will not. Sometimes you
spend time to learn about an issue before you decide.

B. There is another pragmatic reason and it has to do with the concept of
TIME.
When it comes to time, it can be seen as a resource that is limited to you.
You only can spend your lifetime once and you cannot do and know everything.

Example:
1. Maybe i know that i oppose nuclear power and i like solar energy.
2. Maybe am a programmer and create software and want it to be open source
in a special way...
...if you now want to have law's or contracts that accomplish the things
you want, you have to get into the technical details or into the details of
law to make it exactly open source the way you thought of it....  This can
be done by experts who know the in's and out's of the details.

So why is delegation important?
Because of the limited time we have as individuals, we can accomplish quite
astonishing things to specialization and delegation of work to each other.
Thats why we, as human race, can accomplish all the things we have
accomplished. BUT... for specialization and delegation to be possible, it
NEEDS TRUST.

=&gt; Maybe I don't have the time to read through the details of everything.
Maybe I'm an unpolitical person. Maybe I'm a person without academic
background, so i know what i like and what i want and i know what i dislike
and what i dont want, but i cannot express it the way i want and complex
proposal texts are not easy to grasp for everyone.
Thats why i would like to get to know people and to TRUST them, because of
my personal heuristics....
I would like to delegate to those people, because i think they represent
how i think. That save's me time and i can spent that time on doing the
stuff i'm good at, thus creating more wealth through devision of labour
than would be possible without.


&gt;<i> You make a representative system you are practically bound to generate
</I>&gt;<i> corruption. People giving off their vote for money. People betraying
</I>&gt;<i> the trust of other people for more money.
</I>
Might be true, but 1. that will be easily punished through votorola because
i vote for proposals and thus, only indirectly for people... and i can
withdraw my vote any time i want. 2. Social business is always about the
possibility of betrayal and thats why everyone makes his or her own
experiences and builds his or her own heuristics.
BUT, if you dont allow delegation of votes, people can still be paid or
talked into voting in a certain way...
AND, if you dont allow it, the people who put in the most time, will be
victorious... if you knew about THE GERMAN WIKIPEDIA, you would know what
can bad things might come from such a policy...

&gt;<i> What is the problem we are trying to solve with proxy voting? (real
</I>&gt;<i> question, not a rhetoric one)
</I>
It's an efficiency issue. If everyone would be familiar with all the
proposals to vote exactly the way he wants, it would cost a lot of time of
a lot of people.
Furthermore, people who are well organized in organisations like &quot;the
church&quot; or stuff like that, could easily be talked into concepts and voting
of all these people will be orchestrated.
Disconnected individuals like me and others, that have a few good friends,
but are not member of a hugh movement... like &quot;the church&quot; will have a hard
time to vote on every issue they want.
For example, ...i'd like to vote on a few important issues myself, but i
TRUST in &quot;Food Watch&quot; NGO and would like to delegate my voice to them when
it comes to food issues.
I also TRUST in GREEN PEACE and would like to delegate my voice to them
when it comes to environmental issues...
...if i would read al proposals in all possible life domains by myself,
there would be no time left for me to actually live my life :-) ...thats
why we probably need a mechanism for delegation.

&gt;<i> People can describe
</I>&gt;<i> a general idea (vote for a proposal where it is said...), but then
</I>&gt;<i> people need to actually understand the proposals to make sure they are
</I>&gt;<i> voting for the right thing.
</I>
Yes, and to accomplish that, it might be a good thing, that most proposals
on a similar topic have similar TEXTS so that the differences can be seen
easily.
Its also a good thing when TEXT changes are very minimal or that a change
in the idea will correspond to a TEXT CHANGE which is as minimal as
possible...
...that simplifies the process of following all the changes that happen.

&gt;<i> A side effect of this might be that laws become suddenly simpler
</I>to understand. Call it a feature.

Yes, if TEXT's of competing proposals only differ by a few sentences or
words, its easy... if changes will only change the text slightly, people
only have to spent the time to understand the text ONCE and then only can
read the changes...

LATER:
&gt;<i> Seems to me unreasonable if done on a
</I>&gt;<i> non semantically base (hamiltonian distance).
</I>
creates of proposals want many voters and they want them to stay, so they
will try to not accelerate rusting. So before they delegate their voice,
they will really try hard to make the own proposal and the proposal they
want to delegate to very similar. They will also try to minimize changes in
the text of their own proposal, thus making it easier for their followers
to learn about changes without spending much time.
If a change in text, will turn the proposal on its head, its also easy to
detect, because the amount of changed text might be minimal and comparing
the current version with the former will immediately highlight the change.

So the good thing about text comparison (not semantic comparison) is, that
people will try to simplify their changes and to make different proposals
very similar before delegating their voice to somone else, to prevent
acceleration of rusting ...thus making it easier for voters to follow the
stream of changes in proposals.
