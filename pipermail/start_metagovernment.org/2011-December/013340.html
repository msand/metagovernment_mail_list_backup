+1 This also determines the technocratic view point, which tries to find 
formal problems, while the problem at heart is that we (all conscious minds) 
want to be self-determined, but we aren't in current social organisation and 
the machinery has only worsened this fact in the past. To give people 
meaningful ways of expression does not mean making decisions for them, but 
giving them as many freedom as possible...

Yet collaboratively developing a machine (voting network) to give us this 
meaningful ways of expression closes the gap of alienation to what machinery 
currently means to us (as private property/means of private property 
production). It is so to speak the synthesis of nature versus 
liberal/instrumental reason. I'd love to do some real-world discussion with 
you guys. Time to show nearby bars in Crossforum for that :-P
