<PRE>Dear All,

I just OCR'ed Smith paper (which originally was in .ps).
It was a long process, and it only moved it from 44MB to 34MB. But now
it's searchable.
I hope the gods of copyright will not hate me for this.

<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/RangeVoting.pdf">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/RangeVoting.pdf</A>

On this paper there was also this passage:

&quot;The issues discussed in this paper are totally independent of the
puzzling question of how to [...].
Neither will Range (nor Condorcet-LR) voting solve such societal
problems as unwise voters and inaccurate vote tallying*.

*For example, R.M. Nixon was re-elected US president in 1972 by a
&quot;landslide&quot;: he got 61% of the vote, the second highest percentage
ever recorded. Essentially every voting system would have declared him
the winner. However since Nixon then became the only president to
resign, with most of the key members of his cabinet jailed on
corruption charges, most people would agree this was not the best
possible decision.&quot;

Which I see it as another reason why any form of representative voting
is dangerous. Although I might understand how if the voters were able
to take away their vote the damage would be diminished (but not
avoided).

BTW, I know I owe an answer to Alex and Thomas on the topic. I just
haven't had the time right now.


Cheers,
Pietro
