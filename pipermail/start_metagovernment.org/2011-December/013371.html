<PRE>Hi Thomas,

</I>
Exactly! There are many solutions that would work. The point is that
it IS possible to have systems where people cannot send each other the
URL of the proposal.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (2) most system let you vote as soon as you see a proposal. This is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not necessary. You can have systems where you can read a proposal, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not vote there and then. You can have a systems that gives you random
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals, to evaluate. Then you can look for a specific proposal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (make a search), and you can read it, but you cannot vote for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I imagine this to be extremely frustrating for the voter ... to find his
</I>&gt;<i> favourite proposal but not be allowed to vote for it. In this case he might
</I>&gt;<i> refuse to vote at all (or, if forced to vote anyway, he could choose one,
</I>&gt;<i> which is doomed to fail anyway and so game the system.)
</I>
Ok, so now we have moved from &quot;this is not technically possible&quot; to
this could be technically possible but it would give emotional
problems (frustration). I welcome this step. Still I think it is also
possible to make a system where you minimize this frustration. I think
the key is in how you present the information to the users. If you say
that they are voting... and should vote on everything they see, then
of course they will be frustrated. They have expectations, and the
expectations will be frustrated. But what if people don't &quot;vote&quot; the
proposal, but have to &quot;judge&quot; them like a Judge. And like a judge they
can read the cases that are open but can only judge the ones that the
system assigns to them. When people realize that this system is in
place to permit them to have their own proposals fairly evaluated they
will accept it. Also on slashdot they have a similar system, people ca
read comments but can vote only when they system decides so. And
people like it.



&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, it is possible for a person to say, please if you see a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> that says: ... vote for it. But (a) other proposals can be similar.
</I>&gt;<i> (b) the effort that people need to make to do it is MUCH more. and (c)
</I>&gt;<i> in looking for that proposal people will read other proposal, and they
</I>&gt;<i> might actually think that they are better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This alone would make it more unlikely for an actor to succed, but just by a
</I>&gt;<i> certain degree. Not by 100%.
</I>

Agreed. It might still be possible. But the risk is when it is too
easy. If it's possible but it's really hard it might not cause such
disruption in the system. And people voting just for something because
it &quot;resembles&quot; a proposal they have been invited to vote, without
understanding it might cause people to vote for different proposals
expressed with a similar wording.

It would become even a risk to invite people to vote for your proposal!
