<PRE>Dear all,

This RFC is about establishing and maintaining an open voting network
within the Occupy movement. [1]

Purpose
-------
The purpose of the network is to level the playing field among service
providers [2] such that:

  a) People are free to experiment with different consensus making
     practices and contribute directly to their development (tech and
     non-tech) without thereby splitting the movement into competing
     technical camps.

  b) Each person is free to choose a service provider, toolset and
     practices based on personal needs and preferences, and to change
     providers at any time.


Scope
-----
The network is *not* concerned with consensus making processes of the
GA or Spokes Council themselves.  It is concerned only with *primary*
voting.  The purpose of primary voting is to facilitate and express
consensus on (i) proposals *prior* to submission to the GA, Spokes
Council or City Council; and on (ii) delegates or candidates prior to
election to a convention, assembly or office. [3]

The network is *not* concerned with private voting, as in decisions by
secret ballot.  It is concerned only with *public* voting, as in
building consensus on the content of a text prior to ratification by
secret ballot.


Structure
---------

  A. Draft policy of non-endorsement for single-provider voting
     services (monopoly), and instead support for an open network
     based on cross-provider vote mirroring (counter-monopoly). [4]

     If a consensus draft of this policy eventually emerges, it will
     be submitted to the GA for general adoption.

  B. List of qualified service providers.  Qualification includes a
     formal agreement to mirror the votes of other qualified service
     providers.

  C. From each qualified service provider, an open invitation to the
     alpha trials and development of its tools and practices.  The
     invitation is extended to tech and non-tech people alike.


Request for comments
--------------------
Can anyone see problems?

How best to formalize this?  An NYC working group, or some kind of
subgroup or separate project?


Notes
-----

 [1] This RFC came out of discussions with Stephen Coffman, Dec. 6/7.
     <A HREF="http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/?topic_page=5&amp;num=15#post-12578">http://www.nycga.net/groups/structure/forum/topic/what-about-the-people-who-dont-have-time-to-go-to-general-assemblies-enough/?topic_page=5&amp;num=15#post-12578</A>

     Mark Murphy was an early visionary of this kind of openness.  See
     his essay: The &quot;killer app&quot; of public participation.  *In*
     Rebooting America.  Edited by Allison Fine, Micah L. Sifrey,
     Andrew Rasiej and Joshua Levy.  Personal Democracy Press.  2008.

 [2] Service providers active in the NYC Internet/Tech Ops mailing
     list include the Federated General Assembly, OpenAssembly and
     Votorola.  Many others exist and they cover a wide range of
     technologies: <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>

     Here's another list (not really a coalition, as maybe implied):
