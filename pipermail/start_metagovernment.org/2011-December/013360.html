<PRE>Hi Thomas,

I was not ignoring you.
I am used to the academic field where people let an issue settle for
some time before responding. While thinking it through.

</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the idea of using a Votorola like system, that is a proxy

I am sorry, I still don't get it. There are some proposals, people can
decide to vote for them, or to let someone else decide for them. Is
this not correct. What are those clusters you speak of?


&gt;<i> Votorolas proxy-voting has this as a side-effect, but there might be other

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all a problem with proxy voting is that people give support

</I>&gt;<i> inherited power. This is very dangerous.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are solutions for that. My favorite is from the german
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Liquid-Democracy-e.V.&quot;. They call it &quot;rusting of the votes&quot;, i.e. votes
</I>&gt;<i> gradually melt away over time if they don't get refreshed by the voters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks but I don't think this would satisfy me as a security mechanism.
People can do a lot of damage while they hold the power.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also an important principle that I am following is a principle of Fair
</I>&gt;<i> participation, which require that proposals are all evaluated only by
</I>&gt;<i> the content. This means that people enter this system without knowing
</I>&gt;<i> who else is there. They do not know the others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The issue of anonymity is not bound to proxy-voting, is it? The problems of
</I>&gt;<i> anonymity and its possible solutions apply to all e-dem-systems, don't they?
</I>
ABSOLUTELY!!! Spot on. This is why I am presenting talks on Fair
Participation. And I do this in general. Not related to proxy voting.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed every voter has the right to participate to both a clarity
</I>&gt;<i> working group and a compromise working group. But, as you pointed out,
</I>&gt;<i> it is probably unfeasible if the groups are too big, in which case
</I>&gt;<i> some groups can be split, and have two groups work in parallel on the
</I>&gt;<i> same cluster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also remember that work groups usually require extra effort.
</I>&gt;<i> Although everybody is welcome to participate, on average less than
</I>&gt;<i> everybody will participate in the workgroups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, but since it is all about politics and sometimes about really important
</I>&gt;<i> decisions you can still expect thousands of participants in a european-wide
</I>&gt;<i> poll, can't you?
</I>
We can expect both the number of proposals, the number of clusters of
proposals to grow as the number of participants grow.

I think this is one of the cases where we need to work on bigger and
bigger systems, and it is unfeasible to evaluate now how the system
will behave when we have millions of people.

I was presenting three tools:
(1) a tool to aggregate proposals in clusters
(2) a tool to let some people in a cluster clarify it
(3) a tool to integrate different clusters.

Now it is possible that the number of clusters grow slower than the
number of proposals, with the effect that the second tool does not
scale up. This might be balanced by making smaller clusters, for
example. Or having multiple groups work in parallel for each cluster.

In short I think those tools can push the system further on
scalabilty. Maybe not all the way yet. But it might be good enough for
now.


&gt;<i> Not to mention a global poll. And then the question comes
</I>&gt;<i> up, which brought us all here in the first place: How can we technically
</I>&gt;<i> support thousands of participants which try to reach a consensus on
</I>&gt;<i> something? How can they all communicate with each other, bargain with each
</I>&gt;<i> other, ... ? I feel this needs to be structured, since more than 20 people
</I>&gt;<i> can not talk to each other directly.
</I>
The global poll is made on closed questions. As such it can scale up
quite well. At this point the decisions among which to chose have been
taken. 20 people cannot talk to each other directly, but millions of
people vote in modern democracies for the same candidates.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have you seen the two taks I gave on Fair Participation and on  System
</I>&gt;<i> Generated Requests for Rewriting Proposals

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw the first. One thought of mine that I remember: I don't think it is
</I>&gt;<i> technically possible to prevent someone pointing his friends to his
</I>&gt;<i> proposal.
</I>
Thanks. I answered this in the other email.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you mention the system of groups within groups that is present in
</I>&gt;<i> Votorola. I am not sure I believe that will actually work. I mean, yes
</I>&gt;<i> you can have a fractal system of split groups, into smaller and smaller
</I>&gt;<i> units. But then I am not sure you can so easily come back and
</I>&gt;<i> aggregate proposals in the bigger groups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, each group is represented by its candidate. Those candidates form
</I>&gt;<i> another group which is represented by their candidate ...
</I>&gt;<i> So you are right, it won't be easy for a group of candidates to form a
</I>&gt;<i> consensus, because they all have to get their voters to agree. But this is
</I>&gt;<i> politics, isn't it? It's not easy, thats for sure.
</I>

Yes and no. Yes it's politics. But there might be something deeper.
I can only wave hands about it, so please forgive me. Thinking aloud:
Once you aggregate groups of people, the way in which you aggregate
you are essentially hiding information (how people disagree, who,
why). This is quite inevitable. But the way in which you do it can
have serious effects in the way those groups can then move to the next
level.

The fact is that setting up those fractal system is an old solution.
It has been used pretty much in any political system in the world. But
even when they tried to avoid them to become a source of centralized
power (like in communist Russia) it did not work.

A group of people discussing works fine. A group of group of people
often leads to bad decisions. This is why in the system presented in
the video have a final poll leading back to the people.

Best Regards,
Pietro
