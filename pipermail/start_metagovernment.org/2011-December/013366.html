<PRE>Hi Pietro,

&gt;<i> I am fully convinced that it is possible, if there are enough
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, to make a system where it is technically unfeasible to
</I>&gt;<i> point your proposals to your friends.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here are some possible solutions:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) we have been educated that everything on the internet bust have
</I>&gt;<i> its URL (actually URI). But this is not so. You can have material that
</I>&gt;<i> does not have an URL. Many systems only show some content to a person
</I>&gt;<i> when he is logged in. And another content to another person for the
</I>&gt;<i> same URL.
</I>
I thought of an approach like Googles Picture search (I think they 
started one, where you load up one picture and Google shows you similiar 
ones) where the URL doesn't matter too.

&gt;<i> (2) most system let you vote as soon as you see a proposal. This is
</I>&gt;<i> not necessary. You can have systems where you can read a proposal, but
</I>&gt;<i> not vote there and then. You can have a systems that gives you random
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, to evaluate. Then you can look for a specific proposal
</I>&gt;<i> (make a search), and you can read it, but you cannot vote for it.
</I>
I imagine this to be extremely frustrating for the voter ... to find his 
favourite proposal but not be allowed to vote for it. In this case he 
might refuse to vote at all (or, if forced to vote anyway, he could 
choose one, which is doomed to fail anyway and so game the system.)

&gt;<i> Yes, it is possible for a person to say, please if you see a proposal
</I>&gt;<i> that says: ... vote for it. But (a) other proposals can be similar.
</I>&gt;<i> (b) the effort that people need to make to do it is MUCH more. and (c)
</I>&gt;<i> in looking for that proposal people will read other proposal, and they
</I>&gt;<i> might actually think that they are better.
</I>
This alone would make it more unlikely for an actor to succed, but just 
by a certain degree. Not by 100%.

Cheers,
Thomas
