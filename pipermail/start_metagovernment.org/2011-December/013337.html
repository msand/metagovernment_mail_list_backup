<PRE>Hi Conan and all,
Please have a look at the network one level standpoint as illustrated in
this installation and  as expounded upon by Bruno Latour
<A HREF="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/article">http://www.bruno-latour.fr/article</A> as an alternative approach to thinking
metapolitical discourse.
All the best,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> [image: Metapolitik.org]Introduction
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Metapolitics* [m&#603;t&#601; p&#594;l&#618;t&#618;ks] (sometimes written meta-politics) is
</I>&gt;<i> metalinguistic talk about the analytic, synthetic, and normative language
</I>&gt;<i> of political inquiry and politics itself. *In simple words, it is talk
</I>&gt;<i> about the way we talk about politics.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: RGB Economy]*Example:* If one studies, analyzes, and describes a
</I>&gt;<i> language, the language used for studying, analyzing, and describing the
</I>&gt;<i> object language is a *metalanguage*.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In current usage and praxis, the term metapolitics is often used in
</I>&gt;<i> relation to postmodern theories of the Subject and their relation to
</I>&gt;<i> political theory. In its broadest definition, metapolitics is a discipline
</I>&gt;<i> that studies the relationship between the State and the Individual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapolitics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metapolitics</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Metapolitik.org* grew out of my strong desire to start a *'Deep Green
</I>&gt;<i> Social Democratic Revolution'*&lt;<A HREF="http://myopsy.blogspot.com/2010/06/deep-green-democratic-socialism.html">http://myopsy.blogspot.com/2010/06/deep-green-democratic-socialism.html</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> As others &lt;<A HREF="http://endofcapitalism.com/">http://endofcapitalism.com/</A>&gt; have noted, Capitalism as we know
</I>&gt;<i> it is no longer sustainable and as such, cannot continue it's current
</I>&gt;<i> trajectory of greed, cronyism and environmental destruction. To quote Alex
</I>&gt;<i> Knight &lt;<A HREF="http://endofcapitalism.com/">http://endofcapitalism.com/</A>&gt;:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Capitalism requires growth. A system that requires growth cannot last
</I>&gt;<i> forever on a planet that is defined by ecological and social limits.
</I>&gt;<i> Capitalism is therefore fundamentally unsustainable &#8211; sooner or later it
</I>&gt;<i> will run up against those limits and the system will stop functioning. At
</I>&gt;<i> this moment we are in the midst of a crisis which is calling into question
</I>&gt;<i> the future of this system. Now is a perfect opportunity to envision a new
</I>&gt;<i> way of living in the world that can meet human needs while also respecting
</I>&gt;<i> the needs of the planet. It is time to build this new world.&quot;*&lt;<A HREF="http://endofcapitalism.com/about">http://endofcapitalism.com/about</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, *Metapolitik * is based on the understanding that modern
</I>&gt;<i> 'Capitalism' (Corporate Socialism or Corporatocratic Fascism) is what
</I>&gt;<i> author Douglas Rushkoff &lt;<A HREF="http://rushkoff.com/videoaudio/opensource/">http://rushkoff.com/videoaudio/opensource/</A>&gt;would call
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;legacy software&quot;* -- that is to say, an outdated, societal *'operating
</I>&gt;<i> system'* that no longer continues to serve it's intended purpose. While
</I>&gt;<i> 'Capitalism' did great things for us back in the 20th Century (helped
</I>&gt;<i> defeat the Nazis and rebuild Europe, etc...) ...It's pretty much out of
</I>&gt;<i> steam. It cannot continue on it's current trajectory without dire
</I>&gt;<i> consequences -- both ecological and economic. In many ways, it seems
</I>&gt;<i> insulting to even call it 'capitalism' any more. More like: *Corporate
</I>&gt;<i> Socialism* a quasi-fuedal, quasi-fascist corporatocracy in which the
</I>&gt;<i> lobbyists who spend the most get the legislation that they want passed and
</I>&gt;<i> in which dramatic condensation of wealth in the hands of a tiny minority of
</I>&gt;<i> people have rendered our economy completely dysfunctional and utterly
</I>&gt;<i> incapable of serving the needs of the body-politic. Not only is this a
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly un-democratic situation, it is not in the spirit of true
</I>&gt;<i> capitalism. If it were pure capitalism -* free market capitalism* - we
</I>&gt;<i> would all be independent contractors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Political Spectrum]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The Body Politic*, in any developed country - tends to be a vibrant and
</I>&gt;<i> diverse mix of people, cultures, colors, creeds and ideas. While this
</I>&gt;<i> diversity makes the twenty-first century among the most interesting times
</I>&gt;<i> in history to be alive, it also makes open discussion and analysis of our
</I>&gt;<i> differing socio-political views incredibly challenging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Metapolitik.org* seeks to address this by formulating, exploring and
</I>&gt;<i> codifying new methods of charting, mapping and analyzing aggregated data
</I>&gt;<i> sources and displaying this political data at a glance in an easy to read
</I>&gt;<i> format. As well as to create a collaborative platform for interaction that
</I>&gt;<i> allows us to share, disseminate and decipher this data in as holistic,
</I>&gt;<i> non-authoritarian and thoroughly decentralized a manner as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *'Deep':* is a reference to the term 'deep-democracy', coined by
</I>&gt;<i> psychiatrist *Arny Mindell* to describe a political system that enables a
</I>&gt;<i> deeper, more democratic level of socio-political interaction. In a deep
</I>&gt;<i> democracy, citizens will have direct influence over public policy, without
</I>&gt;<i> the need for the parasitic political class that we have grown so accustomed
</I>&gt;<i> to. It is now possible to achieve this with the aid of the Internet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_democracy</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *'Green':* of course, refers to the concept of 'green politics' - which
</I>&gt;<i> is to say - a political ideology which places high importance on
</I>&gt;<i> environmental goals, while achieving these goals through broad-based,
</I>&gt;<i> grassroots, participatory democracy (thus, 'green politics' are inherently
</I>&gt;<i> 'deep democracy' politics by virtue of their grass-roots approach). Green
</I>&gt;<i> politics are advocated by supporters of the Green movement, which has been
</I>&gt;<i> active through Green parties in many nations since the early 1980s.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_politics</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Social:* simply describes the inherently *social* aspects of *soc*iety.
</I>&gt;<i> Though the term *'socialism'* has been demonized and vilified by the
</I>&gt;<i> right, we already live in a socialist economy in many ways. All societies
</I>&gt;<i> socialize some resources and capitalize others depending on an essentially
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrary set of values that are ascribed to each respectively. In the US,
</I>&gt;<i> examples of socialized resources include *bailouts* for banking cartels, *Social
</I>&gt;<i> Security*, *Medicare*, *Medicaid*, *Workers Compensation* and *Unemployment
</I>&gt;<i> Insurance*. Just as communism is - at it's core - about *commun*ity.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Open Source Democracy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The term 'open source' comes to us from the world of software development
</I>&gt;<i> and refers to a set of production and documentation standards that promote
</I>&gt;<i> access to the end product's source materials or 'code'. Some consider open
</I>&gt;<i> source a philosophy, others consider it a pragmatic methodology. Before the
</I>&gt;<i> term open source became widely adopted, developers and producers used a
</I>&gt;<i> variety of phrases to describe the concept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 'Open source' eventually gained hold with the rise of the Internet, and
</I>&gt;<i> the corresponding need for a massive retooling of computing source code.
</I>&gt;<i> This in-turn enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models,
</I>&gt;<i> communication paths, and interactive communities. A new, three-word phrase:
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;open source software* &quot; was born to describe the environment that the
</I>&gt;<i> new copyright, licensing, domain, and consumer issues created.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Douglas Rushkoff &lt;<A HREF="http://rushkoff.com/">http://rushkoff.com/</A>&gt; defines an open source democracy&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10753">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10753</A>&gt;as 'what happens when the open source development model is applied to the
</I>&gt;<i> economy'. In 'Applying the Theory' he observes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;...It would mean coming to appreciate the rules of the economic game
</I>&gt;<i> for what they are: [arbitrary] rules. Operating in a closed source fashion,
</I>&gt;<i> the right to actually produce currency is held exclusively by the Federal
</I>&gt;<i> Reserve. Quietly removed from any relationship to real money such as gold
</I>&gt;<i> or silver by Richard Nixon in the early 1970s, US currency now finds its
</I>&gt;<i> value in pure social construction.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***&quot;Whether or not we know it, we all participate in the creation of its
</I>&gt;<i> value by competing for dollars against one another. For example, when a
</I>&gt;<i> people or businesses borrows money from the bank (an agent, in a sense, of
</I>&gt;<i> the Federal Reserve) in the form of a mortgage they must eventually pay the
</I>&gt;<i> bank back two or three times the original borrowed amount. These additional
</I>&gt;<i> funds are not printed into existence, but must be won from others in the
</I>&gt;<i> closed source system. Likewise, every time a student wants to buy one of my
</I>&gt;<i> books, he must go out into the economy and earn or win some of these
</I>&gt;<i> arbitrarily concocted tokens, US currency, in order to do it. Our
</I>&gt;<i> transaction is brokered by the Federal Reserve, who has a monopoly on this
</I>&gt;<i> closed source currency.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Meanwhile, the actual value of this currency, and the effort required
</I>&gt;<i> to obtain it, is decided much more by market speculators than its actual
</I>&gt;<i> users. Speculation accounts for over 90 percent of US currency transactions
</I>&gt;<i> in any given day. By this measure, real spending and the real economy are a
</I>&gt;<i> tiny and secondary function of money: the dog is being wagged by its tail.
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;What if currency were to become open source? In some communities it
</I>&gt;<i> already is. They are not printing counterfeit bills but catalyzing regional
</I>&gt;<i> economies through the use of local currencies, locally created 'scrip' that
</I>&gt;<i> can be exchanged throughout a particular region in lieu of Federal Reserve
</I>&gt;<i> notes or real cash. The use of these currencies, as promoted by
</I>&gt;<i> organizations such as the E.F. Schumacher Society, has been shown to
</I>&gt;<i> accelerate the exchange of goods and services in a region by increasing the
</I>&gt;<i> purchasing power of its members. There is no Federal Reserve surcharge on
</I>&gt;<i> the creation and maintenance of cash, and no danger of government currency
</I>&gt;<i> depreciation due to matters that have nothing to do with actual production
</I>&gt;<i> and consumption.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Like any other bottom-up system, the creation of local currency
</I>&gt;<i> develops transactional models appropriate to the scale of the actual
</I>&gt;<i> transactions and the communities in which they occur. While Federal notes,
</I>&gt;<i> or Euros for that matter, might be appropriate for a merchant to use across
</I>&gt;<i> state or national boundaries, local currencies make for greater fluidity
</I>&gt;<i> and accountability between members of the same community.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Thanks to the dynamic relationships permitted in a networked society,
</I>&gt;<i> we need not choose between local and closed currencies. A post-renaissance
</I>&gt;<i> perspective on economic issues has room for both to exist, simultaneously
</I>&gt;<i> functioning on different orders of magnitude.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;In a society modeled on open source ideals, 'think globally, act
</I>&gt;<i> locally' becomes more than just a catch phrase. The relationship of an
</I>&gt;<i> individual or local community's action to the whole system can be
</I>&gt;<i> experienced quite readily. For example, an open source software developer
</I>&gt;<i> who writes just a few useful lines of code, say the protocol for enabling
</I>&gt;<i> infrared communications to work on the Linux operating system, will see his
</I>&gt;<i> or her contribution interpolated into the kernel of the operating system
</I>&gt;<i> and then spread to everyone who uses it. He has done more than distributed
</I>&gt;<i> a line of computer code. He has also enabled thousands of people using
</I>&gt;<i> Linux to connect cell phones, PDA's and other devices to their computers
</I>&gt;<i> for the first time. And he did it from his home, in his spare time.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Likewise, a developer who leaves a security hole open in a piece of
</I>&gt;<i> software quite dramatically sees the results of his action when a software
</I>&gt;<i> 'worm', written by a computer criminal, penetrates the mail files of
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of users, sending replicates of itself throughout the internet,
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes for years to come.09*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Members of an open source community are able to experience how their
</I>&gt;<i> actions affect the whole. As a result, they become more conscious of how
</I>&gt;<i> their moment-to-moment decisions can be better aligned with the larger
</I>&gt;<i> issues with which they are concerned. A programmer concerned with energy
</I>&gt;<i> consumption and the environment might take time to consider how a
</I>&gt;<i> particular screen-saver routine impacts the total energy consumption
</I>&gt;<i> pattern of a particular monitor. The programmer already understands that if
</I>&gt;<i> the code is used on millions of machines, each effort to reduce energy
</I>&gt;<i> consumption by a minuscule amount can amplify into tremendous energy
</I>&gt;<i> savings. (Indeed, it has been calculated that the energy required to power
</I>&gt;<i> all the televisions and computers in America that are currently in sleep
</I>&gt;<i> mode equals the output of an entire average-size power plant.)*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;The experience of open source development, or even just the acceptance
</I>&gt;<i> of its value as a model for others, provides real-life practice for the
</I>&gt;<i> deeper change in perspective required of us if we are to move into a more
</I>&gt;<i> networked and emergent understanding of our world. The local community must
</I>&gt;<i> be experienced as a place to implement policies, incrementally, that will
</I>&gt;<i> eventually have an effect on the whole. For example, the environmental
</I>&gt;<i> advocate who worries about the Brazilian rainforest will quit smoking
</I>&gt;<i> himself before racing off to the next rally held to save the lungs of the
</I>&gt;<i> planet. The woman organizing against genetic engineering in agriculture
</I>&gt;<i> will refuse to let her children eat at McDonalds, even if it requires them
</I>&gt;<i> to bring their own lunch to a friend's birthday party. A consistency
</I>&gt;<i> between belief and behavior becomes the only way to make our designs on
</I>&gt;<i> reality real.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Closed source: no justice, no power*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;An open source model for participatory, bottom-up and emergent policy
</I>&gt;<i> will force us, or allow us, to confront the issues of our time more
</I>&gt;<i> directly. Using the logic of a computer programmer, when we find we can't
</I>&gt;<i> solve a problem by attacking one level of societal software, we proceed to
</I>&gt;<i> the next level down. If necessary we dig all the way down to the machine
</I>&gt;<i> language. *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;For instance, today's misunderstood energy crisis provides a glaring
</I>&gt;<i> example of the liability of closed source policy-making. The Western World
</I>&gt;<i> is unnecessarily addicted to fossil fuels and other energy commodities not
</I>&gt;<i> because alternative energy sources are unavailable, but because alternative
</I>&gt;<i> business models for energy production cannot be fully considered without
</I>&gt;<i> disrupting the world's most powerful corporations and economies.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;It really is as simple as that.&quot;*

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Rather than viewing technological socialism as one side of a zero-sum
</I>&gt;<i> trade-off between free-market individualism and centralized authority, it
</I>&gt;<i> can be seen as a cultural OS that elevates both the individual and the
</I>&gt;<i> group at once. The largely unarticulated but intuitively understood goal of
</I>&gt;<i> communitarian technology is this: to maximize both individual autonomy and
</I>&gt;<i> the power of people working together. Thus, digital socialism can be viewed
</I>&gt;<i> as a third way that renders irrelevant the old debates.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Thus,* In a true, 'free-market' economy (just like in a true democracy)
</I>&gt;<i> all participants would be given equal legal protections and equal access to
</I>&gt;<i> information and resources. In a truly democratic society (a deep democracy)
</I>&gt;<i> the corporation is replaced by the community and members of that community
</I>&gt;<i> are permitted to contract with one another for the goods and services that
</I>&gt;<i> they need to prosper. Thus, Capital is itself, a social construct.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy 2.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In April of 2010 - while mourning my father's death and in the midst of
</I>&gt;<i> deep personal crisis - I envisioned *Metapolitik.org*, an open,
</I>&gt;<i> transparent framework for 'deep democratic dialogue'. The idea was simple,
</I>&gt;<i> to create an accessible, inclusive, online-forum and polling-system where
</I>&gt;<i> real working people could determine the issues and view opinions of their
</I>&gt;<i> peers in a real-time manner, similar to Facebook or Google Analytics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The vision was to create a viable alternative to the skewed two-party
</I>&gt;<i> media debate as well as an online voting framework that would call into
</I>&gt;<i> question the basic assumptions underlying our two-party electoral system,
</I>&gt;<i> the electoral college and perhaps even the assumed need for
</I>&gt;<i> 'representatives', who of course, only seem to ever represent their own
</I>&gt;<i> interests. I for one, have always questioned 'representational' government
</I>&gt;<i> and have always wondered what the world might be like if we could represent
</I>&gt;<i> ourselves in politics the way we do on our Facebook pages and our blogs?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine what our democracy might look like if it were designed today using
</I>&gt;<i> modern technology and security safeguards: No electoral college, no closed
</I>&gt;<i> primaries forcing candidates to bend to powerful special interests, no
</I>&gt;<i> antiquated voting booths and arcane mechanical devices, no long lines at
</I>&gt;<i> the polls, instead of talking heads backed by powerful media corporations
</I>&gt;<i> putting their spin on things in a top-down, one-way dialogue aimed more at
</I>&gt;<i> spreading corporate propaganda than at telling the truth, we would all
</I>&gt;<i> chime-in on the issues of the day via video, blogs, and powerful,
</I>&gt;<i> secure-polling software that all of us carried in the palm of our hands.
</I>&gt;<i> Modern defenders of pluralist government would no doubt devise a process
</I>&gt;<i> that was open, citizen-driven, and capable of producing policy that truly
</I>&gt;<i> reflected the Will of The People.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Like most simple ideas however, this one was a lot easier to dream up than
</I>&gt;<i> it was to implement. Building the software and the proper secure server
</I>&gt;<i> environment for an actual techno-democracy had (to the best of my
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge) never been done before and all sorts of difficult questions had
</I>&gt;<i> to be answered first like: Who would host it? Who would administer the
</I>&gt;<i> server? How would we insure against hacking and virus-based attempts to
</I>&gt;<i> defraud the system? How would we insure against a technocracy run by system
</I>&gt;<i> administrators? In other words, how could we ensure that we did not
</I>&gt;<i> recreate the very problems that we sought to solve in the first place?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are important questions for any thinking person to ask themselves,
</I>&gt;<i> much less anyone engaged in any level of civic discourse or in developing a
</I>&gt;<i> next generation voting engine. For as any historian can tell you, as
</I>&gt;<i> cultures evolve and the meanings of words change, a political system set up
</I>&gt;<i> to nurture people's liberty may one day later be subverted to take those
</I>&gt;<i> liberties away. This meant, that in order for me to responsibly pursue such
</I>&gt;<i> an endeavor I was going to need to do a lot of research first. Perhaps more
</I>&gt;<i> importantly, I would need to know if anyone had already tried anything
</I>&gt;<i> similar or was already thinking along these lines. This led me to the
</I>&gt;<i> rediscovery of Rushkoff's work in promoting what he calls 'Open Source
</I>&gt;<i> Democracy', a real-time, networked democratic process which is both
</I>&gt;<i> thoroughly transparent and thoroughly inclusive across boundaries of class
</I>&gt;<i> and race.

</I>&gt;<i> Hollywood Babylon - Re-Examining the Red / Blue Orthodoxy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Even a cursory examination of American politics immediately reveals the
</I>&gt;<i> bizarre red/blue color-coding and groupings used to discuss the issues and
</I>&gt;<i> to push people into positions along party-lines. While analyzing these
</I>&gt;<i> red/blue, conservative/liberal dichotomies that the entire debate seems
</I>&gt;<i> inevitably framed in, I eventually came to the observation that our 2 1/2
</I>&gt;<i> party political system, in which one party - the party of the rich - always
</I>&gt;<i> manages to get it's way, is in it's essence a deliberate cybernetic
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism which is systematically used to undermine and short circuit the
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process in various, nefarious ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: No-3D]Like an old set of 1950's red &amp; blue 3D-glasses stuck over
</I>&gt;<i> our eyes, we are expected to believe that one of these two puppet-parties
</I>&gt;<i> have our interests at-heart, when in-fact, they are both funded by Madison
</I>&gt;<i> Ave., Wall Street, Hollywood and the criminal Drug/Oil/Military/Industrial
</I>&gt;<i> Cartels. They are more interested in promoting Globalism, exploiting cheap
</I>&gt;<i> foreign-labor and busting unions than they are in protecting the American
</I>&gt;<i> people.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And much like the visual-effect that one gets using a pair of 3D glasses,
</I>&gt;<i> this stilted red/blue debate is really an illusion designed by wealthy
</I>&gt;<i> political think tanks to take our attention away from the most important
</I>&gt;<i> issues in this country, which of course, are those of unemployment,
</I>&gt;<i> class-warfare and the horribly uneven distribution of wealth. Issues which
</I>&gt;<i> go hand-in-hand with the equally important issues of the environment, our
</I>&gt;<i> dependence on foreign oil, our truly, unapologetic imperialist
</I>&gt;<i> foreign-policy and our economic dependence on China. The US seems hell-bent
</I>&gt;<i> on destroying itself with outmoded economic and military policies that have
</I>&gt;<i> absolutely no place in the civilized world.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cognitive dissonance is beyond schizophrenic: We claim to be against
</I>&gt;<i> slavery when we tolerate and support a corporate culture of wage slavery in
</I>&gt;<i> our workplaces every day. We claim to be against totalitarian dictatorships
</I>&gt;<i> but we tolerate and support totalitarianism in third world countries and
</I>&gt;<i> prop-up foreign dictators with frightening regularity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Rick Moody of the Guardian.uk&lt;<A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/nov/24/frank-miller-hollywood-fascism">http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/nov/24/frank-miller-hollywood-fascism</A>&gt;informs us - in spite of Hollywood's reputation for being a largely
</I>&gt;<i> 'liberal' industry - in reality, the entertainment industry is an
</I>&gt;<i> increasingly crypto-fascist propaganda mill.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ultimately, as Michael Moore&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism:_A_Love_Story">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism:_A_Love_Story</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> Alex Knight &lt;<A HREF="http://endofcapitalism.com/alex-knight/">http://endofcapitalism.com/alex-knight/</A>&gt;and (many) others
</I>&gt;<i> have repeatedly observed, what really is called into question is the
</I>&gt;<i> economic system of capitalism and what it needs to be replaced with is a
</I>&gt;<i> system that is truly democratic. Just as the slavery so common in the early
</I>&gt;<i> Americas needed to be replaced, yet still echoes throughout our society in
</I>&gt;<i> the form of poverty and ravaged communities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But what does a true democracy look like? Especially in a networked world
</I>&gt;<i> where entire social movements like the Egyptian uprising can happen in a
</I>&gt;<i> matter of days or even hours with the help of web technology? And what
</I>&gt;<i> shape does this democracy take? If a two-party electoral system isn't
</I>&gt;<i> working, then what sort of system would? And of course, in order for all of
</I>&gt;<i> this to be* truly democratic*, won't *'The People'* have to answer these
</I>&gt;<i> questions themselves?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Well, first we've got to get them talking to each other.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: People who like Venn Diagrams] All people (unless they suffer
</I>&gt;<i> from severe emotional damage) want essentially the same things for
</I>&gt;<i> themselves and their fellow humans: peace and prosperity. However,
</I>&gt;<i> different political parties and ideologies have very differing ideas about
</I>&gt;<i> how to achieve these goals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From a &quot;conservative&quot; (red/republican/libertarian) perspective, the
</I>&gt;<i> economy is a zero-sum game in which we all must compete against each other
</I>&gt;<i> for resources. Whereas from a &quot;liberal&quot; (blue / democrat) perspective, the
</I>&gt;<i> economy is a state-administered zero-sum game in which order must be
</I>&gt;<i> maintained via the rule of law. In the US, these two polar economic views
</I>&gt;<i> monopolize the debate and make it nearly impossible for creative, divergent
</I>&gt;<i> viewpoints to get involved in the political process. Thus, the green party
</I>&gt;<i> is currently atrophied and desperately in need of an influx of political
</I>&gt;<i> capital (people. not money).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The map below is a &quot;cartograph&quot;, or visualization of the political maps of
</I>&gt;<i> the US, based on the 2008 Presidential election. Notice that all of the
</I>&gt;<i> color fields are entire districts and that all districts are filled with
</I>&gt;<i> completely solid colors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While it may not be obvious to the casual observer, this map is actually
</I>&gt;<i> lacking in a great deal of statistical data to the extent that it does not
</I>&gt;<i> have a high degree of granularity. By applying the winner-take-all effect
</I>&gt;<i> of the map to show which parties won which districts, the map fails to
</I>&gt;<i> reveal an accurate picture of the public's leanings, in that the map gives
</I>&gt;<i> the visual impression that a district won by a Republican Party candidate
</I>&gt;<i> has no Democratic Party or Green Party voters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The cartographs below on the other hand, were published by Mark Newman,
</I>&gt;<i> from the University of Michigan. These visualizations provide more accuracy
</I>&gt;<i> than the traditional red-state/blue-state mapping system, this is done by
</I>&gt;<i> county, using Red, Blue or shades of Purple, based on their percentage of
</I>&gt;<i> vote. The Map on the right uses the same color scheme, but with each of the
</I>&gt;<i> counties scaled to visually show their population size. The idea is to help
</I>&gt;<i> us see the voter breakdown by population more accurately. Producing an
</I>&gt;<i> oddly shaped but recognizable map.

</I>&gt;<i> politics &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics</A>&gt; by advocating

</I>&gt;<i> phrase *&quot;Third Way&quot;* is used to refer to Distributism&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> or similar Populist &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism</A>&gt; or Progressive&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism</A>&gt;policies such as FDR's New Deal or (more recently) ideas such as Resource

</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another example of Third Way politics would be the &quot;Radical Center&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_center_%28politics%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_center_%28politics%29</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - or:  a philosophy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy</A>&gt; as well as
</I>&gt;<i> an associated political movement&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_movement</A>&gt;and position on the political spectrum. Adherents of this philosophy claim
</I>&gt;<i> to improve policy and general politics by not harboring a bias toward the
</I>&gt;<i> precedence of either markets or the state, as can be characterized of right-wing
</I>&gt;<i> politics &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics</A>&gt; and left-wing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Various groups have adopted *radical center* as a term to describe a
</I>&gt;<i> philosophy which includes their belief that, in affirming the core

</I>&gt;<i> Social Threefolding
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Social Threefolding* &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_threefolding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_threefolding</A>&gt;is a
</I>&gt;<i> sociological &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociological</A>&gt; theory that
</I>&gt;<i> suggests increasing the independence of society's three primary realms (
</I>&gt;<i> economy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy</A>&gt;, politics&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics</A>&gt;and
</I>&gt;<i> culture &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture</A>&gt;) in such a way that those
</I>&gt;<i> three realms can mutually correct each other in an ongoing process. The
</I>&gt;<i> movement aims for equality of rights in political life, freedom in cultural
</I>&gt;<i> life, and associative cooperation in economic life. It originated out of
</I>&gt;<i> the philosophy of Anthroposophy&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy</A>&gt;founded by Rudolf
</I>&gt;<i> Steiner &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steiner held that it is socially destructive when one of the three spheres
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to dominate the others; for example, theocracy means a cultural
</I>&gt;<i> impulse dominates economy and politics; conventional shareholder capitalism
</I>&gt;<i> means economic life dominates the polity and culture; and state socialism
</I>&gt;<i> means government dominates culture and economy.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A more specific example: Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Salter,_1st_Baron_Salter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Salter,_1st_Baron_Salter</A>&gt;has suggested that governments frequently fail when they begin to give
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;discretionary, particularly preferential privileges to competitive
</I>&gt;<i> industry.&quot; Steiner said the three social spheres had very gradually, over
</I>&gt;<i> thousands of years, been growing independent of each other, and would
</I>&gt;<i> naturally tend to continue to do so. Consciously effecting stages of this
</I>&gt;<i> independence thus works in accordance with society's natural evolution, and
</I>&gt;<i> gradually leads society beyond the three forms of domination mentioned.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steiner distinguished three realms of society:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    - the economy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy</A>&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i>    - politics &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics</A>&gt; and human rights&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights</A>&gt;;
</I>&gt;<i>    and
</I>&gt;<i>    - cultural institutions &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i>    including science, education, arts and religion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He suggested that the three would only function together harmoniously when
</I>&gt;<i> each was granted sufficient independence. This has become known as &quot;social
</I>&gt;<i> threefolding&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many institutions have striven to realize a relative independence of the
</I>&gt;<i> three spheres within their own structures; the Waldorf schools&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf_education</A>&gt;deserve special mention in this regard. Another application has been the
</I>&gt;<i> creation of various socially-responsible banks and foundations. Though many
</I>&gt;<i> concrete reform proposals to advance a &quot;threefold social order&quot; at various
</I>&gt;<i> scales have been advanced, Steiner emphasized that the specifics of how
</I>&gt;<i> this could best be done are contingent on the particular situation. Bernard
</I>&gt;<i> Lievegoed &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lievegoed">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Lievegoed</A>&gt; incorporated
</I>&gt;<i> significant aspects of social threefolding in his work on organizational

</I>&gt;<i> and its simultaneous predominance and invisibility at Occupy Wall Street
</I>&gt;<i> carries a biting irony. Di Suvero is one of the great artists of the
</I>&gt;<i> American left, a member of the city's crane operators' union, who went into
</I>&gt;<i> exile to protest the Vietnam war. Its irrelevance to the young folks down
</I>&gt;<i> at Occupy Wall Street may be of a piece with their chant on the Brooklyn
</I>&gt;<i> Bridge last weekend that &quot;the whole world is watching&quot; &#8211; a phrase that a
</I>&gt;<i> few of them must realise dates all the way back to the demonstrations at
</I>&gt;<i> the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago. Or the sculpture's erasure may
</I>&gt;<i> have a darker meaning: high capital has already absorbed one generation of
</I>&gt;<i> protesters into its logic, and this one probably won't fare much better.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> Synergetics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But whether Jerry Tallmer, Jason Farago, or the other 99% know it, this
</I>&gt;<i> sculpture has stronger, deeper and more meaningful connotations than any of
</I>&gt;<i> them seem to be aware. I'm pretty sure that the artist, Mark di Suvero,
</I>&gt;<i> understands these implications perfectly well... But alas, he doesn't seem
</I>&gt;<i> to be talking. That is, except for this single paragraph in the interview:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&#8220;It&#8217;s not an X,&#8221; the sculptor no less genially- explosively corrected
</I>&gt;<i> this writer during a telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no X in it! It&#8217;s a
</I>&gt;<i> series of tetrahedrons that are open at the ends. Yes, of course I call
</I>&gt;<i> it a piece. A sculpture. Yes, of course it can be taken apart and put
</I>&gt;<i> back together. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s unique about these pieces [his life&#8217;s work]:
</I>&gt;<i> They can be disassembled.&#8221; *[emphasis mine]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Tetrahedral Modularity**. *Sounds like the work of the late *Mr. R.
</I>&gt;<i> Buckiminster Fuller* (*July 12, 1895 &#8211; July 1, 1983*), or *&quot;Bucky&quot;* as
</I>&gt;<i> he's known to his fans and friends. Bucky, as some of you may know - was
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for a grand and brilliant body of work and a very unique
</I>&gt;<i> legacy. Like his contemporary, *Jaques Fresco*&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> he was a champion of ideas addressing the needs of* all people *and was
</I>&gt;<i> an engineering pioneer in his day with 28 US patents bearing his name. The
</I>&gt;<i> most famous of these is perhaps the 'geodesic dome' or 'geodesic sphere'
</I>&gt;<i> like the one seen at *Disneys Epcot Center*&lt;<A HREF="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/parks/epcot/</A>&gt;in south Florida.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Epcot Center 1982] &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epcot</A>&gt;But what
</I>&gt;<i> is less well know is that - much like Jaques Fresco's 'Venus Project' and
</I>&gt;<i> 'resource Based Economy', Bucky had his own body of work known as *&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Synergetics &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29</A>&gt;&quot;* - a
</I>&gt;<i> cross-disciplinary approach to systems thinking and as such: a metaphoric
</I>&gt;<i> language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts. More
</I>&gt;<i> specifically, a tool used to reference the empirical study of systems in
</I>&gt;<i> transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by
</I>&gt;<i> the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long
</I>&gt;<i> before the term *'synergy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy</A>&gt;'* became
</I>&gt;<i> popular in corporate jargon.]

</I>&gt;<i> *[image: Sphere Packing] &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_packing</A>&gt;**&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> Synergetics is the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an
</I>&gt;<i> emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any
</I>&gt;<i> isolated components, including humanity&#8217;s role as both participant and
</I>&gt;<i> observer. Since systems are identifiable at every scale from the quantum
</I>&gt;<i> level to the cosmic, and humanity both articulates the behavior of these
</I>&gt;<i> systems and is composed of these systems, synergetics is a very broad
</I>&gt;<i> discipline, and embraces a broad range of scientific and philosophical
</I>&gt;<i> studies including tetrahedral and close-packed-sphere geometries,
</I>&gt;<i> thermodynamics, chemistry, psychology, biochemistry, economics, philosophy
</I>&gt;<i> and theology.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Tetrahedron] &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron</A>&gt;...Thus,
</I>&gt;<i> Synergetics is a legitimate branch of Cybernetics&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> , also known as Generalized Systems Theory. Synergetics defines the primary
</I>&gt;<i> unit of space as a tetrahedron (as opposed to the cube) and - in Design
</I>&gt;<i> Science &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Science">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Science</A>&gt;- is more oriented
</I>&gt;<i> toward round, circular, spherical enclosures. This is in direct contrast
</I>&gt;<i> and opposition to much of so-called 'civilized society' which by and large
</I>&gt;<i> prefers the cube as it's basic unit of enclosing space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (This is evident when looking at the way that city streets are typically
</I>&gt;<i> laid-out, how buildings are typically constructed and how much of our
</I>&gt;<i> society is - in general - based on squares, cubes and right-angles).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fuller also observed that the natural analytic geometry of the universe --
</I>&gt;<i> which he termed 'synergetics&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29</A>&gt;'
</I>&gt;<i> -- was invariably based on arrays of tessellating, interlocking and
</I>&gt;<i> nesting tetrahedra &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron</A>&gt;. He
</I>&gt;<i> developed this idea in several ways, from the idea of close-packing spheres (like
</I>&gt;<i> cells in an organism) to the number of compressive or tensile members
</I>&gt;<i> required to stabilize an object in space (spaceframe&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_frame">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_frame</A>&gt;).
</I>&gt;<i> This is an apt metaphor for our interconnectedness on this planet - be it
</I>&gt;<i> environmental or economic.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Buckminster Fuller was one of the first to propagate a systemic worldview,
</I>&gt;<i> exploring principles of energy and material efficiency in the fields of
</I>&gt;<i> architecture, engineering and design. He cited geologist Fran&#231;ois de
</I>&gt;<i> Chardenedes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement
</I>&gt;<i> cost out of our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially, the net incoming
</I>&gt;<i> solar flux), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot; per U.S. gallon (US
</I>&gt;<i> $300,000 per liter) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a
</I>&gt;<i> transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss
</I>&gt;<i> compared to their earnings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounding like a Zen master with a PhD, Fuller once wrote: *&quot;...I am not a
</I>&gt;<i> thing -- a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process &#8211; an
</I>&gt;<i> integral function of the universe.&quot; *The ancient figure below illustrates
</I>&gt;<i> the timeless permanence of Fuller's insight. So called primitive societies
</I>&gt;<i> *intuitively* understood the interdependent, cyclic nature of the Earth's
</I>&gt;<i> ecology. How did we forget?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Fuller was concerned about sustainability and about human survival under
</I>&gt;<i> the existing socio-economic system, yet he remained optimistic about
</I>&gt;<i> humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the *&quot;technological
</I>&gt;<i> ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of
</I>&gt;<i> life&quot;*, his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceship_Earth</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity
</I>&gt;<i> had attained an unprecedented state.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He was convinced that as a result of our accumulated knowledge, combined
</I>&gt;<i> with the vast quantities of *recyclable* resources we had already
</I>&gt;<i> extracted from the earth, we'd attained a critical level of progress that
</I>&gt;<i> rendered competition for resources largely unnecessary. Cooperation had
</I>&gt;<i> instead become the optimum survival strategy. *&quot;Selfishness,&quot;* he
</I>&gt;<i> declared, *&quot;is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is
</I>&gt;<i> obsolete.&quot;* While this may sound overly idealistic or 'pie in the sky',
</I>&gt;<i> it should be noted that the corporations that succeed in today's economy,
</I>&gt;<i> often do so by virtue of their ability to cooperate with one another.

</I>&gt;<i> Resource Based Economics
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While Bucky Fuller was busy developing and championing the philosophy of
</I>&gt;<i> Synergetics, *Jaques Fresco* &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacque_Fresco</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> was busy dreaming up:* &quot;The Venus Project&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venus_Project">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venus_Project</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;The Venus Project is an organization that advocates American futurist
</I>&gt;<i> Fresco's vision of the future with the aim of improving society by moving
</I>&gt;<i> towards a global sustainable social design that they call a &quot;resource-based
</I>&gt;<i> economy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-based_economy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-based_economy</A>&gt;&quot;. Such a
</I>&gt;<i> system incorporates sustainable cities and values, energy efficiency, collective
</I>&gt;<i> farms, natural resource management and advanced automation, focusing on
</I>&gt;<i> the benefits that these developments will bring to humanity. The name of
</I>&gt;<i> the organization originates from Venus, Florida, where its research center
</I>&gt;<i> is located, near Lake Okeechobee. Within the center are ten buildings,
</I>&gt;<i> designed by Fresco, which showcase the architecture of the project. Future

</I>&gt;<i> In a 'resource-based economy', resources are held in a public trust as the
</I>&gt;<i> property of the people, moving beyond the need for the artificial
</I>&gt;<i> boundaries that separate individuals in a community.* Ideally*, in a
</I>&gt;<i> global, resource-based economy, all of the planet's resources are held as
</I>&gt;<i> the common heritage of Earth's people, transcending the need for the
</I>&gt;<i> artificial boundaries that separate all individuals and cultures. This is
</I>&gt;<i> the unifying imperative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The term '*resource-based economy*' was originated by designer and
</I>&gt;<i> futurist, Jacque Fresco &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Fresco">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Fresco</A>&gt;. It
</I>&gt;<i> is a system in which all goods and services are available without the use
</I>&gt;<i> of money, credits, barter or any other system of debt or servitude. All
</I>&gt;<i> resources become the common heritage of all of the inhabitants, *not just
</I>&gt;<i> a select few.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A resource-based economy will utilize existing resources from the land and
</I>&gt;<i> sea, physical equipment, industrial plants, etc. to enhance the lives of
</I>&gt;<i> the total population. In an economy based on resources rather than money,
</I>&gt;<i> we will easily produce all of the necessities of life and provide a high
</I>&gt;<i> standard of living for all while simultaneously reducing our levels of
</I>&gt;<i> consumption and waste by stream-lining the production, distribution and
</I>&gt;<i> organization of resources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consider the following examples: At the beginning of World War II the US
</I>&gt;<i> had a mere 600 or so first-class fighting aircraft. We rapidly overcame
</I>&gt;<i> this short supply by turning out more than 90,000 planes a year. The
</I>&gt;<i> question at the start of World War II was: *Do we have enough funds to
</I>&gt;<i> produce the required implements of war?* The answer:* No*, we did not
</I>&gt;<i> have enough money, nor did we have enough gold; but we did have more than
</I>&gt;<i> enough resources. It was the available *resources* that enabled the US to
</I>&gt;<i> achieve the high production and efficiency required to win the war.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately this approach only seems to be considered in times of war or
</I>&gt;<i> national emergency. Between the state of the economy and the current crisis
</I>&gt;<i> in the Gulf, we'd say a state of national emergency exists.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A resource-based economy will overcome scarcity by using renewable sources
</I>&gt;<i> of energy, food and materials, as well as computerized, semi-automated
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturing and inventory and the limitless resource of human potential
</I>&gt;<i> and collective will. It will maintain safe, energy-efficient cities
</I>&gt;<i> featuring advanced, ecologically-sound transportation systems, and will
</I>&gt;<i> provide universal health care, relevant education and universal access to
</I>&gt;<i> employment. This can be accomplished by creating a new set of economic
</I>&gt;<i> incentives based on *humane values* and environmental concerns and which
</I>&gt;<i> negate the shallow, self-centered goals of individual wealth, property,
</I>&gt;<i> power and privilege.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As Comedian *Lewis Black &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Black">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Black</A>&gt;*recently pointed out while brandishing an iPhone:
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;This thing has more power than a cold war supercomputer and I can't
</I>&gt;<i> have clean energy?!&quot; *Black also thinks we should *&quot;Invade BP&quot;*. Not a
</I>&gt;<i> bad idea. They could use some wealth-redistribution right about now. And
</I>&gt;<i> they call themselves a socialized industry.

</I>&gt;<i> Synergetic Economy
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, the question inevitably gets asked: *&quot;Who will pay for it?&quot;*...A question loaded with so many false basic assumptions, so riddled with
</I>&gt;<i> shaky logic and so indicative of the complete cluelessness that capitalist
</I>&gt;<i> society has indoctrinated us with... That it hardly seems to warrant
</I>&gt;<i> consideration. However, since this is the first question the average US
</I>&gt;<i> Citizen will probably ask, I will spell it out for you:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The entire premise of currency or of *&quot;money&quot;* is a deeply flawed
</I>&gt;<i> construct and a complete legal fiction that enables a non-working leisure
</I>&gt;<i> class to parasitically feed off of the lower and middle class in our
</I>&gt;<i> society. The institution of our modern monetary system has been
</I>&gt;<i> deliberately put in place to ensure that those at the top stay at the top (
</I>&gt;<i> *as do their offspring*) while everyone else gets the shaft. This spans
</I>&gt;<i> the spectrum from the (*privately-owned*) Federal Reserve Banking System
</I>&gt;<i> to the fact that many private bankers get cushy, powerful appointments in
</I>&gt;<i> the Treasury Department and various Federal economic oversight committees
</I>&gt;<i> where they proceed to further pillage our economic system with wild abandon.

</I>&gt;<i> Unlike the hyperbolic ravings from the right over the years about the *&quot;Red
</I>&gt;<i> Threat&quot;* (*in the 1950's*) and *&quot;Terrorists&quot; *(*now*)... These ideas are

</I>&gt;<i> The Myth of 'Rational Self Interest'
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Synergetic Economy]In a society who's primary economic philosophy
</I>&gt;<i> consists of stating flatly: *&quot;self interest is rational&quot;*, any form of
</I>&gt;<i> altruism or desire to help others becomes ipso-facto: *irr*ational. We nowknow that this somewhat bizarre line of reasoning (known as: '
</I>&gt;<i> social-Darwinism') is a *deeply* flawed relic from some former, harsher,
</I>&gt;<i> more patriarchal period of history that we have thankfully stepped out of.
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly, markets* do not*, cannot and *will not* regulate themselves
</I>&gt;<i> effectively.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On a small planet with finite resources -- where we all breathe the same
</I>&gt;<i> air, drink the same water and eat the same food from the same oceans and
</I>&gt;<i> farms -- there is simply no logic in competitive behavior. Thus, the
</I>&gt;<i> cultural meme of so-called 'rational self-interest' will be inoculated -
</I>&gt;<i> as ignorance always is, eventually - by a deep, shared understanding of 'Enlightened
</I>&gt;<i> Self Interest &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_self-interest</A>&gt;'
</I>&gt;<i> or: '*sustainable altruism*'. Examples of sustainable altruism range from micro
</I>&gt;<i> finance to crowd-sourcing and even include collaborative technologies
</I>&gt;<i> such as Wikipedia &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</A>&gt; and Drupal&lt;<A HREF="http://drupal.org/">http://drupal.org/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will be a difficult task, but worth it in every way. The real
</I>&gt;<i> challenge comes from our own cherished, unexamined beliefs about the world.
</I>&gt;<i> We are collectively inundated by the doctrine of rational self interest on
</I>&gt;<i> a daily basis by every pundit, politician, product placement and PowerPoint
</I>&gt;<i> presentation we come into contact with. The American establishment spends
</I>&gt;<i> billions of dollars keeping that steady drumbeat of propaganda rhythmically
</I>&gt;<i> and ceaselessly pounding into our collective head.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In order to effectively inoculate ourselves against this 'thought virus'
</I>&gt;<i> that has infected the body politic, we must learn to identify it and attack

</I>&gt;<i> Mapping the Political Spectrum
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Typical Political Chart] &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nolanchart.com/">http://www.nolanchart.com/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While analyzing the problem of Red/Blue Orthodoxy in light of Buckminster
</I>&gt;<i> Fuller's concept of Synergetics: It became clear to me that the traditional
</I>&gt;<i> 2-dimensional / 2-axis map of the political-spectrum (such as the Nolan
</I>&gt;<i> Chart &lt;<A HREF="http://www.nolanchart.com/">http://www.nolanchart.com/</A>&gt; for example) was insufficient for
</I>&gt;<i> mapping the complex ways that people think about and discuss politics.
</I>&gt;<i> While it outlines the difference between &quot;authoritarianism&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;individualism&quot; and attempts to show us where these concepts seem to
</I>&gt;<i> intersect with &quot;progressive&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; ideals, it does not
</I>&gt;<i> address: corporatism, labor, or the staggering impact of technology.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since just about everyone I have ever met falls-into or defines themselves
</I>&gt;<i> politically by one of several 'camps', it seemed suitable *(for the time
</I>&gt;<i> being at least)* to let the labels lay where they may and to use the
</I>&gt;<i> existing red/green/blue party-affiliation labels to define where a person
</I>&gt;<i> stood on any particular issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: RGB Political Spectrum]I envisioned a color-coding system, or
</I>&gt;<i> 'color-wheel' &#8211; utilizing a Venn diagram&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram</A>&gt;of the parties &#8211; that would allow a person to map their political 'colors'
</I>&gt;<i> (above, left), based on their stance on various issues ranging from
</I>&gt;<i> health-care to the environment, foreign-policy to economics, you name it.
</I>&gt;<i> Based on their answers to these questions, a person's 'political colors'
</I>&gt;<i> would become apparent and they could then use this information to find
</I>&gt;<i> other people in the network that they shared their values with and could
</I>&gt;<i> then use the platform as a communications-tool for open discussion with
</I>&gt;<i> that person or persons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, 'greens' could network with other 'greens', 'blues' with 'blues' and
</I>&gt;<i> so on. More importantly, it would allow users to find common-ground or
</I>&gt;<i> areas of agreement with people in other parties based on where their
</I>&gt;<i> interests *intersected*. This could all be tied-in with the Google Maps
</I>&gt;<i> API so that geographic maps of public opinions could be generated and
</I>&gt;<i> people could finally get a handle on American politics without the 'camera
</I>&gt;<i> obscura' of mainstream media putting it's childish, dualistic spin on
</I>&gt;<i> everything.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This three-party political map where certain interests overlap is - in
</I>&gt;<i> some respects - a lot easier to communicate to someone than say, the Nolan
</I>&gt;<i> Chart &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart</A>&gt;, which is basically
</I>&gt;<i> two-sided and thus, only reflective of the old red/blue dichotomy.
</I>&gt;<i> Ironically our only remotely viable third-party in this country happens to
</I>&gt;<i> be labeled 'green', which is about the same color as the money that we
</I>&gt;<i> collectively don't have to compete in Federal elections. Thus, a democracy
</I>&gt;<i> that truly respects the will of 'The People' will not be controlled simply
</I>&gt;<i> be red or blue interests at any one time, but will be an open forum
</I>&gt;<i> in-which red,green and blue perspectives all have an equal voice and an
</I>&gt;<i> equal-access to direct democracy through real-time participation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The interesting thing about this approach is that by sheer coincidence,
</I>&gt;<i> the colors red, green and blue also happen to be the three
</I>&gt;<i> constituent-colors of all light that is visible to humans. This is why
</I>&gt;<i> color TVs and computer monitors were called 'RGB' for years *(Sony
</I>&gt;<i> branded theirs the 'Trinitron' but it was the same basic concept)*, as
</I>&gt;<i> they are capable of reproducing all three colors and thereby, the entire
</I>&gt;<i> visible spectrum.

</I>&gt;<i> A more accurate mapping of the body politic would probably more closely
</I>&gt;<i> resemble a sphere, a hexagon, or an isometrically-projected 3D-cube,
</I>&gt;<i> depicted as a gradient color-wheel - similar to what one sees when choosing
</I>&gt;<i> a color in a graphics program such as Photoshop or Gimp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This hexadecimal color-chart that web-developers use to quickly find the
</I>&gt;<i> color codes that they are looking for is also a great example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The very word 'spectrum' evokes the idea of linearity (lines). However,
</I>&gt;<i> this one-dimensional approach leaves a lot to be desired in that it
</I>&gt;<i> polarizes all political discourse into one of two competing groups and
</I>&gt;<i> proceeds to ignore and marginalize various viewpoints that do not
</I>&gt;<i> necessarily fit into the red/blue framing of the political debate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As observed elsewhere in this article, this is not unlike looking at the
</I>&gt;<i> world through a set of old 1950s 3D glasses with their red and blue
</I>&gt;<i> celluloid lenses.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[Autor's note: This is all very much in the 'vaporware' stages and many
</I>&gt;<i> - if not all - of the details have yet to be determined.]*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [image: Model 1]*Metapolitik* is basically software designed to ascribe a
</I>&gt;<i> hexadecimal &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal</A>&gt; (RGB) additive&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color</A>&gt;color-value to various people, organizations, or ideas based on their views
</I>&gt;<i> on various social, economic and environmental issues. These views are then
</I>&gt;<i> expressed by an individual's level of &quot;Red&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_state">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_state</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Right, Republican, 'Conservative', etc...), &quot;Green&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_state#The_Green_State">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_state#The_Green_State</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Green, Radical, Anarchist, etc...) or &quot;Blue&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_state">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_state</A>&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (Liberal, Democrat, etc...) ideals. In so-doing, it creates corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> 'value-categories' or 'collusion-factors' - colors that are ascribed to
</I>&gt;<i> each group's bones of contention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Thus...*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Reds&quot;* correspond to the color: *Cyan* (labor / worker's-rights) -
</I>&gt;<i> since the Republican Party is so often opposed to populist or progressive
</I>&gt;<i> legislation or anything else that compromises economic prosperity for the
</I>&gt;<i> rich.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *[ It should be noted that this map pertains largely to US politics. For
</I>&gt;<i> instance, this is the only country on the planet** (that I know of) **were
</I>&gt;<i> 'Red' has come to mean Capitalist / Conservative instead of Communist /
</I>&gt;<i> Socialist ]*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Greens&quot;* are ascribed: *Magenta* (economy: state-power /
</I>&gt;<i> monetary-control / economic-regulation) for their opposition to what they
</I>&gt;<i> perceive as &quot;fascist&quot; (state-centered) political ideologies and/or: greed,
</I>&gt;<i> mercantilism and imperialism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;Blues&quot;* are assigned: *Yellow* (liberty: personal-responsibility:
</I>&gt;<i> individual autonomy, freedom, etc...) since &quot;Blues&quot; are so often centered
</I>&gt;<i> on expansion of government, legislation, taxes, etc... and since they
</I>&gt;<i> typically support limiting certain freedoms such as gun ownership, etc...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> All of these secondary colors (*CM**Y**K*) are - within this context also
</I>&gt;<i> known as *'collusion-factors'* because - in addition to illustrating
</I>&gt;<i> contrast or conflict, they also constitute areas where each camp finds the
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity for common ground and as a result - progressive policymaking.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An area where everyone is in agreement has no color and is considered
</I>&gt;<i> 'clear'. If this is at all confusing, please see the images below:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the basic premise of Metapolitik is that the two-party red / blue
</I>&gt;<i> politics in this country (conservative / liberal, capitalist / socialist,
</I>&gt;<i> privatized / public, etc...) are hopelessly skewed without the influx of
</I>&gt;<i> green ideas and policies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [We are currently seeing these &quot;Green&quot; ideas expressed en masse at the protests
</I>&gt;<i> in New York and around the world &lt;<A HREF="http://occupywallst.org/">http://occupywallst.org/</A>&gt;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, a balanced political discourse would be an RGB (red, green, blue)
</I>&gt;<i> political discourse. This makes sense from a socio-biological perspective
</I>&gt;<i> as-well. Humans are biologically programmed to see (and probably even to
</I>&gt;<i> think) in terms of red, green and blue as a direct result of the red, green
</I>&gt;<i> and blue photoreceptors &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell</A>&gt;in our eyes that allow us to perceive the various colors in nature. The
</I>&gt;<i> result will be a dynamic, isometric, three-dimensional (four-dimensional,
</I>&gt;<i> if you count the forward motion of time) mapping of the political-spectrum
</I>&gt;<i> in real-time, as opposed to the traditional, static, two-dimensional
</I>&gt;<i> political maps such as the Nolan Chart, etc....

</I>&gt;<i> Direct Digital Democracy (D3GA)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *An Online General Assembly and Transparent, Open-Source, Online Voting
</I>&gt;<i> and Policy Development Engine*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Utilizing the principles set-forth in the Occupy Wall St. General
</I>&gt;<i> Assemblies (digital hand signals, via keyboard shortcuts and flashing
</I>&gt;<i> icons), participants would be able to effect real-time Deep Democratic
</I>&gt;<i> Dialogue (3D) via live multicast General Assemblies replete with video
</I>&gt;<i> feeds and a digital log of participant's voting activity culminating in
</I>&gt;<i> time-stamped line graphs and pie-charts. Using streaming-video technology,
</I>&gt;<i> participants would be able to see each other and interact in real time
</I>&gt;<i> video-conferences using the same technology that powers Skype (picture a
</I>&gt;<i> screen with lots of little video windows - similar to 'Hollywood Squares')
</I>&gt;<i> serving to the public a sort of *Global Digital Roundtable.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The engine should be capable of *both** mapping a users general political
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;color&quot;**, as well as** to map the user's political on a particular issue*.
</I>&gt;<i> The user should be able to view 3 maps (*or 3 versions / renderings of
</I>&gt;<i> one map*):
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1)*  How they (user/object) perceive their political leanings (chosen
</I>&gt;<i> colors)
</I>&gt;<i> *2)*  How other users perceive their political leanings (colors chosen by
</I>&gt;<i> other users)
</I>&gt;<i> *3)*  What their views on individual (subject) issues says about their
</I>&gt;<i> political leanings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please excuse any vagueness on this. As I stated previously, all of this
</I>&gt;<i> is very much in the 'vaporware' stages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While the tripartite political chart outlined here is already usable
</I>&gt;<i> as-is, the software version envisions several 'stages':
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *1)* [perceived views - internal] User selects his or her 'camp' (red,
</I>&gt;<i> green or blue) based on political affiliation. In other words, if someone
</I>&gt;<i> has always voted Republican or typically considers themselves a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;conservative&quot;, they would choose 'red'. This doesn't really mean much, but
</I>&gt;<i> provides an idea of what the user considers his/her political leanings and
</I>&gt;<i> as-such, a statistical 'baseline' from which the software will attempt to
</I>&gt;<i> infer/ascertain certain things about them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *2) *[actual views] User completes a questionnaire consisting of various
</I>&gt;<i> multiple-choice questions, which the software then uses to plot their
</I>&gt;<i> actual views against what it already knows about their political
</I>&gt;<i> affiliation (from #1, above).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *3)* [perceived views - external] How other users perceive your views.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hexadecimal Mapping
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (*if you already understand 'hex' color-mapping, feel free to skip this*)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In case you are unfamiliar with 'Hex', it basically refers to a numbering
</I>&gt;<i> system that uses 16 as it's base (instead of 10, which would be decimal).
</I>&gt;<i> It does this by assigning a letter (A-F) to any number above 10. Example:
</I>&gt;<i> 15 (in hex) = 1E. (*see attachment:* &quot;Hex-Colorchart&quot;) This is how
</I>&gt;<i> computers typically communicate and store color-information, with 3 columns
</I>&gt;<i> of 2-hex-digits each (1 for each component color).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *This is illustrated as follows:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    0 = 0    4 = 4    8 = 8   *12 = C*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    1 = 1    5 = 5    9 = 9   *13 = D*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    2 = 2    6 = 6  *10 = A   14 = E*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    3 = 3    7 = 7 * 11 = B   15 = F*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thus, the Red, Green and Blue Values of each color are mapped
</I>&gt;<i> mathematically using three sets of two-digit hexadecimal-values.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Examples:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *#FFFFFF =* White (*all maxed*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#000000* = Black (*no colors*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#**FF**0000* = All *Red* (*no other colors*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#**00**FF**00* = All *Green *(*no other colors*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#**0000**FF* = All *Blue *(*no other colors*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#**CC6600* = *This Color* (*parts red and green with no blue*)
</I>&gt;<i> *#**6600CC* = *This Color* (*parts red and blue with no green*)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...Thus, there are a possible 256 colors (16x16) that can define a
</I>&gt;<i> person's political stance. Technically there are 4096 (16x16x16) - but that
</I>&gt;<i> level of granularity seems like overkill.

</I>&gt;<i> Spatial / Chromatic - Mapping
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Colors attributions are as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Black* - *Anarchy *(Apolitical / Lack of Opinion / &quot;Political
</I>&gt;<i> Agnosticism&quot; / etc...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Let's keep politics out of this.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Red - **Conservative** *(Republican / Capitalist / Pro-Business /
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-State / etc...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Fiscal Responsibility.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Yellow* - *Libertarian *(Individual Rights / Anti-Authoritarian /
</I>&gt;<i> Anti-State / etc...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Don't tread on me.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Green* - *Green Party* (Grass-Roots* / *Environment / Anti-Corporate /
</I>&gt;<i> etc...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Earth First.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Cyan* - *Labor, *(Worker's Rights / Unions)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;People before profits.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Blue - **Democrat* (Pro-State / Pro-Regulation / etc...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;The rule of law.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Magenta* - *Corporatist *(Pro-State/Corporate-Collusion / Entitlement /
</I>&gt;<i> Ruling Class)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Corporations create jobs.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *White / &quot;Clear&quot; - **Synergy / Overlap *(a balanced perspective between
</I>&gt;<i> all 3/6 camps)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>      Motto: *&quot;Consensus.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The basic mechanism of the map lies in the hexadecimal color-coding along
</I>&gt;<i> three interdependent axis as-follows.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Axis 1:* *Blue **/ **Yellow* (Govt. / State Interests *vs.* Individual

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Lexical Mapping
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since all of this is mixed up in how we define words and label concepts
</I>&gt;<i> regarding our political leanings, the software should furnish an array of
</I>&gt;<i> words, laid-out on an RGB / CMYK map, that allows the user to see
</I>&gt;<i> at-a-glance which concepts are in-play at any given time. (*see
</I>&gt;<i> attachments:* &quot;Model-1&quot; &amp; &quot;Model-2&quot;). The idea is that you enter a word
</I>&gt;<i> into a field and the software automatically generates corresponding words
</I>&gt;<i> that are 60, 120 and 180 degrees &quot;away&quot; from that word:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Example:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I typed &quot;conservative&quot; into the 'Red' field, the software would
</I>&gt;<i> automatically fill-in the other fields as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Conservative*
</I>&gt;<i> *Progressive*
</I>&gt;<i> *Liberal*
</I>&gt;<i> *Employment*
</I>&gt;<i> *Privilege*
</I>&gt;<i> *Freedom*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One should be able to type-over any one of these words in-order to
</I>&gt;<i> re-populated the other fields with their corresponding terms. Thus, if I
</I>&gt;<i> replaced the word *&quot;Liberal&quot;* in the list above with the word *&quot;State&quot;*,
</I>&gt;<i> the software would re-populate the list as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Corporate*
</I>&gt;<i> *Ecology*
</I>&gt;<i> *State*
</I>&gt;<i> *Labor*
</I>&gt;<i> *Economy*
</I>&gt;<i> *Individual*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ... The challenge here lies in organizing these terms into 'classes' that
</I>&gt;<i> define different vocabularies and what 'scope' those taxonomies refer-to.
</I>&gt;<i> Since the colors themselves are essentially *arbitrary - *and the true
</I>&gt;<i> distinction lies in their geospatial relationship to one-another - this
</I>&gt;<i> list cound just as easily come out like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *State *
</I>&gt;<i> *Corporate*
</I>&gt;<i> *Ecology*
</I>&gt;<i> *Individual*
</I>&gt;<i> *Labor*
</I>&gt;<i> *Economy *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...Part of the purpose of all this is to demonstrate that the colors
</I>&gt;<i> (in-and-of-themselves) have no *inherent *meaning, but rather are used to
</I>&gt;<i> 'frame', 'label' and communicate various concepts.

</I>&gt;<i> VRDB
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When discussing 'eDemocracy', 'voter registration databases' are an
</I>&gt;<i> important consideration. These are repositories used for identifying users
</I>&gt;<i> and authenticating them as voters. The distinction between voters and users
</I>&gt;<i> and the ability to authenticate them cannot be understated. Such a database
</I>&gt;<i> requires a framework defining things like registration and authentication
</I>&gt;<i> in electoral districts; proof of residence or organizational membership;
</I>&gt;<i> the compilation of voter lists; and so forth.  It does not define
</I>&gt;<i> registration and authentication of users, as such. Thus, it is not
</I>&gt;<i> comparable to OpenID or OAuth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seemed logical to me that there would already be some sort of Open
</I>&gt;<i> Source 'VRDB' (Voter Registration Database) Software being used in various
</I>&gt;<i> projects. Google begs to differ however - informing me that VRDB is the
</I>&gt;<i> acronym most commonly used for *''Variable Rated Demand Bonds&quot; *(a
</I>&gt;<i> financial instrument) and to Avast Software's *&quot;Virus Repository Database&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> *. Only Wikipedia had ever heard of such a thing, where it is referred-to
</I>&gt;<i> simply as a *'Voter Database' *- a page containing some surprising (and
</I>&gt;<i> revealing) information on the subject:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *&quot;The United States has no state or federal election agency, and thus no
</I>&gt;<i> central lists. In 2002, the United States Congress passed HAVA, the Help
</I>&gt;<i> America Vote Act. HAVA required that each state compile an official state
</I>&gt;<i> voter database by January 2006. Most states complied with HAVA by gathering
</I>&gt;<i> the voter files available from each individual county. States decided what
</I>&gt;<i> information to include, what restrictions to place on the use of their
</I>&gt;<i> voter database, and how much the database would cost. In the United States,
</I>&gt;<i> several companies have merged state voter information with commercially
</I>&gt;<i> obtained data to create comprehensive voter databases that include a
</I>&gt;<i> plethora of personal details on each voter. These companies often provide
</I>&gt;<i> United States Voter Files to statutorily permitted or otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> non-restricted users.&quot;*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...Thus, there are numerous state-wide databases to be found, but no
</I>&gt;<i> centralized repository of voter data.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At first glance this is kind of staggering to me considering how vast the
</I>&gt;<i> Federal Government is. But upon further inspection, it makes perfect sense,
</I>&gt;<i> as the potential for abuse of such a repository would be so great, that
</I>&gt;<i> mustering the political will to create one would probably have been quite
</I>&gt;<i> difficult. Thus, such a resource has (apparently, ostensibly, &quot;officially&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> and to the best of our knowledge) never been built. - I qualified that
</I>&gt;<i> statement as I am almost willing to bet that *private *repositories have
</I>&gt;<i> indeed been secretly compile by the likes of *Diebold*, et al. The fact
</I>&gt;<i> that this has never been done is is a double edged sword with a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> implications. From a security / privacy-risk standpoint (concerns that are
</I>&gt;<i> not without precedent&lt;<A HREF="http://www.spamfighter.com/News-16708-Malicious-Program-Compromises-Database-of-Maines-Voter-Registration.htm">http://www.spamfighter.com/News-16708-Malicious-Program-Compromises-Database-of-Maines-Voter-Registration.htm</A>&gt;),
</I>&gt;<i> it is encouraging in the sense that it indicates our collective values in
</I>&gt;<i> rejecting totalitarianism and abuse of power. However, it is also a bit
</I>&gt;<i> discouraging in the sense that it seems to indicate a lack of cooperation
</I>&gt;<i> or coordination in protecting democratic freedoms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *So, from where I'm standing, the whole issue of VRDBs is segmented thus:*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * 1)* Ensuring a reliable, accurate means of securing and authenticating
</I>&gt;<i> voter identities. (*logistic*)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * 2) *The software that #1 (above) would need to run under (*technical*)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My thoughts on #1 are outlined above. As for #2, while there does not
</I>&gt;<i> appear to be an existing Open Source solution, there are numerous
</I>&gt;<i> commercial packages available. With politics these days being so thoroughly
</I>&gt;<i> clouded by money, special interests and lobbyists, it almost goes without
</I>&gt;<i> saying that a 'private' solution is the worst possible approach. Here are
</I>&gt;<i> the ones that I've unearthed:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  - *VoteBuilder* &lt;<A HREF="http://www.votebuilder.com/">http://www.votebuilder.com/</A>&gt; from: *NGPVAN&lt;<A HREF="http://www.ngpvan.com/">http://www.ngpvan.com/</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> *
</I>&gt;<i>  - *AccuVote&lt;<A HREF="http://www.premierelections.com/secure_solutions/voting_equipment.html">http://www.premierelections.com/secure_solutions/voting_equipment.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> * from *Premier Election* (*front for Diebold*)
</I>&gt;<i>  - *ES&amp;S &lt;<A HREF="http://www.essvote.com/HTML/home.html">http://www.essvote.com/HTML/home.html</A>&gt; *from *Election Systems
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; Software Inc.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *...There are more, but I don't feel like listing them because - as far
</I>&gt;<i> as I'm concerned - they are all part of the problem.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To sum all of this up, some sort of shared / collaborative *VRDB **will
</I>&gt;<i> be required. The same goes for mirroring and shared issue-identifiers.*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *The biggest concern about any of this would be the potential for
</I>&gt;<i> developing another political 'monoculture' such as the one we seem to have
</I>&gt;<i> now. I personally believe that the best hope for protecting democratic
</I>&gt;<i> freedoms lies in nurturing debate and offering a voice to divergent points
</I>&gt;<i> of view.*

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Software Summary
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *As stated, *all of this is in the 'vaporware' stages. Also, I would like
</I>&gt;<i> to somehow *&quot;crowd-source&quot;* the development of this - thereby making the
</I>&gt;<i> development of it as open, inclusive and Democratic as possible. I have set
</I>&gt;<i> up an account on Sourceforge, but I am pretty new to Github and SVG so it
</I>&gt;<i> will take some time to get the development rolling.

</I>&gt;<i> Collaborative Effort
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Metapolitik is a collaborative effort. Which is to say that the
</I>&gt;<i> development of Metapolitik the software, will be crowdsourced. While we are
</I>&gt;<i> still working out how exactly this crowdsourcing and collaboration will
</I>&gt;<i> take place - an inclusive process that is still being researched and
</I>&gt;<i> discussed - expect to see more from us in the very near future.
</I>&gt;<i>
