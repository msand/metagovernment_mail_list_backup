<PRE>Hi Paul,

thanks for your reply.

I am not that familiar with the situation inside companies.

Can you clarify what you mean by &quot;a delegation have to be paid&quot;.

I was wondering if it was possible to set up a system where a person
could pay someone to vote for him, but then I discarded it because I
thought that is was just another system to give to the rich more
power.

But maybe you are suggesting something different.

Cheers,
Pietro

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the delegation to the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters should be questioned faster
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for &quot;low power&quot; voters? This can be an automatic algorithm and does not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> depend on an interpretation of such a thing as a &quot;fundamental policy&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is:
</I>&gt;<i> The slower a person is in changing his vote the faster the algorithm
</I>&gt;<i> should ignore it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Interesting idea. It has several weakness, but maybe they could be amended.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all people that are only voting once should have their vote
</I>&gt;<i> ignored very very soon. But the algorithm cannot do this too soon
</I>&gt;<i> (enough) before it needs to notice that the person is not changing his
</I>&gt;<i> position anymore. So in a sense the algorithm would always be &quot;late&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> And there is a minimum time that cannot be crossed. The more precise
</I>&gt;<i> you want the algorithm to be the later it will be. Sounds like we
</I>&gt;<i> found a modern equivalent to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, it is offering the flank to people who gather brownie points by
</I>&gt;<i> voting a lot, to then just set the course on something, and go to
</I>&gt;<i> sleep at the wheel. Somehow the algorithm should notice when a person
</I>&gt;<i> changes their behavior. Again noticing this cannot be both precise and
</I>&gt;<i> timely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So we can expect that the system is somehow always having some
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;inertia&quot; either because of the heavy votes that the algorithm has not
</I>&gt;<i> noticed, or the people who were light voters, and then started to gain
</I>&gt;<i> weight. This kind of inertia is similar to what we experience in
</I>&gt;<i> modern democracies, but it would of course be not so bad (we would not
</I>&gt;<i> have to wait 4 years, but much less). Still I hope we can do better
</I>&gt;<i> than this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also the system seem to require a number of &quot;constants&quot;, &quot;thresholds&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> and &quot;functions&quot;. All that should be decided, and each that would have
</I>&gt;<i> an effect on the democracy that would come out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What is the minimum amount of time that a person can stay without
</I>&gt;<i> voting before his votes start rusting? (this is a number)
</I>&gt;<i> How fast should his vote rust? (this is a function)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any implementation of this idea would require the coder to take
</I>&gt;<i> decisions to clarify all this. But any such decision would be hard to
</I>&gt;<i> defend, and would ultimately represent a liability for the system. And
</I>&gt;<i> all this to save a concept that I am not sure we should save: the
</I>&gt;<i> concept of having someone vote for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although the idea is interesting and gave rise to interesting
</I>&gt;<i> consequences, I am still unconvinced that this would solve the problem
</I>&gt;<i> of people who lazily delegate their power. Sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best Regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
