Yes, I think so.  Given the structure of modern society, an ability to
reach primary (formative, normative) consensus is all that's required.
The rest will follow - not quite automatically, but inevitably.

I just applied for the OVN working group.  The diagram on our home
page summarizes what we're talking about:
<A HREF="https://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network">https://wiki.occupy.net/wiki/Open_Voting_Network</A>

The crucial thing is that the electoral system and the GA are
participatory authorities.  In particular, the decisions of the
electoral system absolutely determine the structure of City Council.
City Council will therefore obey the consensus of the OVN, except in
those cases where it knows it shouldn't (there can be exceptions).  In
those cases, it will explain itself.  Anyway, that's the theory.

&gt;<i> I'm grateful for your patience,
</I>
And I for yours!  If it weren't for your earlier encouragement, then
*all* we'd have is theory.  Now we get to put it into practice. :-)

Provided you know your own voters and have a good rapport with them.
You'll be in Dutch of course if they say &quot;no&quot;; or worse if they start
shifting their own support.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Michael,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the distinctions between the &quot;normative&quot; and &quot;executive&quot; systems.....or.....the difference between &quot;(what *is* to be)&quot; and &quot;(what *ought* to be)&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible for the &quot;normative&quot; system to come to a point of *action* without an &quot;executive&quot; decision system to *finalize* it's proposal?  Some of the pivotal actions or protests that arose in Egypt last Spring were informally developed and *agreed to* without any formal (executive) decision-making process. These were potent expressions of a self-organizing (normative) body that created significant change without any final (executive) vote...or approval.  It seems they made no real distinction between &quot;what ought to be&quot; and &quot;what is to be&quot;.    <A HREF="http://blog.ted.com/2011/03/04/inside-the-egyptian-revolution-wael-ghonim-on-ted-com/">http://blog.ted.com/2011/03/04/inside-the-egyptian-revolution-wael-ghonim-on-ted-com/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If a proposal reaches a certain level of development and agreement/consensus...couldn't that alone empower and (in)form some framework of requisite action? Could the consensus/agreement itself BE the *executive* vote for...or approval of...force...as you say?   In my mind, a truly self-organizing body may no longer find it useful to expend the time and energy necessary to develop, maintain, and petition some form of *representative voting system*.  In my mind, a well-developed and thoroughly discussed proposal might alone be *representation* enough....and a broadly based consensus/agreement might alone be a sufficient *vote* of approval. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For me the question is... Could normative (or formative) processes alone be trusted to develop a reasonable *mandate* for ordering the administration of our human enterprise?  Could the equation be....Formative [proposal development and agreement] ---- Executive [administration (or &quot;execution&quot;) of the agreement or mandate]?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When I look at the profusion of critical issues we are now facing and the narrow window we have to adjust our current momentum, the preponderant question for me is...&quot;do we have the time, patience, and collective will to push &quot;legislation&quot; through the existing structures?&quot;   Personally, I don't think so.  The entrenched polarities/obstructions are too great and I wonder whether we're at the crossroads where we need to let go of the embedded or existing &quot;administrative decision systems&quot; entirely....or nearly so...to begin anew.. [The...&quot;You just can't put new wine into old skins&quot;...kinda thing.] 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I believe we need to create (or seed) and empower a large (global), self-organizing, synthesis/consensus based network/movement...and do so very quickly. I don't understand why Votorola, working in tandem with similar systems (through an OVN), couldn't provide the means for developing such a system/movement...on it's own? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I really appreciate your tolerance with my (trying) to articulate this question....again.  I know I'm a little slow on the uptake with all of this. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm grateful for your patience,
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
