<PRE>Hi Ed,
thanks for the invitation.

I wrote my version of the Draft, as I would be willing to support. It
is quite different, so I made it into another page:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Charter/Draft2</A>

Let me explain the differences:

(1) The rules on how to modify the Mission and Principles have been
moved to inside the mission and principles, to avoid someone being
able to change them, as a shortcut to change the mission and
principle.

(2) the 98% has been taken out, and was instead substituted by a 100%
of the voting members, and 80% of all the members. In the previous
version there was no reference to the difference between voting
members and members. In other words a small group of people could vote
a change, without anyone else noticing. That is why for something like
this we need that at least x% of the people must be involved.
Also the 98% seemed a joke.  Why 98%? 100% had a sense (full
consensus). Maybe 96% also could have a sense, as the number of
sociopath in society is about 4%. But 98%?


Rulemaking.

Here is where I made the biggest change.

First of all MG is a meta community. Is a community fo communities.
And we are going to test and try different systems in our evolution.
It is important that each decision taken is official, but is also
important that we never freeze in using a single system. Mostly the
key issue in metagovernment is how to solve open questions. But we
also stand on the shoulders of giants. And those are all those who
made research on how to solve closed questions. Now deciding how to
decide is an open question. But once we have defined a set of options
it becomes a closed question. So my suggestion is that for each
decision we (a) decide how we decide and (b) decide. And since we are
going to test new systems all the time it is possible that from time
to time something truly horrible comes out. SO we need to be able to
go back one decision.

So my suggestion is:
(a) any person can suggest a way to decide

Once all the proposals have been presented, (and only then!), we set
up a shultz voting system. That is about the best technology there is
around for taking closed decisions.

(b) Then the metagovernment members decide how we shall decide.

Not that the MG members here have a special status. Anyone can suggest
a decision method, but only the MG members can then decide how to
decide. This is to avoid that a group of people just come, suggest,
vote for themselves, and then implement the decisions and go away with
the money. What is still missing are the rules that decide how a
person becomes a member. It could be done that anyone asking can
become a member, but in general I think no one can participate in any
decision who have been started before they joined. In fact I would
also add a little time frame (say 3 months), so no one can just come
with all his friends and decide.

(c) Then the decision method is applied, and we decide.

(d) after the decision, it is still possible to overturn the decision.
This is done in a simple, way. If 50%+1 of the MG members feel that
the decision did not represent the community or did not respect the
Mission and Principles they can impose to re-implement the whole
process from the beginning (a).

NOTE: this substitutes the: &quot;No decision shall have force if it is in
contradiction to the Mission and Principles.&quot; which I found to be too
vague to be useful.

(e) Then the result is applied.

I took away references to other decision rules mostly because it does
not make sense to say that something &quot;resembles&quot;. Either something is
identical or not. Something that resembles for me does not for you.

Changes in the Charter, but not on the Mission and Principles are
easier to do. They are done as normal decisions, but need to be done
twice, at a distance of at least 1 month.

The new version I am presenting is at

Cheers,
Pietro

Since Votorola is one of those platforms, then it would include delegation, but I wouldn't say that is representative voting or even necessarily proxy voting.
