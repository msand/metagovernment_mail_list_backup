<PRE>Sure, i didnt want to propose interpretation of policys, ...just wanted to
come up with an example for a different perspective on the issue.

So &quot;change-&amp;heavyness?-dependent acceleration of vote rusting&quot; ?
Could someone come up with a better word for that? :P

@Paul
Do you mean people with many votes should lose their voters faster than
people with only a few votes oder do you mean people who vote rarely should
be more affected by vote rusting?

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> the delegation to the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters should be questioned faster
</I>&gt;<i> then for &quot;low power&quot; voters?  This can be an automatic algorithm and does
</I>&gt;<i> not depend on an interpretation of such a thing as a &quot;fundamental policy&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm, I think I got the issue and I support Pietro's point of view.
</I>&gt;<i> I'd like to comment on....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My idea is that the right of vote should be proportional to how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; willing is a person to be bothered to let his voice be heard.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you a better suggestion that satisfies my need not to be governed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by the people who are too lazy to update their vote, I would be happy
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to hear it. But not a rusting system, that only limits the damage, but
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not eliminate it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People may no always be lazy, sometimes they are very busy, but passively
</I>&gt;<i> follow politics very close.
</I>&gt;<i> Such people might delegate their vote, because they dont want to argue
</I>&gt;<i> about issues, but they always follow the outcomes and will act as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> things change in a way they dont like.
</I>&gt;<i> I think:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters who move their votes slowly for
</I>&gt;<i> whatever reason (might be laziness, but could be anything), votes for a
</I>&gt;<i> proposal (e.g. Human &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/Human.html">http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/Human.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> dignity &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/dignity.html">http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/dignity.html</A>&gt; shall&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/shall.html">http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/shall.html</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>  be &lt;<A HREF="http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/be.html">http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/be.html</A>&gt; inviolable.&lt;<A HREF="http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/inviolable..html">http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/inviolable..html</A>&gt;)
</I>&gt;<i> ... vote rusting should be very very slow, because you dont want such
</I>&gt;<i> fundamental policy's to &quot;rust away&quot; because of people beeing lazy, dont
</I>&gt;<i> you? ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters votes for a proposal and that
</I>&gt;<i> proposal changes, ....the more it changes the more accelerated vote rusting
</I>&gt;<i> should become.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. If someone of the &quot;heavy power&quot; voters decided to accept money or
</I>&gt;<i> anything in order to give away his power, what could you do about it? How
</I>&gt;<i> could you even be sure this has been done? Blame the monetary system!  In
</I>&gt;<i> my view, the monetary system is nothing else but a &quot;voting system&quot; where
</I>&gt;<i> people's voices are not equal and which coexists with democracy.
</I>&gt;<i> If our monetary system would be a fair system, i think money wouldnt
</I>&gt;<i> matter that much, but its not fair (that's why Ron Paul wants to end the
</I>&gt;<i> FED), so i think the argument is valid :-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So whats a solution?
</I>&gt;<i> A. You dont want policy's such as &quot;Human dignity shall be inviolable&quot; to
</I>&gt;<i> rust away because of laziness or because people are paid to move their votes
</I>&gt;<i> B. You want &quot;bad&quot; policy's such as.... (think of an example for yourself)
</I>&gt;<i> ... to rust away fast, so they have to be refreshed on a regular basis in
</I>&gt;<i> order to note give &quot;heavy power&quot; to demagogues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't it be a duty of voters to care for their fellow voters, and
</I>&gt;<i> thats everyone, so shouldn't it be a responsibility of a voter to argue
</I>&gt;<i> with their lazy fellows? The demagogue did the same. He invested a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> time to motivate &quot;heavy power&quot; to move and maybe people should respect that
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;heave power&quot; has moved as it pleases...
</I>&gt;<i> So maybe a voter who doesnt like this shouldinvest a similar amount of
</I>&gt;<i> energy? If one thinks that its not fair, this could be interpreted as
</I>&gt;<i> disrespect for the will of &quot;heavy power&quot; which is heavy for a hodge-podge
</I>&gt;<i> of reasons i guess ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So what do you think of &quot;change-dependent accelerated vote rusting&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS.: If you look close enough, the concept of vote's is not comlpetely
</I>&gt;<i> different from the concept of money. Maybe, in order to solve issues like
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;paying someone for his vote&quot;, we should discuss alternative &quot;seed
</I>&gt;<i> mechanisms&quot; and &quot;control structures&quot; for money?

</I>&gt;<i> 2011/12/11 Pietro Speroni di Fenizio &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">metagovernment at pietrosperoni.it</A>&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Dear Thomas,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let me answer your suggestion:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; requires fresh proposals for each issue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thanks, this is good to know. Could Michael or Thomas confirm it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Because what I saw in respect to the metagovernment rules question was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that Thomas could move his 5 votes as he liked.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The 5 people did not have to give him the vote again.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; At them moment it is like you say, Pietro. But it would be a relativly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; feature to include: &quot;My vote gets automatically withdrawn, when you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> change
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; your postion a bit/ a lot/ completely ...&quot; So this is no question of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; concept.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am afraid it would not be enough. Let me explain:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The problem in a democracy is two fold. On the one side you want that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your vote is counted, that you can change it, that you can collaborate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the drafting and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> On the other side you want that also the vote of other people is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> counted and represents correctly what they feel/believe/think.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If my vote is correctly counted, but the other people vote is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because they are too lazy to keep track of it, now the problem raises
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is what happens to all this power left untaped.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If that power remains attached to someone (because they simply could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not be bothered to update it), the result is that I will live in a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> democracy dominated by the people that have convinced the lazy buggers
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to vote for them, and then forget about it. This is not a democracy I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to live in, and I bet is not a democracy where YOU would want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> live in either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So what should happen with the heavy power of the lazy voters?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (It's heavy because it takes a lot to move it.  But it's also heavy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> because once it has moved it is hard to change it again.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My idea is that the right of vote should be proportional to how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> willing is a person to be bothered to let his voice be heard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you a better suggestion that satisfies my need not to be governed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the people who are too lazy to update their vote, I would be happy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to hear it. But not a rusting system, that only limits the damage, but
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does not eliminate it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As such I am not just having a requirement about my voice, but also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about how others should be allowed to organise between them. In this I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am stepping beyond my direct circle. I am saying: not only I want my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> voice to be heard, but I do not want that Ed (for example) is allowed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (legally or technically) to give to Thomas the right to vote for him
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> more than one time. If Ed wants someone else to vote for him he should
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repeat his desire each time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I know this sounds unfair, what right do I have to discuss the way Ed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Thomas organise between them?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, you see, I do have to live in the society generated also by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas and Ed interaction. So their relation is effectively touching
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me. And if the result of their relation is that I will be governed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people only because some other people are too lazy to follow what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> going on, I oppose such organization.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And this is why I also cannot support a system that counts voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> independently on how they are gathered. As my understanding is that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Outcast does.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But I am willing to change my position once someone convinces me of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> vote for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; them each time.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I agree with Ed here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let's say that I am an actor with a vast support. I support a certain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very popular position (rape is illegal even between married couples in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> muslim countries). I in this way gather million of people supporting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> me supporting that position. As the position slightly changes (is sex
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by surprise rape?), people keep on supporting me, not to have to work
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in following that position. Eventually I gather a lot of people who
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are willing to support me on any issue (&quot;I like this guy, he sings
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> such a KOOL songs, and I totally DIG him when he was ..., and my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> supporting him I can also support the really cool social fight he is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> participating in&quot;). Then I (actor) receive an offer, someone offers me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a million dollar if I give my support for their proposal (and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> subsequent drafts). I secretly accept, I support them, and with me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come most of my supporters.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, this would happen;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> yes, often this would lead to an uproar from the public;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> no, the uproar would not happen all the time;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Is the time when it does not happen that worries me)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So a proxy voting is essentially a system where people by default will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> give their vote away, and then have to work each time to make sure it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was used wisely. Instead we need a system where by default the vote is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> nil. And people need to work (by voting) to make themselves be heard.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Pietro
