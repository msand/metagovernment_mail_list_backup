<PRE>First of all, thanks Thomas for clarifying that in Votorola delegation
is done only inside a single poll. That sounds better, although still
unsafe.

Regarding the rest...
the idea that rusting should change depending on the changes done seem
to me based on an unsolved (and maybe unsolvable) problem if you do it
from a semantic point of view. Seems to me unreasonable if done on a
non semantically base (hamiltonian distance).
But also the idea that the person that suggests a new idea should
declare how much does it differ from the original proposal seem to me
like a non-practical solution. People in Italy tend to pretend that
the little loophole they introduced in the law is &quot;nothing important&quot;,
while they add that money sent for alternative energies can now be
used for nuclear power. And that genetically modified food can be
labelled as organic. First you make a law have enough support to make
it pass, then you add the little comma you are really interested in.
You simply cannot trust the person making the change to tell you how
big the change was.
Asking other people to check for each change, and make sure it is well
done will work for big, popular topics, but not for the myriad of
unpopular ones. Like in Wikipedia popular pages are more precise than
paged edited by few pens.

All together it seem to me that a rusting that differentiate from
change to change does not work.

But on the base of all this, I have to admit I cannot find the moral,
ethical or pragmatic reason why we need to let people delegate their
power at all. In any shape manner or form.

There was a time when most of the people where ignorant. So they were
believed to just have the power to vote who among the educated should
guide them. It was impractical to have everybody voting, and
impossible for the people to know what they needed to make educated
decisions. Also those people had the bad habit of starting
revolutions.

Now everybody knows how to read and write. Although many people
believe that the sun rotates around the earth everybody is able to
look inside the internet to find the answers they need. The situation
is totally different.

Also forcing people to delegate their power is leading people not to
think, while people who are called to make decisions tend to take it
seriously, and educate themselves.

We also have some field testing of representative democratic system,
and in all of them (in some cases more, in some less) representation
leads to corruption. Leads to people trying to convince the bottleneck
of the decision process: giving money to the representatives.

You make a representative system you are practically bound to generate
corruption. People giving off their vote for money. People betraying
the trust of other people for more money. Are we trying to make a
democratic system or restarting the economy? ;-)

The idea of proxy voting was a nice intuition. But not all intuitions
are bound to be true (in science) or acceptable (in design) once you
think them through in the details. This is the case in every form of
research and e-Democracy is no different.

What is the problem we are trying to solve with proxy voting? (real
question, not a rhetoric one)
Maybe there are different ways to solve it.

For me I would support a system where people need to vote directly. No
one can give to anyone else their power. It is not possible to give to
anyone the URL to someone else to vote for it. The system avoids older
proposal from having any advantage over new ones. People can describe
a general idea (vote for a proposal where it is said...), but then
people need to actually understand the proposals to make sure they are
voting for the right thing.

A side effect of this might be that laws become suddenly simpler to
understand. Call it a feature.

The result of this is that not everybody can vote? This is not a
problem as long as anyone who wants to vote can vote, and anyone can
educate himself to understand what he is voting. I also would support
a system where proposals are automatically clustered, and people can
support all the proposals in a cluster. Also although not everybody
can vote, nearly everybody will probably vote for the issues they
really care about.

Also right now we are lead to believe that politicians are so
knowledgeable. Many forms of candid camera were taken in Italy showing
how italian politicians are generally quite ignorant. Pretty much like
the average Joe. And when a non political person, who passed his life
in studying a topic, a technician, is placed in a place of power
everybody protests.
