<PRE>Dear Ed,

&gt;<i> Pietro, if I understand correctly, Votorola does require renewal. It also requires fresh proposals for each issue.
</I>
Thanks, this is good to know. Could Michael or Thomas confirm it?
Because what I saw in respect to the metagovernment rules question was
that Thomas could move his 5 votes as he liked.
The 5 people did not have to give him the vote again.

&gt;<i> So the only way an actor can become a &quot;politician&quot; is if they draft a proposal on every issue, and if each of their supporters decides to vote for them each time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Granted, that is still possible. In my part of the world, any time Oprah Winfrey makes a proposal, she would get overwhelming support. But that is inevitable anyway isn't it?
</I>
Nop, I have given several suggestions before.

&gt;<i>Even in an anonymous system, if Oprah endorses a particular issue, people would vote for it in droves. That's just human nature and we can't program it out. We can only make something as fair as possible in the face of it.
</I>
Please see the answer I wrote on the other email for a counter example.
