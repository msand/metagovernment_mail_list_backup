&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>

Wouldn't this form clusters of friends, and parties? Freezing the
whole system again (I see the current system as frozen, since each
party in general would not even evaluate proposals from other parties)


&gt;&gt;<i> I am sorry, I still don't get it. There are some proposals, people can

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this not correct. What are those clusters you speak of?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Vilfredo...
</I>
First a clarification. The presentation I did where I speak about the
Mass Online Deliberation system is NOT Vilfredo, but another system we
were planning. We called it M.O.D.ENA and were planning a EU proposal
on that.

&gt;<i> clusters are formed according to some algorithm, which uses
</I>&gt;<i> certain data. In Votorola the users themselves decide which cluster (or call
</I>&gt;<i> it group or delegation tree) they want to belong to. (Just to mention:
</I>&gt;<i> delegation does not only allow for letting others decide for you, but also
</I>&gt;<i> for letting others work for you in the sense of: letting others implement
</I>&gt;<i> *your* decisions.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Interesting the passage from decision to implementation. I am thinking
about how to implement that on Vilfredo too.


&gt;<i> I was presenting three tools:
</I>&gt;<i> (1) a tool to aggregate proposals in clusters
</I>&gt;<i> (2) a tool to let some people in a cluster clarify it
</I>&gt;<i> (3) a tool to integrate different clusters.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now it is possible that the number of clusters grow slower than the
</I>&gt;<i> number of proposals, with the effect that the second tool does not
</I>&gt;<i> scale up. This might be balanced by making smaller clusters, for
</I>&gt;<i> example. Or having multiple groups work in parallel for each cluster.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was talking about (3), about integration. This is were the real
</I>&gt;<i> political/social/communicative effort lies IMO. To find consensus between
</I>&gt;<i> thousands or millions of participants. Consensus not just about the clearest
</I>&gt;<i> expression of a proposal as in (2), but about real content. (BTW, I doubt,
</I>&gt;<i> that you can seperate this in (2) and (3)). How can that many people talk to
</I>&gt;<i> each other in a constructive way? I feel, this is the question we need to
</I>&gt;<i> answer.
</I>
Well the size of the clusters should match the tool that they are
going to use to discuss.
Vilfredo works well with 10-12 people. Not more, unfortunately. I am
confident it is possible to make tools for more people.
Could we push Vilfredo to handle 20 or 50 people?
What is keeping Vilfredo down is the requirement that
(a) everybody need to read every proposal
(b) we take the pareto front which means that when you have too many
people the Pareto Front becomes the full set of proposal. But it could
be changed... I am thinking about it.

In any case each tool will have an optimal number of participants, a
minimum and a maximum. As people are split in clusters they should
also chose tools that can handle those type of clusters.

&gt;<i> The global poll is made on closed questions. As such it can scale up
</I>&gt;<i> quite well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How? How do people find consensus?
</I>
In closed questions people do not find a consensus. They accept to
chose the best options among the presented ones. WHat does &quot;best&quot; mean
changes as you change the voting system. But the usual way in which
people vote (with people only presenting one vote for their favorite
candidate) is among the worse ways to vote.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 20 people cannot talk to each other directly, but millions of
</I>&gt;<i> people vote in modern democracies for the same candidates.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the results you and I suffer from for years now.
</I>
Hmm, not really! First of all the proposals that would be presented
would be the emerging result of a collaborative process.
Second the voting system would be something like a Condorcet system,
and the result would more faithfully represent what the people
actually want.

Thomas, sorry to ask you so directly, but are you aware of how does
Condorcet Voting works? Or Borda?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The fact is that setting up those fractal system is an old solution.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It has been used pretty much in any political system in the world. But
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> even when they tried to avoid them to become a source of centralized
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> power (like in communist Russia) it did not work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A group of people discussing works fine. A group of group of people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often leads to bad decisions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What has never been tried so far (because of a lack of technical
</I>&gt;<i> possibilies) to do this in complete openness and transparency and allow
</I>&gt;<i> everybody to withdraw his support for his delegate with just one click of
</I>&gt;<i> the mouse-button. The power those people have, only lasts as long as you
</I>&gt;<i> don't press this one button. Very different from Russia, East-Germany, ...
</I>&gt;<i> and even democracies today, where you can not withdraw your vote for 4 years
</I>&gt;<i> ... (and have only very very few candidates to choose from).
</I>
I agree that this has never been tried. But I also think that the
number of systems that can be tested is limited. So we make
thought-experiments where we run a scenario in our head. We run the
risk of being wrong, but it is inevitable when you compare the number
of decisions systems you can think of with the number of decision
systems you can actually test.

As I explained in the other email I am afraid such system would
provide power to the people who can convince the lazy. The people who
once they put their support would not withdraw it unless terrible
things happen.


Cheers,
Pietro
