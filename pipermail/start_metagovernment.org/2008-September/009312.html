When you come to open relationship let me know :)

In fact I remember a livejournal back in 2003 probably (ages ago in
www terms) from someone who claimed to have an 'open life' or 'open
lifestyle', and he would openly discuss his life on his journal, with
very few tabu, and then would accept suggestion from a sometimes
anonymous crowd. Same revolution, different medium.

Now it seem to me that we all pretty much agree by now that the term
open has come to mean something else, and we might want to consider
keep on using it regardless of what Richard desires.

But now I want to bring your attention to something else.
To the meta level, in fact.

Because whatever we desire, Richard will still be against it. He has
probably invested too much to be willing to exchange being the father
of the word 'open' in a strictly legal setting to being the first
person who used a meme. I can understand how this position is weak in
various ways. SO now let us suppose that metascore was in place, and
we were asked through a resolution what to do.

The original idea of metascore is that also people fromoutside the
community can vote (maybe with a lower karma, but still vote). Beside
our community is 'open' (as in open door, not open software), so
Richard could in any moment join the discussion group, and say that he
is part of this community, full member. And he would be welcome by
each one of us!

But now think about the discussion, deliberation, voting and consensus
making on this issue. I mean, I have little doubt that whatever
reasoning are brought for the use of the term open, he will use his
full weight against using the term open.

We are not reaching consensus over here!

Now what?

Pietro
