It isn't as clean as it might be, but it's not a showstopper if there
is a requirement for users to upload files.


&gt;<i> 2. App Engine's greatest features (load-balancing and

</I>
It is also free until you get (according to 'typical' estimates)
around 5million hits/month, so that's one less thing to worry about -
in addition to the ability to scale - which, as you mention, is less
of a concern when using GAE anyway.


&gt;<i> I really think App Engine appeals to people in the same way that people

</I>&gt;<i> what's available with the most basic of web hosting.
</I>
Agreed. I don't think that's a bad thing though. It allows for really
quick development and exploration of ideas. Countless times I've
configured and tweaked a LAMP environment just to test something out
quickly and spent more time in pointless drudgery than fun hackery -
no more!


&gt;<i> We have some mountains
</I>&gt;<i> to climb with Metagovernment, but scaling issues of our web application is
</I>&gt;<i> not one of them.  And it may never be one of them.
</I>
Metagovernment is not a project of small ideas - if I didn't think
scaling was going to be an issue in the future then I would be
investing time into a project which I thought would.


&gt;<i> Why sacrifice essential privacies and freedoms for a benefit we don't know we need?
</I>
Which privacies or freedoms are being potentially sacrificed?

I'm not advocating that GAE be used as a Metascore implementation
platform - it fails the &quot;single point of failure&quot; and &quot;distributed&quot;
tests. Both those arguments would fall the moment the source to GAE
was opened though (assuming no atypical hardware requirements), or if
a GAE compatible backend was developed - perhaps from the fully
functioning SDK version.

&gt;<i>From what I've seen though, it'd be harder to retrofit an existing
</I>application onto GAE.. so for the prototypes in development it doesn't
seem relevant.
