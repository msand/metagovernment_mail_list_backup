Can't we have both? That is to say, can't the back-end work as you  
say, but the front end be more simplistic for the user? I can imagine  
there being several prefixes appended to each tag. For example, one  
for the associated resolution, one for the community, and one for the  
user. None have to be evident to the end-user, and some prefixes may  
even be parsed out or ignored in the back-end.

Apple invented the iPod, but they never conceived of Podcasting...  
that was an invention of the community of users. I like your idea of  
making the software flexible and seeing what people do with it. Once  
people started podcasting, then Apple started adding in features  
specific to that function.

&gt;<i> The most important thing is the scoring. Messages with higher scores

</I>&gt;<i> like tags, will help against link spamming (you see why I want them to
</I>&gt;<i> be the same under the hood, so we don't have two implementations of
</I>&gt;<i> the weighting mechanism.)
</I>
One potential problem I can imagine is that people might go tag-crazy,  
trying to apply tons of tags to something to make it more visible. As  
a suggestion, how about giving them a set number of points they can  
apply to their tags? That is, say they have 20 tagging points. They  
can give a resolution 10 points for one tag that is really important,  
five points for another significant tag, and one point each to five  
more tags that somewhat apply...
