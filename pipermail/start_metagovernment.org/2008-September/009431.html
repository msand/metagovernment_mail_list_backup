i don't see how ##1-4 are more &quot;scientific&quot; than #5. if community members are 
prepared to agree on something, they just do that. this achievement can be a 
foundation for a more general agreement, and so on. it's easy to analyze the 
entire progress after we have reached the last agreement, but in the 
beginning of our undertaking we don't know the future outcome in most cases.

&gt;<i> This thread, in particular, is about getting closer to &quot;truth&quot; ...
</I>
or to agreement between us, or to consensus of our views ... you name it :-)

&gt;<i> Consensus is a de-facto goal, otherwise it's a soap-box, not a form of
</I>&gt;<i> governance ...
</I>
i think consensus is not a goal, but an indicator that originally opposing 
views have transformed into a consistent one.

&gt;<i> &quot;Objectiveness&quot; may well be abstract, but it is far from useless ...
</I>
i didn't say objectiveness is useless. i said it's as useless [or useful, if 
you wish] as truthiness.

&gt;<i> A &quot;concert of subjective opinions&quot; can objectively measure a form of
</I>&gt;<i> consensus, but not objectivity itself ...
</I>
if not this, then what can measure &quot;objectivity&quot;?

&gt;<i> Every &quot;truth&quot; was first considered subjective, before it was deemed
</I>&gt;<i> objective through consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Richard
</I>
and my version of the above: every opinion/theory/sensation was first 
considered subjective, before it was deemed objective through consensus.

it seems to me that your last statement contradicts the previous one, don't 
you think?

Best regards,
