I have a great deal of respect for Stallman and for what he has  
accomplished, so I keep wanting to follow his advice and to advocate  
for his cause... but I have to agree with you here.

In fact, when I thought about my own experience, I had the opposite  
view of what he is trying to accomplish. Again, I &quot;grew up&quot; in I.T.,  
where software is a tool made by others, to be manipulated to  
utilitarian purposes.

When, in the world of I.T., I first encountered open source software,  
I quickly realized that there was a deep philosophy behind it. That it  
wasn't just about giving away code for no money, but that the openness  
of the source was an inherent, critical component of it. To me, it  
said &quot;freedom&quot; in several different ways.

When I first encountered the word &quot;free software&quot; and heard someone  
say that there was a dispute between the free software movement and  
the OSS movement, I figured that &quot;free software&quot; referred to freeware,  
devoid of the philosophical ramifications inherent in OSS. In other  
words... I had *exactly the opposite* reaction than what Stallman  
wants from the word.

I could understand &quot;freedom software&quot; or &quot;liberating software,&quot; but  
&quot;free software&quot; to almost everyone is going to mean freeware.

&quot;Open source&quot; has a somewhat limited connotation in that it is about  
the source code, so some people may think it is just about ensuring  
that the code is what it says it is. But The word &quot;open&quot; by itself has  
a very clear, liberating meaning in almost every context in which it  
is used. I don't see how Stallman is going to win this one.

I invited him to join our list, and he has not. So I think pretty much  
everyone who has responded in this thread disagrees with him, and he  
is not actively making his case. So, as much as I wish to pay respect  
to what he has accomplished... I also propose we use the term &quot;open  
governance.&quot;
