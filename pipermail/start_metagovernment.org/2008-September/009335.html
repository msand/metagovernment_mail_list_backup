<PRE>When I read the first post, I immediately thought 'tags?', too. What
about using check boxes to instead select multiple posts that you are
replying to, or joining together. Your reply would then inherit the
tags used for those posts, and presumably you could add or remove some
tags at will.

Perhaps a checkbox would be too old school, instead each message
(which contains a tag not already in your tag list) could have an &quot;Add
Tags&quot;/&quot;Undo&quot; toggle button, and an &quot;Add Tags and Reply&quot; button to
initiate the response.

&quot;Undo&quot; rather than &quot;Remove Tags&quot; as if the tag list for the post is
&quot;web2.0 javascript ajax sausages&quot; and you already had the first three
in the tag list you were building, but changed your mind about the
last tag, you don't want to remove all the tags.

Or perhaps even simpler to just display tags attached to a post, which
toggle between bold and regular font when you click upon them - adding
or removing the tags from the list of tags you are interested in for
that particular subject. Then hitting a global 'filter' or 'reply'
button would have a more obvious action.
