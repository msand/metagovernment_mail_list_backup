I thought we were only talking about a development environment. I  
certainly wouldn't want to say that to participate in Metascore, you  
have to register with Google. I hope nobody is seriously considering  
that.

FWIW, I already made an entry, figuring that everyone would pump one  
in and that the number of applications would work to our benefit. Now  
that I've had a cup of coffee, I like Manuel's idea much better...  
working on a collective entry makes more sense. (I don't seem to be  
able to withdraw my entry, but presumably Manuel's will be better  
through the wisdom of crowds. :)
