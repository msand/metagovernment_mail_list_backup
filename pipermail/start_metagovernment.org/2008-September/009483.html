Hmm, I of course was not suggesting that we did not go there but I was
more thinking to avoid requiring unnecessary publicity for now. I
think you know what I mean, Ed. One thing is to respond to things
coming to us, another is to go and look for them. Like writing in
slashdot comments with the intent of stirrinf interest, or contacting
politicians, and so on. Of course we should not overlook a good
opportunity if it comes up (I mean if you happen to sit in the bus in
front of x, y, z (relevant personalities), and you happen to chat with
them, it would be moronic not to mention the project. But going and
emailing people right now seems preposterous.

And I agree that we should be open, but there is a balance between
openness, and focus. We now need focus until we get some ground. Then
we can expand.
