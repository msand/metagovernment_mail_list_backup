<PRE>The analogy is most appropriate to Capitalist Nations as we consider Money
to be the source from which all things flow.

In addition to the analogy, I believe the Internet Banking Challenge
provides us with a framework on which to build an Open Government:

1. A Civic Account which provides users with the ability to log on and
manage their personal account information.
2. A Dashboard that displays their tax balance (how much they've given, how
much they owe, how much their due).
3. A General Overview of the civic services, their costs, organization
(employees and managers), etc.
4. Profiles of the civil servants with descriptions of their
responsibilities along with their contact information.

All of these are things we've come to expect of Internet Banking, and should
consider to a right as a citizen.

In the grand scheme of things, I feel that we might be focusing on the
future without evaluating how our product fits into the current system. In
other words, while voting is an absolute pillar of an Open Government, how
am I going to vote when I can't even access the system? Furthermore, if we
expect the people to use our software, shouldn't it reflect the functions of
their Government, and not just the Legislative Branch?
