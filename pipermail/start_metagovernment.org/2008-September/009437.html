Precisely - I'm arguing three points here:
1) The system should not inherently favour either subjective or objective input.
2) But, by asking users to judge their own input as subjective or
objective (without fear of discrimination) we encourage that
separation in the minds of the users over time.
3) Most people, when pressed, prefer to live by rule which is more
objective than subjective - e.g. church-goers who support separation
of church and state.
4) That separation exercise is a necessary tool in combating the
get-nothing-done effects of applied partisanship.


&gt;&gt;<i> This thread, in particular, is about getting closer to &quot;truth&quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or to agreement between us, or to consensus of our views ... you name it :-)
</I>
Truth implies a process - scientific, asking your God or asking your
gut. Agreement and consensus are tautological by definition, and can
only take on an implied process if it is embedded within a modified
definition, accepted in turn by agreement or consensus.

Furthermore, not every process has a statistical probability greater
than 0.5 of getting any closer to &quot;truth&quot;.


&gt;&gt;<i> Consensus is a de-facto goal, otherwise it's a soap-box, not a form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governance ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i think consensus is not a goal, but an indicator that originally opposing
</I>&gt;<i> views have transformed into a consistent one.
</I>
Isn't &quot;an indicator that originally opposing views have transformed
into a consistent one&quot;, a goal of Metagovernment?


&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;Objectiveness&quot; may well be abstract, but it is far from useless ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i didn't say objectiveness is useless. i said it's as useless [or useful, if
</I>&gt;<i> you wish] as truthiness.
</I>
Okay - I'd still argue that the abstract concepts of objectiveness and
truth can be more useful than not, when properly applied.

I'd also argue that &quot;subjectivity&quot; is also an abstract concept which
does not exist in absolute, because it neatly nullifies any argument
against striving towards truth.


&gt;&gt;<i> A &quot;concert of subjective opinions&quot; can objectively measure a form of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> consensus, but not objectivity itself ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if not this, then what can measure &quot;objectivity&quot;?
</I>
Objectively speaking, nothing can measure objectivity. For me, what
makes something more objective than subjective is the quality of the
process applied. And yes - the evaluation of 'quality' is recursive.


&gt;&gt;<i> Every &quot;truth&quot; was first considered subjective, before it was deemed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> objective through consensus.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Richard
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and my version of the above: every opinion/theory/sensation was first
</I>&gt;<i> considered subjective, before it was deemed objective through consensus.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it seems to me that your last statement contradicts the previous one, don't
</I>&gt;<i> you think?
</I>
Well first up, I'm not afraid of contradicting myself. No, really.
Anyone who pretends they have _any_ of the answers here is either
lying or deluded. I have some ideas, with a faint smattering of logic.
But I don't think there is a contradiction here - the best we can do
is to say &quot;this is what I think given the available evidence, and
here's how I worked it out&quot; - that doesn't make something true, but it
makes it more likely to be true than false the longer it survives
active usage and examination without plausible contradiction.
