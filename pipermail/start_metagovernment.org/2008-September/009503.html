Textual content is the source code to ideas and philosophy. So it
doesn't make too much sense to me to require attribution or integrity.
None of the ideas in this email are particularly unique - if I were to
hunt them down and list their original sources then it'd probably take
more space than the content itself. Anything which slows down the
transmission and evolution of ideas is a net negative - but I'd really
like to hear more voices on this if possible.


&gt;<i> 2) Source Code of the Application(s) - should use an open source license,
</I>&gt;<i> but which one?
</I>
AFAIK the GPL hasn't been court-tested yet - cases have been brought
against companies in violation, which have resulted in out-of-court
settlements instead. However, I do think it's the safest bet if you
don't want a 3rd party to develop a closed codebase based upon your
work. My impression is that the legal solidity of CC is less defined.


&gt;<i> 3) Content Created by Users of the Application(s) - I think that this
</I>&gt;<i> content should be freely shared and used by others, with attribution
</I>&gt;<i> desirable.
</I>
Agreed - assuming the ability to import/export exists, then including
attribution as metadata comes at no cost, and serves a useful function
with relation to historical trails.
