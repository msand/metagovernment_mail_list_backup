I agree with Scott regarding this, and believe that there are many more
similarities than differences between Metagovernment and DemocracyLab.  The
objectives of the two projects are very similar.  The biggest differences
are concerning tactics for synthesizing content and identifying consensus.  
 
As I understand it, Metascore asks users to vote on Resolutions, rating
their merit on a scale.  Users are also able to engage in Synthesis scoring,
identifying Resolutions that can be woven together.  These ratings result in
a Consensus Score, which factor in Resolution Ratings and Synthesis Ratings
to produce a comprehensive rating that can be used to inform the community's
decision making.  (I'm sure there's a great deal I'm missing or misstating.
I'd welcome any correction to what I've said.  I'm also unclear as to how
it's envisioned that the Consensus Rating translates into action by the
community.)
 
DemocracyLab attempts to accomplish the objectives using different means.
The similarities are tools to allow rating of content and mechanisms to
synthesize content and achieve consensus.  
 
One difference is DemocracyLab segments content ratings into two pieces -
Agreement and Importance.  
 
Another is that the synthesis mechanism in DemocracyLab is a Link Rating.
Two Concepts can link to each other, and users rate the Link, deciding if
they support/oppose each other, their degree of Relevance, or if they are
Redundant.
 
A final, significant difference is that DemocracyLab supports more distinct
types of content.  MetaScore's Resolutions translate to Policies on
DemocracyLab - specific plans of action to achieve a desired outcome.
DemocracyLab also supports statements of Positions and Values, believing
Values lead to Positions which lead to Policies.  Our purpose in creating
this data structure is to recognize different levels of thinking on issues,
and to make it easier to identify points of consensus (e.g., it would be
much easier to build consensus around the Value of Equality than around a
Policy specifying a system of universal health care.)  Our hope is to create
a map of political thought, identifying where consensus and disagreement
exists, and to productively focus discussion at critical points of
disagreement.  For a more detailed description of our planned
implementation, click here

What does all this mean?  I think it could be wise to consider opportunities
for collaboration.  It seems serendipitous that our discussion of the Google
Moderator led to discussion of the Google App Engine which led to Google's
Project 10^100.  Perhaps we should consider a joint submission to Google's
Project 10^100?  It seems that the much of the code for our two projects
will be very similar, and that the two branches might be able to benefit
from ideas of the other.
