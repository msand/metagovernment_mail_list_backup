</I>in my view, &quot;objectiveness&quot; is as abstract and useless as &quot;truthiness&quot;. but 
concert of &quot;subjective&quot; opinions can be used as measure of &quot;objectiveness&quot;. 
and this is again about &quot;consensus&quot;.

search after &quot;truth&quot; is endless. at the same time we all see many cases where 
people manage to achieve consensus and some cases where they fail to do so. 
and i hope this project will make people more effective in reaching 
agreements.

Best regards,
