I'm starting to get a real appreciation for Richard Stallman... the  
&quot;anyone with a Google account&quot; is about as far from &quot;free software&quot; as  
can be imagined.

Absolutely. It's becoming painfully obvious that the old school isn't  
necessary anymore, and the new technologies open up so much more than  
can be achieved by smoke-filled rooms. As people start to explore Web  
2.0 technologies, they have to start wondering why government should  
remain stuck in the 1700s.

My fear is just what I said above... that the winner in this race will  
be some monolithic corporation. What if MySpace became the new form of  
governance? Maybe you'd get to buy upgraded rights, or have your  
township be &quot;sponsored&quot; by the highest bidder. It really sounds like a  
very-possible dystopia.

Our approach is a bit of a long shot, but I honestly think it's the  
best thing going. The competitors have, collectively, hundreds of  
billions of dollars compared to our zero. But we have the promise of  
actual, genuine freedom: something they can never offer. Maybe we have  
a shot.
