<PRE>Thank you Ed.  I think this is a fabulous start on a presentation outline.
There's an intern from Portland State University's Department of Conflict
Resolution who's going to help me research and prepare the presentation.
We'll use this as our jumping off point.  The sponsoring professor from PSU
is going to be in Cyprus for the next couple of weeks.  I don't suppose any
members of this group live there?
 
Also, I thought everyone would be interested in seeing this invitation I
received as a result of attending the Open Source Convention here in
Portland this July.  I sent them an email concerning DemocracyLab.  You may
wish to do likewise.

On a tangentially related note, I've been asked to give a presentation next
month on 21st Century Civic Engagement for a conference here in Oregon.  I'd
welcome any input others have or resources they can point to, and will
happily share the presentation with the group once it's complete.
 
Great! I am pressed for time at the moment, so can't work on it at the
moment, but here is the general outline I was thinking of (if anyone wants
to get started):
 
The nature of Web 2.0
 - openness and collaboration bring strength
 - success has been surprising to many
 - is still nascent; wikipedia is not the ultimate in Web 2.0
 
Problems with Democracy
 - Direct democracy only works for tiny groups
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Direct_democracy">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Direct_democracy</A>
 - Representative democracy has numerous flaws
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy</A>
 
How Web 2.0 can improve governance and Democracy
 - Collaboration instead of conflict
 - Encourages and welcomes citizen participation
 - Eliminates corruption; provides transparency
 - (others...)
 - Not just for political governments, but for any governance structure
 
How Web 2.0 is being applied to Governance
 - Early, pre-Web 2.0 examples (Debian, etc.)
 - &quot;Mixdemocracy&quot; approaches starting up around the world
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>
 - Wikimedia Meta and other nascent governance structures
 
Metagovernment project
 - Completely global, completely open
 - Targeted at all forms of governance
 - Provides sole governance mechanism for any community
 - We know how much we don't know
 - So we are making Metascore open and flexible, to see what people do with
it
 - Please help!
