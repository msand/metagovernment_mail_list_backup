<PRE>Great discussion!  As an FYI, at DemocracyLab &lt;<A HREF="http://www.democracylab.org/">http://www.democracylab.org/</A>&gt;
, we've taken a different approach to this issue.  We've divided comments
into two categories, Evidence and Opinion.  Each could link to one or more
Concepts (Values, Positions, Policies in our model, or to other instances of
Evidence or Opinion).  Users can rate the link between a piece of
Evidence/Opinion and a Concept on two scales - Support/Opposition and
Relevance.  The ratings determine the positioning of the Evidence/Opinion in
the User Interface.  
 
This is quite a bit different than the tagging concept.  I'll be interested
to see what you come up with pursuing the path you're on.  It doesn't seem
like the two are necessarily mutually exclusive.
 
Best of luck-
Mark Frischmuth

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> graph like structure, so then it should be possible to see the

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> responded to it on the right (tree style), and the ones that came
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> before on the left (tree style), and maybe some lines from the left to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the right for any comment on the right which also answered any other
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comment on the left.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is pretty much what I had in mind with reference tags. Any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message can reference another, and the system can build a graph
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structure.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot; . each message has its own tag, with the prefix &quot;message-&quot; followed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by its id. This is the method by which messages are marked as replies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to another. &quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Taken from &quot;tags.py&quot;. Though it's not completely obvious from the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> message, I did want to keep it open to that sort of debate structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and not be limited to traditional threads.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure the interface you suggested is the best approach though.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also a connection should also be possible to established after it has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been posted, not just by the author.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>hmm! Very interesting!
</I>&gt;<i>Yes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Some thoughts follow.
</I>&gt;<i>More like an avalanche of thoughts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I am not sure if tags are the correct way to do this.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>I mean, tags have a weight, and we want to use this weight for various
</I>reasons.
&gt;<i>Also it is probably not that easy to write down the link to the
</I>&gt;<i>message as a tag,
</I>&gt;<i>there will be numbers involved, and codes:
</I>&gt;<i>message:1234 message:7829 message:3745
</I>&gt;<i>And it would make it harder to find the actual tags.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Like:
</I>&gt;<i>medicine economy opensource
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>is easier to read than:
</I>&gt;<i>medicine mess:1234 mess:7829 economy mess:3745 opensource
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>So maybe a parallel system would be better. Or at least a way to
</I>&gt;<i>filter out the reference tags from the way we visualize the tags of a
</I>&gt;<i>comment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Also, tagging resolutions is ok, this because, resolutions are not
</I>&gt;<i>everyday events, so people will go an extra mile to link them.
</I>&gt;<i>Tagging comments does not seem to work. When it was tried in TagSurf
</I>&gt;<i>it did not work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>WHy? Because once a person have read a comment there is generally
</I>&gt;<i>little need for them to remember it. SO they don't link to it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>And if people do not consistently use the tags the whole thing become
</I>&gt;<i>unreliable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe in this case a parallel narrow folksonomy, where anyone can add
</I>&gt;<i>a link might be what we really need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Another issue is that if people use those mess:tags to link different
</I>&gt;<i>comments and resolutions, would this not take away power from the
</I>&gt;<i>tags.
</I>&gt;<i>I mean, tags work because people need them to find the
</I>&gt;<i>comments/resolutions. The more you can find them without tags, the
</I>&gt;<i>less people will sue tags, the more tags will be a weak way to find
</I>&gt;<i>the actual similarity between resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>So I would say:
</I>&gt;<i>a broad folksonomy for resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>A way to add links narrow folksonomy like style, for comments.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Onlt the author of a resolution can add a link to a resolution, and
</I>&gt;<i>say this is a sinthesis of this and that (then people vote).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>And more and more details.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>It seem to me that resolutions and comments are two different systems.
</I>&gt;<i>And they should be deal separately. What is good for one, might not be
</I>&gt;<i>good for the other.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Maybe preparing one of those systems first, and the the other might be
</I>&gt;<i>the correct way, in all case we need to be able to differentiate
</I>&gt;<i>between them, so that if in future we need the two systems to work
</I>&gt;<i>differently it can be done.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>Another idea, every time you add a comment you put your karma at
</I>&gt;<i>stake. And similarly depending on how many people link to that
</I>&gt;<i>comment, ignore and proceed on a different thread, your karma can go
</I>&gt;<i>up and down. So it is a bit of a bet, every comment. If you add your
</I>&gt;<i>comment to too many threads, your karma can go down, but if you
</I>&gt;<i>effectively connect different threads, and from that moment they are
</I>&gt;<i>one, your karma should go impressively up. After all you are making a
</I>&gt;<i>great work for the community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>We need to have a system that acknowledges all this.
</I>&gt;<i>Similarly people who add links, and those are not ok, should have
</I>&gt;<i>their karma go down, but if they are ok, their karma should go up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>So to summarise yet again we have:
</I>&gt;<i>* broad folksonomy for resolution.
</I>&gt;<i>* adding links for comments (as tags, hmm, not convinced)
</I>&gt;<i>* the karma should go up and down depending on how people behave
</I>&gt;<i>respect to that link. If people fee the need to branch off, then the
</I>&gt;<i>link might not have been a good idea, if instead people follow up,
</I>&gt;<i>then you have effectively connected two threads. Kudos to you!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>And I still like the idea of the tick boxes. Maybe as a first
</I>&gt;<i>approximation of what comments are you answering to.
