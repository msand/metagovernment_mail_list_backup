<PRE>I was recently contacted by the organizer of a Czech web conference,  
asking if I would be available to give a speech in Prague (Oct 18-19)  
on the potential for the web to revolutionize democracy.

I have to say, this is sort of a dream gig for me... I would love to  
travel and speak on behalf of this project and its objectives.  
Unfortunately, despite being sponsored by Microsoft and Adobe, this  
conference can't realistically afford to cover the steep airfare from  
Washington to Prague (I was a last-minute consideration, beyond what  
was already budgeted). They are looking into securing the funding for  
that, but aren't very optimistic.

So I said I would put it to the group to see if anyone else would be  
able and willing to give such a speech (in English). There is no  
guarantee they would accept said person, but if you might be  
interested, please reply.

Manuel seems to be the geographically closest person, but I am unsure  
if he would be able to skip out on classes to travel to Prague, nor if  
he is comfortable with public speaking.

In any event, the conference information is here:
<A HREF="http://www.webexpo.cz/">http://www.webexpo.cz/</A>
(note the US and German flags in the upper-left, which provide decent  
Google translations).

If you might be interested, let me/the list know and I'll put you in  
touch with the organizer.
