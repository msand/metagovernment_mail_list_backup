I don't see it this way. The copyright on the wiki is closed to  
modification by anyone but admins, but several members of this list  
are admins. (The only reason for the closure is to protect it from  
someone joining and then changing it to a hostile copyright.)

If you'd like to be an admin of any function, just ask the list, and  
if nobody objects, you're in. As far as I am concerned, the list is  
owner of this project, and a Metascore body will be when it exists.

My objective in this project is for it to be able to completely  
survive even if I die and the domain or server gets shut down. For the  
latter, at the moment, we only have only defined #metascore on  
irc.freenode.net as a fallback, but I think we could use gmane/usenet  
now as well.

I had been looking into it, but mostly got talked out of it. My/our  
reasons both for and against are detailed here:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Organization</A>
Feel free to edit! :)
Basically, the reasons against are that a non-profit corporation is an  
old-school governance mechanism and we are a new-school one. Why  
constrain ourselves by one? Also, any non-profit has to register  
within one nation, and we are entirely global and want no specific  
geographic presence. Also, I really don't like the idea of asking  
permission to exist from a national government. It diminishes our  
(hopeful) destiny as a proto-governmental institution.
