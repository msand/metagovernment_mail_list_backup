<PRE>I'm starting to get the feeling that Ed has subjected all of us to one big
social experiment in order to see how online communities are formed. One
interesting caveat is that our particular online community exists in order
to determine how to best govern a community online. So...

What have we learned from Ed's Social Experiment thus far?

A. Mailing lists produce a good amount of conversation that is difficult to
sort through without third party tools that are only usable by developers
and other technically minded individuals.

B. Wikis are an effective way to generate information and distribute it to
the community at the high cost of alienating those who do not wish to simply
generate information.

C. Everything else that went over my head which I'm assuming would require a
good amount of technical know-how just to access -- not exactly a good place
to start with organizing a community that included non-developers.

D. All of the above.

Judging by all of the above, I believe that we should find a solution that
affords us the following:

1. The ability to generate and distribute content to the Open Source
Government community.

2. A socially interactive experience that allows members to identify
themselves and connect with each other.

3. A pre-existing solution that comes with an international following of
developers and non-developers alike.

If we take these three points into consideration, I think that a number of
options emerge, from Drupal to CivicSpaceLabs.org -- which is certainly
worth looking into -- or we could hop on board with the other Open Source
teams I mentioned and focus on the MetaScore aspects of these other
solutions.

If nothing else I would highly recommend that we change course from going at
it alone and pool the amazing talents together to make Online Government a
reality as soon as humanly possible!!! SOME of us are living in the midst of
the Second Great Depression, thank you very much. ;)
