I very much agree, and if I ended up going to the conference I was  
going to propose doing something like this. If any of us speak, we can  
use the presentation as a guideline, but with the understanding that  
the individual speaker has free reign to modify it to suit their needs/ 
personality. After all, it is their individual persona on the line  
when giving a speech.

That's wonderful, Manuel (and I am so jealous!). I will send a message  
to both you and the conference organizer and see what the two of you  
can decide on.

We'll be there in spirit if not in person. And if the above works out,  
at least you'll have our support in the form of help with the speech.

And just to be clear, if they can find the money to fly me over, I'm  
still very interested in giving such a speech.

Yes, they did mention that they should be able to cover the train from  
Darmstadt to Prague. They were just having trouble with the  
substantial cost of airfare from the US to Europe. And their website  
does say in the light blue box (of the three boxes in a row, in the  
center) that &quot;P&#345;edn&#225;&#353;ky jsou honorov&#225;ny.&quot; Google is having trouble  
translating the last word, but I believe it means they pay an  
honorarium.
