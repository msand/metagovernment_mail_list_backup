<PRE>Thanks for pointing this out Chris.  So everyone knows, Google's App Engine
&lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/appengine/">http://code.google.com/appengine/</A>&gt;  is a distributed platform for open
source software development.  Basically your application on their servers.
It's free, and apparently is extremely easy to work with.  Currently, it
only supports applications written in Python.  Google also offers a Web
Toolkit &lt;<A HREF="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/</A>&gt;  with libraries you can use to
build your applications.  Far from a sinister force superimposing its
malicious will, Google is actively supporting open source development.
DemocracyLab has chosen to build its application on the App Engine.  It
provides superior infrastructure at zero cost.  
 
There's also been some discussion about how to best manage discussions and
which tools to use.  We've chosen Jive Software's Clearspace
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">http://www.jivesoftware.com/</A>&gt;  application (community version).  Our
instance &lt;<A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/index.jspa">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/index.jspa</A>&gt;  is running
version 2.1.  They just released 2.5, which looks to have some great new
features.  They make their software available for free to open source
projects.  It needs to run on an Apache Tomcat server.  Our instance is
hosted at Oregon State University's Open Source Lab &lt;<A HREF="http://osuosl.org/">http://osuosl.org/</A>&gt; .
There was quite a bit of work involved setting it up, but it might be much
easier to do a second time if this group was interested in going that
direction.  Alternatively, there's been some conversation about pooling
resources, which could be an idea worth exploring.
 
I'm in danger of being late for a meeting and must run.  Let's get to that
tipping point ASAP!

conferences, etc. It's hosted on the Google App Engine and can be used by
anyone with a Google account.&quot;

Does anyone else get the feeling that we're nearing the Tipping Point for
Open Government?
