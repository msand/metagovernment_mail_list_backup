<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively, there's been some conversation about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pooling resources, which could be an idea worth exploring.

</I>&gt;<i>Do you have any thoughts with regards what license pooled resources
</I>&gt;<i>should go under?
</I>
This is an area that I know we (DemocracyLab) need to address, but I haven't
fully wrapped my brain around it yet.  I've found the recent discussion on
copyrights to be very helpful.

It seems like there are several issues here:

1) Content Created During Development Process - things like these emails,
documentation of prototype ideas, etc.  It seems like these could be freely
used and built upon, though attribution would be nice.  It seems like one of
the CC licenses would accomplish this.

2) Source Code of the Application(s) - should use an open source license,
but which one?

3) Content Created by Users of the Application(s) - I think that this
content should be freely shared and used by others, with attribution
desirable.  An attorney here in Portland is working on Terms of Use and
Privacy Policies for us on a pro bono basis.  I'll share those once they're
developed.  I pointed him towards the CC licenses as a model for what we're
trying to accomplish.


On an unrelated note, I was invited recently to participate in the
Convergence08 conference (<A HREF="http://www.convergence08.org">http://www.convergence08.org</A>) November 15th and
16th in Mountain View, California.  I signed up as a speaker under the topic
&quot;Open Source Politics - Collaborative Online Public Policy Formation&quot;.  If
anyone from this list will be there, it'd be fun to meet and possibly
collaborate on a presentation.

Mark
