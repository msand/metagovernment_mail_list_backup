I think the problem Roustam is getting to is that there is no such  
thing as truth; at least in most modern philosophical systems. Even  
saying something as seemingly clear as &quot;there is a computer screen in  
front of you right now&quot; makes all kinds of assumptions about the  
universe (that you exist, that there is a you separate from other  
things, that it is reasonable to divide the universe into things like  
computer screens, that there is a right now, and so on). At best, we  
can say we are striving toward what most people would agree on as true.
