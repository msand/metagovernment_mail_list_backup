I just wish to support Ed in his position here.
I find myself totally agreeing in what he is saying, to the point that
I seriously wondered if the critic that was moved was serious.

I agree that we should define our own laws, and follow them. But if we
start to be binded by the law of this or that nation it will all
amount to nothing. Said that whatever decision a community using
metascore will take, will have to consider the local rules/laws. But
the idea of many members who are obliged by the law to vote, and to
vote in conformity with their leader seems an opprobrium. WHy vote
then? Let just the leader decide and economise the time of the other
people! Also I am puzzled by the phrase:
&gt;&gt;<i> You could make it a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirement that all board members sign a document agreeing that they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> will vote in accordance with the will of the majority.  Make it a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fail
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to vote with the metascore results.

What does 'You' here stand for? You Ed? Ed is not the leader of this
project. No one is. We all are involved, and each of us is filling
anecessary position. Manuel is programming, I am providing the maths
background and the links with the tags, Ed is inviting people, and
speaking for the group in public occasions, and so on (sorry guys I am
not listing everybody). But no one is the leader, and if we were to
select a leader we would first decide what its responsabilities would
be. AT the moment this is an adhocracy, and it is working quite fine.
