<PRE>Hello, I find this discussion really interesting.
I agree with everybody else that words do change meaning, but then if
we are going to use the word 'open' in any case we should clarify in
what sense.

Let me tell a small story that might give a flavour of what I want to
say. My academic focus is an area which is called artificial
chemistry. This historical was coming from artificial life, which
itself was coming from artificial intelligence. There is a nice quote
from Von Neumann that says that if something is to be intelligent it
must be alive (quote out of memory are never precise, forgive me). So
when Chris Langhton coined the term artificial life as the study of
life as it is possible, so not just as it evolved, he knew he was
moving away from the way  it has been used in artificial intelligence.
After all his use is more broad than just making something which is
alife. It encompasses the whole of biology... potentially. Now
artificial chemistry is even broader, this came from the understanding
that something that is alife cannot really evolve unless it is
grounded and rooted in a form of chemistry (read it, a reaction
system). And so we have artificial chemistry as the study of those
systems. Of which chemistry is obviously one.
So now we have moved from AI which is one kind of intelligence, to AC
which is more general than chemistry. Through Alife.

Great!

The reason why Langton chose to use the term 'artificial' even though
it was not precise was because he wanted to give a sense of continuity
with the previous work, and use a term that other people would
identify, and be able to roughly know what is going on. Roughly.

When the open source project came out, we saw it start in some
operating systems, then in software. But now it is a full blown
revolution. It has created the Creative Common copyright. There is
this wave. And when this wave touches a subject you expect the subject
to change, and in particular you expect users to be empowered with the
ability to change the tool itself. Wiki in a sense are part of this
revolution too.

The way in which this revolution touches each realm, is different. Not
just because the people who are doing it are different, but because
the realm itself is different. Music is different than text, which is
different than code. Which is different than computer code.

People have recognised this revolution, and have recognised that
metagovernment is part of it. If you go to the page in delicious where
people have tagged the website of metagovernment :
www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page

<A HREF="http://delicious.com/url/bc951ecc9c4693cec14573a37c8b9469">http://delicious.com/url/bc951ecc9c4693cec14573a37c8b9469</A>

you will notice that the word 'open' is the fourth tag, after
government, wiki and politics.
If you go to the historical page of metagovernment
the one that is now not accessible (or bookmark able) anymore because
the user is forwarded to the wiki homepage,
www.metagovernment.org

<A HREF="http://delicious.com/url/8e72cf6c276dae0d4148a2f3af693117">http://delicious.com/url/8e72cf6c276dae0d4148a2f3af693117</A>

And you look the tags used in that case you have:


    * government41
    * politics34
    * democracy24
    * opensource20
    * wiki19
    * society14
    * open11
    * collaboration9
    * technology5
    * culture5

Notice how at the time it was not a wiki, and still it was understood
that wiki were important, so at the fifth position the term was wiki.
And again open source is the fourth term.

Richard might not like this, and as a mathematician I can sympathise
with him. We like clear cut definitions. But here we are not speaking
inside math, we are describing something for human beings. And 20
human beings out of 64 has used he term 'opensource' to describe our
project.
I would say they don't intend this as Richard meant it, but as to say:
this also is part of the open source revolution. And I think they are
right, as artificial chemistries are too part of the AI revolution.

Who are we to go against this wisdom of the masses?

Also I would invite you to look at the other words that has been
suggested: We have:

    * SocioRealityPlatform
    * open          (!!!)
    * ENC4931  (???)

directdemocracy
web2.0
odd
legaladvice (??!)
edemocracy
design-politics
open_p2p
politics_2.0
p2p_governance


now many of those have been used only one time, but they can give us
ideas of what people are expecting from this project.
BTW, open has been used 11 times. ;-)

So I would say, let's keep on using the term open, and not give too
much importance to what Richard desires are.


BTW, I have some problems with self organising governance. Self
organising critical systems are systems that will tend to reach a
state of criticality, where a single element can be greatly disruptive
for the whole system. It is in a sense saying that the critical state
is in the attractor of the system. To have a self organising
governance system would mean that our system automatically will tend
toward a state of governing itself. Now we HOPE so, but we don't know
yet. This is more something we observe, more than something we
predict. In other words, if you want to f*ck up a legal word, feel
free, but please don't start messing around with terms in mathematics,
that that area IS sacred :-P



Cheers,
Pietro



(BTW, tomorrow I might have a hard time to connect, and then for a few
days I can only connect very slowly)
