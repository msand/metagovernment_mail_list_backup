I agree that imposing direct democracy on our current structures would  
have the failings you (and the Wikipedia article on the subject)  
delineate. However, since we are taking a ground-up approach, it  
breaks this model. If you read the first month's discussions of this  
list, you'll see how we evolved the idea from a rigid hierarchy into a  
mesh of communities.

The idea is that nobody has to participate in anything, but people are  
very likely to want to participate in the communities they care about  
most. With a broad definition of community, it becomes readily  
apparent that each individual participates in perhaps hundreds of  
different communities... maybe even thousands. Walking into a street  
market or a public park is an act of participation in the community of  
that market or park.

So with all the myriad communities in one's life, one has to make  
choices about which of them one cares about. The beauty of having an  
instance of Metascore governing each community is that the moment you  
decide that a community's governance needs tweaking, you can jump in  
and propose your changes. The more involved you get in a community,  
the more people there will respect you and the more they trust you to  
make changes: you can't just jump in and immediately change everything.

This flexible system allows anyone to participate in any community's  
governance, but controls for mob rule. There is no &quot;mob&quot; because there  
are so many communities that people get spread out between them. Since  
there is no huge overarching central government, there is no real  
demagoguery... that is, there's no opportunity for leaders to sway  
huge groups into following one course of action, since there aren't  
really huge groups.
