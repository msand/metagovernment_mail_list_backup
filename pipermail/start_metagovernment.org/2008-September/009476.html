<PRE>I hesitated before posting tonight lest I be labeled a &quot;difficult
person&quot; - but I do think we're seeing an absolute disconnect between
the inclusionary principles of Metagovernment and exclusionary
practice.

With all respect, which internet are you from? ;-)

Well call it an idea incubator then, make it newbie friendly,
crosspost the best ideas to the startup committee list for
consideration. If the traffic here is deemed too high and unhelpful
then start bouncing some of those threads down to the 'idea
incubator'. Something, because anything is better (in my opinion) than
running the risk of stagnation via alienation.

We (collectively because no-one interceded) threw someone out today.

This is fail incarnate.

He had passion, energy, was completely wrong-headed on some things..
but I thought he could be reasoned with. In other words - over time
his contribution would have been higher than the cost of accommodating
the debate.


&gt;<i> Plus I have seen Ed being concerned about the splitting of the
</I>&gt;<i> discussion through different medium.
</I>
I am concerned that the discussion be split into &quot;worthy&quot; and &quot;not
worthy&quot; categories, while actively discouraging those elements of
discussion which are deemed &quot;not worthy&quot;.


&gt;<i> But I liked his suggestion that new people should be invited to
</I>&gt;<i> summarise the old discussion on the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i> At least while we are in  a preprototype phase.
</I>
Agreed.
