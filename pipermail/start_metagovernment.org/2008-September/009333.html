<PRE>&gt;<i> graph like structure, so then it should be possible to see the
</I>&gt;<i> comments from the POV of a single comment, with all the comments that
</I>&gt;<i> responded to it on the right (tree style), and the ones that came
</I>&gt;<i> before on the left (tree style), and maybe some lines from the left to
</I>&gt;<i> the right for any comment on the right which also answered any other
</I>&gt;<i> comment on the left.

This is pretty much what I had in mind with reference tags. Any
message can reference another, and the system can build a graph
structure.

&quot; . each message has its own tag, with the prefix &quot;message-&quot; followed
by its id. This is the method by which messages are marked as replies
to another. &quot;

Taken from &quot;tags.py&quot;. Though it's not completely obvious from the
message, I did want to keep it open to that sort of debate structure
and not be limited to traditional threads.

I'm not sure the interface you suggested is the best approach though.
Also a connection should also be possible to established after it has
been posted, not just by the author.
