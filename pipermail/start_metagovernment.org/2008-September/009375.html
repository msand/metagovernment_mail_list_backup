<PRE>2008/9/11 Pietro Speroni di Fenizio &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">metagovernment at pietrosperoni.it</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I will be in Canada too, but com'on Manuel is just one train away.
</I>&gt;<i> I am sure we can send him there, provided he is willing to hitchhike
</I>&gt;<i> his way, and sleep under a blanket of stars ;-)

Prague is wonderful, I was there just last summer, I even have some
koruna left over I think. The train ride isn't that expensive 250 &#8364;
there and back and then some for a hotel. Though even that may be a
bit much on my student budget.
I'm only confident about speaking in front of a crowd, when I'm
comfortable and enthusiastic about the topic, so this might actually
work. But this would be my first presentation outside of an academic
circle, so I'll probably be nervous as hell. Well gotta start
somewhere I guess.
