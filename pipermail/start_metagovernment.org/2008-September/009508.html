<PRE>Google's App Engine is very similar to Django.  In fact, Django can be 
used with App Engine with only some conversion.  So, I believe it would 
be possible to design your application to use Django and deploy it on 
App Engine with a minimum of fuss.  This would allow us to use App 
Engine's load-balancing and scaling architecture with the possibility of 
pulling out and deploying a Django web-site at the cost of converting 
the data models.

However, I don't think App Engine is worth it for 2 reasons: 1. You 
can't upload files.  2. App Engine's greatest features (load-balancing 
and unlimited scaling) are problems we don't have yet.  Django hosting 
can be had for $10 a month on a no-contract basis, and for considerably 
less if you're willing to pay for a year in advance. 

I really think App Engine appeals to people in the same way that people 
dream of being a rock star.  Musicians worry about getting signed to a 
record label and then they figure they will make millions.  But in 
truth, most musicians will never make any money from their work.  But 
the dream drives them on.  Google says to people, &quot;when you hit it big, 
we'll be there to make sure your web site scales.&quot;  In truth,  most 
people's websites will never hit it big, most sites will not get 
slashdotted, and I'm willing to bet that 99% of all App Engine sites 
will never require any scaling beyond what's available with the most 
basic of web hosting.  We have some mountains to climb with 
Metagovernment, but scaling issues of our web application is not one of 
them.  And it may never be one of them.  Why sacrifice essential 
privacies and freedoms for a benefit we don't know we need?

I think we should rather prefer the freedom of web hosting where we know 
the host is not combing our data, where we can build the Django 
application any way we like, where we can move that application to 
another host at a moment's notice and have no down time, where anyone 
can sign up.  All for $84 a year.  Money well spent, in my opinion.

Kind regards,
Robert
