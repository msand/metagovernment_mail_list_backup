<PRE>Hi Ed,

Sorry for the delay.  I'm afraid for the next several months I will be
buried finishing a documentary about the kind of thing we are both working
on, and completing grad school, but I've just joined the listserv, and
hopefully will have something to contribute to the conversation when I get
the chance.

As for collaborative opportunities, I hope you are right.  We have
received a few similar offers, most notably from the folks behind TID+,
all of which we are not quite in a position to take advantage of yet, but
are looking forward to doing so.

lowercase d is not itself involved in software development, but is rather
geared towards creating the necessary legal framework and public demand
for such systems.  So we are more of a legal theory and organizing group. 
Having different working models to look at of how electronic direct
democracy might look, even if they are not actually in use, is of course
immensely helpful, both in our drafting work and in convincing people of
its feasibility.  We're all volunteer, but recently formed a local 527 so
that we can prepare for the political campaign(s) that winning electronic
direct democracy will require.  While we are focusing on New York, once
completed, hopefully in late 2009, the portion of our legislation dealing
with electronic direct democracy should be easily transferable as a ballot
measure in other places that already have direct democracy.

I'm curious how you foresee implementing Metascore globally when complete,
applaud your ambition, and look forward to the work ahead.

I guess I'll post this to the listserv, too, to supplement my short intro
note.  Apologies to everyone for any resulting repetition.

Best,
Olaf Bertram-Nothnagel
