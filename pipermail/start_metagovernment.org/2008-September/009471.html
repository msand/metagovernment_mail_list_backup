<PRE>I expect this to sound unpopular,
but to tell the truth I feel the project should close down to external
influences for work until we have a simple working prototype that we
can
a) start to use
b) present as an example
c) use to govern ourselves

When I joined this project I took 2 days full time from my vacation to
read all the messages that have been exchanged so far. I wish others
would do the same.

In the last month we had a lot of new people coming in. I personally
appreciate and really like the project growing, but growth have to
come at the right time, and be organic.

SO that the time of the ones that are programming are not taken into
discussing again things we have already defined.
If the growth is organice, new people can be brought up to speed from
the nearly new people, and we don't need to go through the same
discussions again and again.

Among the most weird suggestion that we had recently:
We had someone suggesting that we programmed a whole operating system
before making metascore,
someone else (or the same person under a different name) suggesting
that there should be rules in metascore that everybody should vote as
the 'board of directors' do (whoever they are).

I am not saying this to single out anyone, but I feel we need to
focus, concentrate on the ONE task at hand, and do it.
I would even reach the point of opposing further press releases until
we have something to show.
Having something to show will also provide with a natural filter.
People who are looking for something totally different will just not
get involved.

On the other side right now we are in the process of saying:
&quot;we should make a system to change the world&quot;,
and everybody is jumping in the bandwagon with their idea on how to do it.

Well, I joined this because I felt I resonated with the idea proposed.
Other ideas are also good, but we cannot necessarily program them all
at the same time.

We also have people who are working on competing systems. Which is
great, I mean, REALLY GREAT, but we should _first_ have our system, so
that the ideas that inspired it, and brought us all together sees the
light. Then we have a stable base to integrate ideas from other
projects. It is ok to look at them, and maybe be inspired, but I feel
it is too early to actively engage them in discussions.

I see how well did we responded on the topic, are we advocating an
'open' democracy or not. But think how bad this would have worked if
the person we were answering too was also part of the list, and
discussing. I feel a level of separation is temporarily needed;
separate then combine. (Hexagram 38 if you are following along on your
i ching :) ).

In any case I really would like to comunicate this sense of deep urgency.
Let's not get lost,
let's not get even involved with the most weird suggestions,
let's keep focused, and implement as much of metascore we had agreed on.
And let's keep a low profile until that time.

And move on from there.

Pietro
