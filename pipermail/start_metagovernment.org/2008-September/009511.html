<PRE>Hi Rob,

I want to give some replies to your assertions about App Engine...as 
I've used it some now, and so have some idea of what it does/doesn't do 
as well as what Google is doing with it (at least so far).

Rob Peters wrote:
&gt;<i> Google's App Engine is very similar to Django.  In fact, Django can be

</I>&gt;<i> would be possible to design your application to use Django and deploy 
</I>&gt;<i> it on App Engine with a minimum of fuss.  This would allow us to use 
</I>&gt;<i> App Engine's load-balancing and scaling architecture with the

</I>&gt;<i> of converting the data models.
</I>
Yes...it is possible to use Django (at least parts of it) and deploy 
something on App Engine.  BUT, you have to be a little bit careful about 
what parts of Django you use for this to be a smooth transition.  So, 
for example, using Django's templating system will convert easily, but 
using Django's db/query API will not (because Google's db API is 
different).  Perhaps this is what you were referring to WRT converting 
data models, but I'm not certain.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I don't think App Engine is worth it for 2 reasons: 1. You 
</I>&gt;<i> can't upload files.  
</I>
You can use binary large objects and/or large text in their db...which 
could be used to store files.  But there are limits on the amount of 
data (for free usage anyway).

&gt;<i> 2. App Engine's greatest features (load-balancing and unlimited 
</I>&gt;<i> scaling) are problems we don't have yet.  Django hosting can be had 
</I>&gt;<i> for $10 a month on a no-contract basis, and for considerably less if 
</I>&gt;<i> you're willing to pay for a year in advance.
</I>
Another thing to consider here is the application deploy and 
administration...which for App Engine is quite good IMHO.  I don't know 
anything about how well/what Django does in this area.

&gt;<i> I really think App Engine appeals to people in the same way that 
</I>&gt;<i> people dream of being a rock star.  Musicians worry about getting 
</I>&gt;<i> signed to a record label and then they figure they will make 
</I>&gt;<i> millions.  But in truth, most musicians will never make any money from 
</I>&gt;<i> their work.  But the dream drives them on.  
</I>
Huh?  This is sort of a strange thing to say IMHO.  In my view as a 
professional developer for &gt; 20 years the App Engine technology is 
good......the service is good (so far), and clearly people are doing 
some interesting applications with it (both Google and others).  And 
it's free...admittedly for limited usage, but they are probably just 
keeping their commercial options open with something that is very new 
(April this year).  I would doubt *very* strongly that they would 
arbitrarily close down an application created by a not-for-profit for 
public usage...unless the application was clearly objectionable on its face.

&gt;<i> Google says to people, &quot;when you hit it big, we'll be there to make 
</I>&gt;<i> sure your web site scales.&quot;  In truth,  most people's websites will 
</I>&gt;<i> never hit it big, most sites will not get slashdotted, and I'm willing 
</I>&gt;<i> to bet that 99% of all App Engine sites will never require any scaling 
</I>&gt;<i> beyond what's available with the most basic of web hosting.  
</I>
Perhaps so (apps won't require scaling)...but what's your point?  I 
would guess that 99% of all web sites also don't require scaling (and 
could run from my laptop and DSL line).  But if you can have it (serious 
scaling) for free, why would that be a problem?...as it seems that have 
support for something that can scale...especially for something that 
aspires to be available/used by the voting public (a large group) and/or 
other groups.

&gt;<i> We have some mountains to climb with Metagovernment, but scaling 
</I>&gt;<i> issues of our web application is not one of them.  And it may never be 
</I>&gt;<i> one of them.
</I>
If there's little hope of your service being used by more than only a 
few people, then why are you doing it?  You are right that most apps 
never get used by as many people as intended/desired by the 
creators...but that doesn't mean you design it to be used by 10 people, 
does it?

&gt;<i> Why sacrifice essential privacies and freedoms for a benefit we don't 
</I>&gt;<i> know we need?
</I>
What essential privacies and freedoms are being sacrificed?  I don't see 
what is being sacrificed here.  Yes, Google has a use agreement...which 
is probably in place mostly to protect the company from lawsuits.  And 
yes they are a commercial entity...but you might notice that (as an 
example), the Google Moderator app was created by some Google employees 
in their 20% time...i.e. the time the company gives its employees to use 
working on whatever they want.  And more than once they have deployed 
new technologies with little idea of what/whether it would generate any 
revenue.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think we should rather prefer the freedom of web hosting where we 
</I>&gt;<i> know the host is not combing our data, 
</I>
Personally, I think this is way too paranoid.  There is no evidence that 
Google does this, or has any intention of doing it.  And actually 
there's plenty of evidence of the opposite (i.e. that they don't do it 
and have no intention of doing it).

&gt;<i> where we can build the Django application any way we like, where we 
</I>&gt;<i> can move that application to another host at a moment's notice and 
</I>&gt;<i> have no down time, where anyone can sign up.  
</I>
You seem to imply that some people can't sign up for a Google App Engine 
app.  This is not the case (each app has it's own user db...and that's 
not based upon one's gmail account).

&gt;<i> All for $84 a year.  Money well spent, in my opinion.
</I>
Well, the 'freedom' to move the application to another host/hosts does 
have some value, but in my opinion you are overstating that value, 
overstating what is given up by using the App Engine (i.e. the privacy 
concerns), and understating the value of scaling and admin/deploy support.

Regards,

Scott
