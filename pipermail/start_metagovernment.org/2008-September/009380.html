Great! I am pressed for time at the moment, so can't work on it at the  
moment, but here is the general outline I was thinking of (if anyone  
wants to get started):

The nature of Web 2.0
  - openness and collaboration bring strength
  - success has been surprising to many
  - is still nascent; wikipedia is not the ultimate in Web 2.0

Problems with Democracy
  - Direct democracy only works for tiny groups
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Direct_democracy">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Direct_democracy</A>
  - Representative democracy has numerous flaws
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Representative_democracy</A>

How Web 2.0 can improve governance and Democracy
  - Collaboration instead of conflict
  - Encourages and welcomes citizen participation
  - Eliminates corruption; provides transparency
  - (others...)
  - Not just for political governments, but for any governance structure

How Web 2.0 is being applied to Governance
  - Early, pre-Web 2.0 examples (Debian, etc.)
  - &quot;Mixdemocracy&quot; approaches starting up around the world
use <A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Related_projects</A>
  - Wikimedia Meta and other nascent governance structures

Metagovernment project
  - Completely global, completely open
  - Targeted at all forms of governance
  - Provides sole governance mechanism for any community
  - We know how much we don't know
  - So we are making Metascore open and flexible, to see what people  
do with it
  - Please help!
