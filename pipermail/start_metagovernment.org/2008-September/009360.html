<PRE>Hi!

I never left, I just wasn't as vocal... I'm still reading and
following non-stop.

</I>
My branch is still waiting for some other people from the community to
contribute their 2c, because otherwise it would become too distanced
from what the community thinks and won't have a chance at acceptance
later on.

&gt;<i> I am happy either way. I think more branches can only make us stronger

</I>&gt;<i> concrete to show the world sooner rather than later.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am also wondering if there is anything really exclusive about your
</I>&gt;<i> ideas. I know that yours are technically disparate in their
</I>&gt;<i> implementation, but I don' think it necessarily has to be that way.
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel's server-based idea is easer to get rolling, and (at this

</I>&gt;<i> However, there are inherent weaknesses to a server-based approach, and
</I>&gt;<i> I think adding a distributed element to it would be extremely helpful.
</I>
Manuel's proposed implementation, as far as I understand it (and
that's not very well), doesn't feel right. No hard feelings, of
course, it's just not my path as a code artist :P And since this is a
hobby project, I can allow myself to follow my feelings like this.

My proposed implementation is my attempt at something REALLY robust -
something robust enough for me to trust the world population's freedom
in. A server-based solution just won't do for something this big.

&gt;<i> As an example, here is a scenario I have been developing in my mind. I
</I>&gt;<i> see distribution working on several levels, and for several reasons
</I>&gt;<i> (security, resilience, user freedom).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Community distribution: I can imagine that each separate community
</I>&gt;<i> would have its own implementation of Metascore. Communities could
</I>&gt;<i> share elements (resolutions, users, scores, etc.) with each other by
</I>&gt;<i> means of prefixed tags.
</I>
That's why I'm separating data format from the tools. It's easy to
build different tools on top of my data - although they'd be in many
ways very similar to my tools.

&gt;<i> Server distribution: Within one instance of Metascore, there should be
</I>&gt;<i> more than one server. This provides redundancy, checksumming against
</I>&gt;<i> hacking, and protection from rogue administrators.
</I>
This is not enough IMHO.

&gt;<i> User distribution (more to Aur's model): I would like to see each user
</I>&gt;<i> maintain their identity outside of any particular server. This gives
</I>&gt;<i> them portability between different instances of Metascore and also
</I>&gt;<i> gives them security in the integrity of their own virtual identity.
</I>
Here you're aiming at a more cryptographically secure OpenID - which
is a part of my implementation that I didn't touch yet and don't
intend to (I can let other people write it when the time is ripe, and
oh, they will).


So as I said, I'll get back to designing when I've received more
feedback to what's already in my repository.
