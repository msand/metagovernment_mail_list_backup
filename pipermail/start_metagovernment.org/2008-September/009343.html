<PRE>&gt;<i>I am not sure if tags are the correct way to do this.
</I>
Again I think the problem here is more about our different
understandings of tags. I see it as a general mechanism of applying an
attribute to a resource. That the attribute can be a link to another
resource, isn't completely obvious. They are both just metadata for me
and as such I'd like to have a uniform way of treating them. It's a
more general concept that I really like as a programmer, but from a
users perspective I have to agree that it may be more intuitive to
have the concrete concepts links and tags seperate from each other.

Slightly offtopic; I see this as a general theme in software. If you
develop a general purpose tool, take spreadsheets for example. You
don't have any particular use in mind. Even the people who see it,
may not be able to imagine at first, that they could organize there
finances with it or a professor could use it for analysing data etc.
You have to show it to them or hope that they are creative.

The best example of are probably programming languages, which have no
specific use or intended purpose whatsoever. Yet everybody uses them.

Building separate dedicated tools for everything is rather cumbersome.
If we implement links separately and then apply a weight to those links,
I'm not sure it will be as elegant as just having the concept of
attributes, that can have different interpretations.

&gt;<i>I mean, tags have a weight, and we want to use this weight for various reasons.
</I>&gt;<i>Also it is probably not that easy to write down the link to the message as a tag,
</I>&gt;<i>there will be numbers involved, and codes:
</I>&gt;<i>message:1234 message:7829 message:3745
</I>&gt;<i>And it would make it harder to find the actual tags.
</I>
The format I was thinking of is &quot;msg-title of the message&quot;
Which would work as long as the title is unambiguous, but really you could
stick with the ids, as long as the title is always displayed with it and
people don't have to type it.

&gt;<i>So maybe a parallel system would be better. Or at least a way to
</I>&gt;<i>filter out the reference tags from the way we visualize the tags of a
</I>&gt;<i>comment.
</I>
There is a different concept to links, so certainly you want to give them
a distinct visual representation.

&gt;<i>WHy? Because once a person have read a comment there is generally
</I>&gt;<i>little need for them to remember it. SO they don't link to it.
</I>
Probably also they don't tag it.

The most important thing is the scoring. Messages with higher scores
will probably be tagged eventually. Plus the authors have an incentive
to tag, since they want there messages to be found. If you add links
then they have an incentive to reference resources. This helps give
most messages some amount of tags. Of course giving links a weight just
like tags, will help against link spamming (you see why I want them to
be the same under the hood, so we don't have two implementations of
the weighting mechanism.)

&gt;<i>Another issue is that if people use those mess:tags to link different
</I>&gt;<i>comments and resolutions, would this not take away power from the
</I>&gt;<i>tags.
</I>&gt;<i>I mean, tags work because people need them to find the
</I>&gt;<i>comments/resolutions. The more you can find them without tags, the
</I>&gt;<i>less people will sue tags, the more tags will be a weak way to find
</I>&gt;<i>the actual similarity between resolutions.
</I>
Fundamentally we have a limited of user interaction that we want to make
as effective as possible. If we can allow people to navigate the
discussion with less use of tags, that will be just as well, so I don't
quite see your point. Even if there are few tags, we can calculate the
distance of messages to each other and to other tags, since they both
use the same mechanism. You want to compute the distance of a message to
another. You just calculate the distance of it's link-tag to another tag.

&gt;<i>It seem to me that resolutions and comments are two different systems.
</I>&gt;<i>And they should be deal separately. What is good for one, might not be
</I>&gt;<i>good for the other.
</I>
When you're looking at a resolution, you will probably want to use that
as a starting point to find any discussion about it. You may even want
to see the discussion about specific sections of the resolution.
Again, if you just use a resolution tag/link, you can calculate the
distance of its tag to other tags and find directly relevant resources
(via links) and related resources (via tags) .

Having the same mechanisms, would allow us to use the same metaphors
across the interface, which would hopefully be a more fluid interaction.

&gt;<i>Another idea, every time you add a comment you put your karma at
</I>&gt;<i>stake. And similarly depending on how many people link to that
</I>&gt;<i>comment, ignore and proceed on a different thread, your karma can go
</I>&gt;<i>up and down. So it is a bit of a bet, every comment. If you add your
</I>&gt;<i>comment to too many threads, your karma can go down, but if you
</I>&gt;<i>effectively connect different threads, and from that moment they are
</I>&gt;<i>one, your karma should go impressively up. After all you are making a
</I>&gt;<i>great work for the community.
</I>
This is a great way of thinking. To make a good discussion, we should
encourage people to think about there writing and not waste peoples
time. (Yeah I know look who's talking, and talking...) It takes you a
minute to write a message that will be read by in our case maybe 5-20
people, so you should give some thought to what you write. Any incentive
to stop inane blather and flaming should be a part of the system.

&gt;<i> If people fee the need to branch off, then the
</I>&gt;<i>link might not have been a good idea, if instead people follow up,
</I>&gt;<i>then you have effectively connected two threads. Kudos to you!
</I>
That gives me an idea. The very interaction of following a link,
suggests that two resources are more related than if you hadn't, so
you might as well capture that, and make the connections between
resources more relevant, by giving them a greater weight. Of course
you'd have to have a connection to begin with.

&gt;<i>And I still like the idea of the tick boxes. Maybe as a first
</I>&gt;<i>approximation of what comments are you answering to.
</I>
If you use the time honored mechanism of quoting the passages you are
referencing, that could be used to establish the link. It would be
automatically expressed in the format of your message, rather than
having an explicit interaction with a checkbox. If people are made aware
that this is how the system works, they will also make a habit of
quoting people and passages they are referring to, thus increase the
quality of there messages as a side effect.
