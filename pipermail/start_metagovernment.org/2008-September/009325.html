<PRE>I would like to request that each member of this list post a message  
about this project somewhere. I know several of you already have, but  
it wouldn't hurt to make an additional post somewhere else. More posts  
about us not only helps bring us more participants, but also increases  
our weight in search engines and helps our general credibility.

Since we are still in the startup phase, the most appropriate places  
to post would be on sites about programming, politics, philosophy,  
mass-collaboration, and perhaps mathematics. I think we'd be better  
off not posting much to mass-market sites until we have something for  
&quot;the people&quot; to get their hands on. But of course, it is up to you to  
decide where you post.

Also, it would be helpful to post to specifically non-American sites  
(and even non-English, as possible). While this group is largely non- 
American, our current traffic is mostly from the U.S. (in the range of  
80-90%).

Anything you post should be:
- non-spammy (i.e., pertinent to the site on which you are posting)
- well-written
- oriented toward the startup phase
- non-confrontational

As an example, here is a post I made on the MediaWiki Users Forum:
<A HREF="http://www.mwusers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8065">http://www.mwusers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=8065</A>

Alternate to posting on a website, you also may wish to contact a  
particular individual who may be interested in the project. I've  
already contacted Richard Stallman :) but there are plenty of other  
people we may wish to attract. I think we are established enough now  
that we don't have to worry about a &quot;big name&quot; coming in and taking  
over the project as their own.

Also, if you haven't done so already, please add us to any bookmarking  
sites (etc.) you may already be using.

Thanks!
