Yes - but not all consensus is equal - #4 is consensus via scientific
method, #5 is consensus via opinion. They reach the same conclusion,
but via different means. If a system supports only one method of
generating consensus then it cannot, and will not, be used by the
portion of the population it excludes.

Every individual has a personal weight they attach to each method -
and this can differ per-subject - e.g. the Fundamentalist Christian
who applies to the Scientific Method perfectly in the course of their
employment, while still believing that the world is 10,000 years old.

Irrationality and cognitive dissonance need to be accounted for -- I
think Aur said it best a few days ago:

&quot;If you are trying to make a system to aid the human race in ruling
itself, you will have to accept the basic follies of humanity and not
fight against them - for you will loose, this way or the other.&quot;

So what I'm talking about is a way to support both 'objective' and
'subjective' reasoning methods and still reach consensus.


&gt;&gt;<i> With regards objectivity - how objective can we expect people to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about things they care about? I think a more achievable goal would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to allow people to explicitly express their opinion (leading to #5)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and their 'objective assessment' (leading to #4) -- separating and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> personally that it is wrong, but 'objectively' would not want to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> remove the option of final choice ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Richard
</I>&gt;<i> in my view, &quot;objectiveness&quot; is as abstract and useless as &quot;truthiness&quot;. but
</I>&gt;<i> concert of &quot;subjective&quot; opinions can be used as measure of &quot;objectiveness&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> and this is again about &quot;consensus&quot;.
</I>
This thread, in particular, is about getting closer to &quot;truth&quot; -
Manuel suggested favouring objectivity - I'm suggesting trying to
lever off the wisdom encapsulated in much subjective thought.
Consensus is a de-facto goal, otherwise it's a soap-box, not a form of
governance.


&gt;<i> search after &quot;truth&quot; is endless. at the same time we all see many cases where
</I>&gt;<i> people manage to achieve consensus and some cases where they fail to do so.
</I>&gt;<i> and i hope this project will make people more effective in reaching
</I>&gt;<i> agreements.
</I>
&quot;Objectiveness&quot; may well be abstract, but it is far from useless -- it
is the attempt to get closer to objectivity which takes us further
away from subjectivity; the same goes for &quot;Truth&quot; - as long as we have
examples of things we know to be false - &quot;I know everything I do not
know&quot; is false - we can start from there.

A &quot;concert of subjective opinions&quot; can objectively measure a form of
consensus, but not objectivity itself. As long as the system does not
inherently support one over the other, I do not think that is a
problem.

Every &quot;truth&quot; was first considered subjective, before it was deemed
objective through consensus.
