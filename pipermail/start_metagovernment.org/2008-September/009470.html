I really don't know how this will play out, but in some sense I think  
a lot of &quot;different&quot; people will end up in different communities. But  
in the long run, again, I think we can't get very far here until we  
try some real-world experiments. As long as we keep an open mind,  
hopefully we will recognize when we're &quot;suppressing&quot; people. And if we  
have a strong consensus model, that too should do a lot of correction.  
Reference the third basic principle of this project.

 From what I understand, the Quakers' fight against slavery started  
with one person. The rest of the quakers totally disagreed with him,  
but instead of ignoring him, they *supported* his quest to convince  
them that they were wrong. They actually provided him a means of  
living in order for him to go around trying to convince them to  
abandon slavery. And after a mere 70 years, they did come to a  
complete consensus against slavery... 70 years before the rest of the  
United States.

&gt;<i> This is another double edged sword.  I think a central government is
</I>&gt;<i> necessary for certain things.  For example; basic human rights.   Take
</I>&gt;<i> away an enforcer to ensure these are upheld will result in some areas
</I>&gt;<i> resorting to barbarism.  Look at hate groups.  What's to stop a neo- 
</I>&gt;<i> nazi
</I>&gt;<i> party from moving every neo-nazi to a state/region etc ,  
</I>&gt;<i> overpopulating
</I>&gt;<i> it and instituting ethnic cleansing without a central government?
</I>
Again, we'll start small and see how it grows. I can see the  
Metagovernment eventually being a sort of planetary government. But  
I'm not going to say that's a good idea until I see how it plays out.

&gt;<i> RF: &quot;Who defines the &quot;experts&quot;, and which categories issues are  
</I>&gt;<i> placed in?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well as I said I was just giving the basic idea..not the minute  
</I>&gt;<i> details,
</I>&gt;<i> but... I envisioned something like a review board of academicians  
</I>&gt;<i> (like
</I>&gt;<i> the Bar association etc). would be tasked with determining what basic
</I>&gt;<i> knowledge of a subject would be sufficient as a prerequisite for
</I>&gt;<i> office.
</I>
For what it's worth, some earlier Metagovernment versions suggested  
just using existing professional societies. For example, see &quot;Topic  
area factor&quot; section of
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/archive/2007-11-30/">http://www.metagovernment.org/archive/2007-11-30/</A>

&gt;<i> SS: &quot;Me too think that &quot;Pure&quot; Direct democracy is not practical, and
</I>&gt;<i> Delegated voting/Liquid Democracy can be a better solution, as long as
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can vote by himself when he prefers.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was a political party that did exactly that.  I was trying to  
</I>&gt;<i> find
</I>&gt;<i> a link for you but can't seem to find it.  They were called something
</I>&gt;<i> along the lines of &quot;the open source party&quot; or something along those
</I>&gt;<i> lines.
</I>
Several are listed here:

If it's not there, please add if you think of it.
