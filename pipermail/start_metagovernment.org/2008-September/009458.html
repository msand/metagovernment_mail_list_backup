<PRE>The Open Knowledge Foundation specializes has a lot of experience with  
these issues, and they are having an open meeting tonight (London  
evening), at 17:30 GMT. About two hours from when this message is  
being sent.

I don't think I can make it, but would encourage other members of the  
list to join in and ask them what their opinion is. (It would also be  
a nice group to plug our project to...)

I really don't like having our group be &quot;governed by certain laws.&quot; We  
shouldn't have to bow to any particular government. It just seems  
antithetical to the spirit of the organization.

Also, personally I am opposed to a board of directors no matter how  
constrained because again, I think it goes against the spirit of open  
source governance. A board is at best a form of representative  
democracy, and that's precisely what we are trying to replace. Yes, I  
had actively promoted a board of directors in the initial formation of  
this group, but that was just because I figured that was the way these  
things are done... I love the idea of there being no single individual  
who can be pinned down as our &quot;leader,&quot; no single decision-maker or  
authority who, even nominally, has power over others.
