<PRE>To challenge your title of &quot;difficult person,&quot; I'll add that Metagovernment
is working to reinvent the wheel which has already been developed on Google
Code, and Drupal, along with numerous other groups and organizations who
support Open Government. I would agree that Metagovernment is working from
exclusionary practices, but I'll raise your call by also adding that we're
excluding ourselves from these other projects by simply developing our own
ideas.

Juding by the focus of this list thus far, we might do well to consider
MetaScore as our contribution to Open Government. I imagine that MetaScore
could be designed in such a way that any Open Government project could
include a robust voting system regardless of their operating environment.
This might also involve redevolping the code base a number of times to plug
into these other projects, but imagine our role as the olive branch that
reaches across cooperative lines!
