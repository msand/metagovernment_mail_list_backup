<PRE> From youtube: &quot; We will, however, enforce our Terms of Use against, 
say, a website that does nothing more than aggregate a bunch of embedded 
YouTube videos and intentionally tries to generate ad revenue from them.&quot;

They're not saying they will sue anyone.  They're basically saying that 
they may deny service to people who do that.  They're a private business 
and if they have a detailed legals page outlining &quot;TOS&quot; they can 
basically do whatever they like in terms of restricting access.

RF: &quot;I didn't specify explicitly, but I was looking for a definition as 
it relates to new media&quot;

&quot;new media&quot; is a phrase on par with &quot;web 2.0&quot;.  In regards to the &quot;copy&quot; 
(text) and &quot;media&quot; (photos) they'll be treated the same as they have 
always been.  Incidentally it comes down to this.  If we come across 
someone using this stuff in a way we feel to be inappropriate, we'll 
decide if we want to take action.  If so, we contact a lawyer who 
decides whether we have a case or not, the lawyer sends a cease and 
desist letter, if the person doesn't comply, then we go to court.

None of this would dissuade a reporter/blogger from writing about 
metagovernment. 

EP: &quot;any non-profit has to register  within one nation, and we are 
entirely global and want no specific  geographic presence.&quot;

I'm not sure if that's true.  In the U.S you need to incorporate in 
every state you do business.  So basically if you were to set up offices 
and go around asking for donations in philadelphia, you would need to 
incorporate here.  If you wanted to do the same thing in California, you 
would have to incorporate there as well.  I don't think this would stop 
you from doing the same in other nations. This is basically what 
multinational non-profits like the red cross and greenpeace have to do.  
Also for now, you could register just in D.C. and still take donations 
from around the world...online.  As far as the Gvmt is concerned you 
would be accepting donations within D.C.   More so, the donations would 
be tax deductible which is a major incentive to people making large 
donations. I do believe a non-profit corporation is governed by certain 
laws, i.e. you have to have board members who meet at predefined times 
etc.  Based on the link you showed me, you would rather have everyone 
make the decisions rather than a select few.  You could make it a 
requirement that all board members sign a document agreeing that they 
will vote in accordance with the will of the majority.  Make it a 
misconduct clause whereby they are stripped of their power if they fail 
to vote with the metascore results. 


Everything I'm saying is based on the U.S.  I have no idea how any of 
this would work overseas as I'm not familiar with their laws.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> RF: &quot;To be clear, I was talking about the text used in the wiki - the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That would get a bit complicated when you go into the philosophy.  As I

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree - which is why I think we save ourselves quite a few headaches
