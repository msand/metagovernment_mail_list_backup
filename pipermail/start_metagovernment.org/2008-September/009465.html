<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>manuel, you basically just proved my point.  You're making inferences 
about me based on your own beliefs and...to be quite honest manuel, 
you've done it since I first came here.  Say I were to propose a really 
good idea.  would you agree with it because it's a good idea?  or would 
you disregard it because you think I'm a &quot;difficult&quot; person or as you've 
labeled me before a &quot;troll&quot;?

You're a programmer as I understand it...so you are invaluable to the 
metascore project.  I'm not a programmer, which makes me much less 
valuable to that project. If my comments aren't welcome, that's fine.  I 
won't waste my time.

Maybe I'm wrong but I view metagovernment and metascore as 2 different 
projects.  Metagovernment being a system of governance and metascore 
being the software facilitating that system of governance.  I'm trying 
to contribute to the system of governance as I have no programming ability.

look, I'll keep my suggestions to myself if that's what everyone 
wants...but I want to build a system of governance that's feasible and 
prepared for the ideological attack that will assuredly come from the 
outside world and doing so requires a constant re-evaluation of your 
ideas until there is no doubt about their effectiveness.  I believe 
strongly in what I'm suggesting.  I believe based on what I've seen.  I 
believe because to me, it makes sense  I believe they are part of a 
necessary difference between making a system of governance that fails 
versus one that succeeds.

either way, it can be difficult to follow all of this through a 
list-server.  Maybe a forum would be better.  or...to save bandwidth and 
server space etc... a ning (www.ning.com).  I'm willing to set one up if 
Ed's cool with that (it takes about 5 minutes). 


-----------------------

Sorry Nicolas, I don't have the time to read you're messages and when
you wrote in the wiki, I researched your suggestions, but didn't think
it was worth a reply with critic to every aspect of the system you're
suggesting. I still don't think it is, and I'd suggest you take a good
look at the archives on gmane before you write 10 paragraphs and
expect 33 people to read them. Specifically I would like to know how
your suggestions are better than what we have come up with so far.

Also to be totally transparent, I consider you to be in the category
of contributors described here:
<A HREF="http://www.producingoss.com/en/difficult-people.html">http://www.producingoss.com/en/difficult-people.html</A>

I don't want to be mean, I'm thinking in terms of the projects best
interests and if you are too, I hope you will read up specifically on
voting
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/79">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/79</A>
and follow up messages.

Manuel
