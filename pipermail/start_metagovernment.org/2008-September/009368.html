I very much like your analogy. I think Shlook makes a good point,  
however... To apply it to your example, not only do you only get  
access to your bank accounts but once every few years, but the bank  
gets to decide everything that gets done with your money in the  
interim. Usually, hopefully, they invest it in your interests. But  
sometimes the banker might take some of your money to buy a gift for a  
friend. If you don't like it; you can choose a new banker next time  
you are allowed into the bank, and that one *promises* they won't buy  
any gifts with your money.
