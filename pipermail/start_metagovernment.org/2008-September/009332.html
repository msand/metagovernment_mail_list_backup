<PRE>I realize it's not so terribly important, but I was interested to hear 
Mike Huckabee on the Daily Show tonight saying (and I'm not quoting, as 
I'm just trying to type it before I forget it), &quot;It's unfortunate that 
money wins elections, but that's the way politics works.  Now, I think 
the internet can change that, and will change that, getting people more 
directly involved in government.&quot;

I would not have suspected a governor to make such a claim, and it's 
interesting to know that at least someone at the highest level has 
considered the power the internet can have in democracy.  I doubt he's 
considering a complete reworking of politics (as we are), but it might 
be interesting to contact him.  At least he didn't claim the internet 
was a &quot;series of tubes.&quot;

Kind regards,
Robert Peters
