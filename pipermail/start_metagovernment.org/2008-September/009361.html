Can you provide some guidance on how people could do that? There have  
been many new subscriptions to the list since your last post, and in  
any event, I think people have had trouble figuring out how to respond  
to what you are asking.

Also, I think it would be helpful if you could give a more thorough  
treatment of your model within the wiki (maybe under PrototypeB, to  
follow existing convention) so that people can see what you are  
talking about without setting up a repository. For many people, even  
within this group, that is going to be rather difficult.
