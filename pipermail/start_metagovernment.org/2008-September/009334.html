</I>hmm! Very interesting!
Yes.

Some thoughts follow.
More like an avalanche of thoughts.

I am not sure if tags are the correct way to do this.

I mean, tags have a weight, and we want to use this weight for various reasons.
Also it is probably not that easy to write down the link to the
message as a tag,
there will be numbers involved, and codes:
message:1234 message:7829 message:3745
And it would make it harder to find the actual tags.

Like:
medicine economy opensource

is easier to read than:
medicine mess:1234 mess:7829 economy mess:3745 opensource

So maybe a parallel system would be better. Or at least a way to
filter out the reference tags from the way we visualize the tags of a
comment.

Also, tagging resolutions is ok, this because, resolutions are not
everyday events, so people will go an extra mile to link them.
Tagging comments does not seem to work. When it was tried in TagSurf
it did not work.

WHy? Because once a person have read a comment there is generally
little need for them to remember it. SO they don't link to it.

And if people do not consistently use the tags the whole thing become
unreliable.

Maybe in this case a parallel narrow folksonomy, where anyone can add
a link might be what we really need.

Another issue is that if people use those mess:tags to link different
comments and resolutions, would this not take away power from the
tags.
I mean, tags work because people need them to find the
comments/resolutions. The more you can find them without tags, the
less people will sue tags, the more tags will be a weak way to find
the actual similarity between resolutions.


So I would say:
a broad folksonomy for resolutions.

A way to add links narrow folksonomy like style, for comments.

Onlt the author of a resolution can add a link to a resolution, and
say this is a sinthesis of this and that (then people vote).

And more and more details.

It seem to me that resolutions and comments are two different systems.
And they should be deal separately. What is good for one, might not be
good for the other.

Maybe preparing one of those systems first, and the the other might be
the correct way, in all case we need to be able to differentiate
between them, so that if in future we need the two systems to work
differently it can be done.

Another idea, every time you add a comment you put your karma at
stake. And similarly depending on how many people link to that
comment, ignore and proceed on a different thread, your karma can go
up and down. So it is a bit of a bet, every comment. If you add your
comment to too many threads, your karma can go down, but if you
effectively connect different threads, and from that moment they are
one, your karma should go impressively up. After all you are making a
great work for the community.

We need to have a system that acknowledges all this.
Similarly people who add links, and those are not ok, should have
their karma go down, but if they are ok, their karma should go up.

So to summarise yet again we have:
* broad folksonomy for resolution.
* adding links for comments (as tags, hmm, not convinced)
* the karma should go up and down depending on how people behave
respect to that link. If people fee the need to branch off, then the
link might not have been a good idea, if instead people follow up,
then you have effectively connected two threads. Kudos to you!

And I still like the idea of the tick boxes. Maybe as a first
approximation of what comments are you answering to.
