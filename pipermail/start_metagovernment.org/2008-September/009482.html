The one thing I don't want is for us to end up being perceived as one  
of &quot;those projects&quot;... where there's an inner clique and if they don't  
like you, you're &quot;encouraged to leave.&quot; For this project n particular,  
that would be death.

And as for the topic of this post, I don't think it's realistic. We're  
now on the schedule for the conference in Prague <A HREF="http://www.webexpo.cz/program/#sobota">http://www.webexpo.cz/program/#sobota</A> 
  so I don't think we're going to be able to keep under the radar. :)

I also like both of these projects. I think we're going to have  
trouble working closely with FreeGovernment just because they are so  
different in both scope (US Federal government only) and format.

As for DemocracyLab, I have to admit, Mark has been a wonderful  
participant of this list, and I think we owe him further analysis of  
what his project has to offer. For some reason, I just have trouble  
getting my teeth into it.

In both cases, I have been deferring to the more programmer-types on  
the list to evaluate the suitability of the codebases to our purposes.
