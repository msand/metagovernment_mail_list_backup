Did Obama call Palin a pig?
Sourced Fact: Obama, said the &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; line days after
Palins &quot;lipstick/pitbull/hockey mom&quot; memorable line
Sourced Fact: Many commentators specifically linked the two
Sourced Fact: Many commentators specifically said the two were not linked

If instead you count that all commentary on that subject as Opinion,
and split up the two lines into separate items of Evidence, then you
still can't provide an answer.

When trying to position the dividing line between objectivity and
subjectivity I think you fall into the trap of believing that there is
such a line, or indeed that there cannot be overlap.

The best compromise I think you could hope for, would be for someone
to be able to express something like:
  &quot;[in my interpretation of subjectivity] I think Obama called Palin a pig&quot;
  &quot;[in my interpretation of objectivity] there isn't enough evidence
to categorically state that he did&quot;

Then - leave it to another mechanism at a different layer, e.g:
  &quot;Does the community support innocence before evidence of guilt?&quot;,
  &quot;If [consensus threshold] of people believe that it alludes to a
common understanding of words/phrases, then that can be used in lieu
of direct evidence&quot;

The latter would essentially be a speeded up version of what we have
now with the gossip orientated news cycle.
