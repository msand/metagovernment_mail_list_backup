Another person has already set up a forum. I forget where it is, but  
it should be findable in the list archives (yes, I recognize the irony  
in this statement).

As Richard said, noone can stop you, but I dislike it because it  
further scatters the discussion. We already have two venues and adding  
a third breaks us up more.

What I think would work best would be to further transcribe early  
discussions into the wiki. That provides an archive of sorts but also  
gives it life: ideas don't have to be stuck in their original form but  
can grow over time. My only holdup in this has been that I have a lot  
of other obligations and haven't gotten around to it. Anyone can go  
about transcribing and I would strongly encourage any/all to do so.

This is why we intend to start in very small communities and to make  
the software very flexible. We expect that it's going to be horribly  
wrong in some ways, but the best way to really find out is through  
real-world experimentation.
