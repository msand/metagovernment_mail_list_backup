Agreed!

Truth is the ultimate consensus. We might all agree that the sky is
blue - and via the exception which proves the rule - the one who
states that the sky is purple with pink dots, knows to go get their
eyes checked.


&gt;&gt;<i> So while the &quot;truthiness&quot; environment doesn't care if we find it or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not, the fact that we can discern some things to be more truthy than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> others leads me to believe that we can use that principle of emergence
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to our advantage by creating a system that rewards (even if it is only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very slightly at first) truthiness over untruthiness.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i don't think we can discern anything to be more or less true. different
</I>&gt;<i> opinions/theories make one and the same thing be either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. again from my perspective, a system should
</I>&gt;<i> produce &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot;. once it has been reached, you can call
</I>&gt;<i> it &quot;truth&quot;, but participants from other systems may disagree with you.
</I>
Consider the following statements:
1) &quot;The sky is blue&quot;,
2) &quot;The sky is blue at noon&quot;,
3) &quot;The sky is blue at noon when there are no clouds&quot;,
4) &quot;The sky is blue at noon local time, relative to GMT, when there
are no clouds, when you are on the equator and not during a total
eclipse of the sun&quot;,
5) &quot;The sky is blue if we all think it is&quot;

Statement #5 is what you get from consensus, statement #4 is what you
get from successively trying to determine the 'truth'. Is one more
useful than the other? I'd say that it depends entirely on what
question you're asking.

But - just because 100% truth cannot be obtained, or it may be a goal
which does not exist, that is absolutely no reason to not attempt to
reach it and instead sit around stroking our collective beards,
sipping bitter espresso.

Also - there is no reason at all to try to force truth though the
wrangler of metaphysics -- I can imagine the day when its most
compelling paradoxes are defeated by a superior application of logic.

With regards objectivity - how objective can we expect people to be
about things they care about? I think a more achievable goal would be
to allow people to explicitly express their opinion (leading to #5)
and their 'objective assessment' (leading to #4) -- separating and
defining those through the UI. For example - someone who leans
Pro-Life may indicate, on the subject of abortion, that they think
personally that it is wrong, but 'objectively' would not want to
remove the option of final choice.

I envisage a system which leads people to the thought process &quot;This is
what I think is true [check], this other thing is what the available
evidence points to [check]&quot; -- as long as the system accepts and uses
both inputs, then we'll start to train our users (and ourselves) to
separate the two, and not to habitually conflate &quot;truth&quot; with
&quot;opinion&quot;, but to value both.


&gt;<i> and what's wrong with Fox News? do you mean this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fBGtXS66VM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fBGtXS66VM</A> ?

You could find examples all day! Literally, 24/7.
