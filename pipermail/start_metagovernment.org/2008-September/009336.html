<PRE>ok, let's slow down a bit.

Yes, in the comments we have a problem if we want to use tags.
Because people tend not to tag messages that are too short.

But making the tagging automatic is _not_ the solution. This is like
the anthithesis of everything we are working for. We want tags to be
represnetatives of where a comment is, so precisely that we can
measure the distance between two resources. If resources start to
inherit tags the result will be total metric chaos. Not only comments
not tagged, but comments tagged with the wrong tags.

Also this is something that would go after we have decided if we want
to use for tags the broad and the narrow folksonomy.
If we use the broad folksonomy, then which tags will you inherit? The
ones YOU used, or the ones other people have used.

What can be done is what delicious and others have done to have a
small javascript, that suggests tags. And then by clicking on each of
them you get to add them. This could be fast AND reliable. But to
automatically inherit tags... -100 from me. No way, this will never
work, as it destroys any possibility to do any measue which is the
deep reason why we want tags.

I don't think that check box are old skool. I mean, Amazon uses check
box in their wish list. And they have enough programmers to be able to
make any programming wish come true. But in their wish list that is
just the best tool. And I think here too is the best tool. What we can
have is that the comments get compressed to a single line, so that in
a page you can see many many comments, and click on all that apply.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or perhaps even simpler to just display tags attached to a post, which
</I>&gt;<i> toggle between bold and regular font when you click upon them - adding
</I>&gt;<i> or removing the tags from the list of tags you are interested in for
</I>&gt;<i> that particular subject. Then hitting a global 'filter' or 'reply'
</I>&gt;<i> button would have a more obvious action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, this might work, but it requires that when you add a tag they
also appear in an edit box. So that people don't feel limited to only
use the tags that has been suggested.

Also the size of the tags suggested might change depending on how many
people have used them before, or now. In short how much we expect them
to be relevant.

Cheers,
Pietro
