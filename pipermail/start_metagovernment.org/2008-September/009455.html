<PRE>Me too think that &quot;Pure&quot; Direct democracy is not practical, and Delegated
voting &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting#Delegated_voting</A>&gt;/Liquid
Democracy &lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy</A>&gt; can be a better
solution, as long as anyone can vote by himself when he prefers.
I think it's even more than just synthesis of direct and representative
democracy, it's somthing that reflects more the nature of the consciousness
-
nobody can decide rationaly for every thing in life. Sometimes you think,
aware of what you think, and than decide and sometimes you &quot;Beilieve&quot; or
&quot;Trust&quot; or &quot;Flow&quot; (With others/the society/god/fun) :-) and as long as you
free to &quot;switch&quot; between these modes, it is good.

</I>&gt;<i> as I stated on my user page I have been working on something called
</I>&gt;<i> symetrism for the past 7 (almost 8) years.  I really think some of it
</I>&gt;<i> can be applied to metagovernment and so I will give you the basic ideas
</I>&gt;<i> behind it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1- many times &quot;the majority&quot; adamantly support/oppose something, but
</I>&gt;<i> their representatives vote against/for it.  Because of this the people
</I>&gt;<i> should have a direct vote on the issues at hand.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2- many times the people cannot make up their mind on an issue which
</I>&gt;<i> needs immediate attention.  In order to safeguard against inaction,
</I>&gt;<i> there should be a representative democracy for those issues.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3- representatives are not necessarily knowledgeable on the subjects
</I>&gt;<i> they are voting on.  This can be changed by determining broad categories
</I>&gt;<i> for legislation and requiring representatives to be &quot;experts&quot; in one
</I>&gt;<i> specific field, for which they vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4- People are different.  They have different ideas about what is good
</I>&gt;<i> and bad.  Attempting to homogenize everyone results in hatred and
</I>&gt;<i> dissatisfaction.  In order to prevent this, allow more efficacy for
</I>&gt;<i> smaller groups, have general &quot;broad strokes&quot; for the larger governing
</I>&gt;<i> body, but leave the details up to the smaller governing bodies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since it's inception it has become much more detailed. but those were
</I>&gt;<i> the basic ideas. I built around that by borrowing aspects of different
</I>&gt;<i> forms of governance and came up with this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A proposed issue is voted on directly by the citizens of the
</I>&gt;<i> region/state etc affected by it.  If they fail to reach a 3/5 majority
</I>&gt;<i> it is then passed on to their localities congress. The issue is
</I>&gt;<i> classified as 1 of 7 different categories (environment, economics,
</I>&gt;<i> education, healthcare, energy. social welfare, child welfare).  If it
</I>&gt;<i> can only be classified as 1 category, the representative who is an
</I>&gt;<i> expert in that field makes a decision.  If it can be classified as an
</I>&gt;<i> even number of categories and the representatives fail to reach a
</I>&gt;<i> majority decision then all 7 representatives will vote on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I came across a book a while ago, I can't remember who wrote it or what
</I>&gt;<i> it was called, but the author proposed something like synthesis scoring
</I>&gt;<i> for potential candidates.  You can score candidated between -10 and 10,
</I>&gt;<i> which ensures the candidate with the most support wins instead
</I>&gt;<i> of...say...some people voting for ralph nader and some people voting for
</I>&gt;<i> al gore and Georger W. Bush winning, even though Gore or Nader would
</I>&gt;<i> have been acceptable to the majority.  So I think that may be a better
</I>&gt;<i> way to do that, than my first idea (anonymous candidates because people
</I>&gt;<i> have been proven to vote based on appearance and not on fact).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> anyway, why am I sending this to everyone?  Well I do believe that an
</I>&gt;<i> absolute direct democracy is doomed to failure.  It relies too greatly
</I>&gt;<i> on the whims of the people...which are fickle at best.  It was tried by
</I>&gt;<i> the athenians way back when...and they executed socrates.   With every
</I>&gt;<i> fiber of my being I believe a synthesis of direct and representative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy to be the best possible choice for a new system and I think it
</I>&gt;<i> should be incorporated into metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i>
