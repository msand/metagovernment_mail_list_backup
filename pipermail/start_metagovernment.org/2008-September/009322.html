<PRE>I finally had the time to read the article suggested by Richard:

<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html</A>

I am sorry to say I totally missed the point before. I assumed
something which simply was wrong. While Ed made a great work in
summarising it, in his email.

Essentially Richard is not so much conecrned with the trademark of the
world 'open', but with the spirit behind the people who started using
this word. Saying they are too pragmatic, and do not sign necessarily
to all the philosophical base of the free software. So they join open
software not because it is free, but because it is inherently better.
But the day a company would arrive with a non free software that is
better they would join the badwagon. And to hell with freedom.
So he is agreeing with us that there is a revolution, and that we need
to all work together in various human domains.

Unfortunately his suggestion of using the word free instead of the
word open just do not apply to us. The word free has been used in
politics all the time, with very little relation to the actual meaning
of the word.

We really cannot use 'free' in this context.

Also I am not sure I would agree with the analysis he does with the
way people have been using hte word open. I mean, it might be true in
the realm of software (maybe!), but it surely is not true in all other
endevour, where the word open is being used.

I mean I have been invited just yesterday to the the &quot;open
sustainability network&quot;.
<A HREF="http://www.appropedia.org/Open_Sustainability_Network">http://www.appropedia.org/Open_Sustainability_Network</A>

What does open here means?

I don't think it shares only the values of being pragmatically better.
I think its members also are working to get a technology out that
everybody is able to change and modify.

So here the word 'open' isn't used as Richard claims.


It seem to me that in general the meaning used most often now is as
participatory, with the added benefit that people who participate can
potentially have the same weight as the original organizers. So
something which is open is more participatory than something which is
participatory.

just some thoughts.
Pietro
