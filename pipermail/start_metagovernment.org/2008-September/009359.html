<PRE>It's great to see you back on the list, Aur! I was beginning to  
suspect we had lost you to the MyVote.org.il group. :) Can I ask what  
your opinion is of your branch of Metascore? You may have noticed that  
Manuel's branch has gained some momentum, and he now has two other  
developers working with him on it.

I am happy either way. I think more branches can only make us stronger  
in the long run, but I also would like to see us have something  
concrete to show the world sooner rather than later.

I am also wondering if there is anything really exclusive about your  
ideas. I know that yours are technically disparate in their  
implementation, but I don' think it necessarily has to be that way.  
Manuel's server-based idea is easer to get rolling, and (at this  
point, anyway) much easier for the average end-user to understand.  
However, there are inherent weaknesses to a server-based approach, and  
I think adding a distributed element to it would be extremely helpful.

As an example, here is a scenario I have been developing in my mind. I  
see distribution working on several levels, and for several reasons  
(security, resilience, user freedom).

Community distribution: I can imagine that each separate community  
would have its own implementation of Metascore. Communities could  
share elements (resolutions, users, scores, etc.) with each other by  
means of prefixed tags.

Server distribution: Within one instance of Metascore, there should be  
more than one server. This provides redundancy, checksumming against  
hacking, and protection from rogue administrators.

User distribution (more to Aur's model): I would like to see each user  
maintain their identity outside of any particular server. This gives  
them portability between different instances of Metascore and also  
gives them security in the integrity of their own virtual identity.
