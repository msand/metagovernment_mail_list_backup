<PRE>Naming is indeed important.  However, words are not static, and while 
RMS may feel Linux should be called GNU-Linux, the truth is that most 
people say &quot;Linux&quot;, even though what they are referring to is 
&quot;GNU-Linux&quot;.  When we say &quot;open-source government&quot;, we may not mean, 
technically, what the Free Software Foundation means when they say 
&quot;open-source&quot;, the truth is that amongst people who know what 
&quot;open-source&quot; is, almost all will understand it the way that you have 
used it, not the way that RMS would like us to use it.

To illustrate, when a dictionary is written, people on the street are 
asked what certain words mean to determine its definition.  When I say 
'snarfblat', if most people instinctively think of a small, red lugnut, 
that's what 'snarfblat' means, no matter how much I post on the internet 
that a snarfblat is really a large blue lugnut, even if I invented the 
term.  The only thing that defines correct and incorrect usage is how 
most people use it.

So, even though Richard may have invented open-source, the word has come 
to mean different things than he intended.  Therefore his definition is 
wrong, and he is fighting a losing battle here, just as he is fighting a 
losing battle with &quot;GNU-Linux&quot;.

None of this is to disparage what RMS thinks and says.  He's clearly a 
smart fellow.  However, he seems to ignore the fact that words change 
with time and cannot be controlled by any one person.

All of this to say that if, when you say the words &quot;open-source 
government&quot;, I understand a series of concepts that you intended, then 
you have used the word correctly, despite what the inventor of the word 
may have intended.  I think you use it in the correct way, for as soon 
as you said it, I understood that you were trying to create government 
that was flexible and open, controlled by a meritocracy rather than an 
aristocracy, free for anyone to use or change, using computers and 
technology to bring all this about.  If I have misunderstood, please let 
me know.  If not, please keep using the term &quot;open-source government&quot; 
they way you currently have been.  I also think the fact that no one 
else has questioned its usage, or been confused about our intentions, 
illustrates that you have it right, and RMS may have it wrong.  You 
cannot (and should not) fight the people on this one.

Kind regards,
Robert Peters

</I>&gt;<i> Personally, I have not been a big fan of the term, since it seems like

</I>&gt;<i> But his opposition was rooted in the history of the term (in which he  
</I>&gt;<i> was personally, centrally involved); something which I have just  
</I>&gt;<i> recently been learning about. In a nutshell, he says that the term  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;open source&quot; was coined explicitly to de-emphasize the concept of  
</I>&gt;<i> freedom in the free software movement (noting that &quot;free software&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> connotes free as in &quot;free speech,&quot; not &quot;free beer&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> He referenced this article, which I would strongly recommend reading.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, as I discussed it with him further, I came to the realization  
</I>&gt;<i> that &quot;freedom&quot; is not the sole, core concept of this project, and that  
</I>&gt;<i> we shouldn't necessarily overly focus on it. For example, freedom is  
</I>&gt;<i> not an important or even applicable concept to the governance of a  
</I>&gt;<i> cycling club or a park authority. And with governance mechanisms such  
</I>&gt;<i> as a condo board or school board, freedom may in fact be an  
</I>&gt;<i> undesirable thing in some regards. We certainly are for freedom from  
</I>&gt;<i> the authority of individual rulers, but we should be careful not to  
</I>&gt;<i> overemphasize the concept.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any event, his point is well taken that we may want to move away  
</I>&gt;<i> from the term &quot;open source.&quot; He also had a problem with the term &quot;open  
</I>&gt;<i> content&quot; in that &quot;open&quot; was used explicitly to de-emphasize freedom,  
</I>&gt;<i> and that &quot;content&quot; is a negative word as well:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> His suggestion: &quot;It seems to me that the crucial point about your idea  
</I>&gt;<i> is government based on participatory discussion. Maybe you can find a  
</I>&gt;<i> good name by thinking about those terms.&quot;
