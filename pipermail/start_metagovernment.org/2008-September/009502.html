<PRE>I think the critical point is that the application could be moved easily off
of Google's platform if the agreement for any reason became undesirable.  In
the mean time, it's providing valuable resources and is generating a great
deal of interest in the open source community.  It's been interesting to see
the eyes of developers light up when they start to understand the tools and
technologies the App Engine makes available.  My experience so far is that
in the eyes of developers, having a technically interesting project is
almost as important as having a noble purpose.
 
Plus, Google's motto is &quot;Don't be Evil&quot;.  That's got to count for
something... :-)

Far from a sinister force superimposing its malicious will, Google is
actively supporting open source development.
 
I understand that it's nice now, but what is Google's motivation? They are
owned by their shareholders, and those people are solely motivated by
profit.
 
I also note that 1. I cannot even see something on Moderator without
agreeing to the Terms; 2. the terms allow Google to censor as they please;
and 3. the terms can be modified at Google's whim and without notice to me,
and the moment I use their service after a change in terms, I have agreed to
that change.
 
Sure, I might just be paranoid, but what reason is there to trust a
for-profit corporation, especially when they have terms like that?
