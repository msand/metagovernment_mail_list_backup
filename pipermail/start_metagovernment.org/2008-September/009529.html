<PRE>Thanks for the well thought out reply, Mark. It helps clarify some  
things to me, and hopefully will help lead us to some sort of  
convergence.

(Some content snipped below. And possibly some weird formatting issues  
from my mail client... sorry.)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
If I understand correctly, this points out another difference. We're  
not trying to inform existing governance structures, but rather to  
completely replace them. Metagovernment envisions there being no other  
governance mechanism within any given community than the software  
within any given community.

Therefore a resolution which achieves a consensus score automatically  
becomes law (or policy, regulation, rule, or whatever term the  
relevant community uses). At that point, the threshold for breaking  
consensus is raised a little bit so that a law doesn't &quot;flap&quot; on and  
off as more people contribute.

&gt;<i> One difference is DemocracyLab segments content ratings into two  
</I>&gt;<i> pieces - Agreement and Importance.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Could you explain the importance aspect more? I think it might be  
simply unnecessary in the Metagovernment model because if something  
isn't important enough to a community, it may just get kicked down to  
a lower community. Our concept of a &quot;mesh of communities&quot; allows for  
different groups to focus on what they think is important.

An example would be to look at a city government, the park system  
within that city, a single park within that system, a community pool  
inside that park, a swim meet held at that pool, and a team competing  
in that meet. Each one is a community and each one would have an  
instance of Metascore to act as the governance mechanism of that  
community. Something which is important to the swim meet might be  
inconsequential to the city... issues will (presumably) flow to the  
community where they are relevant.

&gt;<i> Another is that the synthesis mechanism in DemocracyLab is a Link  
</I>&gt;<i> Rating.  Two Concepts can link to each other, and users rate the  
</I>&gt;<i> Link, deciding if they support/oppose each other, their degree of  
</I>&gt;<i> Relevance, or if they are Redundant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is that a point of difference? It sounds very much like our concept of  
a synthesis score.

&gt;<i> A final, significant difference is that DemocracyLab supports more  
</I>&gt;<i> distinct types of content.  MetaScore's Resolutions translate to  
</I>&gt;<i> Policies on DemocracyLab - specific plans of action to achieve a  
</I>&gt;<i> desired outcome.  DemocracyLab also supports statements of Positions  
</I>&gt;<i> and Values, believing Values lead to Positions which lead to  
</I>&gt;<i> Policies.  Our purpose in creating this data structure is to  
</I>&gt;<i> recognize different levels of thinking on issues, and to make it  
</I>&gt;<i> easier to identify points of consensus (e.g., it would be much  
</I>&gt;<i> easier to build consensus around the Value of Equality than around a  
</I>&gt;<i> Policy specifying a system of universal health care.)  Our hope is  
</I>&gt;<i> to create a map of political thought, identifying where consensus  
</I>&gt;<i> and disagreement exists, and to productively focus discussion at  
</I>&gt;<i> critical points of disagreement.  For a more detailed description of  
</I>&gt;<i> our planned implementation, click here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is what I meant by more structured... but it does seem like a  
somewhat minor difference; more of an additional layer of  
sophistication than a point of departure.

&gt;<i> What does all this mean?  I think it could be wise to consider  
</I>&gt;<i> opportunities for collaboration.  It seems serendipitous that our  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion of the Google Moderator led to discussion of the Google  
</I>&gt;<i> App Engine which led to Google's Project 10^100.  Perhaps we should  
</I>&gt;<i> consider a joint submission to Google's Project 10^100?  It seems  
</I>&gt;<i> that the much of the code for our two projects will be very similar,  
</I>&gt;<i> and that the two branches might be able to benefit from ideas of the  
</I>&gt;<i> other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think we're all in favor of whatever collaboration we can devise.  
The way I see it, this is not a competition between us... but I do see  
a potential for competition between open source and commercial  
implementations. MySpace is already trying to push into American  
politics, I think I heard Microsoft is devising software for  
governance of some kind. I shudder to think of what government-by- 
Microsoft would be like.

The closest point of convergence seems to be between DemocracyLab and  
Metascore. I'd like to hear the programmers' opinions on that,  
particularly Manuel and Aur. (In case it hasn't become clear before,  
we already have two rather different branches of Metascore.)

I think Metagovernment has a somewhat different course... first to be  
the testbed for any sort of governance software and later perhaps to  
be an actual meta-government. Again, we're looking to replace  
governments, and the Metagovernment, being controlled by all users of  
the internet, would be the logical choice for the government of  
governments.
