As they say in the world of mutual funds... Past performance is not an  
indicator of future performance. At any time, the board of directors  
can change the course of the company, especially if for any reason  
Google suddenly starts to experience financial hardship. The fact that  
they can change the terms of agreement at will and without notice  
means you are at the mercy of the shareholders, and those people's  
motivation is -- there's no better word for it -- all about greed.

Things are good with Google now, but I see no reason why that means  
they will always be so. People can earn my trust, but a corporation  
does not behave like a person.
