This seems a little harsh to me.  It is indeed true that Google is owned 
by shareholders, and that many of those folks are motivated by profit.  
OTOH, it's overstating the case, I believe, to assert that that means 
that Google's motivation for *everything* they do as a company is 
profit.  For example, Google allows it's employees to spend 20% of their 
time working on projects of their choice...for several reasons...but 
with one reason being that it tends to keep their most talented, smart, 
and creative people from getting bored with the company and leaving.  
And it's far from clear that in the case of Google Moderator (which was 
done by Google employees in this 20% time), that their motivation is to 
make money (that wasn't the stated motivation from Taliver as described here

</I>&gt;<i> Sure, I might just be paranoid, but what reason is there to trust a

</I>
Most for-profit large technology companies are very risk 
averse...because they frequently become the target of lawsuits for any 
service that can be imagined.  Of course I don't know the history in 
this specific case, but I would guess that google's legal department 
imposes such use agreements on all new services that are introduced.  In 
other words, although I share your distaste for such usage Terms, it may 
have less to do with this service and more to do with other things.  But 
it is something worth talking with them about IMHO (the license and use 
agreement).
