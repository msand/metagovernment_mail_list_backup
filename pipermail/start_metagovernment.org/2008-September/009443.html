<PRE>my compliments to you, Ed! i think going into Wiki was a brilliant idea. i 
visited this site prior to the wiki format, but was reluctant to contribute 
somehow. i guess it was because i didn't see apparent progress of the 
project. the new format helped me realize there's an actual development 
behind the scenes. then i decided to join the mailing list and now i regret i 
didn't do that before, but better late than never ...

meanwhile, i found some interesting stuff in Harry's article you pointed to 
some days ago. not that i learned the answer to the identity problem, but at 
least i can imagine it can be solved some way. hopefully, Harry will 
eventually find a little time and give a more detailed description of how it 
can be implemented at Metagovernment.

i'd also like to draw our attention back to the issue of elaborating an 
acceptable adoption procedure for resolutions, but not in this thread ...

Best regards,
rustahm
