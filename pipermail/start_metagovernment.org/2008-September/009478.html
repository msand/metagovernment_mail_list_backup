I'm sorry to see you go, and hope you will reconsider... if not now,  
maybe later. If this group is exclusionary, then it is doing something  
wrong. I would rather take our cue from the Quakers who, as I noted in  
my previous message, went out of their way to support a minority  
opinion in order to find a way to build consensus.

Anyway, if you don't come back, I'd like to suggest you look at the  
other projects in a similar vein to this one. Some of them may be more  
in line with the mechanisms you were looking for.

namely, DemocracyLab is similar but has more structure than us, and  
Free Government is a form of mixdemocracy, which I believe you were  
supporting. FWIW, both of them do have formal nonprofits (in the U.S.).
