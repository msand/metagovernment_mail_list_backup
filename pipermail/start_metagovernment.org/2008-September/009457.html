&gt;<i> 1- many times &quot;the majority&quot; adamantly support/oppose something, but

</I>
Agreed, the &quot;mob-rule&quot; argument is rather circular - an uninformed
populace has no incentive to become an informed populace, if the
information gained does not grant them a net positive.


&gt;<i> 2- many times the people cannot make up their mind on an issue which
</I>&gt;<i> needs immediate attention.  In order to safeguard against inaction,
</I>&gt;<i> there should be a representative democracy for those issues.
</I>
I kind of like Ed's argument here, in that the urgency of the matter
should act as an incentive to gain rapid consensus.

I have a problem with ambiguity - and here it's unclear how it would
be determined which issues are to be taken out of the hands of the
populace and control granted to a representative democracy. Especially
if it conflicts with #1


&gt;<i> 3- representatives are not necessarily knowledgeable on the subjects
</I>&gt;<i> they are voting on.  This can be changed by determining broad categories
</I>&gt;<i> for legislation and requiring representatives to be &quot;experts&quot; in one
</I>&gt;<i> specific field, for which they vote.
</I>
Who defines the &quot;experts&quot;, and which categories issues are placed in?
I'm not an expert in military intelligence, or foreign affairs... does
that mean I would not have a say on a matter such as going to war with
Iraq? And if I were an expert on those things, what is to stop someone
else placing the issue in the &quot;experts in pointless conflict&quot;
category?

Hindsight is 20/20, depending upon the freedom and lethargy of the
press. But say categories could be defined - perhaps dynamically
through tagging (energy, environment, education, etc) - then would it
not be preferable to weight users on both the votes they cast and the
accepted wisdom about the decision with the benefit of hindsight?

For example - if you voted to go to war with Iraq in 2003, and 80% of
the populace now believe that resolution should have never passed and
express their 'hindsight' vote accordingly - you would find your vote
to have less weight with regards the war with Iran resolution in 2008.

Although that would seem the fairest way to determine who is an expert
or not, that would also provide a clear disincentive for people to
change their minds on issues -- especially because if you decided that
war was wrong, you wouldn't want to limit your voting powers to
prevent war in the future.

So I think system-ordained &quot;experts&quot; is an unattainable, if not
undesirable, ideal -- I would expect leaders in various fields to
emerge naturally anyway, and if Cory Doctorow is arguing for a certain
change to a CC license definition, a lot of geeks would consider his
opinion and vote accordingly.

As Shirky points out - our brains are hardwired for a lot of group
functions naturally - the digital analogues can't compete.


&gt;<i> 4- People are different.  They have different ideas about what is good
</I>&gt;<i> and bad.  Attempting to homogenize everyone results in hatred and
</I>&gt;<i> dissatisfaction.  In order to prevent this, allow more efficacy for
</I>&gt;<i> smaller groups, have general &quot;broad strokes&quot; for the larger governing
</I>&gt;<i> body, but leave the details up to the smaller governing bodies.
</I>
Do you mean like a pyramid? With the populace at the bottom, voting on
issues which fioat up until it reaches a level
(local/county/state/regional/etc) which is able to enact that
resolution? Such that power comes from the bottom, and the higher
levels have higher levels of accountability, but less real power?


&gt;<i> A proposed issue is voted on directly by the citizens of the
</I>&gt;<i> region/state etc affected by it.  If they fail to reach a 3/5 majority
</I>&gt;<i> it is then passed on to their localities congress. The issue is
</I>&gt;<i> classified as 1 of 7 different categories (environment, economics,
</I>&gt;<i> education, healthcare, energy. social welfare, child welfare).  If it
</I>&gt;<i> can only be classified as 1 category, the representative who is an
</I>&gt;<i> expert in that field makes a decision.  If it can be classified as an
</I>&gt;<i> even number of categories and the representatives fail to reach a
</I>&gt;<i> majority decision then all 7 representatives will vote on it.
</I>
The concern I have with placing actual numbers or values, is that
while they may be totally bogus - people tend to get attached to them
and argue about the merits of -10/+10  vs  -5/+5  when neither may be
very good and the actual values could be better determined
scientifically through testing.

Of course, the numbers might be perfect the first time, but that seems
less likely to me.


&gt;<i> anyway, why am I sending this to everyone?  Well I do believe that an
</I>&gt;<i> absolute direct democracy is doomed to failure.  It relies too greatly
</I>&gt;<i> on the whims of the people...which are fickle at best.  It was tried by
</I>&gt;<i> the athenians way back when...and they executed socrates.   With every
</I>&gt;<i> fiber of my being I believe a synthesis of direct and representative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy to be the best possible choice for a new system and I think it
</I>&gt;<i> should be incorporated into metagovernment.
</I>
While I don't agree - convince me - I found it very interesting - thanks.

Richard
