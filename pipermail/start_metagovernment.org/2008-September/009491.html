I take exception to it being described as mine. The vision as it now  
stands is radically different from my original idea. At best, I'm  
chief cat-herder. :)

I think both branches of Metascore involve some really radical new  
thinking, and I'm not sure there is anything out there which comes  
close to their approach. Yes, we are way behind some more mature  
projects, but I still haven't seen something extant which can do what  
we want to achieve. If you can wait a little longer, Manuel's version  
of Metascore should be usable enough that we can try it out on  
ourselves, and I think we'll have a much better idea of what to do then.
