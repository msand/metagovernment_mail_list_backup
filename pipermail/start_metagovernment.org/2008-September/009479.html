So again, I would encourage everyone to help populate the wiki. You  
don't have to get it &quot;right.&quot; Just make a stab at it... that's the  
beauty of a wiki. Anything you add is a definite plus and a great boon  
to the project. So in the future, if someone asks something we've  
already covered, we can just point them to the appropriate page on the  
wiki.

I have toyed with the idea of suggesting that Metascore should be  
nothing but a rating system for users of bulletin boards. But I do  
like the directions the developers are taking it at the moment.

And while I agree that there is a lot of other stuff out there, I am  
not sure it is really the same. Much of it is commercial or otherwise  
not &quot;free software.&quot; And... is there any other software out there  
which aims to be a standalone governance mechanism? Based on consensus- 
through-syntheses? ;)
