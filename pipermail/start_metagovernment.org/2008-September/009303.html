Yeah, I guess I have to do more research before I go contacting big  
names like that. As I've noted before, my experience is in I.T., and  
in that realm &quot;open source&quot; has one distinct meaning: &quot;you pay in time  
instead of money.&quot; The whole concept of software freedom is pretty  
much lost on corporate operations folks, even in the non-profits I  
have worked for.

I think you're on to something there. After all, while a condo  
association or cycling club may use representative democracy to  
constitute their governance structure, most people do not think of  
democracy as anything but about political governments. &quot;Governance&quot;  
however, is generally understood to be about anything that needs  
organization.

(As a side-note, I also was thinking of changing
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2008-08">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Main_Page/2008-08</A>
so that every reference to a &quot;law&quot; is instead a &quot;policy.&quot; Again,  
policy is a more generic term which includes laws, but can also  
incorporate less formal governance mechanisms.)

How about something like &quot;participatory governance&quot; or &quot;collaborative  
governance?&quot; My biggest problem with those terms is the number of  
syllables. Fewer is always better when coining a term, but... they do  
seem to encapsulate what we are going for...

I don't much care for the following terms, but this is where I ended  
up when clicking around on Wikipedia:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_deliberation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_deliberation</A>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy</A>
