<PRE>I hope that I haven't accidentally criticized Manuel's work,
or inadvertently recommend that we push our accomplishments aside!
My intentions were to point out what resources we have available to fill in
some of the gaps -- especially where accessibility and sociability are
concerned. While I've commented elsewhere that I agree with your aversion to
using Corporate sponsored options, there are a number of open source Content
Management Systems to choose from.

As a Drupual fanboy I'll point out that numerous Civic Management
applications have been built on their platform, including DeanSpace,
CivicSpace, and CivicCRM (which is also available for Joomla.) We could also
look into enhancing our wiki installation with more social networking
plugins (or whatever they call their extensions).

Either way, we should find a solution that allows us to use Manuel's code to
help solve our issues with our direction and growth. I strongly believe that
plugging it in to a pre-existing solution will have a huge impact on the
success of our project.
