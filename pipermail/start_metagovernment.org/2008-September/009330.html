<PRE>I just had an Idea.
One of those basic ideas so obvious and easy that you wander how come
no one has thought about it before.

We have seen how a linear way of commenting to things, where each new
comment goes to the back (or start) of a list is essentially helping
to have a single discussion going on, but when there are too many
people commenting, makes it impossible for a real discussion to
happen, but just people all commenting back to the 'leader'.

If you look at the 1000 comments each post in beppegrillo.it has (in
the italian side) you get a glimpse of that.

Instead the tree discussion structure, a la livejournal, instead helps
threading, and the structure of sub-discussions. Especially if,like in
lj, when someone answers you, you get a nice email with a facility to
answer directly.

SO here is the idea,
what about a site, where the comments are shown in a tree like
structure, with karma, BUT when you answer you don't answer to the
single comment. Instead there is a tick box next to all the comments,
and you tick ALL the boxes you are answering to, and then at the end
there is an edit box with written:
Respond to THOSE comments.

Then your comment appears in all those branches at the same time. When
you tick it, to answer it, all the boxes oof all the instances of the
same comments get ticked.

I think such a simple yet effective structure might really help in
generating a commenting environment, where new ideas are discussed in
separate threads, and then re-inserted in the original thread of the
discussion.

Of course this would then not create a tree like strucutre, but a
graph like structure, so then it should be possible to see the
comments from the POV of a single comment, with all the comments that
responded to it on the right (tree style), and the ones that came
before on the left (tree style), and maybe some lines from the left to
the right for any comment on the right which also answered any other
comment on the left.

4.30 am.
I connected just to write this idea.
Good night, going back to sleep.
Pietro
