<PRE>I think your analogy works perfectly; however, in the United States, most of
us have resigned to the fact that we only have TWO stores to choose from
every FOUR years -- and every FOUR years we convince ourselves that
something will change -- and it DOES! Unfortunately, it simply changes over
into the hands of the Corporations (Big Oil, Big Pharma, Et al).

While there's more to be said on that subject, the Internet Banking
challenge is much more specific, providing users with the ability to manage
their bank accounts over the Internet (or the telephone, or through the
mail, or at a banking center). With these specific examples in mind, people
new to the concept of Open Government can imagine a website (or a telephone
call, snail mail communication, government center, et al) to manage their
civic account.

That said, I'm still unclear as to which piece of the puzzle Metagovernment
is looking to solve.
