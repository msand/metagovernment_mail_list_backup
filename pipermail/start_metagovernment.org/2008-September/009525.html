I wasn't aware you were with DemocracyLab. I would love to see us find  
a way to work together, and I'm very open to any suggestion that front.

However, it seems like we have parallel but decidedly different  
approaches, and I am not entirely sure how they would be blended. I  
admit I haven't had time to look at DL in depth, but my impression is  
that DL has more pre-determined structure while MG is more geared  
toward organically developed structures.

I think Manuel can weigh in on this better, but I wouldn't expect to  
hear much from him for another couple of days.

P.S. Nonetheless, your passive participation in the Dev list would be  
appreciated. ;)
