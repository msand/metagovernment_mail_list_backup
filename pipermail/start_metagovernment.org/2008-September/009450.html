RF: &quot;I looked, but I was unable to find a definition - do you have a 
source?&quot;

Yes: <A HREF="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commercial">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commercial</A>


RF: &quot;To be clear, I was talking about the text used in the wiki - the 
philosophies of Metagovernment - not Metascore itself.&quot;

That would get a bit complicated when you go into the philosophy.  As I 
see it Metagovernment is pretty much syncretistic (borrows ideas from 
different things).


RF: &quot;how is that not commercial use? E.g. if I have a popular blog 
funded entirely by adwords, and I use &quot;by-nc-sa&quot; pictures from Flickr.&quot;

Just using the images and having ads on the page does not necessarily 
mean it's commercial.  If the person was, however, releasing them for 
sale as stock photos, then that would be infringing on the licenses 
terms.  If the person used them in a banner ad for their site, then 
again it would be an infringement.  If however the person had a blog 
about flickr, and was using the photos to demonstrate what people 
upload, then it would fall under fair use.  If the person took those 
images, modified and redistributed them (assuming they clearly explained 
they were derivative works and linked to the original artist) that would 
be legal under those terms.

the bigger question I would have is...who owns the license to the text?  
I mean, metagovernment isn't a legal entity yet.  As it stands it is 
basically just Ed , since he started the website.  So right now it 
really just comes down to &quot;what would Ed do?&quot; in a situation.  I mean he 
could write a &quot;legal&quot; page outlining exactly what use he is allowing etc 
and wouldn't need any CCL or GPL.  Incidentally Ed, you should consider 
forming as a non-profit.  You could solicit donations, etc and it would 
give a decent structure to the whole organization.
