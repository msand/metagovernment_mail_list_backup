</I>Hi Richard,
thanks for answering, still I think what you suggest wouldn't work.
no one wants to be in a discussion list whose aim is to let people go
round and round in empty circles.

Plus I have seen Ed being concerned about the splitting of the
discussion through different medium.

But I liked his suggestion that new people should be invited to
summarise the old discussion on the wiki.
At least while we are in  a preprototype phase.

Pietro
