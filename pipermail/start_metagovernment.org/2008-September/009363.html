<PRE>I had the chance to see Ralph Nader speak in Cincinnati, OH, USA last night.
For those of you who aren't familiar with Ralph Nader, he's an Independent
who has run for President in every election since 1992. He has a long track
record of amazing accomplishments, from seat belt laws to the Freedom of
Information Act, and is considered to be a 'spoiler' as his base typically
draws support from the Democrats.

I told him about the Metagovernment project, along with the other Open
Source Governance projects that are popping up all around the globe, and
asked him what he thought of Open Government. He responded that he
considered himself an Open Source Candidate. This is certainly the case --
judging from his track record, but his comments seemed to focus more on the
idea of Open Source as opposed to any concrete form of Open Government.

Nevertheless, our discussion created a bunch of interest on the topic, and I
found myself talking to people until 1 o'clock in the morning about the
ideas of Open Government. I spoke with an open source developer who is
working on a Java CMS who seemed to almost get it -- though he felt that, at
most, the idea sounded a lot like what we're supposed to currently have in
the United States, and didn't see the merit in what we are doing.

What I gained most from the discussion was a better idea of what the people
were looking for in an Open Government scenario.

To illustrate my thoughts, I would pose a challenge to anyone who uses
Internet Banking to manage their accounts online: Sign out of your Internet
Bank and don't log on for FOUR YEARS. In addition, do not use the ATM or any
other form of electronic banking (credit cards included) for FOUR YEARS. And
finally, while emergencies may arise that require interaction with your
bank, limit yourselves to going into the bank no more more than ONCE PER
YEAR.

This is how frequently the majority of Americans take part in their
Democracy.

I believe this challenge shows exactly the kind of power and control that
extremely benefitial for personal banking -- but moreso, absolutley critical
for Open Government. Furthermore, I believe the analogy brings the idea of
Open Government down to the common folk, and highlights both the benefits
and the need quite succinctly. There's also more to be said on the User
Experience (from the perspective of Online Banking) in a separate post!
