<PRE>&gt;<i> He had passion, energy, was completely wrong-headed on some things..
</I>&gt;<i> but I thought he could be reasoned with. In other words - over time
</I>&gt;<i> his contribution would have been higher than the cost of accommodating
</I>&gt;<i> the debate.
</I>
Well after going over the discussion of the last few days, I think we did spend
some time accommodating debate and coming to consensus. A while ago I
did the same on the wiki but eventually didn't have the impression he was
willing to give the same effort as I was, so I stopped. He confirmed this to me,
by being unwilling to look through the archives (linked at the bottom of every
message and gmane just recently mentioned on the list).
As Ed suggested, we should try to transfer the essence of old discussions to
the wiki, since we can't expect the kind of investment Pietro made from every
new participant.

I'm not sure how much that would have helped in this situation though. I think
nicholas was after the dialog more than making an honest effort to participate
effectively. The thing is of course, even if his ideas were good, the
most important
resource of an open source project, is time and he was using far more of it than
I think we can afford at this point.

I don't think I treated him unfairly, and I don't freely &quot;label&quot;
people. I do say what
I think though. Early on, when we were discussing metascore with Aur, I may
have also been overly harsh, but ultimately I do think that the
approach he wants
to take is fundamentally better, I just don't think it's feasible at this time.

Hopefully with metascore we can handle this situation more gracefully
in the future.
