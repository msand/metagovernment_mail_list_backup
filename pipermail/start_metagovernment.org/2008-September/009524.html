<PRE>Hi Rob,

Agreed.  I don't think that scaling is the only important feature of the 
app engine.  It is a useful feature (value &gt; 0), but as a user/developer 
with it for a couple of months now there are clearly others:  1) 
easy/simple deploy/update and management of app; 2) good/solid APIs 
(that work reliably...at least so far); 3) the ability to 
use/collaborate other app engine-based stuff with little technical 
effort (e.g. Moderator...but that's not the only thing done on app 
engine that looks interesting/valuable).

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> creators...but that doesn't mean you design it to be used by 10 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people, does it?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, I want Metagovernment to succeed, but the aforementioned 99% of 
</I>&gt;<i> Google App Engine owners want them to succeed as well, but they won't.  
</I>
True, but I still don't understand...i.e. if your app succeeds (and not 
running on App Engine) then you will have to deal with a scaling 
problem...which may not be an easy thing to do.  OTOH, if you use App 
Engine you get scaling for free.  Still seems to me that having scaling 
(to support the %1 case :) is not a disadvantage.

&gt;<i> I'm just being realistic.  I'm involved (well, I write inane comments 
</I>&gt;<i> to the mailing list, if you can call that involvement) because it will 
</I>&gt;<i> be a learning experience, and I hope that out of it will come 
</I>&gt;<i> something, somewhere, somehow, that will accomplish our goals.  But it

</I>&gt;<i> the /process /is important.  We may never reach our goal, but we may 
</I>&gt;<i> clear a bit of the path that will allow someone else to reach our goal.
</I>
I agree that the process is important...but solving db scaling issues 
isn't an important learning experience for me.  What I mean by this 
is...figuring out how to build something that allows/encourages people 
to participate in policy creation/critique, building communities, having 
some sort of user-acceptable credibility/reputation system...these are 
all important potential learning experiences for what democracylab is 
trying to do.  But figuring out how to take a web-based application from 
one that doesn't scale to one that does is not a useful learning 
experience for us.  That is, as builder of a system I don't care *who* 
solves *that* problem, just that someone solves it...and hopefully it's 
not me :)...because I would like our process of 
developing/refining/updating the application to result in learning about 
the issues above...rather than scaling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Why sacrifice essential privacies and freedoms for a benefit we 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> don't know we need?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What essential privacies and freedoms are being sacrificed?  I don't 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see what is being sacrificed here.  Yes, Google has a use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> agreement...which is probably in place mostly to protect the company 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from lawsuits.  And yes they are a commercial entity...but you might 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> notice that (as an example), the Google Moderator app was created by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some Google employees in their 20% time...i.e. the time the company 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> gives its employees to use working on whatever they want.  And more 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than once they have deployed new technologies with little idea of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what/whether it would generate any revenue.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> TANSTAAFL.  
</I>
I think you are going to have to spell that acronym out for me please.

&gt;<i> Google does what they do because they think it will make them money.  
</I>&gt;<i> They are philanthropic now because they think philanthropy is 
</I>&gt;<i> profitable.  That may change.  They let their employees work on their 
</I>&gt;<i> own projects because they think those projects will be profitable (and 
</I>&gt;<i> if not, their employee's happiness is certainly profitable).  If 
</I>&gt;<i> anything becomes unprofitable, and does not look like it will become 
</I>&gt;<i> profitable in the future, rest assured it will be quickly killed.
</I>
Although I agree that most of what 'Google' does as a corporate entity 
is done to make them money, I think it's a little simplistic to assume 
that everything that is ever done by a company or its employees is done 
only because it makes them money.  Believe me, I'm no fan of 
corporations (particularly large tech companies ;), BUT I don't think 
it's usually as simple as you are implying here.


&gt;&gt;<i> Personally, I think this is way too paranoid.  There is no evidence 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that Google does this, or has any intention of doing it.  And 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually there's plenty of evidence of the opposite (i.e. that they 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> don't do it and have no intention of doing it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Google has built their entire industry on collecting information about 
</I>&gt;<i> people to sell as advertising.  Every search you type into Google is 
</I>&gt;<i> carefully collected and analyzed.  What makes you think they would 
</I>&gt;<i> treat our application data any differently?  Why else would they offer 
</I>&gt;<i> the App Engine service?  As someone else pointed out, it may not 
</I>&gt;<i> matter if they comb our data (because of the nature of the information 
</I>&gt;<i> we would collect), but then again it might.  Would you want to vote on 
</I>&gt;<i> something knowing that Google would have access to that vote, however 
</I>&gt;<i> it might be obfuscated?
</I>
I know how google makes it's money, and I understand the threat to 
privacy that you are describing...but I still think that to 
automatically assume that this means that google would, as part of their 
*service* to application creators, comb over *their users/customer's* 
data without any sort of permission seems to underestimate someone's 
intelligence.  That is, if Google plans on charging commercial app 
vendors to run their apps on app engine (which I think is plausible), 
then why would they scare away the people in that way?  And if they did 
that, it would indeed scare away any such business potential.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> All for $84 a year.  Money well spent, in my opinion.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, the 'freedom' to move the application to another host/hosts 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does have some value, but in my opinion you are overstating that 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> value, overstating what is given up by using the App Engine (i.e. the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> privacy concerns), and understating the value of scaling and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> admin/deploy support.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So I suppose my main point was that App Engine's chief benefit 
</I>&gt;<i> (scaling) is not an issue for us now and we have no idea when or even 
</I>&gt;<i> if it will become an issue.  With that in mind, if there are /any 
</I>&gt;<i> /privacy, security, or portability issues, however insignificant, why 
</I>&gt;<i> would we use App Engine when we could avoid all these concerns for the 
</I>&gt;<i> price of a family's night out at the movie theater?
</I>
1) I don't think scaling is necessarily the chief benefit (there are 
others as discussed above)
2) I still think that you are overestimating the privacy, security, and 
perhaps even portability issues. 

I'm not trying to say that I think everyone should use the Google App 
Engine...I agree that there are valid reasons not to use it (porting, 
and yes privacy/security concerns).  And it's certainly for you all to 
decide what makes sense for you/your org given the benefit and risks.

Scott
