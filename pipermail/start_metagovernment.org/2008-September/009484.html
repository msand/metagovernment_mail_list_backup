Mostly I try to attract programmers and/or other significant people in  
the field. For example, I recently contacted lowercased.org as they  
seem like another group we should be speaking with. In some cases such  
as theirs, I'd like to coordinate with them before we get too far  
apart, even if it does slow us down a little.

I will try to limit myself to only those sorts of contact, but there  
certainly are other people out there posting about us in many  
different venues. For example, I think recently we've been getting  
bounced around on Twitter, and a few weeks ago we were featured on  
StumbleUpon. This sort of thing is likely to continue. At this point,  
we have at least 100 people visiting our site each day, regardless of  
anything I may do.

&gt;<i> And I agree that we should be open, but there is a balance between
</I>&gt;<i> openness, and focus. We now need focus until we get some ground. Then
</I>&gt;<i> we can expand.
</I>
Point taken. But I would still like to recruit and encourage others to  
recruit programmers.
