</I>
To be clear, I was talking about the text used in the wiki - the
philosophies of Metagovernment - not Metascore itself.

The danger of a 3rd party modifying Metascore in closed form is an
antithesis to the principles of transparency - who could honestly
trust it? For that reason I think the GPL family would offer the best
potential protection for Metascore - purely to keep the source open,
rather than BSD which has allowed Apple to do who-knows-what. In
addition, I believe the GPL is most likely to withstand test-by-trial
if litigation ever became necessary.


&gt;<i> Ad-revenue does not equate to commercial use.
</I>&gt;<i> Commercial use means you are offering the work for sale, plain and
</I>&gt;<i> simple.
</I>
I looked, but I was unable to find a definition - do you have a source?

I thought there were some businesses who survive upon nothing but
ad-revenue - how is that not commercial use? E.g. if I have a popular
blog funded entirely by adwords, and I use &quot;by-nc-sa&quot; pictures from
Flickr.


&gt;<i>  In terms of content of the metagovernment website, regardless
</I>&gt;<i> of copyright, there is something called fair use
</I>
How does &quot;fair use&quot; apply across international copyright boundaries? I
think any potential obstacle which makes someone pause about whether
to incude some Metagovernment text, should have a clear reason for
being there. With the internet as it is now, it's really very hard to
plagiarise _anything_ - nevermind when Google Meme Search is released
- which is why I think even imposing the attribution license is
unnecessary.
