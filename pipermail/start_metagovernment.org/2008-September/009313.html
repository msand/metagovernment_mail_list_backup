Agreed on the second. A deeper study would be necessary to understand
how many people are just blindly scanning a page for keywords, and how
many read the whole damn thing, and then find out the keywords from
their understanding on the topic.

Still it 'seem' to me that if people did not like the word open in
this context it would have been used far less. But I admit it is a
sensation.

Regarding the first:
Experience with tagclouds showed me that even such a small sample is
quite representative of the population. I never have seen the first
tags be totally changed after 50 or 60 people. When it happened, it
was mostly because a new tag appeared, as a new concept was coined,
and was percolating through society.
For an example of this, please look at the entry on my blog:
<A HREF="http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/28/tagclouds-and-cultural-changes/">http://blog.pietrosperoni.it/2005/05/28/tagclouds-and-cultural-changes/</A>




&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I just asked my half-geek wife - &quot;What do you think of when I say:
</I>&gt;<i> open source governance?&quot; - response: &quot;anarchy!&quot; then after some
</I>&gt;<i> thought &quot;because that means that _anyone_ could have an input!!?!&quot;.
</I>
Did she say so with fear or with excitment? I can see people have both
feeling with exactly the same word expression :)

&gt;<i> Something then perhaps to avert fear?
</I>
This is what I mean when I say that I don't understand you at times.


avert |&#601;&#712;v&#601;&#720;t|
verb [ trans. ]
1 turn away (one's eyes or thoughts) : she averted her eyes during the
more violent scenes.
2 prevent or ward off (an undesirable occurrence) : talks failed to
avert a rail strike.
ORIGIN late Middle English (in the sense [divert or deter someone from
a place or a course of action] ): from Latin avertere, from ab- 'from'
+ vertere 'to turn' ; reinforced by Old French avertir.


&quot;Something to turn away fear.&quot;

What is something to turn away fear?
Is her response a way to avoid facing fear?
Is Anarchy a way to avert fear?

Could you please clarify?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Grassroots Governance? - Sounds so unlikely that it almost prompts the
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;how the heck would that ever work?&quot; question, at which point examples
</I>&gt;<i> could be cited.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Cheers,
Pietro
