<PRE>I set up an account on this website (<A HREF="http://themeforest.net">http://themeforest.net</A>) and in 
order to become an author, first you have to read about their policies 
etc, then they quiz you on it.  This got me to thinking about 
something.  People don't like to read things.  The average person makes 
assumptions about issues based on what the media etc tell them.  Few 
actually take time to research an issue and, once they've &quot;made up their 
mind&quot; based on these third parties, they can be quite stubborn regarding 
conflicting arguments.  With that in mind, how about making a quiz an 
aspect of a proposal?  In order to vote on something you need to 
demonstrate a basic competency regarding the issue at hand.  It may turn 
some people away from voting...but if they didn't really know what they 
were voting for in the first place...is that such a bad thing?  A 
question does come to mind though...who writes the quiz?  I mean 
obviously the person making the proposal is going to be biased and that 
could potentially come through in the quiz...thoughts?
