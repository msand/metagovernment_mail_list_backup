<PRE>when a license is non-commercial that means it cannot be resold. That 
means a 3rd party couldn't take metascore, claim it was their original 
work and sell it.  Ad-revenue does not equate to commercial use.  
Commercial use means you are offering the work for sale, plain and 
simple.  In terms of content of the metagovernment website, regardless 
of copyright, there is something called fair use 
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use</A>).  If someone were reporting on 
Metagovernment it would be completely legal for them to excerpt or 
reproduce content on the website for those purposes.  In regards to your 
comment &quot;not even the Creative Commons themselves can agree on the 
definition &quot;  That is because their license is applied to so many things 
that it's impossible to be specific without ruling out some of those 
applications.

so..to summarize
RE: the software.  It cannot be resold.  It can however be modified.  
But the modified version cannot be sold and it must be made clear that 
it's a derivative work
RE: the content of the website.  It's protected by international 
copyright law, however Fair Use will allow it to be reported on etc 
without requiring permission

it would be a very bad idea to release this as public domain.  It could 
be gobbled up by a big company and all the programmers working on it 
would not even be credited for their hard work.

The thing I don't like about the by-nc-sa CC license is the ambiguity
of what defines something as commercial or not. If a blog has adwords
- is that commercial usage, if it brings in $2/year in ad revenue? If
slashdot were to reprint the &quot;basic principles&quot; as part of an article
on Metagovernment, would they be in violation? To put a finer point on
it, not even the Creative Commons themselves can agree on the
definition:

<A HREF="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#Is_use_X_a_violation_of_the_Noncommercial_clause_of_the_licenses.3F">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FFAQ#Is_use_X_a_violation_of_the_Noncommercial_clause_of_the_licenses.3F</A>

I'd suggest something simpler like attribution, as that would seem to
serve the goals of Metagovernment of spreading awareness (back
linking), without restriction:
<A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</A>

Even the share-alike option raises problems:
<A HREF="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</A>

As technically incompatible with the GFDL, the &quot;basic principles&quot;
could not appear on a Wikipedia page about Metagovernment:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share-alike</A>

Ideally - I think public domain would serve best - as I don't believe
that the folks over at SupergovernmentPlus could 'borrow' significant
portions of the Metagovernment platform or philosophy without
voluntary attribution without being called out on it. Tangentially -
if they did, and if SuperScorePlus worked better than MetaScore, then
we should not stand in the way of progress -- but I admit that's a
hard-sell  :-)
