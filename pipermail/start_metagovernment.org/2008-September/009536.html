Thanks for your participation, Olaf. I hope Metascore can be of use to  
you in the future... As noted in a few other recent posts, our plan is  
to make Metascore available for small, non-governmental communities  
(such as our own) and then let it grow organically from there.

So in your case, for example, we wouldn't suggest that Metascore be  
used in the near future to run New York City (eventually, though).  
Rather, that you consider using it to run lowercase-d.

As people get used to using it, we expect that they will find it is  
much more productive, engaging, and inclusive than any representative  
democracy could hope to achieve.

To be clear, as I noted in the previous e-mail to this list, we are  
not advocating a traditional direct democracy. While we wish to enable  
all people to participate in all forms of governance, we do not  
advocate voting, majority rule, or other things normally associated  
with direct democracy. We are not simply trying to impose direct  
democracy on the status quo but rather to use the full power of Web  
2.0 systems to enable real citizen engagement in every community.
