Yeah, I apparently didn't do much of a search before opting for  
Metascore... it is an American registered trademark of Metacritic:
<A HREF="http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml">http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml</A>
(and note that their scoring system is worth looking at, as it seems  
interestingly complex).

I have thought about considering a name change, but (and I'm no  
lawyer) I am not sure it is necessary because:

1. We intend no profit from the name
2. We are not an American organization... or any organization, really :)
3. The terms apply to different markets (i.e., theirs is the name of a  
kind of score applied to rating media, while ours is the name of a  
website and software used for organizational governance)
4. They never bothered to register a metascore.anything domain name
5. They have never complained to us of infringement; while  
metascore.org has been active for over a year.

I am pretty sure I have seen other open source projects which more  
directly stomp on trademarks using only a non-commercial  
justification, though nothing comes to mind now that I try to recall  
(of course).

Still, if there is anyone with some lawerly background in the group,  
please do chime in with your thoughts. If we do find we have to change  
the name, sooner would be preferable to later.
