<PRE>Ok, I think we do agree.

But more than this, I think we should put a statement on the wiki,
we start with his request, a link to the discussion, and then a page
with OUR answer.

We could use this also as an experiment to see howmuch a wiki can be
used to write up a common answer, to something.
Each person who agrees with it, should sign it. (of course, last
person who signs is a rotten egg, :-D)

Each person who wants to modify it, does it. Changes it, adds parts,
and modifies it, until we have something which says all we agree on.
Not just that we shall continue to use it, but also our respect for
him, and his work, a welcome letter, an invitation to join us, and
why(!) do we feel that the word open better fits our work than the
word freedom.

I think by doing this excercise we also get a great chance to develop
a common voice. So I would invite you Ed *not* to answer him now, but
to write the first version of the letter on the wiki, which we all add
and modify.

Cheers,
