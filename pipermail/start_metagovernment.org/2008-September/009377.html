<PRE>Would a youth hostel be alright?

Are the conference organisers willing to pay anything?
Usually they are when they invite! The US is far away but an
invitation with no budget at all, is not much of an invitation.

I think if Manuel is willing to go to a YH (I go to YH, when I go to
conferences, and I bet I am older than Manuel :) ).
we might be able to raise the rest of the money between us.

And if this is the case we should start keeping transparent finances,
and a paypal button on the site.

But I am pretty sure that we should be able to get enough money from
the conference organizers for the train and an hostel.

Cheers,
Pietro
