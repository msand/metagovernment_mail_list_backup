I think they're saying &quot;commercial use&quot; is too legally ambiguous to do
anything about, therefore we're going to use the phrase as a
&quot;best-fit&quot; placeholder to guide your discretion, while reserving our
rights to exercise ours. Particularly telling is this line (emphasis
mine): &quot;We don't want to discourage you from putting the _occasional_
YouTube video in your blog ... even if you have general purpose ads&quot;

In the absence of a legally testable definition of &quot;commercial use&quot;, I
believe consideration would be given to how the phrase is commonly
used with regards the redistribution of digital content. Here -
revenue from ads is being used as a partial indicator, by one of the
heavyweights in the industry, without the commercial sale of any goods
containing the copyrighted content.


&gt;<i> RF: &quot;I didn't specify explicitly, but I was looking for a definition as
</I>&gt;<i> it relates to new media&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;new media&quot; is a phrase on par with &quot;web 2.0&quot;.
</I>
Agreed in the sense that perspective is difficult whilst in
transition, but within the next 10 years we'll likely have a much
tighter and widely-accepted definition for both.  Replace &quot;new media&quot;
with &quot;online digital content&quot; if that works better for now.


&gt;<i> In regards to the &quot;copy&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> (text) and &quot;media&quot; (photos) they'll be treated the same as they have
</I>&gt;<i> always been.
</I>
I disagree. The very existence of licenses such as the CC family
suggests that assertion to be false.


&gt;<i> Incidentally it comes down to this.  If we come across
</I>&gt;<i> someone using this stuff in a way we feel to be inappropriate, we'll
</I>&gt;<i> decide if we want to take action.  If so, we contact a lawyer who
</I>&gt;<i> decides whether we have a case or not, the lawyer sends a cease and
</I>&gt;<i> desist letter, if the person doesn't comply, then we go to court.
</I>
Why would we want to?

Ever?

It's just words and ideas which we want to spread as far and as freely
as possible.

In fact, the idea that a sub-group of Metagovernment could decide to
take that route at some time in the future is the best argument I've
seen to place the text under public domain - to preclude that very
possibility.


&gt;<i> None of this would dissuade a reporter/blogger from writing about
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.
</I>
In your opinion. In my opinion there is a small, but not non-existent, chance.

And what possible gain does holding a restrictive and ambiguous
license over the text grant us?
