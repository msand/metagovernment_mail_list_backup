<PRE>&gt;<i> His problem was with our use of the term &quot;open source governance.&quot;
</I>
I laughed when I read that. Really if you know anything about Stallman
that is exactly what you would expect. The term Open Source is mainly
for management and marketing people because it seems they can't wrap
there heads around the concept and ideology of free software. I'm
perfectly fine with them using that term because if we do this project
right, we won't have to deal with managers anymore =) Oh happy days.

It's also worth using a different term, because if we go to an
organization and tell them we're about &quot;Open Source Governance&quot; we
might be trying to explain the system in terms of another system that
they don't understand. Then again open source if fairly widespread
these days.

(I see Ed has also said this befor I hid send)

&gt;<i> So, even though Richard may have invented open-source, the
</I>&gt;<i> word has  come to mean different things than he intended.
</I>
Richard invented &quot;Free Software&quot;, I think he would be a bit offended
by that statement, and deny any association with the Open Source
movement.

I don't particularly like Electronic-Democracy, because it invokes the
idea of bringing the current system to a different platform, but we're
doing more than that. For me at least, E-Democracy is synonymous with
online voting, so I'm not fond of that term.

Governance should be a part of the term I think.
