Hi everyone, 

I just found this group very recently and started following the threads.  The idea of small networks is definitely something that needs to be included, as we need to have more connection with both our government and people on a local level. Otherwise we create separation, as well as people not feeling like their voice even matters and therefore don't want to contribute.  

I'm also wondering about how a system would play out, where the
&quot;respected&quot; people your system talks about, are people who have
completed many large scale social projects benefiting society, or have
proven themselves to be a trusted individual or made a significant
contribution to society. Then, even if they end up being a corrupted
individual, they have already given a lot to society and can be kicked
out when they do something corrupted. A win win situation if you ask me.   There's still the issue of propaganda though, as people with a lot of money can easily sway others to believe they are better than they are.

We (a group of social entrepreneurs) have also been creating a similar structure to metagovernment over at yesgood.org. It's based upon a collective democracy type system, focusing on very small networks, but with a different twist and solution to hierarchy and propaganda problems.  It makes a reverse system, where the smaller networks have more power and the upper network has very little power and does not need to make large scale decisions, but instead be used as a guide.  It's in the first draft phase, so be careful, but hopefully it can give some more ideas and yours can give us some ideas as well. I like the rating system created by this group!

Justin

</I>&gt;<i> I agree that imposing direct democracy on our current structures would

</I>&gt;<i> delineate. However, since we are taking a ground-up approach, it  
</I>&gt;<i> breaks this model. If you read the first month's discussions of this  
</I>&gt;<i> list, you'll see how we evolved the idea from a rigid hierarchy into a  
</I>&gt;<i> mesh of communities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is that nobody has to participate in anything, but people are  
</I>&gt;<i> very likely to want to participate in the communities they care about  
</I>&gt;<i> most. With a broad definition of community, it becomes readily  
</I>&gt;<i> apparent that each individual participates in perhaps hundreds of  
</I>&gt;<i> different communities... maybe even thousands. Walking into a street  
</I>&gt;<i> market or a public park is an act of participation in the community of  
</I>&gt;<i> that market or park.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So with all the myriad communities in one's life, one has to make  
</I>&gt;<i> choices about which of them one cares about. The beauty of having an  
</I>&gt;<i> instance of Metascore governing each community is that the moment you  
</I>&gt;<i> decide that a community's governance needs tweaking, you can jump in  
</I>&gt;<i> and propose your changes. The more involved you get in a community,  
</I>&gt;<i> the more people there will respect you and the more they trust you to  
</I>&gt;<i> make changes: you can't just jump in and immediately change everything.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This flexible system allows anyone to participate in any community's  
</I>&gt;<i> governance, but controls for mob rule. There is no &quot;mob&quot; because there  
</I>&gt;<i> are so many communities that people get spread out between them. Since  
</I>&gt;<i> there is no huge overarching central government, there is no real  
</I>&gt;<i> demagoguery... that is, there's no opportunity for leaders to sway  
</I>&gt;<i> huge groups into following one course of action, since there aren't  
</I>&gt;<i> really huge groups.
