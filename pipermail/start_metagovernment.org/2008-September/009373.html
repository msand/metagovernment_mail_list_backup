</I>I agree completely with this.  This invitation demonstrates that the 
time has come for us to have prepared material, ready to distribute when 
an opportunity like this appears.

Unfortunately I just moved from the UK to Canada last month, otherwise I 
certainly would offer to pay out of my own pocket for a chance to speak 
in front of such a crowd.  What an opportunity!

Anyways, even if there isn't an official &quot;Presentation Materials&quot; 
movement in Metagovernment (and there should be.  Effective 
communication is the most important thing we can do), I think it would 
be good for anyone who does give a speech to post the full text in the 
wiki, allowing us to adjust, improve, expand, simplify, and hone what 
has gone before.

I will donate $100 USD if that would help Ed get to Prague.  Let me know 
how/where/if to send the money.

Kind regards,
Robert Peters
