Well, I would be happy to...if democracy lab and metascore work together

Parts of it are, parts of it are not...so the question of 'is it 
portable to non-Google servers' is actually a question of 'how much 
effort/time/money' would it take to do so?  What I mean by this is that 
the app engine uses python (which is portable/implemented on multiple 
environments), and it uses several libraries...e.g. parts of Django, a 
webapp framework, and a db framework, etc.  Several of these frameworks 
(e.g. db) is unique to Google's app engine (currently).  So if another 
framework was to be used (e.g. Django's db framework) it would mean some 
amount of work to change it over.  In the case of Django's db I don't 
think the work to do so is huge, but I wouldn't call it trivial either.

&gt;<i> If not, I have trouble seeing how we could let ourselves get stuck

</I>
As discussed above, this is a matter of degree (whether it can be ported).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And in any case, is this relevant? Aur's branch doesn't really use any

</I>&gt;<i> Django. Is there any reason why Manuel's code should be ported?
</I>
I suppose it depends upon whether there is any value to you in being 
able to 1) use a free, scalable service; 2) get support for APIs, 
libraries, dev tools, etc; 3) get free administration and monitoring; 4) 
work with/collaborate with folks doing other app engine-based OS stuff 
rather than going it alone (e.g. Moderator...perhaps...but obviously 
other things...like democracy lab and others).

Regards,

Scott
