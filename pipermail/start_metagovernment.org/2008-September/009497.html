I wonder how hard it would be to get access to the source code for
&quot;Moderator&quot; - from playing around a little with the Google Application
Engine, the requirement for a Google Account seems arbitrary (all you
get from the user class after authentication is a 'nickname' and email
address), so it should be easily augmented with OpenID or any other
authentication mechanism.

I second the ease-of-use argument.

With regards the concern of Google holding the data - it's not a
concern with regards control:
1) A few lines of python is all it takes to export all the datastores
2) The SDK comes with a fully functioning web-server which implements
locally the server-side magic of GAE. It's not currently recommended
for external usage - it's not been security hardened - but if Google
ever pulled the plug the community would very quickly be able to
supply a replacement.

With this in mind the risks of using GAE seem pretty minimal.


&gt;<i> Alternatively, there's been some conversation about
</I>&gt;<i> pooling resources, which could be an idea worth exploring.
</I>
Do you have any thoughts with regards what license pooled resources
should go under?

CCZero seems the most flexible and hassle free, and has one minor
political/awareness advantage that there would be some free exposure:
<A HREF="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_Implementations">http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_Implementations</A>

CC-BY and CC-BY-SA seem the most likely to gain consensus simply due
to their popularity, although I haven't seen any arguments against the
assertion that the attribution and integrity clauses don't buy us
anything. E.g. if Microsoft launch MSGovernmentLive.Net, based off our
pooled resources without voluntary attribution - that's the basis of a
few indignant slashdot/mother jones/etc stories right there - seems
like free advertising ;-)
