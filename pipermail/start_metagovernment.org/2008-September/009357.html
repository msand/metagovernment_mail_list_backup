Interesting idea.
It reminds me of a joke (ignore this mail if you have no time),
some years ago there was some complicated referendum in Italy,
people had to say their position on 6 very complex topic ranging from
agricultural laws, to laws concerning occupations when a person sued
their company, and so on.

A newspaper came out with the following title:
&quot;panic in Italy,
the prime minister called for an oral examination after the written test.
He declared: it is necessary to make sure people know what they are voting on.&quot;

Until reading your email I thought it was always going to be a joke :)

Sorry for the loss of time. :-D

Pietro
