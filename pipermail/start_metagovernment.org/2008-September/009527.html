Although this is obviously just my opinion, this doesn't seem accurate 
to me (about DL anyway).  An important focus of DL (as I understand it 
anyway) is to create a system that is usable and used by the public to 
evaluate and create policy.  The emphasis is certainly on the creation 
of policy by users.  Open participation, and actual contribution by 
many/public are crucial.  At least to me, that seems quite 'organic'.

OK.
