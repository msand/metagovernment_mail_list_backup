I like the phrase &quot;Open Government&quot; too. My only criticism of it (as a
title) is that it perhaps doesn't differentiate itself enough from
what we have now. I can imagine the following conversation:

&quot;Have you heard of Open Government? It's a form of Government where
anyone can participate.&quot;
&quot;Like what we have now? I could run for office tomorrow!&quot;

RMS's idea of working the concept of mass participation into the title
somehow I think is quite insightful.

Well, for over 25 years RMS has been an activist - and activists don't
generally play well with others - that's the point. Personally I think
he's earned the benefit of the doubt, having been right more often
than wrong. I see the challenge of Metagovernment to fly this meme,
not with the least amount of friction, but with the friction that is
chosen specifically to benefit the cause.

If you think RMS is extreme, then you haven't - yet - met his fanbase :-)
