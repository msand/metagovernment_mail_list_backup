<PRE>ning is a free service.  The reason they can offer it for free is 
because they put ads on your pages.  To get rid of the ads you have to 
pay them,  Alternatively you could host a forum on your own 
server...assuming you have one or are willing to pay $5+ a month for 
space on someone elses w/ support for the php and mysql databases needed 
for something like that. log into the master account and go through the 
manage tab and you can get all this pricing info yourself.  More so, you 
can change ALL of it.  Through the master account you can designate 
others as admins and switch it from the hushmail acct to another acct.

in terms of closing down, to develop the software.  If you are going by 
the philosophy ed mentioned... i.e. &quot;make the software, implement it, 
change it as needed when philosophy changes&quot; then closing down, or 
seperating the software project from the governance would be a good idea.

on a related note...I'm going to delete myself from the list-server and 
if possible the wiki. 
It's become very obvious that I'm not a good fit for this group.   I 
wish you all the best of luck with this and all of your projects.

While the risk is small, I don't think the passwords should be public
- seems too easy to turn it into a spam venue. Also - adsense? Whose
google account is that attached to?
