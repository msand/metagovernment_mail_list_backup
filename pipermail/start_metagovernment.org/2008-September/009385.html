<PRE>I like your edits, Manuel, and the change in tone. The original was  
written as a legal document, to be the formal charter of the  
Metagovernment. At this point, your tone (informally inviting people  
to participate in our startup community) seems to make more sense.  
I've made mostly copy edits in reply.

Anyone else? Even if all you have to say is, &quot;looks good, no changes,&quot;  
that would be appreciated. I'd like us to have more input before  
making such a major change to our primary page.

Thanks.
