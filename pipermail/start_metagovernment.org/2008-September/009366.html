<PRE>First, I'm really sorry for my English :-)

Maybe it can be compared to &quot;Free market&quot;: in the free market everybody have
the right to sell and buy things, anytime.
Why in politics it should be different ?
If the market would work the same way as the current political system, we,
as consumers would have the right to choose only from which store we would
buy for the next 4 years. And for 4 years we will not be able to buy from
any other store. and even inside the store, the store manager will decide
what he sells to the customers.
No one will be granted to open any other store, if someone thinks he can
provide better store, he can only tell about it, and wait for the next
&quot;Stores Elections&quot;.
