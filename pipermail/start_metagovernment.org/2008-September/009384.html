<PRE>Ok, I've done some editing on the page. You could say that I dumbed it
down, but I'd like to think that I made it more concise and to the
point, which is important, since this is the first thing that people
read about the project. We have about 5 minutes when a person comes
across the project, by that time they will have determined for
themselves if they are willing to invest more time and I don't think
that formulations like &quot;governance mechanism which determines the
development and constitution of [[Metascore]]: the software being
developed to implement and manage community-based open source
governance systems.&quot; are particularly helpful.

Please somebody go over it again, I don't have more time right now.
But please think of the reader: Be clear and consise and please dear
god don't use passive form; we're trying to engage them, not state
facts.

Every minute invested here may translate to hours gained through a new
participant.
