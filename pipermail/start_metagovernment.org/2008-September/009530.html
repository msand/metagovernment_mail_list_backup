<PRE>&gt;<i> One difference is DemocracyLab segments content ratings into two
</I>&gt;<i> pieces - Agreement and Importance.
</I>
There does seem to be allot of overlap. When thinking about scoring I
also thought it would be important to be able to distinguish, between
how important you thing a resolution is even when you don't agree
entirely with it its current form. I'm still not sure how the scoring
will be implemented and that is an aspect we will probably want to
experiment with.

&gt;<i> A final, significant difference is that DemocracyLab supports more distinct types
</I>&gt;<i> of content.  MetaScore's Resolutions translate to Policies on DemocracyLab -
</I>
I also don't see the differentiation between content types as all to
important. Basically a resolution is just a file in the repository,
and it can be anything you want it to be, just like an article in a
wiki. Of course if it should be considered law, it has to follow a
certain format, but otherwise there are no limitations.

Organization of the content will revolve largely around tags and
links, and otherwise there are allot of concepts that seem to be
overlapping. The main difference I see at the moment, is that I would
like to give people a web interface for editing a repository, similar
to a wiki and the concept of code review, a nice example of which you
can find here:
<A HREF="http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter01/">http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/chapter01/</A>

Each &quot;comment&quot; will actually be a message, to a specific part of a
file in the repository.

I'm not sure about the explicit rating of links anymore, it seems like
something people would ignore. I'd rather do that indirectly, by
registering how often a link is used, otherwise it might just end up
like using tags for messages, in that people don't see a reason to use
them.

Is there any code I can take a look at?

&gt;<i> Perhaps we should consider a joint submission to Google's Project 10^100?
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that the much of the code for our two projects will be very similar,
</I>&gt;<i> and that the two branches might be able to benefit from ideas of the other.
</I>
Please feel free to edit the proposal, in our wiki
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Project_Googol">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Project_Googol</A>

I do think though, that having many proposals, even if they are fairly
similar could be a way to get around the word limit and give the
judges a better idea of different aspects of the projects, as well as
a better sense of its importance to allot of people. At least one well
written proposal is of course also a good thing.
