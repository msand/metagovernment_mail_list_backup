Interesting demo! I don't see &quot;lack of subtlety&quot; as a major stumbling
block personally, as I assume that the voter votes as a service to the
community, not as an act of personalised self-expression -- the
community has much more use for a yes/no than a maybe.

In traditional paper-based politics where it can take weeks to redraft
legislation, the maybe/present vote can have statistical significance
(perhaps giving incentive for those drafting the legislation to seek
out how to turn the maybe's into yes's) - but that argument drops away
when you take things online, and the cost of redrafting isn't so high.
