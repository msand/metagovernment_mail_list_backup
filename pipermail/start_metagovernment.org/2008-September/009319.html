&gt;<i> I like the phrase &quot;Open Government&quot; too. My only criticism of it (as a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Have you heard of Open Government? It's a form of Government where
</I>&gt;<i> anyone can participate.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Like what we have now? I could run for office tomorrow!&quot;
</I>
If we are leaning toward this phraseology, I would prefer &quot;open  
governance&quot; to &quot;open government.&quot; The latter, as you say, implies  
openness in existing governments. In fact, that is what  
opengovernment.org seems to be about:
<A HREF="http://opengovernment.org/">http://opengovernment.org/</A>
While, as noted previously, &quot;governance&quot; more broadly encompasses any  
sort of organizational management.

And also, to be clear, I think the term Metagovernment is still  
central to the project, and may become a sort of brand name in itself.  
Though really, the intention of Metagovernment is to be the government  
of governments: i.e., the regulating body of Metascore. The philosophy  
itself still needs a definite name.

&gt;<i> RMS's idea of working the concept of mass participation into the title
</I>&gt;<i> somehow I think is quite insightful.
</I>
Then I'll repeat my suggestions of &quot;participatory governance&quot; and  
&quot;collaborative governance.&quot; They do seem to very clearly get across  
what we are getting at. Though I think &quot;open governance&quot; does as well.

Since this is such a diverse international group, can I ask the  
speakers of other languages how these terms feel when translated from  
English? Unfortunately, I don't think we have any Asian-language  
speakers, but I'd be interested to see what you speakers of romance,  
germanic, and slavic languages have to say...
