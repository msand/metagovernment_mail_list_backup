<PRE>This is gonna be kinda long....Sorry.


In response to Ed.-------------

Ed: &quot;The more involved you get in a community,  the more people there 
will respect you and the more they trust you to  make changes: you can't 
just jump in and immediately change everything.&quot;

This is a double edged sword.  If respect, success and trust were 
obtained based on honesty, integrity and intelligence then this would be 
a wonderful world.  Unfortunately most people make decisions based on 
arbitrary inferences.  Let's look to advertising as an example.  A key 
element of advertising is the &quot;affirmation of a lfestyle&quot;, basically 
this means you show a particular way of life as being &quot;normal&quot; or 
&quot;positive&quot;.  This is designed to make people living that lifestyle 
relate to the characters portrayed in the ad, and feel good about 
themselves based on this positive reinforcement.  Through transference 
the viewers apply and associate these positive feelings with the 
company.  Now apply this to a discussion.  People will let bits and 
pieces of information about their lives, slip through when commenting in 
forums etc.  This can be used to infer the lifestyle of that person.  
i.e. a comment like this;  &quot;my partner and I have decided to stop buying 
dog food from china because we'd never want to hurt our toy terrier 
Princess Henrietta&quot;, divulges a great deal of information about the 
commenter.  We can determine that A) they are homosexual based on the 
&quot;partner&quot; reference. B) They probably anthropomorphize their pet based 
on it's name and the fact that it's a smaller animal.  C) The previous 
observations can draw the assumption that the commenter is male as, 
stereotypically (and we all think in stereotypes) homosexual males are 
more likely to have a small anthropomorphized dog than are homosexual 
females.  Now if you were a homosexual male with a small dog, you could 
then potentially start applying assumed attributes to this commenter 
based on your own beliefs/observations about yourself.  You may think 
religious thinking is a boon to society since you are oppressed by it, 
you may then apply this thought to them as well, you may think southern 
states are a bunch of bigots because of other stereotypes and you may 
then transfer these thoughts to the commenter. 

It seems insane that mankind works this way, but almost all evidence 
shows that we do.  The major problem resulting from this is that ideas 
are then judged by the person suggesting them rather than the validity 
of their idea.  People who are known to be &quot;different&quot; will have their 
ideas ignored while people who are deemed &quot;popular&quot; will be regarded 
with great esteem. 


Ed: &quot; If you read the first month's discussions of this  list, you'll 
see how we evolved the idea from a rigid hierarchy into a  mesh of 
communities.&quot;

I have no idea where to find that.  Have you considered making a forum 
for discussions? That way people could go through everything without 
having to re-argue points which it seems is happening now.


Ed: &quot;one has to make choices about which of them one cares about.&quot;

I really do think that's a good idea.  It does apply to human behavior 
well...in fact I assumed that was how it would work with 
symetrism....that people would only vote on issues they cared about.


Ed: &quot;Since  there is no huge overarching central government, there is no 
real  demagoguery&quot;

This is another double edged sword.  I think a central government is 
necessary for certain things.  For example; basic human rights.   Take 
away an enforcer to ensure these are upheld will result in some areas 
resorting to barbarism.  Look at hate groups.  What's to stop a neo-nazi 
party from moving every neo-nazi to a state/region etc , overpopulating 
it and instituting ethnic cleansing without a central government?

In response to Richard-----------------

RF: &quot;I have a problem with ambiguity - and here it's unclear how it 
would be determined which issues are to be taken out of the hands of the 
populace and control granted to a representative democracy. Especially 
if it conflicts with #1&quot;

you make a good point.  Overall I had assumed the 3/5 majority would be 
the deciding factor.  Most scenarios (such as those that would be 
handled by FEMA) would be handled by a group similar to FEMA.  I'm 
having trouble imagining an event which would need immediate action but 
wouldn't have an organization for it. i.e. military aggression between 2 
states would be handled by a regional military leader (see: 
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Symetrist">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/User:Symetrist</A> for tiers) etc.  If a 
situation did come up...to paraphrase ed;  urgency would dictate an 
urgent response.

RF: &quot;Who defines the &quot;experts&quot;, and which categories issues are placed in?&quot;

Well as I said I was just giving the basic idea..not the minute details, 
but... I envisioned something like a review board of academicians (like 
the Bar association etc). would be tasked with determining what basic 
knowledge of a subject would be sufficient as a prerequisite for 
office.  In terms of classifying proposals...it gets a bit complicated.  
I understand england has a rule that proposed legislation has to 
summarize everything in the proposal in it's title.  In the U.S. when a 
corporation prints it's IPO (initial public offering) they have to 
disclose risk, failure to disclose potential risk is a crime.  I would 
imagine something along those lines.  i.e. it becomes law that all 
foreseeable repercussions must be detailed in the proposal.  Perhaps the 
review board could examine the proposals to ensure they disclosed 
everything and are classified correctly.

In response to Shook----------------

SS: &quot;Me too think that &quot;Pure&quot; Direct democracy is not practical, and 
Delegated voting/Liquid Democracy can be a better solution, as long as 
anyone can vote by himself when he prefers.&quot;

There was a political party that did exactly that.  I was trying to find 
a link for you but can't seem to find it.  They were called something 
along the lines of &quot;the open source party&quot; or something along those 
lines.  The way they worked was that upon registering you pick an 
&quot;advocate&quot;.  The advocate votes on all issues for you automatically.  
You can then go and change your vote if you disagree with their choice.  
It was an intersting concept, but not too many people seemed very 
&quot;supportive&quot; of it (myself included) so I stopped visiting their project.
