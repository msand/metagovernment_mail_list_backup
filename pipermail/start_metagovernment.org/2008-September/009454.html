<PRE>as I stated on my user page I have been working on something called 
symetrism for the past 7 (almost 8) years.  I really think some of it 
can be applied to metagovernment and so I will give you the basic ideas 
behind it.

1- many times &quot;the majority&quot; adamantly support/oppose something, but 
their representatives vote against/for it.  Because of this the people 
should have a direct vote on the issues at hand.

2- many times the people cannot make up their mind on an issue which 
needs immediate attention.  In order to safeguard against inaction, 
there should be a representative democracy for those issues.

3- representatives are not necessarily knowledgeable on the subjects 
they are voting on.  This can be changed by determining broad categories 
for legislation and requiring representatives to be &quot;experts&quot; in one 
specific field, for which they vote. 

4- People are different.  They have different ideas about what is good 
and bad.  Attempting to homogenize everyone results in hatred and 
dissatisfaction.  In order to prevent this, allow more efficacy for 
smaller groups, have general &quot;broad strokes&quot; for the larger governing 
body, but leave the details up to the smaller governing bodies.

Since it's inception it has become much more detailed. but those were 
the basic ideas. I built around that by borrowing aspects of different 
forms of governance and came up with this:

A proposed issue is voted on directly by the citizens of the 
region/state etc affected by it.  If they fail to reach a 3/5 majority 
it is then passed on to their localities congress. The issue is 
classified as 1 of 7 different categories (environment, economics, 
education, healthcare, energy. social welfare, child welfare).  If it 
can only be classified as 1 category, the representative who is an 
expert in that field makes a decision.  If it can be classified as an 
even number of categories and the representatives fail to reach a 
majority decision then all 7 representatives will vote on it.

I came across a book a while ago, I can't remember who wrote it or what 
it was called, but the author proposed something like synthesis scoring 
for potential candidates.  You can score candidated between -10 and 10, 
which ensures the candidate with the most support wins instead 
of...say...some people voting for ralph nader and some people voting for 
al gore and Georger W. Bush winning, even though Gore or Nader would 
have been acceptable to the majority.  So I think that may be a better 
way to do that, than my first idea (anonymous candidates because people 
have been proven to vote based on appearance and not on fact).

anyway, why am I sending this to everyone?  Well I do believe that an 
absolute direct democracy is doomed to failure.  It relies too greatly 
on the whims of the people...which are fickle at best.  It was tried by 
the athenians way back when...and they executed socrates.   With every 
fiber of my being I believe a synthesis of direct and representative 
democracy to be the best possible choice for a new system and I think it 
should be incorporated into metagovernment.
