Is that a problem though? I mean, if a message is too short (which
usually, but not always) implies that it is low on useful content,
then in most cases you wouldn't want to tag useless content anyway?
Death by obscurity?

Agreed - I did change my mind a bit while writing that response, but
kept the thought-processes in as I thought it summarised a few
different approaches.

On a conceptual level tags are meta in relation to content (individual
posts), in a pre-tag era we were, as you say, limited to linear 2
dimensional discussions which fit the static html structure very well.
But assuming a post to a thread (&quot;weave&quot; would be more appropriate?)
is not always a reply to a single post, but drawing upon several
concurrent ideas expressed within the weave, then the very concept of
a &quot;reply&quot; is maybe something that we should not feel tied to?

But I think I've accidentally mixed up two distinct concepts of
deriving structure:
1) The idea of a 'child' post having multiple parents
2) The idea that there may be references to previous posts, but that
the structure is derived from the tags themselves

For #1, perhaps the authors (and all interested parties) of the posts
which are being tied together in one response could have an option to
express &quot;this response is not relevant&quot;.
