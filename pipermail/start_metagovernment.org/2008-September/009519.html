What we're talking about here is only the text on the website, not the  
actual software. So to some extent, it may not be extremely important.  
However, some of the ideas we have come up with are very valuable. The  
elegance of the scoring system we have been devising is something that  
can be applied to all kinds of software.

The advantage of attribution is simply that it helps bring publicity  
to the project. The advantage of share-alike is that it is &quot;viral  
goodness.&quot; It makes people who copy us follow, to some extent, our  
principles.

Additionally, both concepts together may make people a little more  
likely to contribute ideas, if they know that their thoughts can't  
necessarily be wholesale stolen by some for-profit company.

But again, since this is only the web text we're talking about, I  
don't know how much it matters (to some extent I'm just trying to play  
devil's advocate above). We're not patenting the scoring system and  
the software itself will have its own license, which I believe is viral.
