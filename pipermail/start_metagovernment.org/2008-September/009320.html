<PRE>&gt;<i> And also, to be clear, I think the term Metagovernment is still
</I>&gt;<i> central to the project, and may become a sort of brand name in itself.
</I>
Speaking of brand names, I think metascore is already used by some
other company. We may have to change that, though I'm not sure they
have a trademark.

&gt;<i> Since this is such a diverse international group, can I ask the
</I>&gt;<i> speakers of other languages how these terms feel when translated from
</I>
Since the term open source is also used internationally, open would be
more recognized. Though you'd still have to translate governance.
German in particular doesn't have a very good translation for that.
The closest is &quot;Regierung&quot; which I would translate back as &quot;rule&quot;, to
which it is closer. I guess &quot;F&#252;hrung&quot; is a bit closer in that sense,
translated back it means &quot;leadership&quot;, so it implies, that there are
leaders and those who are lead.

Most of the times I've explained metagovernment, it was in the context
of government and open source, which seemed to work fairly well. I
guess I'll try it out on somebody not so familiar with open source and
see if there's something that brings expresses the idea better.
