<PRE>&gt;<i>I think more examples would help. E.g. the sorts of resolutions that
</I>&gt;<i>MetaScore would be dealing with, especially showing how synthesis
</I>&gt;<i>resolutions are created and how the scoring cascades.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>I was thinking of 'borrowing' from the examples DemocracyLab already
</I>&gt;<i>have, or creating a shared pool, but they don't appear to be under any
</I>&gt;<i>CC or GFDL type license.

You're welcome to borrow anything you like from the demos we've put
together.  We haven't gotten around to licensing them yet, mostly because
until now there wasn't anyone else who wanted to use them.  We're starting
to address the questions of which open source license to use, as well as the
terms of use for users of the prototype application.

We're very open to collaborating, so if there's something you'd like to use,
let me know and we'll figure out the best way to make it work.

Mark
