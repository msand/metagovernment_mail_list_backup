This project is attempting to create software which can act as the  
sole mechanism of government. That is, there are to be no executive or  
legislative powers other than those embodied in the software.

We are not entirely sure how it will work in the real world. We intend  
to release the software into small, non-governmental communities  
(including our own) to use as their governance mechanism. As it  
matures, we expect that it will get implemented more broadly, and that  
eventually it may begin replacing existing political governmental  
mechanisms (through peaceful, lawful changes in government).

&gt;<i> Am I right (judjing by the first paragraph on the first page) that  
</I>&gt;<i> you are against direct democracy, i.e. approving by a majority vote  
</I>&gt;<i> of all decisions concerning the whole society?
</I>
Correct, we are advocating consensus, not mere majority rule. If a  
community can't come to consensus on an issue, then they shouldn't  
have a law on that issue. However, a smaller community, a subset of  
the larger one perhaps, may be able to come to consensus and make a  
law within their community.
