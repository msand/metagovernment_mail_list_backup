i think the difference between us is that you see things through the 
perspective of &quot;truthiness&quot;, whereas i do so through the perspective 
of &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot;. nonetheless, this shouldn't depreciate the 
fact that we're both happy with the result. you say: true, i say: agreed :-)

</I>
yes, i also like the idea behind Spencer's phrase &quot;survival of the 
fittest&quot; :-)

&gt;<i> So while the &quot;truthiness&quot; environment doesn't care if we find it or
</I>&gt;<i> not, the fact that we can discern some things to be more truthy than
</I>&gt;<i> others leads me to believe that we can use that principle of emergence
</I>&gt;<i> to our advantage by creating a system that rewards (even if it is only
</I>&gt;<i> very slightly at first) truthiness over untruthiness.
</I>
i don't think we can discern anything to be more or less true. different 
opinions/theories make one and the same thing be either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, 
either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. again from my perspective, a system should 
produce &quot;agreement&quot; or &quot;consensus&quot;. once it has been reached, you can call 
it &quot;truth&quot;, but participants from other systems may disagree with you.

&gt;<i> Of course, if you get the reward balance the wrong way, you end up
</I>&gt;<i> with Fox News, but that's another story - caring about truthiness has
</I>&gt;<i> to be a factor.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Richard
</I>
and what's wrong with Fox News? do you mean this:
