<PRE>Well it's certainly questionable, to put that much sensitive
information of so many people, in the hands of one company. But as far
as I can see, they're a bunch of academics and programmers, who have
found a way to make money. If anybody should have that kind of power,
it should probably be them. The question is then should anybody?

They have great hardware and the app engine is a wonderful opportunity
to get access to that infrastructure. As a programmer I have little
interest in administration, so what they're offering is wonderful. To
really be able to commit to that platform, it would help if there were
an alternative open source implementation of the platform. Also we
can't force the decision of using one companies services, on everybody
wanting to use metascore, so that isn't really an option yet.

As to project googol, if they're willing to finance us and don't
compromise our goals, I don't care who gives us the money.
