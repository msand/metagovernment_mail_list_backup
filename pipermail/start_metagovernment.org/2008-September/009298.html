<PRE>I have been having an e-mail conversation with Richard Stallman, an  
architect of the GNU project, the GPL, and the free software  
movement... and I was surprised that his initial reaction to us was  
rather negative. His problem was with our use of the term &quot;open source  
governance.&quot;

Personally, I have not been a big fan of the term, since it seems like  
a poorly constructed neologism... legal code isn't really source code.  
But his opposition was rooted in the history of the term (in which he  
was personally, centrally involved); something which I have just  
recently been learning about. In a nutshell, he says that the term  
&quot;open source&quot; was coined explicitly to de-emphasize the concept of  
freedom in the free software movement (noting that &quot;free software&quot;  
connotes free as in &quot;free speech,&quot; not &quot;free beer&quot;).

He referenced this article, which I would strongly recommend reading.  
it is both brief and enlightening.

However, as I discussed it with him further, I came to the realization  
that &quot;freedom&quot; is not the sole, core concept of this project, and that  
we shouldn't necessarily overly focus on it. For example, freedom is  
not an important or even applicable concept to the governance of a  
cycling club or a park authority. And with governance mechanisms such  
as a condo board or school board, freedom may in fact be an  
undesirable thing in some regards. We certainly are for freedom from  
the authority of individual rulers, but we should be careful not to  
overemphasize the concept.

In any event, his point is well taken that we may want to move away  
from the term &quot;open source.&quot; He also had a problem with the term &quot;open  
content&quot; in that &quot;open&quot; was used explicitly to de-emphasize freedom,  
and that &quot;content&quot; is a negative word as well:

His suggestion: &quot;It seems to me that the crucial point about your idea  
is government based on participatory discussion. Maybe you can find a  
good name by thinking about those terms.&quot;

Thoughts?
