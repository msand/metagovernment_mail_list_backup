<PRE>The tag study is very interesting. I have two concerns about using it
to form canonical opinion though:
1) It is not a very large sample
2) The very first version of metagovernment.org in the wayback machine
( <A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20070519063610/http://www.metagovernment.org/">http://web.archive.org/web/20070519063610/http://www.metagovernment.org/</A>
) does mention &quot;open source&quot; twice.

So we shouldn't assume that people are automatically associating &quot;open
source&quot; with Metagovernment of their own volition. Although I do
imagine it helps geeks &quot;grok&quot; the collaborative nature of the project,
it probably does nothing for non-geeks.

I just asked my half-geek wife - &quot;What do you think of when I say:
open source governance?&quot; - response: &quot;anarchy!&quot; then after some
thought &quot;because that means that _anyone_ could have an input!!?!&quot;.
Something then perhaps to avert fear?

Grassroots Governance? - Sounds so unlikely that it almost prompts the
&quot;how the heck would that ever work?&quot; question, at which point examples
could be cited.
