Your point is well taken, but now that you mention it, I have to  
wonder if everyone sees it the way you do. &quot;Open source&quot; has a pretty  
clear meaning among the inhabitants of SlashDot-space, but to the  
general public, it does not have a great deal of meaning. To most  
people, if it means anything at all, it probably means &quot;free  
software&quot; (as in free beer... and I do have trouble with FSF's use of  
&quot;free software.&quot; I think any term that has to be continuously  
explained is going to have trouble gaining acceptance).

My problems with this are that:

1. Direct democracy has some pretty negative connotations. For most  
people, it is equivalent with mob rule.

2. Also for most people, the term democracy is intrinsically linked  
with voting. And further, with &quot;one person, one vote.&quot; Neither of  
those really apply here.

That said, I am somewhat fond of the term the South African  
Progressive Initiative uses when referring to us: &quot;Electronic Direct  
Democracy.&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.progressiveinitiative.org/Initiative3">http://www.progressiveinitiative.org/Initiative3</A>&gt; It is  
better, but still a little cumbersome. &quot;Electronic&quot; is an almost  
archaic term at this point, since everything in our lives seems to  
have a plug/battery. And It also brings up connotations of electronic  
voting, which again, takes people in the wrong direction.

I have some revulsion to the new fad of throwing a 2.0 after anything  
that seems a little different, but we are talking about Web 2.0 and  
direct democracy. We could use something like &quot;Democracy 2.0,&quot; though  
it sounds trite to me.

The above is a bit of brainstorming... I'm open to suggestions.
