<PRE>&gt;<i>When trying to position the dividing line between objectivity and
</I>&gt;<i>subjectivity I think you fall into the trap of believing that there is
</I>&gt;<i>such a line, or indeed that there cannot be overlap.

I understand your point here.  An earlier formulation of our data structure
saw things more along these lines, believing that any post fell somewhere
along two scales:

Values=&gt;Positions=&gt;Policies=&gt;Laws
OR
Fact&lt;=&gt;Opinion 

To get an idea of how we envisioned this scale could work, see
<A HREF="http://democracylab.net/demo/post1_opinion/evaluation.html.">http://democracylab.net/demo/post1_opinion/evaluation.html.</A>
Note that this is not interactive, if you click on one of the voting panes,
there's only one outcome the demo will represent.  It plays more like a
movie than an interactive site.

We moved away from this formulation because we believed it was too
confusing/complicated for users to understand.  Our thinking now is to force
users to choose a category at Concept/Comment creation, and that users will
rate poorly things that are miscategorized.

The downside is a lack of subtlety.  The upside is easier user
comprehension, which hopefully equals higher usage.  I think this is more
important (for now, at least), because for any of this to matter, it needs
to be used by as many people as possible.
