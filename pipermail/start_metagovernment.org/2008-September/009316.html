<PRE>I'm starting to glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel now that I have relocated my family to Barcelona. I should be in a position to make a fuller contribution again in another few weeks once I've found work and hit a new routine. Meantime I'm trying to keep up to date with the emails.

I think Richard's article is very good. I was not aware of the history, and I understand and support his position. But it seems he is slightly living in a time-warp. I am one of the people that came to the movement well after &quot;open&quot; and &quot;open-source&quot; had been seized on by the media and popularised. But personally I had always assumed the open source movement to be a social force for freedom as well as a pragmatic improvement in terms of software development and support models. In any case I'm not against the term &quot;open&quot; so long as we all know that there is an ethical imperative for freedom assumed and incorporated. 

So &quot;open governance&quot; probably does it for me. It is not something we need to stick to forever if we decide it needs to evolve further.

BTW - it strikes me that Richard should be calling free software &quot; freedom software&quot; which is what he really means.

Paul
