<PRE>If Copyright is a necessary evil - because we can't trust others to
act honourably without incentive - then the GPL is necessarily a Work
of Evil Genius - you have the right to copy/modify/distribute as long
as the same rights are transferred to the recipients. I think this is
important to restate lest we think of Copyright as a good thing in of
itself, and conflate what the GPL achieves (+) with the _mechanism_ by
which it does so (-).

The GPL is necessary to enforce the freedom to view and use the source
code -- with textual content, there is no such incentive to muddy the
waters.

Fast forward 50 years. Due to several unforeseen circumstances Open
Governance didn't take off. A new group forms and independently comes
up with ideas similar to those outlined by Metagovernment. Not that
they have access to the Metagovernment archives due to a segmented
version of the Internet. Due to new harsh &quot;one-strike&quot; copyright laws,
MSCopyrightEnforcerAdvantage(tm) detects a violation and the copyright
cops confiscate their servers and disband the group because they
didn't correctly attribute their ideas.

Far-fetched - perhaps - none of us can predict the future - but the
point I'm trying to make is that we need to be as careful as possible
when playing with copyright fire.
