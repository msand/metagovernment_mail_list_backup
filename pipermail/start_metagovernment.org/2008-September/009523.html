Well I agree with you that they can change the terms, and that this is a 
potential hazard...but I disagree with you that it constitutes a major risk.

I never said they did. 

But one thing I've learned working as a single individual in a sea of 
open source projects started by corporate entities (at the Eclipse 
Foundation), is that even as corporate entities they have to behave like 
decent community members...or the community turns on them.  And they are 
usually quite aware that it is a very bad thing to have a community turn 
on them.  In any event, even this (community ire) will keep the risk of 
what you describe above from being realized...but I still think that 
risk is pretty low (especially since I know some of the people involved 
in the Google's open source programs office).
