<PRE>I don't know how banking works in other parts of the world, but here in the
United States, Internet Banking has become a competitive edge in the
industry -- which means that if you don't provide your customers with
Internet access to their accounts, that potential customers will surely take
their business elsewhere.

But I'm glad you recognized the true test of the challenge -- which wasn't
to convince you to give up your Internet Banking, but to illustrate how
similar tools have already become an integral part of our daily / monthly /
yearly lives. This &quot;meme&quot; helps focus the debate away from SECURITY HACKERS
CORPORATIONS VOTER FRAUD EVIL SATAN to &quot;I rely on these tools for banking,
why don't I have the same level of access to my Government?&quot;

However, I have to admit that this vision seems quite different from the
Metagovernment perspective. Whereas the IB [Internet Banking] perspective
denotes logging into your local government portal and seeing where your
taxes are going, etc., the Metagovernment Project seems to be focusing on
the final click that occurs when users wish to change where their taxes are
going, etc.

I would be curious to know how the IB Challenge sits with others on the
Committee.
