<PRE>I'm with Ed on this.  My primary concern at this point is that if a &quot;vote&quot;
is to mean anything, it must be possible to ensure that it is associated
with an individual and that individual is only allowed to vote once, with
caveats to enable: a) anonymous voting, as election systems do now, and b)
*perhaps* proxy voting, if the voters agree to delegate to others they
trust.  

As implied in Ed's message, I'm not sure proxy voting should be allowed in
many, if any instances, because it means that individuals don't care enough
to take the time to vote and it risks giving too much power to other
individuals, which inevitably corrupts them.  (The case has been made that
Members of Congress are too busy and sit on too many committees to be
required to be present to vote.  However, from my perspective, based upon my
personal experience, that is merely evidence they have too much power.)

Another issue that is too complicated and controversial to get into right
now is the degrees to which each voter's interests may actually be affected
by the issue to be decided by vote.  For example, if one does not pay income
tax, it is very easy to vote to raise the taxes of others in order to enable
greater spending on social causes.  Or if one is fortunate enough to sit on
a corporate board by virtue of having befriended the CEO, it has been pretty
easy to vote to raise the compensation of the CEO, whereas common
stockholders may have no real voice in such decisions. (Under current
economic circumstances, it is now harder for board members to do that.)
Colloquially speaking, the issue is how much &quot;skin&quot; one has in the game.
Another way to consider this issue is the distinction between charity and
volunteering versus taxation and mandatory &quot;service&quot;.

Systems attached to existing governments seem to think that way, but  
for Metagovernment I hope we can hold true to the &quot;anyone&quot; in the  
first principle. As soon as people get artificially disenfranchised  
from a process for any reason, democracy suffers.

Given that we live in a very global, very connected world, it is  
unseemly that we should disenfranchise people from decisions simply  
because they do not live in a certain geography. If someone cares  
about something enough to spend time acting on it, then it probably  
effects them or their interests.

A classic example is watershed management. If a locality at the head  
of a river has sole jurisdiction over what pollutants enter the river,  
all people downstream are disenfranchised from an issue which clearly  
affects them. Modern governments have started to develop regional  
authorities for things like watersheds, but now there are so many  
cross-jurisdictional issues that it seems the easiest and purest  
solution would be to invite participation from anyone interested  
enough to participate.
