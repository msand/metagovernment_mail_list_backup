<PRE>I'm starting up my blog again to track the evolution of NationBuilder,
please check it out.  Here's the first post.

<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/</A> Making the
Future&lt;<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/</A>&gt; Published
on May 11, 2009

I&#8217;m getting ready to launch NationBuilder &lt;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/">http://nationbuilder.com/</A>&gt; in the
next month or two, so I&#8217;m starting my blog back up and even giving it a name
&#8212; Make the Future &lt;<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/</A>&gt;. The name comes from Carl
Pope, the long-time leader of the Sierra Club. In This Brave
Nation&lt;<A HREF="http://bravenation.com/carl_pope_van_jones.php">http://bravenation.com/carl_pope_van_jones.php</A>&gt;,
a documentary series we made at Brave New Films
&lt;<A HREF="http://bravenewfilms.org/">http://bravenewfilms.org/</A>&gt;about a year ago, he said: &#8220;Just take what
you love doing, and do it with
enough other people, to make it the future.&#8221;

Shortly before the election, I started White House
2&lt;<A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/">http://whitehouse2.org/</A>&gt;to democratically set the agenda for the
incoming Obama administration, and
track it like the Nielsen&#8217;s TV ratings. There was so much to be done, I
wanted people to think hard about what the priorities should be &#8212; there was
just no way he could do everything at once!

I put the first site up in two weeks, and people from all over the world
started contacting me about bringing it to their country. I&#8217;ve been working
non-stop since then, and am about 5-6 weeks away from beta on
NationBuilder&lt;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/">http://nationbuilder.com/</A>&gt;,
a web service that will let anyone set up their own site just like White
House 2.

You can look at White House 2 &lt;<A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/">http://whitehouse2.org/</A>&gt; and easily see how
this could be used for governments of all kinds, but I believe it can also
be used to bring democracy to business. Successful businesses of the future
need to involve all the stakeholders, whether they are employees,
management, shareholders, or customers. They need to establish the right
incentives, and have tools that work *better* when hundreds of thousands of
people are involved, not worse. Oh, and it has to be fun, or no one will
care.

At Brave New Films, we pretty much turned the documentary world upside down
doing a first generation version of this. We built our own audience, and
then involved them as much as we could in making and distributing the films.
They hosted tens of thousands of screenings, shot footage, took photos of
abandoned Wal-Marts&lt;<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartmovie/tags/abandoned/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartmovie/tags/abandoned/</A>&gt;,
put up half the funding for our last
documentary&lt;<A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/AR2006081800210_pf.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/AR2006081800210_pf.html</A>&gt;($260k),
and even suggested the name of the company itself. But the only
reason we were able to do as much as we did, is because I could code
anything we might dream up. There just aren&#8217;t many tools designed for
companies to operate like this.

NationBuilder will be a general purpose operating system to run democracies
online, and we&#8217;ll use the software itself to run the company. It&#8217;s kind of a
far out idea, and I don&#8217;t have all the answers on how it should work yet,
but I&#8217;m having a ton of fun figuring it out. This blog will track the
evolution of the platform, and show how people can use NationBuilder to,
well, make the future.
