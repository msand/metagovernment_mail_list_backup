<PRE>Tom, if and, hopefully, when you get to the point of documenting the vision,
mission, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders for Ethonomics.org --
<A HREF="http://www.ethonomics.org/about-ethonomics">http://www.ethonomics.org/about-ethonomics</A> -- I'd like to render that
information in StratML format for inclusion in our collection at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> 

 

BTW, at this point, the StratML schema does not enable the association of
globally unique identifiers with stakeholders.  A graphic depiction of the
schema in InfoPath is available at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#WorkResults</A> or, more specifically,
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/InfoPathRendition20090509.doc">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/InfoPathRendition20090509.doc</A>   

 

However, the &lt;Identifier&gt; element is associated with &lt;Organization&gt;.  Thus,
if individuals were to document their goals and objectives in StratML format
on the Web and associate GUIDs with themselves as &quot;organizations&quot; --
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Organization">http://xml.gov/stratml/draft/StratMLGlossary.xml#Organization</A> - those
identifiers could provide evidence of who the individual truly is (as well
as what they have accomplished and what they plan to accomplish).  

 

To the degree that their goals and objectives are linked to those upon which
&quot;voting&quot; is occurring, their &quot;stakeholder-ship&quot; would automatically be
apparent.  (In Part 3 of the StratML standard, we plan to address geospatial
referencing of organizations, goals, objectives, and stakeholders.)
Moreover, even to the degree that explicit linkages have not yet been
established, machine intelligence can be applied to identify goals and
objectives that appear to be related (based upon their names and
descriptions) and, thus, the populations of organizations and individuals
who *may* &amp;/or should be interested in voting.

Thoughts of a newcomer on parts of Kris' views - apologies for anything
missed in previous threads.

1. It may be worth bearing in mind general possibilities in the future for
'community auditing' of declarations of stakeholder interest, rather than
reliance upon a superior authority.  Assuming that people should be prepared
to have such declarations as public information, then those they know could
effectively moderate their selection of categories.  In areas where it might
not be appropriate to have this information as public (for example, those
affected medically by governmental/industry activity) then other mechanisms
would need to be explored.  Cross-referencing between different social
networking etc web technologies might also be a possibility but could raise
much trickier issues I think, as my assumption is that consent would be
appropriate and would be incomplete across participants.

4. I've put forward some views on delegation in earlier emails.  Just to add
here that I think that people/organisations are stakeholders in so many
issues that a framework for ensuring inclusion, even without direct
participation, would be necessary.

Tom

Hi all,

Going through everyone's views, i conclude, the following are the main
subjects of the discussions here - please correct me, if i am wrong: 

1. 'Stakeholder involvement' rather than anyone's (outsider's) involvement.

2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.

3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.

4. Delegating for proxy voting.


The following are my views on the above:

1. It is difficult to segregate someone as a stakeholder and another as a
non-stakeholder; may be a classification of directly impacted, indirectly
impacted and not impacted, may help. But such declaration must come from the
individual and cannot be subject to audit, lest a superior authority for
review is brought it, which may belie the purpose. 

A weightage factor can be introduced for the 3 categories - directly
impacted, indirectly impacted and not impacted.

2. Biometric Smart Card (BSC) can be used for unique identity.

3. BSC would limit to a single vote for each, even online.  

4. Delegating for proxy voting may help in some genuine cases; but could
subvert the process of stakeholder direct involvement.

that's right.

Our user-verifiable telematics project aims to create a
&quot;community-managed certifying authority&quot;, that will ensure openness
and  transparency in this process. We are now writing a new EU grant
about this, and the Free Software Foundation Europe has given their go
to join as a partner (although they don't want to commit to write the
project). The deadline is June 2, I am not sure we will make it this
time because we are in the beginning, but we'll try.
