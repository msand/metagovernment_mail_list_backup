<PRE>Now this is a great idea!!!!
what if we have a way to speak between our projects.
So you could use White House to set up what the main issues are,
Vilfredo to set up the answers to those issues,
and a polling system (metascore?) to ask respect to a particular
issue, respect to some particular positions, what does a person take.

In short, what if we have a simple api with which to import and
exporte issues, questions and possible answers.

Then we could set up an open standard that would let all the new eGov
system speak.

If it becomes big enough the governments might start to use it too.

Great idea indeed, Ed.

</I>&gt;<i> A singular computing platform (e.g., Windows) stifles innovation and

</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand, a singular network (i.e., the internet) is a very good
</I>&gt;<i> thing. It allows for standardization and provides a platform for amazing
</I>&gt;<i> innovations (e.g., Web 2.0). Back when everyone had a
</I>&gt;<i> separate,&#160;internal&#160;network with no real outside communications, none of the
</I>&gt;<i> current web innovations were even imaginable.
</I>&gt;<i> So at this early stage, it is only reasonable that we have many competing
</I>&gt;<i> projects, but it certainly would help if we had some common ground to allow
</I>&gt;<i> for cross-fertilization. There are areas of our various projects that are
</I>&gt;<i> too different to find a common platform, but there are some things (the idea
</I>&gt;<i> and perhaps the format of a law/policy, for example) that could be
</I>&gt;<i> standardized into a common format of some kind... aren't there?
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. The one thing we already have in common is this list. (And for the most
</I>&gt;<i> part, I believe almost every group generally agrees with the first two basic
</I>&gt;<i> principles of the Metagovernment project, though certainly not all would
</I>&gt;<i> agree with allowing *everyone* to participate in *any* decision without any
</I>&gt;<i> limitation.) I continue to invite people from other groups to join this
</I>&gt;<i> list, and would encourage others to do so as well. If nothing else, the mere
</I>&gt;<i> fact that we discuss in this open format is certainly a good thing.
