<PRE>Hi all --

So, in recent months I have been helping to develop a site
(polladium.com) and I wanted to take a moment to introduce it to the
community...

I see it as related to online governance, though the reasons for this
may not be immediately apparent. Allow me to elaborate.

It's a social polling site, integrated with Facebook and twitter.
Users create poll questions on current news issues and participate in
polls. They can see what other people are thinking about and what
their facebook/twitter friends are voting on.

So, you may ask, how is this connected with our aims? I see it as
improving the rate of participation in community issues through an
online forum. Because it's social, and not obviously political, it's
less intimidating than other sites like WH2 which will primarily
attract people who are already politically active, or who have a
vested interest in a specific political issue. So the reach of a site
like this will be more broad than those of our other initiatives.

One issue I have noticed in using the site is the potentially divisive
affect that polls have on the participants -- basically, people are
forced to choose one or another 'camp' and there's very little sense
that a consensus can be reached.

Some positive interface ideas we have come up with are the VoxBox (see
my voxbox here: <A HREF="http://www.polladium.com/voxbox/jb555">http://www.polladium.com/voxbox/jb555</A>) which allows
one to follow the actions of friends on the site. Also, the publisher
section (see my publisher profile here:
<A HREF="http://www.polladium.com/p/polladium.php?p=1003">http://www.polladium.com/p/polladium.php?p=1003</A>) which can list a
subset of polls related to a particular interest group.

Would be curious to know if there are thoughts in the group as to the
site's design, how it may improve and what may be useful about what we
have done.

PS I define my aims in the online governance initiative to be three-fold:
1 - increase transparency
2 - improve participation
3 - improve accountability

Feel free to disagree with me on these -- they are my personal goals
and not necessarily those of the group.

Jacki
