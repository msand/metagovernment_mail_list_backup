<PRE>I don't see it as elitist because nobody is suggesting that anyone  
should be prevented from participating/voting on any issue based on  
some standard. Rather, I am hoping that people will concentrate their  
efforts into what they know best, instead of blindly casting votes on  
issues they know nothing about (a practice which is rampant in the  
status quo). The way I am proposing is not through some sort of  
authoritarian limit but simply by the natural process resulting from  
there being far too many issues to look at. The sheer overload of  
issues should get people to self-select into areas they actually care  
about, and encourage people to tend away from random voting on issues  
they don't understand.

I can see how this might look elitist, but it just as readily be  
viewed as inclusive. Someone who really cares about the potholes in  
their street can spend a lot of time on that issue, while someone else  
who is excited about educating children about narcotics can focus on  
that issue. Either person can participate in the issue of the other,  
but alternately they can rest easy knowing that someone who really  
cares about the issue is putting a lot of time into it. This is a  
significant distinction from the delegation model, because at any  
moment, anyone can begin participating on any issue (though to be  
fair, I think Votorola allows for that as well, by allowing someone to  
de-delegate and participate directly).

Put another way: the reason for encouraging this self-selection into  
issues is not for elitist purposes, but to overcome the biggest  
problems with traditional direct democracy: mob rule and demagoguery.  
If everyone channels into a few hot-button issues, the debate is  
degraded into a blind black-white, single decision. If individuals fan  
out over a broad array of issues, policy-making can be genuinely  
productive.

</I>&gt;<i> economics, or sociology that you prefer -- but I will once again  
</I>&gt;<i> stress that these should be options, and would caution against  
</I>&gt;<i> programming these into the vote count.
