<PRE>Giving you some updates about Vilfredo,
we had the suggestion to add the title, and I did it yesterday
evening. Now every question must have a title (max 256 characters, I
think, but we might lower it to make it possible to fit into a tweet.
I also had manually (!) added a title to all the questions that have
been posed so far. I hope the title somehow represent what the person
tried to ask. If it does not, please forgive me, those things happen
in version preprepreprealpha. Now on the general question page you get
only the title. And, more interestingly, the content of the question
(the big blurb of text) can get newlines. So if you write a newline in
the edit box, it will remain. This might help people to write the
question with paragraphs, and in a more clear way.

I also added near the box where people write their question some
clarification about the kind of question that this system can handle.
Those are not ethical or moral issues but pragmatic ones. This system
handles open questions. For closed polls of which you have already
decided what are the answers you should go somwhere else (there are
plenty of websites that do that).

I added near the entries that reach the pareto front for a generation,
the users that has voted them. I think this will help in reaching a
sinthesis. The information was in any case already publicly available,
but you had to search for it. De facto if this information is
available or not will greatly change the way the process run. So I
think (and everybody I spoke agrees on it), eventually the person who
asks the question should be the person allowed to decide if the info
is available or not.

Christopher suggested to add a propose question in the frontpage, and
to move the FAQ to another page. We did it. Not only that, but there
was a question who was asked via Pareto: when does a discussion ends.
That has been answered in the FAQ.

I changed how long will it pass before Vilfredo will ask you to log in
again. Now it's 7 days.

Now let us go to the discussions:

Christopher question:
&quot;How do you balance the Love of Nature with the Power of the Internet?&quot;
has gone through a first generation, got some answers, and now is
cooking some more.

Manuel question:
&quot;What is the solution to the banking crisis?&quot;
reached a new level of compassion. We finally do not want to kill
bankers anymore. And what has remained is a liberal option (let the
bank die) and a local option (banks should be under the government
with a Vilfredo system). I like how Vilfredo is now being suggested as
an effective way to decide.

There are some new questions. Leaving aside the closed questions, and
the yes/no questions, there was:
&quot;What is the most plausible way for humanity to tackle universal
issues that traverse all boundaries?&quot; by Imbroglio. Please consider
answer it.

Fabian question:
&quot;What can we do to make the participation and communication in
metascore/megoverment better.&quot; had now 6 person voting on it, and is
now begging to moveone! :)

Christopher also presented another question:
&quot;What aspects of UserVoice.com would be helpful for Vilfredo?&quot;
which is very related to the question on how to make VgtA better.
Please vote on it. Speaking about the question on how to make things
better, we had 4 winners last time. One winner asked to being able to
delete/edit proposals you have already asked. We already had that, in
any case, I deleted the code abd then copied it back again.

Then there were two different requests that were asking to have
questions divided into title and content (or similar). Done. And
finally, there was question to let the person asking the question set
up the parameters for the question. This is in the todo list, as we
need to figure it out how to do it in a way that is possible.

Any feedback would be welcome.
