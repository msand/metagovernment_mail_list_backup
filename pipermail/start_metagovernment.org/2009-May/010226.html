<PRE>Thank you for answering my questions about your development plans.
I'm curious how you'll generate revenue, as you say, &quot;in keeping with
the concepts embodied in the platform&quot;.  I imagine some kind of
connection between the business revenue to keep it running, and the
political captital (PC as you call it) that is generated by the
participants!  (Don't deny it though, it's good for buzz.)

</I>&gt;<i> but that's just for people's suggestions for the site itself.
</I>
(I mistook it for the site engine.  I have to apologize to some other
 people, because I misinformed them.)

Maybe there's a way to answer Thomas without going into technical
details, disclosing competitive secrets, etc.  If you're willing, I'd
like to ask you a series of questions regarding (a) the aims of WH2;
(b) the general technical facilities to achieve those aims; and (c)
the steps that are involved once the facilities are in place.  I could
ask these questions of any project, but I'll start with you.  Aside
from Telematics Freedom, which is currently bound to silence, yours is
the project that I know least about.

The idea is to discover potential points of synergy, where WH2 can
collaborate with other projects.  Synergy is not entirely a question
of aims (I agree with you and Pietro) but let's begin there:

  a) What is the aim of the project?
 
So for example, in regard to Votorola, I would answer that the aim is
a direct democracy (plus).  I would then add a few sentences of
explanation, defining roughly what I mean by a direct democracy (and
by the &quot;plus&quot;).  I might say that I mean the transfer of decision
making from government and political parties to the general
population, such that people at large decide who holds official power,
what policies they pursue, what plans they enact, and what laws they
pass.  (By the &quot;plus&quot;, I might say the same thing, but with regard to
socio-cultural issues that are normally beyond the scope of
governmental power.  These too would be deliberately decided by people
at large.)

Can you answer in the same pattern?  (Can other projects answer, too?
Owen, is this a good approach to take, in response to Thomas's plea?)

&gt;<i> re: your questions on wh2
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm pursuing the Wordpress model.  There will be a downloadable version that
</I>&gt;<i> folks can install themselves, and then there will be a hosted version that
</I>&gt;<i> any one can sign up for and customize, similar to ning.com.  They will be
</I>&gt;<i> the same code base (I hope), multi-lingual, and open source.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The requirements to install the software are a bit more complex than
</I>&gt;<i> Wordpress (it needs memcached installed, search software, etc.), and I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to spend time trying to help people get it installed right now, so I'm
</I>&gt;<i> putting all my efforts into getting the hosted version into beta in about
</I>&gt;<i> 5-6 weeks.
</I>
(I'm personally commited to a distributed pattern, one site per
 town/region.  But there shouldn't be any insurmountable technical
 hurdle to migrating from one pattern to the other, or to sitting on
 the fence and straddling both.  Logically speaking, it's all the
 same.  The differences are economic and social.)
 
&gt;<i> Pricing of the hosted version will be unique (not advertising) and in
</I>&gt;<i> keeping with the concepts embodied in the platform.  I'm keeping it a secret
</I>&gt;<i> at the moment in hopes I can get some buzz out of it when I announce.
</I>
(I speculate that Jim has discovered a way of mixing money into the
 fabric of democracy - but a good way, not a bad way.)
