<PRE>Ed, on this topic it might be good to collaborate with OASIS's law and
government TCs: <A HREF="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_cat.php?cat=lawgov">http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_cat.php?cat=lawgov</A> 

With respect to legislative documents, see <A HREF="http://www.legalxml.org/">http://www.legalxml.org/</A> &amp;

With respect to the topic of voting, it would be good to touch base with the
Elections and Voter Services TC:

their Top 10 reasons for using Election Markup Language (EML):

BTW, as a nonprogrammer, it does not seem to me that an application
*programming* interface is required.  Indeed, it seems to me that the goal
should be to *separate* the data from the software, so that the data can
stand on its own and be reused appropriately regardless of the software.

Subject: [Start] Policymaking API

I think my day is about to get busy, so I don't have time to start an  
article on the wiki now, but it seems like the wiki would be the best  
place to put together the groundwork for a global API for lawmaking/ 
policymaking.

Here are some initial ideas for laying out the groundwork for the  
format, if someone would like to take it further... or come up with  
something completely different. I'm no programmer, so don't know if  
this is the way to start.

Act (or Law or Policy or Bill, etc.):
- Title
- Summary
- Sections - which may include but are not limited to:
-- Prohibitions - Things people are prohibited from doing
-- Compulsions - Things people are required to do
-- Rights - Things which people are allowed to do
-- Proactions - Things which the governing body is required to do
-- Resolutions - Things which the community holds to be true
-- Funding
-- Enforcement
- Paragraphs

Tracking Information
- Version
- Timestamp
- Containing community (ie, jurisdiction)
- Author

Comparison Information
- Issues this act pertains to
- Other Acts which this Act:
-- Contradicts
-- Supersedes
-- Synthesizes
-- Obsolitizes

Status
- (not sure how to break this down in a way that works with various  
systems)

Discussion
- (not sure how to break this down logically)
