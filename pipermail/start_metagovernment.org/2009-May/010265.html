<PRE>I hope this problem will be somewhat mitigated by not having the
participants career depening on them being right (ie. being a politician).
This is of course just an assumption and we can expect people to decide
against their own intrest based on false evaluation of information, but I
don't see that we can do much about that other than pleading to objectivity
and dilligence.

FWIW, I think this issue with delegation is completely trumped by the much
bigger problem of people who have no idea they know nothing about an issue.
How many political conversations have you been in where someone said &quot;I
don't really know too much about that issue, I think I'll defer to you.&quot;
What happens more frequently is you've got someone who is absolutely
convinced they are right, even though a 2 minute exercise in logic would
show they are wrong.   I believe this is the single hardest problem to solve
with democracy, and can only be solved by people being more accurately
informed.  Any system of the sort we are discussing needs to have informing
people central to it.   Although, if someone has a better way of solving it,
I will absolutely to defer to you!  :)
