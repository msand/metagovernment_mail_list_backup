DVCS is short for Distributed Version Control System.
<A HREF="http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/220760">http://www.southparkstudios.com/episodes/220760</A>
I don't understand it perfectly, but here's what I know... Instead of  
one central server, it effectively allows everyone to run their own  
&quot;server,&quot; publishing their version out to the world. Others can then  
accept or reject those distributed publications. This is how open  
source software developers develop code together. If you look at one  
of the metascore repositories, such as
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/mbarkhau/metascore/">https://bitbucket.org/mbarkhau/metascore/</A>
you can see it contains bits of code from other people's repositories,  
which that developer accepted into his version.

It's a somewhat hectic system, and a little sophisticated of a concept  
to get across to the general public, but the end result is that there  
is no reliance on a privileged and no singular authority. It seems  
like a fantastic way for a forward-looking system of governance to be  
managed.

&gt;<i> What is external solution to identity? How would it help  
</I>&gt;<i> standardization?
</I>
And external ID system would be something like OpenID, which is a sort  
of standard in itself:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID</A>
however as far as I know, it does not restrict a single person to a  
single identity.

&gt;<i> What is a commercial solution and how would it bring undue influence?
</I>
I just don't see it as a good thing to have a commercial entity be in  
charge of a central aspect of a democracy. If there is a profit  
motive, then there is a motive for something other than the benefit of  
the society, and there is immediately room for a conflict of interest  
there.
