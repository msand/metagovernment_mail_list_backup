Before trying to answer, I'll suggest how classification could be
separated from voting so they don't get tangled up.  Then I think
Pietro, Metascore team, and maybe Mark F. know more about
classification than I do, and they may have some ideas/answers.
Here's more diagrams:


  A    B     C    D     e-democracy clients

    \  |     |  /
     \ |     | /

       X     Y       voting services and vote pools

     / |     | \
    /  |     |  \

  S    T     U    V    issue classification services
           
         

E-dem client sites (A, B, C, D) are consumers of both the voting
services and the classification services.  A given client site (A)
will typically consume a single voting service (X, as shown above) and
multiple classification services (S, T, as shown below).


  A      B     e-democracy clients

  | \  / |
  |  \/  |
  |  /\  |
  | /  \ |

  S      T    issue classification services


The client sites also consume other services (not shown), for example
brainstorming (Vilfredo).  The client sites are mostly UI
superstructure in direct contact with the voters, whereas the service
sites are mostly infrastructure hidden from view.

At first glance, and from what I know of Metascore, these diagrams
tell me that Metascore is torn between providing a voting service (X)
and a classification service (S).  Maybe you could split it into
separate services?  I also think that DemocracyLab is strong on
classification, but perhaps weaker on voting.  Maybe it could
specialize, too?

Important to note: classification software need not be restricted to a
particular voting service.  So classification sites S and U may
actually be running the same software, one applied to the issue/vote
pool of X, the other to the issue/vote pool of Y.  In this way,
Metascore and Votorola might actually have a synergy.  (I think that's
cool.)

(This is just a napkin sketch, one example of what's possible.  Others
 will have ideas, especially later, when the detailed frameworks are
 sketched, and proposed for discussion.)
