<PRE>Hello Thomas,
nice to have you (back?).

I don't think that it is so much a problem of competition, but an
issue of the different ways to tackle a difficult problem.
You are a philosopher, so from your point of view, if you need to
reach a deeper understanding about something, you discuss it. Most of
us are computer scientists. Our attitude is a bit different. We try
different things, as a way to explore different paths. And then we
report on how it went well, and how it went wrong.

But generally there is a deep understanding that words alone have a
hard time to express a model. You need to code it, try it, show that
it works (or doesn't). And then you have a base on which to built
further. It is a bit like in peer reviewed journals. You have some
articles that explain what they (a particular group) are going to do
in the future. Often such an article appears at the beginning of a
project. Then you have some articles that present what they have done.
They appear at the end of the 3 years project. Often the two articles,
the before and the after, might be quite similar. The 'only'
difference is a section. A section which does not even need to be very
large. But it is really important. The section is called: results.

The kind of deep analysis you speak about need to have results from
all partners. Maybe WhiteHouse 2 does have some of those results. But
the others? Not yet, I would say.

So discussion happens, but often they end up with the line:
ok we need to test this, and then decide.

Best Regards,
Pietro
