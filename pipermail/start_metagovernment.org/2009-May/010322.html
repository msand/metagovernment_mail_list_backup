<PRE>Hi Jacki,
thanks for the link.

I find interesting the connection with Twitter.
I personally have some troubles with tools that forces our thinking
into a 1 dimensiona yes/no. But I understand I might be in a minority
over this.
Please be aware that very often I would click on something and I would
be told that the page does not exist. And then I would go to the home
page.

I think there are a number of online poll system like this. They do
let ideas circulate, which is beneficial, but other than that I am not
sure on their effect.

yesnot.eu

Regards,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Hi all --
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, in recent months I have been helping to develop a site
</I>&gt;<i> (polladium.com) and I wanted to take a moment to introduce it to the
</I>&gt;<i> community...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see it as related to online governance, though the reasons for this
</I>&gt;<i> may not be immediately apparent. Allow me to elaborate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a social polling site, integrated with Facebook and twitter.
</I>&gt;<i> Users create poll questions on current news issues and participate in
</I>&gt;<i> polls. They can see what other people are thinking about and what
</I>&gt;<i> their facebook/twitter friends are voting on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, you may ask, how is this connected with our aims? I see it as
</I>&gt;<i> improving the rate of participation in community issues through an
</I>&gt;<i> online forum. Because it's social, and not obviously political, it's
</I>&gt;<i> less intimidating than other sites like WH2 which will primarily
</I>&gt;<i> attract people who are already politically active, or who have a
</I>&gt;<i> vested interest in a specific political issue. So the reach of a site
</I>&gt;<i> like this will be more broad than those of our other initiatives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One issue I have noticed in using the site is the potentially divisive
</I>&gt;<i> affect that polls have on the participants -- basically, people are
</I>&gt;<i> forced to choose one or another 'camp' and there's very little sense
</I>&gt;<i> that a consensus can be reached.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some positive interface ideas we have come up with are the VoxBox (see
</I>&gt;<i> my voxbox here: <A HREF="http://www.polladium.com/voxbox/jb555">http://www.polladium.com/voxbox/jb555</A>) which allows
</I>&gt;<i> one to follow the actions of friends on the site. Also, the publisher
</I>&gt;<i> section (see my publisher profile here:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.polladium.com/p/polladium.php?p=1003">http://www.polladium.com/p/polladium.php?p=1003</A>) which can list a
</I>&gt;<i> subset of polls related to a particular interest group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would be curious to know if there are thoughts in the group as to the
</I>&gt;<i> site's design, how it may improve and what may be useful about what we
</I>&gt;<i> have done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS I define my aims in the online governance initiative to be three-fold:
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - increase transparency
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - improve participation
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - improve accountability
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Feel free to disagree with me on these -- they are my personal goals
</I>&gt;<i> and not necessarily those of the group.
