<PRE>In answer to Ed: I get lost without a diagram, here's one:


    voting clients

  A    B     C    D

    \  |     |  /
     \ |     | /

       X     Y

   voting services
   and vote pools


Each client (A, B, C, D) is essentially a user interface (UI).  It's a
place where people see what there is to vote on; cast votes; see
results; and make sense of them.  The client may be full-blown e-dem
Web site with a variety of proposals, like White House 2; or single
proposal affair that is run by a user, maybe as a blog page with a
&quot;Vote&quot; button (vote for me!); or just about any site or service
imagineable that would want to present a voting UI to the world.

Each voting service (X, Y) is provided by a server, or distributed
network of servers, dedicated to maintaining a vote pool on behalf of
its clients.  Here I show only two services, which might be Metascore
(X) and Votorola (Y).

The lines going up/down are voting interfaces.  To the extent the
interfaces are standardized, clients will be free to switch from one
service to the other without having to recode their UI, retrain their
users, etc.  The voting services will therefore appear to the client
as &quot;pluggable components&quot; in the sense that client admins may choose
whichever one they like, and may expect to have more choices in
future.

&gt;&gt;<i>  c. When a voter [at C] votes for a proposal (P) in the context of a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Votorola issue (I), and another voter [at D] votes for another
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     proposal (Q) in the context of the same issue, then both P and Q
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     are thereby made alternative proposals of I.

Are you asking in the context of Votorola's service (Y)?  Or
Metascore's (X)?  For Votorola, it is very simple: a proposal is
associated with an issue (I) whenever - in the context of that issue -
a voter casts a vote for it.  For example, a blogger who knows nothing
about issue (I) may express an opinion on her blog.  A voter may see
this and think, &quot;Hey, that's a great idea for how to solve issue (I)!&quot;

So the voter casts a vote for the blogger, pre-registering her if
necessary, and linking her candidacy to the blog page.  (Voters can
freely do these things in order to nominate new candidates/proposals.)
So now the blog page is a new proposal under issue (I), and all other
voters can see it as such.  (Hopefully, someone informs the blogger!)

In the context of Metascore - not sure.  It's up to you guys.  I can
look at your docs later, and make suggestions - no problem.  As far as
possible though, it would be good if we (voting service providers)
make our client interfaces (to accept incoming votes, post results,
etc.) compatible.

&gt;<i> ... I think DemocracyLab uses a formal taxonomy of pre-defined
</I>&gt;<i> issues. I think the Metascore team is considering using a folksonomy
</I>&gt;<i> to have issues interrelate by organic user tagging. How can such
</I>&gt;<i> things be made compatible? The concept of proposals speaking to
</I>&gt;<i> issues is a very central one to every project, and probably should
</I>&gt;<i> be scrutinized at length.
</I>
(By issue I think you mean, as I do, the general action under
 consideration, such as adopting a new Climate Change Policy.  You
 don't mean a specific proposal for that action; what I call a
 &quot;candidate&quot;.)

Relations among issues are not necessarily part of the voting service.
They might just as easily (and maybe this is better) be a separate
service to the clients - issue classification service (ICS).  So users
may use the ICS to browse for other policies, plans and laws that are
related in some sense to the Climate Change Policy; and so forth.

Anyway, the voting services (X, Y) are under no restrictions in how
they do things.  But whatever they do, they should try to align
themselves and factor out the alignments as interface standards,
wherever that may prove useful to the clients.

This is open network architecture.  (We do this, could be big news.
Someone start it rolling, nothing'll stop it... my opinion.)
