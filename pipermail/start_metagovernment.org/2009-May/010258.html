<PRE>Dear people,

first I want to thank you for deeper exploring possible cooperation 
between us!

And I would also like to answer to some doubts concerning this.

I believe, that most of us are very intensively focused on their 
particular tasks in their particular project.
But if we just for a moment could loosen this focus a bit and zoom out 
of the picture. In this wider picture, isn&#180;t it obvious to see, that our 
goals are the same or at least compatible?

Of course: cooperation would take time and energy to communicate, 
discuss etc. and finally find consensus on how and what to do. And if a 
project is close to completion, it might make no sense to invest that 
energy for a future benefit.
Has one of our projects already reached this point?

But there might be another hurdle for cooperation: One&#180;s own 
identification with one&#180;s project.
In my case: I had the idea for global, direct e-democracy a few years 
ago and started to convince people to work with me on it. Then I found 
Metagovernment and realized, that they were much further developed already.
Retrospective it is funny to see, that at first I saw them as 
competitors. I was not the first one with this idea and probably would 
not be the one to bring it into existence either. This did hurt somehow.
But slowly my identification shifted to Metagovernment. The new &quot;We&quot; was 
much bigger now, global and much more powerful, capable of reaching the 
goal even faster. Now this felt even better then before!
But then other projects like Votorola, Democracylab, WH2 appeared. Again 
the same process: fear of not being in the winning team. lol
A part of me tried to ignore them. Another part compared us, to reassure 
myself, that Metagovernment was better.
But finally I found in the other projects such beautiful solutions for 
problems I hadn&#180;t even seen yet, that my whole pattern of 
self-aggrandizement (at least in this area ;-)) collapsed.
Thank you for this !

Now somehow my focus has shifted to the beautiful energy behind all of 
our projects. And I can see, that this energy is the very same in all of 
us. And I just can&#180;t chase away the picture of all of us working 
together. Just imagine how fast we could get really far!

And like I said, maybe the projects are already developed so far, that 
soon we will have a darwian fight among them, which only the fittest one 
will survive. But if not, let&#180;s take a moment together to consider what 
the dead ends of this evolution are most likely going to be !
After all, one of Metagovernments basic principles is: Consensus through 
Synthesis.


With best regards,
Thomas


PS: I just had the idea, that maybe some people with their project are 
hoping for the future to create a job with an income. But that would be 
equally possible in a joint project, wouldn&#180;t it?
