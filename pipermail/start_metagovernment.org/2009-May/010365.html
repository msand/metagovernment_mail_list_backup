<PRE>Jim,

Thanks for directing us to the article on online identity.

I had proposed implementation of e-Administration open source tool for
e-Governance in the public domain, incorporating finger print authentication
using a multi purpose biometric smart card linked to a single money account
for all communications / transactions, thereby making it fool proof.

Every transaction could be authentic when authenticated by a one-to-one
biometric verification of finger print stored in a smart card; and the
transaction could be recorded indelibly in the individual's smart card, in a
database and a print out with the parties involved in the transaction.

The identity of the person could be anonymous unless warranted by a court
order, etc.

Does this make sense?

Best,

Kris Dev

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the Internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog, as the New Yorker cartoon
</I>&gt;<i> famously said. But what if, while you are surfing, you want to prove your
</I>&gt;<i> pedigree?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equifax, the big credit agency that already knows more about your flea
</I>&gt;<i> count than you do, wants to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is developing a service &lt;<A HREF="http://equifaxicards.com/">http://equifaxicards.com/</A>&gt; that will let you
</I>&gt;<i> create an online identity that can assert various &#8220;claims&#8221; that it will back
</I>&gt;<i> up. To an online wine merchant, it might back you up when you say you are of
</I>&gt;<i> legal age. If you are applying to open a bank account, the company might
</I>&gt;<i> vouch for your entire profile, including name, address, birthday and Social
</I>&gt;<i> Security number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ron Carpinella, Equifax&#8217;s vice president for ID management, said the
</I>&gt;<i> service might even be of use on a blog. &#8220;Think of all the people using false
</I>&gt;<i> identities on blogs to post 15 different comments on something,&#8221; he said.
</I>&gt;<i> &#8220;We can prevent that.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Consumers won&#8217;t pay anything for this, as Equifax envisions the service.
</I>&gt;<i> Rather, Web site owners will pay money for a better way to trust that what
</I>&gt;<i> users tell them is true.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mr. Carpinella would not say how much the company expected the fees to be.
</I>&gt;<i> There is another year of testing before the service goes to market. But he
</I>&gt;<i> did say he envisions a broad range of prices, depending on the information
</I>&gt;<i> being verified. A publisher that wanted simple identity information might
</I>&gt;<i> pay fractions of a dollar, while a banking site might pay several dollars.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Credit bureaus like Equifax already offer sites a way to verify the
</I>&gt;<i> identities of users. You may have seen this when you tried to open a new
</I>&gt;<i> bank or credit card account and you were presented with some multiple choice
</I>&gt;<i> questions asking you to verify where you got your mortgage or car loan (the
</I>&gt;<i> sort of facts a credit bureau knows about you).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This new initiative hopes to piggyback on an elaborate attempt to create an
</I>&gt;<i> industry standard called Information Card &lt;<A HREF="http://informationcard.net/">http://informationcard.net/</A>&gt;that is meant to let people log into many sites with one account. If that
</I>&gt;<i> reminds you of Microsoft Passport, it should, because the proposed standard
</I>&gt;<i> combines work done by Microsoft to create an improved identity service with
</I>&gt;<i> similar efforts by some of its rivals. Microsoft wants to use this
</I>&gt;<i> technology both for people to sign on to corporate networks and for
</I>&gt;<i> consumers to identify themselves to Web sites they use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Whether the broader Information Card effort has any chance of taking off is
</I>&gt;<i> a topic for another day. Information Card is far more complex, and thus
</I>&gt;<i> harder to use, than Open ID, a standard that lets you use your name and
</I>&gt;<i> password from one site, say Google, to sign onto another site, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, Facebook&lt;<A HREF="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_openid_good.php">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_openid_good.php</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> But that complexity enables some extra features and possible protection
</I>&gt;<i> against fraud.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equifax is on to something. There are times when you want someone you are
</I>&gt;<i> dealing with online to know you really are you. Amazon&#8217;s product reviews
</I>&gt;<i> became more trustworthy when the company started identifying&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14279641">http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14279641</A>&gt;those written by people whose names were validated by way of their credit
</I>&gt;<i> card accounts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So let&#8217;s look at how the technology might work with the sort of service
</I>&gt;<i> Equifax is proposing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Say you are shopping for a bottle of wine; the site you visit might display
</I>&gt;<i> the Information Card icon (a purple letter I). Click it, and a piece of
</I>&gt;<i> software called a selector will pop up. This is the key idea of information
</I>&gt;<i> cards: Instead of using a name and password to sign onto a site, your
</I>&gt;<i> selector program will pass an encrypted version of your identity to sites
</I>&gt;<i> you visit. (Microsoft has been distributing with Windows a selector called
</I>&gt;<i> Cardspace&lt;<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/cardspace/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/cardspace/default.mspx</A>&gt;,
</I>&gt;<i> which as far as I can tell nobody uses.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your selector can contain several versions of your identity &#8212; accounts you
</I>&gt;<i> have created with various sites and bits about yourself. And you can choose
</I>&gt;<i> which one you want to present to a given site. One of your cards can contain
</I>&gt;<i> information you provide yourself. You say you are or aren&#8217;t a dog, and a
</I>&gt;<i> site you visit simply trusts you. Other cards contain &#8220;claims&#8221; that are
</I>&gt;<i> backed up by third parties. Banks might provide cards that associate a
</I>&gt;<i> particular account with a particular shipping address, to enable online
</I>&gt;<i> shopping, for example. Governments may well provide the online equivalent of
</I>&gt;<i> a driver&#8217;s license, providing the electronic backup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your selector will show you which cards you have that can prove you are old
</I>&gt;<i> enough to buy alcohol. Click again and your claim is sent off to the wine
</I>&gt;<i> site. Behind the scenes, the wine company zaps some money to Equifax for
</I>&gt;<i> helping avoid being hauled into court for selling to minors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Equifax hopes you&#8217;ll agree to let it spread more of what it knows about
</I>&gt;<i> your buying habits to sites that you visit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Never mind the details, though. If someone was able to make this as simple
</I>&gt;<i> as possible to use, would you want to be able to prove to others online that
</I>&gt;<i> in fact you are a cat?

excellence and rewards effort, which shuns laziness and incompetence -
