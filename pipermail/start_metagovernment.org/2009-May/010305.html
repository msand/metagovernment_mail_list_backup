<PRE>Michael, the StratML standard is still in development.  So services to
support all of the purposes outlined at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A> (as well as others which
we have not envisioned) have not yet emerged.  However, several prototypes
have been developed.  See <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices</A> 

The UID and password for Mark Logic's StratML search service prototype are,
respectively:  stratml_demo &amp; marklogic  Among other things, it provides
advanced search capabilities.  So, for example, it is very easy to determine
that the mission statements in 30 of the 500+ plans in the StratML
collection contain the word &quot;health&quot; and 13 plans contain objectives named
&quot;education&quot;.  However, it is just a prototype so, of course, it does not do
everything we might eventually expect to see in such a service.  For
example, it only indexes StratML documents posted on the xml.gov site and
does not allow others (anyone) to provide the URLs for StratML documents
posted anywhere on the Web.  Nor does it display potentially related
objective statements in a single view for comparison purposes.

I see that Joe Carmel's account has been suspended.
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Carmel">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Carmel</A>  So his demo is apparently no longer
available online.  However, you can see what it looked like by checking out
slides 26 &amp; 27 at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/references/AIIMConference20090402_files/frame.htm">http://xml.gov/stratml/references/AIIMConference20090402_files/frame.htm</A>
Screen shots of the other prototypes are also available there.

Ari Knausenberger's tag cloud demo is available at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Ari">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Ari</A> 

The key point is that each of those service prototypes reuses the very same
StratML documents, all of whose URLs are provided at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/urls.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/urls.xml</A> 

If and, hopefully, when others develop services providing more and better
features like those you are suggesting, I will be happy to post links to
them as well.

True, and these should be reasons enough.  The rewards are there for
anyone who takes the time to look.  Still, I wonder if it might help
to have some kind of demonstration.  Maybe a site to which people can
post their StratML (immediately after encoding it) and see their aims,
resources, etc., in comparison with other projects?  Or is this
already available?
