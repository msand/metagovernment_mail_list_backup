<PRE>Thomas, to some degree, I agree with both you and Jim.  

 

I agree with Jim that the software is immature and it is good that a lot of
different people are experimenting with it.  To that degree, competition is
good.

 

However, I also agree with you that it would be good if the competition
could take place within the context of a larger plan upon which at least
some degree of consensus exists.  Developers could work on different aspects
of the overall plan and/or they could provide extensions to the core set of
features that all such systems should support.  

 

Most importantly, prospective users of such software should insist that it
have the ability to share their data with other services they may wish to
use, in order to avoid vendor lock-in and needless time and trouble
re-creating their data in other systems.  See the open data principles,
particularly principle 7, at
<A HREF="http://wiki.opengovdata.org/index.php/OpenDataPrinciples">http://wiki.opengovdata.org/index.php/OpenDataPrinciples</A> 

 

It would be a shame if stakeholders were to allow the problem of
bureaucratic inertia to be embedded in eGovernance software.  (That would be
an unfortunate example of paving the cow path.)

 

I hope our meeting in the morning will be the beginning of the development
of such a strategic plan:  <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/3">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/3</A>
However, it doesn&#146;t look like many of us are planning to participate.

Thomas-

We should be hoping for MORE projects, not less!   There should not be one
piece of software that everyone uses, that would be terrible.  I believe we
are at an early stage of what will eventually be an entire industry/movement
of such software.

Dear people,

first I want to thank you for deeper exploring possible cooperation between
us!

And I would also like to answer to some doubts concerning this.

I believe, that most of us are very intensively focused on their particular
tasks in their particular project.
But if we just for a moment could loosen this focus a bit and zoom out of
the picture. In this wider picture, isn&#180;t it obvious to see, that our goals
are the same or at least compatible?

Of course: cooperation would take time and energy to communicate, discuss
etc. and finally find consensus on how and what to do. And if a project is
close to completion, it might make no sense to invest that energy for a
future benefit.
Has one of our projects already reached this point?

But there might be another hurdle for cooperation: One&#180;s own identification
with one&#180;s project.
In my case: I had the idea for global, direct e-democracy a few years ago
and started to convince people to work with me on it. Then I found
Metagovernment and realized, that they were much further developed already.
Retrospective it is funny to see, that at first I saw them as competitors. I
was not the first one with this idea and probably would not be the one to
bring it into existence either. This did hurt somehow.
But slowly my identification shifted to Metagovernment. The new &quot;We&quot; was
much bigger now, global and much more powerful, capable of reaching the goal
even faster. Now this felt even better then before!
But then other projects like Votorola, Democracylab, WH2 appeared. Again the
same process: fear of not being in the winning team. lol
A part of me tried to ignore them. Another part compared us, to reassure
myself, that Metagovernment was better.
But finally I found in the other projects such beautiful solutions for
problems I hadn&#180;t even seen yet, that my whole pattern of
self-aggrandizement (at least in this area ;-)) collapsed.
Thank you for this !

Now somehow my focus has shifted to the beautiful energy behind all of our
projects. And I can see, that this energy is the very same in all of us. And
I just can&#180;t chase away the picture of all of us working together. Just
imagine how fast we could get really far!

And like I said, maybe the projects are already developed so far, that soon
we will have a darwian fight among them, which only the fittest one will
survive. But if not, let&#180;s take a moment together to consider what the dead
ends of this evolution are most likely going to be !
After all, one of Metagovernments basic principles is: Consensus through
Synthesis.


With best regards,
Thomas


PS: I just had the idea, that maybe some people with their project are
hoping for the future to create a job with an income. But that would be
equally possible in a joint project, wouldn&#180;t it?
