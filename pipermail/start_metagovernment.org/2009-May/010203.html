<PRE>Dear Ed,
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If neither of those work for you, then who is it that could have a 
</I>&gt;<i> SlashDot-style system running in two days? I cannot. If you can, then 
</I>&gt;<i> please do. I'll give you access to the domain if that's what you 
</I>&gt;<i> require. I cannot force anyone to set up that software, so it is up to 
</I>&gt;<i> you to do so if you think it can be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ah, but you could learn how in several weeks if you cared enough.  But 
you don't.  And if the leader doesn't care, why should I?

This is why I have refused to get involved: I have never been convinced 
you cared enough about the timely success of MetaGovernment for me to 
risk investing my time and energy.  If a 50-year time-line is suitable 
to you, why would I give up my weekend now to set up a Slashdot-type site?

Kind regards,
Robert
