This is a very interesting dialog.  

&gt;<i>From my perspective, a key point is to ensure that no one (individual 
</I>&gt;<i>or
</I>group) be given too much power or have too much influence to cause (much
less force) others to do something they might not otherwise be inclined to
do of their own volition.  Regardless of how smart, well-informed, and
well-intentioned they might be, they are still human and subject to all of
the foibles of humanity, including (among many others):

	faulty memory - <A HREF="http://ambur.net/memorysins.pdf">http://ambur.net/memorysins.pdf</A> 

	irrationality - <A HREF="http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm">http://ambur.net/irrationality.htm</A>

	short-term &amp; narrow thinking (&quot;courting failure&quot;) -

As the saying goes, power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely ...
not necessarily because powerful people are more corrupt but because they
are no &quot;better&quot; than the rest of us human beings.  However, a case could be
made that those who have the urge to dictate to others may be more
susceptible to corruption, and Jean Lipman Blumen argues that we are
inclined to &quot;create&quot; such leaders, if they don't already exist:

Subject: Re: [Start] Level of Abstraction

Thank you folks, for raising and discussing this questions.  I'll just offer
a few technical corrections, related to cascade delegation.

This is incorrect, as Owen has pointed out.  Although Thomas's elderly lady
is no expert on climatalogy, she is very knowledgeable on what she cares
about.  She is probably also capable of asking questions and making
decisions based on the answers.  For example: suppose she lends her vote to
a neighbour, someone more knowledgeable than her about climate change.
Later, she is in discussion with some of the other voters, a small group of
them, all voting for the same delegate.  A question occurs to her:

  My people are originally from a low lying country, and I have family
  there.  Is our policy the best for them?  Or is there a better one?

She then asks this question of the delegate.  Depending on how he answers
(or not), she considers whether to shift her vote to a different delegate,
and perhaps to a different policy.

Manuel was assuming that she was too ignorant to contribute to the decision,
and that only the experts - a self-selected group of them - ought to be
making the decisions.  (I do not think he really feels that way, but just
that he doesn't see an alternative.)

Ed is here speaking of a different kind of delegation, one in which the vote
becomes the property of the delegate, to do with as he pleases.  Cascade
delegation does not work that way.  To begin with, there is nothing vague
about it.  The voter can follow her vote in the cascade, and see where it
ends up.  It ends up at a document.  That document outlines a specific
policy on climate change, and is that policy that she is voting for -
nothing vague.

Nor does she have any dependency on the promises of the delegate.  If she
wants to see a change in the policy, then she goes into the delegate's copy
of the document (on his wiki) and she makes the change herself.  She then
waits, and watches.  Is the change accepted by the delegate, on his next
round of editing?  Does it then cascade further, from delegate to delegate,
toward the end document?  (If not, she will ask the delegate, &quot;Why?&quot;.  At
issue will be her vote.)

I'm starting up my blog again to track the evolution of NationBuilder,
please check it out.  Here's the first post.

<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/</A> Making the
Future&lt;<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/</A>&gt; Published on
May 11, 2009

I?m getting ready to launch NationBuilder &lt;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/">http://nationbuilder.com/</A>&gt; in the
next month or two, so I?m starting my blog back up and even giving it a name
? Make the Future &lt;<A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/</A>&gt;. The name comes from Carl
Pope, the long-time leader of the Sierra Club. In This Brave
Nation&lt;<A HREF="http://bravenation.com/carl_pope_van_jones.php">http://bravenation.com/carl_pope_van_jones.php</A>&gt;,
a documentary series we made at Brave New Films
&lt;<A HREF="http://bravenewfilms.org/">http://bravenewfilms.org/</A>&gt;about a year ago, he said: ?Just take what you
love doing, and do it with enough other people, to make it the future.?

Shortly before the election, I started White House
2&lt;<A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/">http://whitehouse2.org/</A>&gt;to democratically set the agenda for the incoming
Obama administration, and track it like the Nielsen?s TV ratings. There was
so much to be done, I wanted people to think hard about what the priorities
should be ? there was just no way he could do everything at once!

I put the first site up in two weeks, and people from all over the world
started contacting me about bringing it to their country. I?ve been working
non-stop since then, and am about 5-6 weeks away from beta on
NationBuilder&lt;<A HREF="http://nationbuilder.com/">http://nationbuilder.com/</A>&gt;,
a web service that will let anyone set up their own site just like White
House 2.

You can look at White House 2 &lt;<A HREF="http://whitehouse2.org/">http://whitehouse2.org/</A>&gt; and easily see how
this could be used for governments of all kinds, but I believe it can also
be used to bring democracy to business. Successful businesses of the future
need to involve all the stakeholders, whether they are employees,
management, shareholders, or customers. They need to establish the right
incentives, and have tools that work *better* when hundreds of thousands of
people are involved, not worse. Oh, and it has to be fun, or no one will
care.

At Brave New Films, we pretty much turned the documentary world upside down
doing a first generation version of this. We built our own audience, and
then involved them as much as we could in making and distributing the films.
They hosted tens of thousands of screenings, shot footage, took photos of
abandoned
Wal-Marts&lt;<A HREF="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartmovie/tags/abandoned/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/walmartmovie/tags/abandoned/</A>&gt;,
put up half the funding for our last
documentary&lt;<A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/18/</A>
AR2006081800210_pf.html&gt;($260k),
and even suggested the name of the company itself. But the only reason we
were able to do as much as we did, is because I could code anything we might
dream up. There just aren?t many tools designed for companies to operate
like this.

NationBuilder will be a general purpose operating system to run democracies
online, and we?ll use the software itself to run the company. It?s kind of a
far out idea, and I don?t have all the answers on how it should work yet,
but I?m having a ton of fun figuring it out. This blog will track the
evolution of the platform, and show how people can use NationBuilder to,
well, make the future.
