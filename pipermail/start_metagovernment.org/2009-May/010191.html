<PRE>Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!

I would like to introduce myself.
I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its 
beginning.

First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been doing! 
Thank you very much!
I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of 
humanity speaking with one voice.

Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt, 
that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something usable 
to emerge.

But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It&#180;s 
about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White 
House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very 
excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really happen yet.
I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And 
out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion 
with them.
After their introduction this would be our turn.

These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition 
come between us!
Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give away 
our name!
Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.

With fondest regards,
Thomas Hahn
