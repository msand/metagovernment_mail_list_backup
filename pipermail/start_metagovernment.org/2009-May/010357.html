I mean the broader scope of issues. Call it a &quot;context&quot; perhaps. What  
is it which associates different related issues with each other?

Imagine a city government. There may be a proposal to keep the speed  
limit of traffic within the entire city under 25mph (ie 40kph). There  
may be another proposal to limit traffic speeds only in residential  
areas, and make commercial-area speeds vary on a case-by-case basis.  
And there may be another proposal in the city's parent county to not  
limit any speed below 30mph/50kph.

In Metascore, these proposals may be related to each other through  
both user-assigned tags and synthesis scores. But how might they be  
related to each other within the larger context of an open marketplace  
of voting systems? What if one township in the city is using Votorola  
and another is using Metascore, while the county is using  
DemocracyLab? How can people see that these proposals affect each other?

This is not as much of a technical question as a standards-design  
question. We could try to impose a defined set of possible issues (eg:  
traffic, police, environment), but that seems limiting and  
inflexible... and there subject to all kinds of failures. How can  
there be an open, cross-platform system which interrelates different  
proposals to each other across different systems?
