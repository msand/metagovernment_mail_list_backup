<PRE>Thank you people for deeper exploring possible connections!
Feels really good to read :-)

Now I have a question which I believe all of our projects have to answer 
at some point.
That is: How to deal with the level of abstraction of a certain issue?

An old Lady for example, who hears the first time of Climate Change: She 
is shocked and wants something to be done. Maybe she doesnt even know, 
what CO2 is. Confronted with all the competing and very specific 
proposals concerning this issue, she would just be lost and her vote too.

As far as I can see, up to now only DemocracyLab and Votorola explicitly 
deal with this problem.

DemocracyLab integrates an &#8220;Issue Hierarchy: A means of moving from 
general to specific Issues (e.g., Ecomony =&gt; Tax Policy =&gt; Sales Tax).&#8220;
And then every issue (on every level) is split into related values, 
positions, and policies. Which in itself is a hierarchy of abstraction 
again (from abstract values down to specific policies).
As I understand it, one can vote on values, positions, and policies on 
every level of the issue hierarchy.

(a description can be found here: 
<A HREF="https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1118">https://clearspace.democracylab.org/docs/DOC-1118</A>)

Now with DemocracyLab the old Lady would just have to choose the general 
issue of &#8220;Climate change&#8221; and then give her vote to the value 
&#8220;Sustainability&#8221;.
Other more expert users can then link her value to specific policies. 
(How much her vote then counts for these is not explained yet.)


Votorola now solves this problem very elegantly through the possibility 
of a cascade delegation of votes. So the level of abstraction is 
completely variable.
The old Lady would just have to choose between different experts, who 
would then do the job of deciding whether to delegate her vote even 
further or on which specific policies to place her vote on. And of 
course her vote would count as one vote then.

(a description can be found here:

What do you think about these solutions ?

With best regards,
Thomas
