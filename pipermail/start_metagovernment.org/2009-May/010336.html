<PRE>After reading this thread a couple more times, I get the impression, 
that so far there is no fundamental doubt expressed among us concerning 
the value of a network of our projects. But that there instead is a 
general openness to this idea. :-)


I&#180;m no technical guy. Do I see this right, that the automatic exchange 
of new proposals between the projects is easy to handle?

And that there is now only the problem left, of exchanging the data 
about the votes?

And that each vote would need to be exchanged with data regarding the 
voter, the authentication mechanism that he used, and whether or not he 
voted directly or via delegation?

And the user himself could then have statistically displayed all this 
data about every proposal and its votes. And additionally he could 
filter these votes in every way he likes, e.g. how many votes are from 
Germany, how many are cast directly, how many are cast with this or that 
authentication mechanism?


Still very excited,

Thomas
