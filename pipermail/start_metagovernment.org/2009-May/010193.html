<PRE>Thomas, from my perspective, what is lacking is a standard set of data that
is common to all services like these, in a format that can readily be shared
among them.  

With respect to the documentation of missions, visions, values, goals,
objectives, and stakeholders, I hope Strategy Markup Language (StratML) will
become that (international voluntary consensus) standard.

To the degree that service providers fail to come to consensus on a standard
set of data and a common format for sharing such data, they have something
other than the public interest foremost at heart.  Deep analysis is not
required to understand that fact.  The only question is how long their
stakeholders will continue to put up with it until &quot;voting with their feet&quot;
to go elsewhere.

BTW, good ideas are a dime a dozen.  What is rare and thus valuable are good
implementations, and such implementations require good strategic and
performance plans.  It is also very easy to try to tell others what they
should do, rather than focusing on that which we ourselves can and are
willing to do.  That's why I am not particularly interested in sharing,
discussing, or even voting upon &quot;ideas&quot; -- unless they are stated as
objectives against which resources can be applied and actual performance can
be measured.  Moreover, it is not necessarily &quot;votes&quot; that truly count but,
rather, the inputs and efforts each of us is willing and able to contribute
toward realization of our common objectives.

Here's how we proposed to address the distinction between interest and
commitment in the ET.gov process:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/draft/ETLifeCycleStage2.htm">http://xml.gov/draft/ETLifeCycleStage2.htm</A>  Thus far we've been unable to
marshal the resources to implement those &quot;good ideas&quot;.  However, making
reality speak more clearly for itself (even when it is not as we have hoped)
is among the principles under which the ET.gov site/process was developed:
<A HREF="http://et.gov/history.htm">http://et.gov/history.htm</A> (Thus far the reality is that .gov agencies have
not shown much inclination to work together in a well-coordinated manner to
accelerate the consideration and use of emerging technologies for the
benefit of We the People.)

Candidates for inclusion in Part 2 of the StratML standard, which will
address the elements of performance plans and reports, are listed at

Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!

I would like to introduce myself.
I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its 
beginning.

First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been doing! 
Thank you very much!
I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of 
humanity speaking with one voice.

Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt, 
that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something usable 
to emerge.

But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It&#180;s 
about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White 
House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very 
excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really happen yet.
I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And 
out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion 
with them.
After their introduction this would be our turn.

These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition 
come between us!
Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give away 
our name!
Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.

With fondest regards,
Thomas Hahn
