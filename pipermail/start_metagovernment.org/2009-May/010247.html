<PRE>The WH2 platform will be called NationBuilder, so I'm going to start using
that name here.

It's kind of hard for me to lay out the goal, mostly because there are goals
on a lot of different levels, but also because I'm still figuring out how to
succinctly communicate my vision.  But here goes..

I want to provide tools for people to organize themselves democratically
(democracy, not anarchy) online and make things happen.  I'm less concerned
with figuring out the proper way to put together a bill, and more concerned
with connecting people and resources together to actually do things, whether
the context is their city, their country, or their company, doesn't matter.

To use more business-like language, I believe the successful endeavors of
the future will be all about bringing all the &quot;stakeholders&quot; together,
whether it's citizens, employees, management, customers, shareholders,
whoever, into a network that can achieve things that weren't possible before
in a top down management system.  A &quot;nation&quot; is the metaphor I'm using to
pull this concept together into something I can evangelize, hence the name,
NationBuilder.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but that's just for people's suggestions for the site itself.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe there's a way to answer Thomas without going into technical
</I>&gt;<i> details, disclosing competitive secrets, etc.  If you're willing, I'd
</I>&gt;<i> like to ask you a series of questions regarding (a) the aims of WH2;
</I>&gt;<i> (b) the general technical facilities to achieve those aims; and (c)
</I>&gt;<i> the steps that are involved once the facilities are in place.  I could
</I>&gt;<i> ask these questions of any project, but I'll start with you.  Aside
</I>&gt;<i> from Telematics Freedom, which is currently bound to silence, yours is
</I>&gt;<i> the project that I know least about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea is to discover potential points of synergy, where WH2 can
</I>&gt;<i> collaborate with other projects.  Synergy is not entirely a question
</I>&gt;<i> of aims (I agree with you and Pietro) but let's begin there:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  a) What is the aim of the project?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So for example, in regard to Votorola, I would answer that the aim is
</I>&gt;<i> a direct democracy (plus).  I would then add a few sentences of
</I>&gt;<i> explanation, defining roughly what I mean by a direct democracy (and
</I>&gt;<i> by the &quot;plus&quot;).  I might say that I mean the transfer of decision
</I>&gt;<i> making from government and political parties to the general
</I>&gt;<i> population, such that people at large decide who holds official power,
</I>&gt;<i> what policies they pursue, what plans they enact, and what laws they
</I>&gt;<i> pass.  (By the &quot;plus&quot;, I might say the same thing, but with regard to
</I>&gt;<i> socio-cultural issues that are normally beyond the scope of
</I>&gt;<i> governmental power.  These too would be deliberately decided by people
</I>&gt;<i> at large.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you answer in the same pattern?  (Can other projects answer, too?
</I>&gt;<i> Owen, is this a good approach to take, in response to Thomas's plea?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; re: your questions on wh2
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm pursuing the Wordpress model.  There will be a downloadable version
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; folks can install themselves, and then there will be a hosted version
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; any one can sign up for and customize, similar to ning.com.  They will
</I>&gt;<i> be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the same code base (I hope), multi-lingual, and open source.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The requirements to install the software are a bit more complex than
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Wordpress (it needs memcached installed, search software, etc.), and I
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; want to spend time trying to help people get it installed right now, so
</I>&gt;<i> I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; putting all my efforts into getting the hosted version into beta in about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 5-6 weeks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I'm personally commited to a distributed pattern, one site per
</I>&gt;<i>  town/region.  But there shouldn't be any insurmountable technical
</I>&gt;<i>  hurdle to migrating from one pattern to the other, or to sitting on
</I>&gt;<i>  the fence and straddling both.  Logically speaking, it's all the
</I>&gt;<i>  same.  The differences are economic and social.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pricing of the hosted version will be unique (not advertising) and in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keeping with the concepts embodied in the platform.  I'm keeping it a
</I>&gt;<i> secret
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at the moment in hopes I can get some buzz out of it when I announce.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I speculate that Jim has discovered a way of mixing money into the
</I>&gt;<i>  fabric of democracy - but a good way, not a bad way.)
