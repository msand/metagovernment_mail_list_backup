<PRE>Hi all,

It's good to trade ideas out in the open.  I only hope organizers like
Ed and Giovani aren't getting the impression that it's first and
foremost a technical problem - that inter-project cooperation depends
on agreeing to specific solutions on voter identity and
authentication, and so forth.  I'm worried they're shaking their heads
and saying to themselves:

   And what next?  There are just too many hurdles.  There's no point
   even *talking* about cooperation at an organization level until
   they sort out their technical differences.

Truth is - and see if you agree - we have no technical disagreements
at an *architectural* level - not on anything - and that's all that
matters to project leaders.  See if you follow me...

Exactly true.  And maybe we even *must* have different ones, all side
by side.

Giovani can confirm: the purpose of authentication is to tie online
identity (ID) to some other property such as a physical residence
(traditional voter register) or physical body (biometric signature).
For a given ID, one method could tie it to a residence:

  ID definitely lives on 522 Main Street

Another could tie it to a body:

  ID definitely has retinal pattern R

And so on, for all the other *authentic* properties of ID that anyone
might care about.  There can even be 6 different auth methods for a
given property - say residential address - provided by 6 different
auth services.  The more the better.  We actually *want* multiple auth
methods, auth services.

</I>
I agree that we should use whatever ID format is the accepted
standard.  However, it need not carry authentication data in itself.
The ID is just a unique online name.  Authentication is a separate
concern.

Biometrics auth is interesting though.  I never considered anything
beyond residential auth, and it really gets me thinking...  it's all
bigger than I thought, just 2 weeks ago!

True, because the only authenticated property here is that ID has lots
of online friends.  (Lucky for him, that can be helpful! :) And it
could be helpful for other voters to know this, in some cases.  In
those cases, voters could filter the results, &quot;Show me the same poll
results, but now include only people who are popular online&quot; (?
maybe).

&gt;<i> Then of course there is the issue that some system do not need user
</I>&gt;<i> identification, but this is another ball game. Many system do need it,
</I>&gt;<i> so we better prepare for that.
</I>
(So we're as open as possible to all systems, to all newcomers, and
 new ideas.  I agree, and it seems like a strategy that nobody can
 compete against!  We could only win at it.)

This is essentially how Votorola's trust network is coded.
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust</A>

&gt;<i> Clustering by verifications may allow to find people who are trying to game
</I>&gt;<i> the system, since fake identities should only be verified by few conspireing
</I>&gt;<i> people. I'm not sure about this though, sounds like a research topic.
</I>
We hammered out a basic design sketch for a neighbourhood trust
network (strictly for residential auth) in open discussions, a couple
of years ago:
<A HREF="http://lists.hmdc.harvard.edu/lists/apsa_itp_at_lists_hmdc_harvard_edu/2007_08/threads.html">http://lists.hmdc.harvard.edu/lists/apsa_itp_at_lists_hmdc_harvard_edu/2007_08/threads.html</A>

It cannot easily be gamed if all trust edges are traceable to a
trusted root node (admin/registrar).  There can be no circular islands
of trust.  But there are other pitfalls, and it didn't take long for
those political scientists and sociologists to see the biggest one!
(Fortunately, it was easy to correct.)

I bet we'll get lots of research help if we come together and start
working on this in open fashion.  Our open networks - register,
polling, authentication, discussion and discourse, brainstorming,
classification, analysis, simulation, etc. - could serve as testbeds
in which researchers float their lab apps, and from which they draw a
bunch of empirical data for their studies.  If we help them, they will
probably help us, too.

So maybe we'll soon be able to give a technical thumbs up to Ed,
Giovani, and other project leaders (anyone else listening) that we can
do this stuff.  The hurdles don't seem to be technical.  What do you
think?
