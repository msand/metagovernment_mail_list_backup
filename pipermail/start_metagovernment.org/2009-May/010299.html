<PRE>I should elaborate somewhat.

The problems I see:

   - It is to early we need to be as flexible as possible creating in api at
   this
   point will very likely introduce bad design decisions and slow us down.
   - Their is no need for one yet. As soon as people start asking for
   extract
   data from an existing system we can think about it.
   - I see great misunderstandings about what an api is here. All of the
   above examples describe data structures and NOT an api.

Why we eventually need a good api:
Interacting and exchanging data with other sites is vital.
Imagen not being able to embed utube videos in other sites or getting data
for statistics firefox plugins and what not.
Communication and interaction between programs is what an api is for.

Why we do not need a data standard:
How a community wants to format its data and what it means are very personal
and different for each community. Their is no way we can devise a structure
is not either overdesignd or inadequite.
We are currenty designing metascore to be as agnostic as possible in this
regard using only flat text files.
Their are great tools today to enable community to define their
datastructures for example with an XML Schema
