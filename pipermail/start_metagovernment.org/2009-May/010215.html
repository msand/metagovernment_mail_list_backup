<PRE>Thanks, Owen,

Your comments speak to some of the challenges I have had with getting more
involved with the project.

As a ux designer, I am most interested in what someone experiences when
using the system. The simple things, such as any confusion that might arise
from a misplaced button in the application, by definition, are easier to
solve than larger issues such as the process of decision making, along with
feedback to ensure that the user realizes their choices make a difference.
However, before tackling the larger issues, I believe it is necessary to
define &quot;metaphorical environment&quot; in which a user experiences the
application. For example, are we headed to the official statehouse to cast
our one-time vote, or are we gathering together in small, intimate groups,
and sharing our thoughts within a completely dynamic environment?

I believe that once the software is working for us as a group, then it would
be more obvious as to what it should be called. Neither government or
governance is specific enough for my tastes, as I would expect my tax ID and
official services to be a part of government, and the laws and regulations
to be a part of governance -- but that is just me. I would propose that we
keep Metagovernment, possibly branding it metaGovernment, and build the
components separately, such as metaScore (or metaVote) to monitor the votes,
metaRule to define all of the laws and regulations that people vote on,
metaPlace to see my local services, and so forth.
