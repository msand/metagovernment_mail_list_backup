that's right.

</I>The problem is not really the cost here. Is the trust. If Verisign or
any other &quot;proprietary&quot; company does the &quot;certification&quot;, how to avoid
corruption and all other problems inherent of dealing with private orgs?
Our user-verifiable telematics project aims to create a
&quot;community-managed certifying authority&quot;, that will ensure openness 
and  transparency in this process. We are now writing a new EU grant
about this, and the Free Software Foundation Europe has given their go
to join as a partner (although they don't want to commit to write the
project). The deadline is June 2, I am not sure we will make it this
time because we are in the beginning, but we'll try.

</I>&gt;<i> using their own trust network.  Here's one implementation (half

</I>&gt;<i> I guess other people will have ideas, too.  No problem, because if we
