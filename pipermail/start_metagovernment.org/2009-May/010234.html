</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, to end up with this, I would ask to remove any FP7 reference in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> metagovernment's wiki if this brings problems to the &quot;principle of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openness&quot; you are referring to.
</I>&gt;<i> This may be the best thing to do. But I will not remove it myself yet as
</I>&gt;<i> most of the active Metascore people have not expressed their opinion
</I>&gt;<i> on the issue and I would like to know what they think before doing so.
</I>
Hmm, I am strongly against it. If not for any other reason because
this has the effect of muddling the waters. The page of the FP7 should
remain as a document of something that has happened:

FP7 was a project that came into being by members of this community.
Not as an action of the community, but as a separate action of those
members. As such it have many of the objectives of the community, much
of the work of the FP7 will in future come back to this community. I
do understand that it somehow disturbs you, Fabian, that things just
cannot be so nice and pure. It happens. I will tell you more, if the
FP7 will suceed there will be place for some PhD students. And some of
the people in this list might apply. We have already spoken about
this. Think how complicated would things become then...

So the FP7 is part of the history of this community. And if it
suceeds, it should even go in the CV of the community:

This community is a crossroad of people with similar interest.
 And it has succeeded in many things: we gave those talks.
Our members did those things...

And so on.

Up to here I spoke in a somehow objective way. Now I will speak in a
personal way. I am actually angry (!); I was the person who was in the
FP7 being the bridge between metagovernment and the FP7. Trying to
keep a connection between the two groups. A lot of the goals, and the
suggestions in the FP7 propoals came from this list. The FP7 owns a
lot to this list. It does it in an indirect way. But it definitly does
it.

Now, maybe Giovani would rather have this connection forgotten, so
next time I ask for some documents to become public, I cannot appeal
to metagovernment. Fabian might want to have it deleted, so he does
not feel that he belongs to a dirty list that got his hands
compromised.

But the FP7 is a project that came into being thanks to this list. It
is a separate project. It cannot be disowed, and it also cannot be
required to comply to the strict rules that we keep between ourselves.

It's like a kid. Let it grow, let it be itself, and let it remember
who his parents are.
