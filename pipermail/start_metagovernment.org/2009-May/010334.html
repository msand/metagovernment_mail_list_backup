<PRE>Hi,

Thanks Michael, Thomas and Ed for taking my summary seriously and taking
this discussions forward. Again my thoughts on the comments are
interleaved....

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  1. 'Stakeholder involvement' rather than anyone's (outsider's)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    involvement.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    The problem here, I guess, is that the projects are split on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    whether or not to enforce this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    But there's a technical solution to that, right?  The user can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    filter out the votes at a higher level according to the criterion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    of stakeholder involvement - or not filter them.  So we can have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    it both ways.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By user, do you mean admin?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any event, the idea of stakeholdership does not have to be strictly
</I>&gt;<i> enforced across the board. All we need is some common standard that can
</I>&gt;<i> place the user geographically, such as a postal code, perhaps?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To me, user and stakeholder is the community member. Admin should be a open
system of coordinators for the tool functioning.

The user can be defined by the community and filters set. For example, I own
a piece of land in my home town where drip irrigation is done. But I am
presently employed in the city. I should be eligible to vote on the land
issue.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Ed is warning us that this could slow up the deployment, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    restrict its reach.  But again, there's maybe a technical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    solution: what if the authentication facility has an on/off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    switch?  Or better yet, what if it's got varying authentication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    levels, some that impose a lighter admin/user burden?  Then we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (admins) can just dial up whatever level we like, or turn it off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Also, there's different ideas on how to design this.  But maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    that's no problem either.  We can be open to multiple solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (see 4).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question here, from the Metagovernment point of view, is: who gets to
</I>&gt;<i> be the admin? The Metascore team's solution is to work toward a DVCS model
</I>&gt;<i> where there is no singular admin in charge of a community, but it still
</I>&gt;<i> seems like there is some basic software administration going on (or am I
</I>&gt;<i> just not understanding it correctly?), and I still see problems with having
</I>&gt;<i> a privileged user, as that opens a clear avenue for corruption.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as to the question of identity, it seems like the best solution is an
</I>&gt;<i> external one. That should make standardization much easier. My vote here,
</I>&gt;<i> however, would be to ensure that it is not a commercial one; again for fear
</I>&gt;<i> of undue influence.
</I>&gt;<i> Ed, what is DVCS model? What is external solution to identity? How would it
</I>&gt;<i> help standardization? What is a commercial solution and how would it bring
</I>&gt;<i> undue influence?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
To me a unique identity is an uncompromising identity of a person and should
not be left to a chance or debated or voted  by any one.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (I guess we all want this, if we can have it.  In that case, 2 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     part of the solution.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as Pietro notes, Metascore and Vilfredo may not have this
</I>&gt;<i> requirement, as they have internal maths to correct for multiple identities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the question of votes-per-user should be entirely internal to any
</I>&gt;<i> particular solution and not require a cross-platform standard.
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I am in agreeemnt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   4. Delegating for proxy voting.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    The problem here is that some of us like the idea of delegation -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    depending on how its done - and some of us do not.  So this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    divides us, and divides the projects.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    But we figure there's a technical solution here too: If we can
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    agree on open standards, then we can have multiple voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    networks side-by-side, eh?  We'd try out all the different ideas,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    and see what works best.  And see what the voters like.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right. Like #3, it is an internal issue and not a cross-platform question.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I am in agreement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
My two cents.

Kris Dev
