<PRE>Just to clarify, &quot;consensus&quot; does not necessarily imply unanimity. See  
for example <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Consensus">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Talk:Consensus</A>

In very small groups (ie, &lt;15 people), I think it will equate to  
something like 100% consent, but as we get into larger groups, the  
percentage which defines consensus will have top drop considerably. I  
would not like to see it drop below a substantial majority, such as  
67%, but I cannot think of any issue whatsoever that can achieve 100%  
accord in a very large group.

As for what to call ourselves, I thought the question at hand was what  
to call the software, not the project. &quot;Metagovernment&quot; was chosen in  
large part because the domain name was available, but as the project  
grows, it seems to be rather appropriate. &quot;Metascore,&quot; however,  
doesn't really convey much and could probably benefit from an overhaul.

</I>&gt;<i> Besides &#8220;synthesis,&#8221; other key concepts in the group&#8217;s charter

</I>&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given a choice, I would like to move away from the word &quot;Government&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> as &quot;Govern&quot; means 'to rule a country, to control or direct the  
</I>&gt;<i> public affairs of a city, country, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe we are creating an ICT enabled system of self  
</I>&gt;<i> administration of the members, by the members, for the members  
</I>&gt;<i> (electronic Self Administration - &quot;eSA&quot; or &quot;eAdmn&quot; or &quot;Open Self  
</I>&gt;<i> Administration Tool&quot; (&quot;OSAT&quot;) or &quot;Transparency &amp; Accountability  
</I>&gt;<i> (TrAc) Tool&quot; or &quot;MetaSelf&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If none of these find favor with many, &quot;MetaGov&quot; can be the option.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My two cents....
