<PRE>I would like to thank you all for your extensive and clarifying answers.
Since Manu, Regina and I met recently to discus the future development
direction,  I would like to use the opportunity to give a status update.

We will start making significant changes to metascore based on the
experience and feedback we have had so far.
We are aiming to make it allot simpler and easier to use without loosing any
of the core advantages of the distributed model.

   - The biggest change will be that users no longer collect changes in
   their own repositories and sharing them between each other to then make a
   proposal. Instead users can make changes to the repository which will create
   or be added to an existing &quot;Bill&quot;. The &quot;Bill&quot; can then be proposed and the
   changes applied if accepted.

This a broad change and has a some side effects:

   1. The interface will become simpler as the number of use cases and
   states are reduced.
   2. The concept of making and collaboratively editing a Bill seems to
   easier to understand for people. Although it is same but just from a
   different &quot;angle&quot;.
   3. The simplification should result in a smaller/cleaner and better
   maintainable code base.
   4. Users repositories will no longer be hosted. This means some advanced
   versioning features can only be available to people who know how to use
   mercurial (the dvcs used by metascore). In retrospect a better idea as
   anyone who needs them (read coders) would rather use mercural anyway.


   - Moving away from a hosted model like source forge. This will simplify
   the interface somewhat and make it more adaptable for an individual
   community. We will gladly host individual communities via sub-domains when
   requested.


   - We will remove the issues as they were not used/understood. When we
   have refined most important aspects we will think about a question/agenda
   system like Vilfredo which serves much of the same purpose.


   - We will move the discussion a bit more into the background like
   wikipedia and focus more the most important things.


On a site note Manu and I were recently taking about metascore (the name
itself) and how it doesn't really reflect the purpose of the software.
Metagoverment is a great name, if you tell somebody about it they have good
starting point but that's not much the case with metascore.
Should rename the software to something more fitting and if yes any
suggestions?
