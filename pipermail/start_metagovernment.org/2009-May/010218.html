<PRE>Nice! That is a very simplistic (in a good way) implementation of our  
perhaps overly-complex idea of a synthesis score:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#Synthesis_scoring">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Scoring_system#Synthesis_scoring</A>

And as for US politics being contentious... name any political process  
on any level that is not. My old 50-person office had more cutting  
political disputes than I see on the news shows. :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Interesting that you chimed in here, Jim, as I was about to  
</I>&gt;<i> reiterate my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; feeling that WhiteHouse2.org seems like a good possible codebase for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Metascore. As not-really-a-programmer, I don't know if this is  
</I>&gt;<i> realistic,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but I wanted to get the opinions of you, Manuel/Fabe (et al), and  
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the possibility of using your code with Pietro's scoring algorithm  
</I>&gt;<i> and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Manuel's DVCS deployment idea.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Each represents a real strength: WH2 is very well developed (not  
</I>&gt;<i> just that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it is far along, but it is also very well done overall), Pietro's  
</I>&gt;<i> scoring
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system is itself very well thought out and highly innovative, and  
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; existing Metascore's DVCS model is both ingenious and seemingly  
</I>&gt;<i> vital to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; system which wants to be an actual governance mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's leave aside DVCS for a moment.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is a level of complication that a single online community  
</I>&gt;<i> rarely needs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have been wondering if WH2 could be integrated with the pareto
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm for a long time. The answer is: not easily. The way the
</I>&gt;<i> pareto front works is theough questions, proposals, endorsements, and
</I>&gt;<i> generations. It requires an interactive experience from the comunity
</I>&gt;<i> that goes through many inputs (sometimes through many days, but it can
</I>&gt;<i> easily be done in 1 hour, if everybody is online at the same time).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> How you pose the question is fundamental. If you are speaking about
</I>&gt;<i> abortion, and you ask:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -what shall we do to the assassins that kill their own babies when
</I>&gt;<i> they are still in the womb against the law of the only true Lord,
</I>&gt;<i> Jesus Christ.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> or you are asking:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -what shall we do to the fanatics that keep on deciding for us about
</I>&gt;<i> our body by forcing us to accept unwanted pregnancies, only to satisfy
</I>&gt;<i> their sense of guilt to an unexistant god.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you can see how they are both adressing a related issue (although they
</I>&gt;<i> are not the same question), but the point of view, is &quot;somehow&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> different ;-). So whoever starts the question has an insane amunt of
</I>&gt;<i> power. We have seen this already in those days in the prototype. A few
</I>&gt;<i> questions had quite a strong spin.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if you are inserting Al Pareto (Algorithm Pareto, brother of Al
</I>&gt;<i> Capone :) ) inside WH2, you are essentially going to first of all
</I>&gt;<i> decide who asks what question. Then you have to decide the topic (is
</I>&gt;<i> this health? religion? public order?). All those are going to be top
</I>&gt;<i> down decisions, that some people will not agree with. Now there are
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly fine bottom up ways to go around both of them. FOr the topic
</I>&gt;<i> issue, the tags will be the solution (we shall explore this in the
</I>&gt;<i> FP7). For the question, the way to go over it is to  ask a
</I>&gt;<i> metaquestion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> -Our community is split on people who want abortion to be legal, and
</I>&gt;<i> people who do not want it to be legal. What question would better help
</I>&gt;<i> in finding a proposal that heals this fracture?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then you find a question on which everybody agrees (this is much
</I>&gt;<i> easier than solving the problem, I bet the number of generations here
</I>&gt;<i> necessary to find an agreement might be only few.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes finding a good metaquestion is as difficult as finding a
</I>&gt;<i> good question. Which is why I have used it only one time. Generally
</I>&gt;<i> you use a meta question when a community has already decided they want
</I>&gt;<i> to ask a question, but they an't really make their mind on how to
</I>&gt;<i> formulate it. Why am I saying all this? Because WH2, with the kind of
</I>&gt;<i> people that is attracting, will have some serious problems in how
</I>&gt;<i> questions get spinned. To the point that it might make sense for Jim
</I>&gt;<i> to make some top down decisions, and ask the question himself. Or ask
</I>&gt;<i> the metaquestions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then there is the whole issue of the proposals, and the endorsments.
</I>&gt;<i> In short you really would have to remake the whole engine of WH2. So I
</I>&gt;<i> am not sure if I were to suggest it. I think WH2 is fine as it is for
</I>&gt;<i> now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other issue is why Vilfredo was done as it is. The idea was not
</I>&gt;<i> just to make a website that works, but also to make it with the least
</I>&gt;<i> number of assumptions. It is spartane in its very nature. A bit like
</I>&gt;<i> delicious in the first years. This because we want to show that it is
</I>&gt;<i> really Al PAreto that is making Vilfredo do its magic, and not
</I>&gt;<i> something else. We do envision for Al Pareto a future in which it
</I>&gt;<i> would be used as an engine in other projects. Like having a plugin for
</I>&gt;<i> Drupal, and an application for Facebook. So yes, eventually Al Pareto
</I>&gt;<i> could be used inside other systems. But the systems need to permit it.
</I>&gt;<i> Either by running external applications, or by being designed in a way
</I>&gt;<i> that fits Al Pareto.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You see, part of the program is that being so different it just does
</I>&gt;<i> not fit many of the assumption that we usually make. For example that
</I>&gt;<i> the number of people endorsing something has any importance. And it is
</I>&gt;<i> very easy to break by inserting unneeded limits, like permitting to a
</I>&gt;<i> person to endorse only x proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So my proposal is:
</I>&gt;<i> while we are in this phase,
</I>&gt;<i> with me writing the VgtA paper,
</I>&gt;<i> waiting for the FP7 decisions,
</I>&gt;<i> why don't you try the website out, maybe asking also there the open
</I>&gt;<i> question you would like to have answered. And trying to use it as a
</I>&gt;<i> group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Of course, as I write this, I now noticed Fabian's update on the  
</I>&gt;<i> progress of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the existing Metascore prototype. I do not by any means wish to  
</I>&gt;<i> simply throw
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; away that development, but I continue to wonder (hope) if there  
</I>&gt;<i> might be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; way to integrate some of the cool programming Jim has done with WH2.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If not... no big. I very much like what I just heard from Fabian,  
</I>&gt;<i> and I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; agree with Jim that this project has been a good meeting point for  
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;tribe&quot; of open source governance folks.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other thing which continues to distinguish this project is its  
</I>&gt;<i> focus on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; providing actual governance instead of simply informing the  
</I>&gt;<i> opinions of our
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; betters... I mean, our representatives. That sets us apart as  
</I>&gt;<i> being the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; third generation in the development of eDemocracy systems, so it

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; beginning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been  
</I>&gt;<i> doing!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all  
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I  
</I>&gt;<i> felt,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something  
</I>&gt;<i> usable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to emerge.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of  
</I>&gt;<i> us. It&#180;s
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab,  
</I>&gt;<i> White
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was  
</I>&gt;<i> very
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really  
</I>&gt;<i> happen yet.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us.  
</I>&gt;<i> And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned  
</I>&gt;<i> discussion
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; with them.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let  
</I>&gt;<i> competition
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; come between us!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily
