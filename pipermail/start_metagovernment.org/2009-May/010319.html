Last time I looked, I couldn't find English docs for DemoEx.  Nothing
but this abstract:

  Karin Ottesen.  2003.  Flexible representation by use of delegated
  voting - a case study of practical use.

  A new and unique function in one of the information technology tools
  that nowadays are in use to strengthen democracy is flexible
  representation by delegated voting. This function is to find in
  NetConference Plus, a conference system developed by Vivarto AB. A
  political organization, Demoex in Vallentuna, is the first
  organization to use the function for delegated voting. The purpose
  of this essay is to investigate this use of the function, how the
  members of the organization values the function and its included
  parts, whether the function serves its purpose and to suggest
  measures that ought to be taken to improve the function. In order to
  find the answers to these questions a web survey has been carried
  out, interviews have been done and voting statistics have been
  collected from the system. The conclusions that can be drawn from
  the body of information are that the members of the organization are
  generally positive to the function and its included parts, but at
  present the use degree is relatively low. The results also indicates
  that the function probably serves its purpose, which is to decrease
  the press laid upon the participants and increase the number of
  given votes in every certain voting. Measures that ought to be taken
  to facilitate further use of the function are extended information
  and elimination of technical and strategic problems.

I'm not sure exactly how the voting worked, only that it was by
recursive delegation.  More refs to recursive delegation:

The only app I know of that saw public use (aside from DemoEx) was
Rodriguez and Steinbock's research prototype.  But that was for
non-political issues.
