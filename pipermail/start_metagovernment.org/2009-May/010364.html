<PRE>this is a perennial internet problem that still hasn't been solved.  for
example, 10 years ago verisign had a service that verified individuals, it
was a natural extension of verifying businesses, but it never got traction.

<A HREF="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/a-service-to-prove-you-are-really-you/">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/a-service-to-prove-you-are-really-you/</A>

May 19, 2009, *10:39 am* A Service to Prove You Are Really You By Saul
Hansell &lt;<A HREF="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/author/saul-hansell/">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/author/saul-hansell/</A>&gt;

On the Internet, nobody knows you&#8217;re a dog, as the New Yorker cartoon
famously said. But what if, while you are surfing, you want to prove your
pedigree?

Equifax, the big credit agency that already knows more about your flea count
than you do, wants to help.

It is developing a service &lt;<A HREF="http://equifaxicards.com/">http://equifaxicards.com/</A>&gt; that will let you
create an online identity that can assert various &#8220;claims&#8221; that it will back
up. To an online wine merchant, it might back you up when you say you are of
legal age. If you are applying to open a bank account, the company might
vouch for your entire profile, including name, address, birthday and Social
Security number.

Ron Carpinella, Equifax&#8217;s vice president for ID management, said the service
might even be of use on a blog. &#8220;Think of all the people using false
identities on blogs to post 15 different comments on something,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We can prevent that.&#8221;

Consumers won&#8217;t pay anything for this, as Equifax envisions the service.
Rather, Web site owners will pay money for a better way to trust that what
users tell them is true.

Mr. Carpinella would not say how much the company expected the fees to be.
There is another year of testing before the service goes to market. But he
did say he envisions a broad range of prices, depending on the information
being verified. A publisher that wanted simple identity information might
pay fractions of a dollar, while a banking site might pay several dollars.

Credit bureaus like Equifax already offer sites a way to verify the
identities of users. You may have seen this when you tried to open a new
bank or credit card account and you were presented with some multiple choice
questions asking you to verify where you got your mortgage or car loan (the
sort of facts a credit bureau knows about you).

This new initiative hopes to piggyback on an elaborate attempt to create an
industry standard called Information Card &lt;<A HREF="http://informationcard.net/">http://informationcard.net/</A>&gt; that
is meant to let people log into many sites with one account. If that reminds
you of Microsoft Passport, it should, because the proposed standard combines
work done by Microsoft to create an improved identity service with similar
efforts by some of its rivals. Microsoft wants to use this technology both
for people to sign on to corporate networks and for consumers to identify
themselves to Web sites they use.

Whether the broader Information Card effort has any chance of taking off is
a topic for another day. Information Card is far more complex, and thus
harder to use, than Open ID, a standard that lets you use your name and
password from one site, say Google, to sign onto another site, for example,
Facebook &lt;<A HREF="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_openid_good.php">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/why_facebook_openid_good.php</A>&gt;.
But that complexity enables some extra features and possible protection
against fraud.

Equifax is on to something. There are times when you want someone you are
dealing with online to know you really are you. Amazon&#8217;s product reviews
became more trustworthy when the company started
identifying&lt;<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14279641">http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14279641</A>&gt;those
written by people whose names were validated by way of their credit
card accounts.

So let&#8217;s look at how the technology might work with the sort of service
Equifax is proposing.

Say you are shopping for a bottle of wine; the site you visit might display
the Information Card icon (a purple letter I). Click it, and a piece of
software called a selector will pop up. This is the key idea of information
cards: Instead of using a name and password to sign onto a site, your
selector program will pass an encrypted version of your identity to sites
you visit. (Microsoft has been distributing with Windows a selector called
Cardspace&lt;<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/cardspace/default.mspx">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/cardspace/default.mspx</A>&gt;,
which as far as I can tell nobody uses.)

Your selector can contain several versions of your identity &#8212; accounts you
have created with various sites and bits about yourself. And you can choose
which one you want to present to a given site. One of your cards can contain
information you provide yourself. You say you are or aren&#8217;t a dog, and a
site you visit simply trusts you. Other cards contain &#8220;claims&#8221; that are
backed up by third parties. Banks might provide cards that associate a
particular account with a particular shipping address, to enable online
shopping, for example. Governments may well provide the online equivalent of
a driver&#8217;s license, providing the electronic backup.

Your selector will show you which cards you have that can prove you are old
enough to buy alcohol. Click again and your claim is sent off to the wine
site. Behind the scenes, the wine company zaps some money to Equifax for
helping avoid being hauled into court for selling to minors.

Equifax hopes you&#8217;ll agree to let it spread more of what it knows about your
buying habits to sites that you visit.

Never mind the details, though. If someone was able to make this as simple
as possible to use, would you want to be able to prove to others online that
in fact you are a cat?
