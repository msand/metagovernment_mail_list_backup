The way I see it, the FP7 proposal is not explicitly a Metagovernment  
project, but rather a related project which hopefully we can integrate  
with. As we are currently an adhocracy, there is no real issue with  
individual members acting as they please and disclosing as they  
please, as long as this organization maintains its principles.

</I>
I'm not sure we even need money for servers. I was under the  
impression that the development model you and Manuel were working  
under was very much the open source software model, where you are  
simply developing a tool which any community can choose to use. Like  
Apache or a bulletin board. In that case, money seems superfluous to  
the project. That said, the FP7 project's aims are for intensive  
scholarly research, and such projects generally entail grants in order  
to enable grad students to eat while they dedicate themselves to the  
research.
