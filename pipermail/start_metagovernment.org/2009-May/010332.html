<PRE>Sorry for not joining in earlier, ...but I was really busy lately.

Now. I find the new ideas in this list absolutely fascinating and very 
exciting.
Especially Michaels idea of a larger network of voting-projects, which 
automatically exchanges data about votes, new proposals, etc. It seems 
to me just like the consequent implementation of Owens more than 
legitimate claim:

&quot;Most importantly, prospective users of such software should insist that it
have the ability to share their data with other services they may wish to
use, in order to avoid vendor lock-in and needless time and trouble
re-creating their data in other systems.
It would be a shame if stakeholders were to allow the problem of
bureaucratic inertia to be embedded in eGovernance software. (That would be
an unfortunate example of paving the cow path.)&quot;

And it would be a beautiful answer to Ed&#180;s suggestion:

&quot;There are areas of our various projects that are too different to find 
a common platform, but there are some things (the idea and perhaps the 
format of a law/ policy, for example) that could be standardized into a 
common format of some kind... aren't there?&quot;

Translated into Ed&#180;s metaphor about the nonsense of a singular computing 
platform (e.g., Windows) vs. the sense of a singular network (i.e., the 
internet): each voting project would be the variable computing platform 
(e.g., Windows) and the exchange of the data would take place in a 
singular network (the internet).

This way, each project could still pursue its own goal. Metagovernment 
for example: to produce proposals of a very high quality. Whereas WH2 
and Votorola: to reach as many people as possible.
And each would benefit from the other.

I&#180;m very excited about all the new possibilities arising here!
This is all now far beyond what I was initially dreaming of, when I 
first got involved in edemocracy!

Thank you all!
Thomas
