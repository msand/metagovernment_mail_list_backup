<PRE>I put a disclaimer in the FP7 page, to avoid further  
misinterpretations (I used some sentences from some of you directly).  
Please tweak it, because it doesn't seem perfect. Also, I have  
retired the FP7 point from the next's meeting agenda.

&quot;Disclaimer: This page is an idea pool for the FP7 proposal, not the  
proposal itself; this latter cannot be published before the selection  
of proposals has been done by the FP7 organizers&#8212;mostly because other  
groups who are competing with us might steal ideas. At first view, it  
would seem that the radical transparency principle adopted by  
Metagovernment is committed. The FP7 proposal is not explicitly a  
Metagovernment project, but rather a related project which hopefully  
we can integrate with. As we are currently an adhocracy, there is no  
real issue with individual members acting as they please and  
disclosing as they please. So, this organization maintains its  
principles.&quot;
