<PRE>I don't think that informing people needs to be the highest priority.  
There are already and have always been various voter education tools,  
but the inherent obstacle which they always face is voter apathy. In  
the United States, we consider it a good thing if half of the eligible  
population (far less than half the whole population) votes. And that's  
for a singular election held once every few years. Most of the time,  
most people are expected to just passively let government happen to  
them.

In my opinion, the core cause of voter apathy is that people feel  
disenfranchised. Even being able to vote hardly seems significant,  
when one has a very infrequent choice between only two people, neither  
of which really represents one's opinions... and the winner then gets  
complete, long-term power over a vast domain of law. It makes the  
voter very close to completely irrelevant in the process.

The idea Manuel put forth, and which seems inherently sensible, is  
that if people have the ability to be truly enfranchised in any  
decision, then the apathy will diminish... eventually completely  
transforming the nature of citizenship, so that people feel  
responsible for their involvement in the decision-making process.

At that point, people will find the best ways to get informed about  
issues. But until they feel they can do something with that  
information, they have little incentive to do anything about it.
