<PRE>I dislike fingerprints, because they can be forged so easily. Indeed you can
even mine them by going to a railing in some public space.

I recall the CCC publishing the fingerprints of the German Minister of the
Interior Wolfgang Sch&#228;uble. He was proposing to make fingerprints mandatory
in the personal ID that ever German carries with them. At a conference, he
hadn't taken care of the glass he had been drinking from =). Since then some
government officials proposing similar ideas either don't drink anything at
conferences, or even take the glasses they use with them.

If I recall correctly, along with the fingerprints you could buy a kit, with
which to create prints that can fool practically every reader on the market.

I remain critical of any solution involving fingerprints, other biometric
authentication mechanisms and smart cards, which despite the best efforts of
manufacturers can be forged. I have yet to see someone implement it
properly, or better said an agency willing to foot the bill for implementing
it properly.

An example of this is I think the new German e-passport. A hacker managed to
forge one, which would authenticate him as Elvis Presley.

Please be careful when you propose such technical solutions. They sound
fancy and sophisticated, but often fall short in the execution, leaving
gaping holes for abuse.
