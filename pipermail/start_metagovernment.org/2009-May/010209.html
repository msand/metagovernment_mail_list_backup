<PRE>I have mixed feelings about this.  As a retired employee of the U.S. federal
government, I was attracted to this group because &quot;government&quot; is part of
its name.  However, I do believe that &quot;governance&quot; is a grossly overused
term, usually implying that we want someone else to be forced to do
something they might not otherwise be inclined to do.  I do not mean to
suggest that governance is not required, because in many cases people do
need to be told what they may and may not do.  (As the saying goes, your
right to swing your fist ends at the tip of my nose.)  However, one of this
group's avowed values is &quot;consensus through synthesis&quot; and it seems to me
that is far from what commonly occurs in governance systems now.
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/MGP.xml</A>   Indeed, it is hard for me to conceive
of a system embracing such values as being a form of &quot;governance&quot;.
<A HREF="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/govern">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/govern</A>   Ideally, it would become a means
of empowerment, by helping to bring together people of like mind in the
pursuit of common objectives (which is part of the purpose of StratML).

 

Besides &quot;synthesis,&quot; other key concepts in the group's charter include:
&quot;Anyone may contribute .&quot; &amp; &quot;Unless consensus can be reached . there will be
no policy .&quot;  It seems to me that means the &quot;policy&quot; cannot apply to anyone
who does not agree with it and, to me, that seems contrary to the notion of
governance.  As stated previously, I also believe is not the &quot;idea&quot; or
&quot;policy&quot; that matters but, rather, the *contributions* that each member of
the community willingly makes.  That prompts the thought of naming ourselves
Metacommunity.org but, wouldn't you know it, the name &quot;metacommunity&quot; is
already in use. Its meaning may have interesting implications for our joint
effort, assuming that in fact we are able to synthesize an objective upon
which we actually do agree:  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacommunity">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacommunity</A>

Hi all,

Given a choice, I would like to move away from the word &quot;Government&quot; as
&quot;Govern&quot; means 'to rule a country, to control or direct the public affairs
of a city, country, etc.

I believe we are creating an ICT enabled system of self administration of
the members, by the members, for the members (electronic Self Administration
- &quot;eSA&quot; or &quot;eAdmn&quot; or &quot;Open Self Administration Tool&quot; (&quot;OSAT&quot;) or
&quot;Transparency &amp; Accountability (TrAc) Tool&quot; or &quot;MetaSelf&quot;. 

If none of these find favor with many, &quot;MetaGov&quot; can be the option.

My two cents....

Best,

I agree also people would have a &quot;feel&quot; for the software and might come up
with some great names :)

On a site note Manu and I were recently taking about metascore (the name
itself) and how it doesn't really reflect the purpose of the software.
Metagoverment is a great name, if you tell somebody about it they have good
starting point but that's not much the case with metascore.
Should rename the software to something more fitting and if yes any
suggestions?

 

I very much agree. The name Metascore was developed months after
Metagovernment. It took me about a minute to come up with, as I was just
trying to &quot;get the job done&quot; at that point and didn't put much thought into
it. In fact, I put so little thought into it that I apparently hadn't even
done a web search for it, else I would have noticed the Metascore algorithm
currently used (and copyrighted) by Metacritic:
<A HREF="http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml">http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml</A>
(Though as noted before, I suspect that the copyright is not an issue.)

Instead of discussing a new name for it on this list, would it be possible
to do it through the prototype? That is, if you will have the new version
deployed soon, could we just take the conversation there in the form of
people proposing new names? This would be a great test of a multi-proposal
event, where there is not a simple yes/no question, but rather a nuanced
question of which idea among many possible alternatives is the best.
