This isn't a new business, it's an open project. Its success is not  
measured by whether or not it becomes profitable but only by whether  
it is able to achieve its objective. That could take 50 years for all  
I know. There are plenty of other projects which are rushing much  
faster than we are, and IMO they are thereby forced to make choices  
which are not necessarily right.

And our immediate aim is not to abolish all governments in the world  
but to set up an alternative system of governance which communities  
can use as they please. I certainly do not expect any major national  
government to be replaced by Metascore in the next few years. We have  
to prove ourselves on the smallest scale first, and it is reasonable  
to expect that that process should be slow and considered.

</I>
We have two active prototypes running. Have you tried the open one at <A HREF="http://prototype.metascore.org/">http://prototype.metascore.org/</A> 
  and given feedback?

If neither of those work for you, then who is it that could have a  
SlashDot-style system running in two days? I cannot. If you can, then  
please do. I'll give you access to the domain if that's what you  
require. I cannot force anyone to set up that software, so it is up to  
you to do so if you think it can be done.
