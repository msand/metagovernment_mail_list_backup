Answering for Votorola's neighbourhood trust network: Ordinary voters
extend trust only to the people they actually know, at least in
passing.  So I might knock on my neighbour's door across the street,
introduce myself and say, &quot;I see you folks are on the voter list.  I'm
trying to get on too!  I live just over there.  Could you please
extend your trust to me?  Here's my online ID.&quot;

Recognizing me, my neighbour would say, &quot;Of course we will!&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot;

So consistency of identity is provided by people's memory, and
refreshed by everyday encounters on the street.
