A simple extension of this would be to require people to submit a 10- 
second video with each post they make, where they just state their  
name and the proposal they are referring to.

I know not everybody has vid capabilities right now, but that is  
certainly changing. Til then people could post a pic of themselves  
holding a piece of paper with a ref to the proposal on it.

I know this sounds a little laborious (though not if the sw is well- 
designed), but it does readily prove consistency of identity in  
relation to the proposal at hand. And it is ammenable to integration  
with facial recognition and voice-printing, should a particular  
community want to use those.
