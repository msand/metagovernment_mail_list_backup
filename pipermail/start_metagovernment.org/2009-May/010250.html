<PRE>There's something in the subtext of this conversation that makes me
uncomfortable (or maybe I'm reading more into it):

The idea that people must be trusted with their vote, or educated in order
to vote intelligently, seems to smack of elitism. Who are you to decide if
someone is trustworthy or well enough educated? In the United States, white
males of an affluent background and Christian faith have historically
defined those particulars -- which is why I'm so invested in the idea of
Open Government. I believe we should head the opposite direction, and keep a
sharp eye out for anything that looks the slightest bit segregationist (ie.
the uneducated vs. the informed, or the honest vs. the untrustworthy).

When it comes to voting, I've become a fan of +X vs. -X. Whether that's a
Five Star system, or a Somewhat Strongly system -- however you brand it, it
gives the people a choice. Once we see how many people made a choice, we can
understand the outcome: 50,000 voters submitted 5,000 votes, consisting of
500 +3 votes, 1000 +2 votes, 2000 +1 votes, etc. We can click and see how
many of those votes came from a particular place, or slice and dice the
information any way we please, but the numbers will always remain as plain
and simple as possible.

I do see the need for other options that a user could set when creating a
vote, such as an &quot;End Vote&quot; to end the voting process on a specific date, or
once a certain number of people have voted. Another option could include a
checkbox with list of required reading (to inform, legally obligate, or
generally increase the intelligence of the user). I could probably imagine
an endless number of other options to satisfy whichever theory on math,
economics, or sociology that you prefer -- but I will once again stress that
these should be options, and would caution against programming these into
the vote count.
