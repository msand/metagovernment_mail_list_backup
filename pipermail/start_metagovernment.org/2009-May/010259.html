<PRE>Thomas-

We should be hoping for MORE projects, not less!   There should not be one
piece of software that everyone uses, that would be terrible.  I believe we
are at an early stage of what will eventually be an entire industry/movement
of such software.

&gt;<i> Dear people,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> first I want to thank you for deeper exploring possible cooperation between
</I>&gt;<i> us!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And I would also like to answer to some doubts concerning this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I believe, that most of us are very intensively focused on their particular
</I>&gt;<i> tasks in their particular project.
</I>&gt;<i> But if we just for a moment could loosen this focus a bit and zoom out of
</I>&gt;<i> the picture. In this wider picture, isn&#180;t it obvious to see, that our goals
</I>&gt;<i> are the same or at least compatible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course: cooperation would take time and energy to communicate, discuss
</I>&gt;<i> etc. and finally find consensus on how and what to do. And if a project is
</I>&gt;<i> close to completion, it might make no sense to invest that energy for a
</I>&gt;<i> future benefit.
</I>&gt;<i> Has one of our projects already reached this point?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But there might be another hurdle for cooperation: One&#180;s own identification
</I>&gt;<i> with one&#180;s project.
</I>&gt;<i> In my case: I had the idea for global, direct e-democracy a few years ago
</I>&gt;<i> and started to convince people to work with me on it. Then I found
</I>&gt;<i> Metagovernment and realized, that they were much further developed already.
</I>&gt;<i> Retrospective it is funny to see, that at first I saw them as competitors.
</I>&gt;<i> I was not the first one with this idea and probably would not be the one to
</I>&gt;<i> bring it into existence either. This did hurt somehow.
</I>&gt;<i> But slowly my identification shifted to Metagovernment. The new &quot;We&quot; was
</I>&gt;<i> much bigger now, global and much more powerful, capable of reaching the goal
</I>&gt;<i> even faster. Now this felt even better then before!
</I>&gt;<i> But then other projects like Votorola, Democracylab, WH2 appeared. Again
</I>&gt;<i> the same process: fear of not being in the winning team. lol
</I>&gt;<i> A part of me tried to ignore them. Another part compared us, to reassure
</I>&gt;<i> myself, that Metagovernment was better.
</I>&gt;<i> But finally I found in the other projects such beautiful solutions for
</I>&gt;<i> problems I hadn&#180;t even seen yet, that my whole pattern of
</I>&gt;<i> self-aggrandizement (at least in this area ;-)) collapsed.
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for this !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now somehow my focus has shifted to the beautiful energy behind all of our
</I>&gt;<i> projects. And I can see, that this energy is the very same in all of us. And
</I>&gt;<i> I just can&#180;t chase away the picture of all of us working together. Just
</I>&gt;<i> imagine how fast we could get really far!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And like I said, maybe the projects are already developed so far, that soon
</I>&gt;<i> we will have a darwian fight among them, which only the fittest one will
</I>&gt;<i> survive. But if not, let&#180;s take a moment together to consider what the dead
</I>&gt;<i> ends of this evolution are most likely going to be !
</I>&gt;<i> After all, one of Metagovernments basic principles is: Consensus through
</I>&gt;<i> Synthesis.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> PS: I just had the idea, that maybe some people with their project are
</I>&gt;<i> hoping for the future to create a job with an income. But that would be
</I>&gt;<i> equally possible in a joint project, wouldn&#180;t it?
</I>&gt;<i>
