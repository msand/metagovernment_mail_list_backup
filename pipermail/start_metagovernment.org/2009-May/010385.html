<PRE>twitter is working on the problem too, apparently.

&quot;The founders also suggested that for a fee they would embrace the challenge
of trying to authenticate a company or person&#8217;s identity.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1) What about a group of people with a vested interest in inflating
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their votes? They could basically conspire to autheticate each
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other's multiple identities and thus further their own
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interests. One can develop software to detect this, but it may
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; become a race situation where the software needs to keep pace with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the groups attempts to game the system - kind of like SEO on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; net, this may be both a good and a bad thing. With respect to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; identities, this would be overwhelmingly a bad thing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're OK on this, I think, as long as the network is rooted: &quot;The
</I>&gt;<i> ultimate trust source is the root node, which is the core site
</I>&gt;<i> [administrator/registrar].  All trust edges must be traceable to the
</I>&gt;<i> root, otherwise they are discounted in the elaborated network.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's no possiblity of self-authenticated islands or loops.  If you
</I>&gt;<i> see that a bogus voter has trust, then you can talk to the truster.
</I>&gt;<i> You can say, &quot;Pardon me, but I think that voter is bogus.  You see,
</I>&gt;<i> there's no house at 22 Shady Lane, and he claims to be living there
</I>&gt;<i> with nineteen other voters!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the truster pays no attention, then you can talk to the truster's
</I>&gt;<i> own trusters.  And so on.  Ultimately, the buck stops with the
</I>&gt;<i> neighbourhood registrars, and with the area admin/registrar.  They're
</I>&gt;<i> responsible for the integrity of the entire trust network.  They can
</I>&gt;<i> pull the plug on any portion of it, at any time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2). Taking the example of my neighbor certifying that I am a real
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; person, this makes sense. But she can't certify that I don't also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; have another identity. Say she saw a picture of my other self, she
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may report this but this would simply be the reverse of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; situation noted above. Rather than have users trust others, users
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would police others, potentially degrading into a scenario where one
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; group systematically questions the authorities of users in an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opposing group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If we're talking about residential authentication, then I think this
</I>&gt;<i> is also covered.  Each online ID is tied to a physical street address.
</I>&gt;<i> It's that tie that's being &quot;trusted&quot;.  So if I want to have 20
</I>&gt;<i> identities - gaming the system with sock puppets - then I must find
</I>&gt;<i> places for each of them to live, just like real people.  Next I must
</I>&gt;<i> get trust for them from the neighbours.  That's going to be tricky.
</I>&gt;<i> I'll eventually be caught, because there's too many eyeballs on the
</I>&gt;<i> watch, safeguarding the register.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2) It's also clear that there is currently *no good solution* to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this, and different applications of a governance system will require
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different criteria. So I would propose that the authentication
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mechanism be separate from the governance system itself. Set up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; standards like an api, but leave lots of room for this component to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; grow and improve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> +1 (Open it up.)  Technically, we can do it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can also do what Owen suggests: Open up the comms between the vote
</I>&gt;<i> pools and the count engines.  Or we can go even further and extend the
</I>&gt;<i> open architecture to all functions, wherever it makes sense.  (Open up
</I>&gt;<i> the whole thing.)
