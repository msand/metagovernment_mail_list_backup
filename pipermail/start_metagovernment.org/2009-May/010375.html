<PRE>It doesn't take many fraudulent votes to destroy confidence in the entire
system, regardless of the math.  

In a sense, I do agree that it is not the votes that truly count but I don't
think it is opinions that really matter either.  Rather, it seems to me that
what truly matters is what we ourselves individually and collectively are
willing and able to contribute to the achievement of goals and objectives we
hold in common.  

I am not particularly interested in contributing to any system, regardless
of what it is called, that aims to force others to make &quot;contributions&quot; they
might not otherwise be inclined to make based upon their own, well-informed
self-interest.

BTW, a single person can do great damage to any voting system that has a
single point of failure, e.g., superuser privileges to the database.

But what damage can a single person do?we are not speaking of
terrorists who can put a bomb but of voters. Having a person vote
twice is not really going to affect the democracy that much.

Said that I still think that the best are systems where you interact
with your opinions and not with your votes. And if the opinions come
from 100 sources or one source should not modify the computer results.

Vilfredo for president! ;-)
P.S. I am acually still developing the maths behind it. The paper has
been submitted, we are now waiting for the results.
