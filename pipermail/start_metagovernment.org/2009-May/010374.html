<PRE>It seems to me that a key issue is how much power we are divesting to others
by our votes.  The more power being divested, the higher the burden that
should be placed upon us to demonstrate that we truly are who we assert that
we are and that we don't have the ability to assert more than one identity.

For example, nobody really cares how many people voted multiple times for
the winner of American Idol but a lot of us care a whole bunch about ACORN
fraudulently registering voters for the U.S. elections.  Even though the
number of fraudulent votes may be a very small percentage, they call into
question the integrity of the entire system -- which divests great power to
the &quot;winners&quot; and significant cost to the &quot;losers&quot;.  Moreover, in
winner-take-all elections, small numbers can make a big difference.  (The
controversy over whether to use statistical sampling in the U.S. census is
another point in evidence of the importance people place on this issue.)

It also seems to me this issue is closely related to the issue of ID theft
with respect to money.  The large financial institutions don't seem to care
much about it because they simply pass the cost onto their customers (and
now also the taxpayers) while keeping it secret.  I recall being stunned to
hear a couple decades ago that bank tellers weren't making any effort to
verify signatures on checks because: a) humans are poorly equipped to
recognize forgeries, and b) the cost of verification exceeded the cost of
covering the losses.  For far too many criminals, unfortunately for the rest
of us, crime does pay quite well.  The result is that we are forced to lock
ourselves in our homes (and live in gated communities) while the criminals
roam freely.

While I recognize there are good reasons for protecting privacy, it seems to
me that in many cases the effect is to enable bad behavior.  For example,
the problem is not that anyone might know my social security number but,
rather, what they may be able do with it without my knowledge -- due to poor
record-keeping systems and practices.  (The reason that electronic voting
machines have been removed from the process in some U.S. states is because
they fail to create records whose integrity can be assured, apart from the
databases in which the votes are tallied, to enable verification of the
tallies, i.e., &quot;recounting&quot;.)

&gt;<i> But what damage can a single person do?we are not speaking of
</I>&gt;<i> terrorists who can put a bomb but of voters. Having a person vote
</I>&gt;<i> twice is not really going to affect the democracy that much.

Like I said:
&gt;<i> Again focus on the problem domain.

It depends on the use case. I'm just so used to hearing these
technologies proposed something to increase security, that I'm maybe
overly critical. I do think there are other use cases for it.
