By user, do you mean admin?

In any event, the idea of stakeholdership does not have to be strictly  
enforced across the board. All we need is some common standard that  
can place the user geographically, such as a postal code, perhaps?


&gt;<i>  2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Ed is warning us that this could slow up the deployment, or
</I>&gt;<i>     restrict its reach.  But again, there's maybe a technical
</I>&gt;<i>     solution: what if the authentication facility has an on/off
</I>&gt;<i>     switch?  Or better yet, what if it's got varying authentication

</I>&gt;<i>     (admins) can just dial up whatever level we like, or turn it off
</I>&gt;<i>     completely.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Also, there's different ideas on how to design this.  But maybe
</I>&gt;<i>     that's no problem either.  We can be open to multiple solutions
</I>&gt;<i>     (see 4).
</I>
The question here, from the Metagovernment point of view, is: who gets  
to be the admin? The Metascore team's solution is to work toward a  
DVCS model where there is no singular admin in charge of a community,  
but it still seems like there is some basic software administration  
going on (or am I just not understanding it correctly?), and I still  
see problems with having a privileged user, as that opens a clear  
avenue for corruption.

But as to the question of identity, it seems like the best solution is  
an external one. That should make standardization much easier. My vote  
here, however, would be to ensure that it is not a commercial one;  
again for fear of undue influence.

&gt;<i>  3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (I guess we all want this, if we can have it.  In that case, 2 is
</I>&gt;<i>      part of the solution.)
</I>
Well, as Pietro notes, Metascore and Vilfredo may not have this  
requirement, as they have internal maths to correct for multiple  
identities.

But the question of votes-per-user should be entirely internal to any  
particular solution and not require a cross-platform standard.

&gt;<i>  4. Delegating for proxy voting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The problem here is that some of us like the idea of delegation -
</I>&gt;<i>     depending on how its done - and some of us do not.  So this
</I>&gt;<i>     divides us, and divides the projects.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     But we figure there's a technical solution here too: If we can
</I>&gt;<i>     agree on open standards, then we can have multiple voting
</I>&gt;<i>     networks side-by-side, eh?  We'd try out all the different ideas,
</I>&gt;<i>     and see what works best.  And see what the voters like.
</I>
Right. Like #3, it is an internal issue and not a cross-platform  
question.
