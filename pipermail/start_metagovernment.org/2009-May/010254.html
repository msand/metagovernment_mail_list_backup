<PRE>It's a good question, but I I think the abstract and the specific are
separate issues. One is polling, the other implementing policy. And
the two are not necessarily the same.

The more abstract (issue- or position-based) approvals could be and
IMHO should be handled separately from the specific (policy- or
bill-based) approvals.

The two can be complementary, but they one can easily confound the
other and the result is complicated to untangle.

I consider the abstract to be more like a polling mechanism (kind of
like what DL &amp; votorola aspire to be), used to ascertain citizens
perspectives on broad or even particular issues about which the
population is relatively informed. The abstract is also addressed to
some extent in various methods of self-identified group membership --
political parties, NGOs, lobbyists, etc. Also by voluntary donations
to these groups to support activities like lobbying, etc.

The specifics, the bill- or policy-related votes, are separate from
this. Certainly on some issues (like abortion, for example) a
responsible citizen who wishes to vote for or against a proposal may
want to refer to the abstract positions of most people in forming
his/her opinion. But, then again, this citizen may choose not to
consult this. Nonetheless, these two can &amp; I believe should be handled
separately.

Where the abstract and the specific are allowed to cross is up to the
system designers.

For example, one may want to refer to, or display, the results of a
broad poll relevant to a particular policy proposal in the discussion
or justification of the bill.

But, I can also envision a system where a group with some number
(small or large) of self-identified members can formally identify
itself as supporting a position, but not *vote* for that position.
Inidividuals (members or non-members) can then read opinions written
by the group on the proposals and use this as a way to educate their
vote, but not delegate it.
