&gt;<i> Sorry if the tone of my email wasn't very kind...
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to make clear that we are dealing with different creatures here (metagovernment, fp7 and the pareto prototype), so we avoid confusion...
</I>No need to be sorry my original post was intended to be somewhat provocative ;)

&gt;<i> You should start from the beginning... I have subscribed to this list
</I>&gt;<i> last year, because I found many of metagovernment goals compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> the work that the Telematics Freedom is doing, and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i> could be a good place to find people interesting in *joining efforts* to
</I>&gt;<i> build something that can really change the world. Check my first emails
</I>&gt;<i> in the archive and see for yourself.
</I>I also think our goals are very much the same and we should collaborate
as much as possible. I just think that working on FP7 is one thing not
compatible with our basic principles. Even if is not a direct effort by
Metagoverment we are indirectly involved. Since transparency is very
important to me this is an issue.

On Tue, May 5, 2009 at 4:34 PM, Giovani Spagnolo
&gt;<i> Now, to end up with this, I would ask to remove any FP7 reference in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment's wiki if this brings problems to the &quot;principle of
</I>&gt;<i> openness&quot; you are referring to.
</I>This may be the best thing to do. But I will not remove it myself yet as
most of the active Metascore people have not expressed their opinion
on the issue and I would like to know what they think before doing so.
