<PRE>Any chance of some open source love? Im sure we could work together.

2009/5/11 Jim Gilliam &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">jim at gilliam.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> I'm starting up my blog again to track the evolution of NationBuilder,
</I>&gt;<i> please check it out.&#160; Here's the first post.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/">http://www.jimgilliam.com/2009/05/making-the-future/</A>

</I>&gt;<i> Making the Future
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Published on May 11, 2009
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m getting ready to launch NationBuilder in the next month or two, so I&#8217;m
</I>&gt;<i> starting my blog back up and even giving it a name &#8212; Make the Future. The
</I>&gt;<i> name comes from Carl Pope, the long-time leader of the Sierra Club. In This
</I>&gt;<i> Brave Nation, a documentary series we made at Brave New Films about a year
</I>&gt;<i> ago, he said: &#8220;Just take what you love doing, and do it with enough other
</I>&gt;<i> people, to make it the future.&#8221;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shortly before the election, I started White House 2 to democratically set
</I>&gt;<i> the agenda for the incoming Obama administration, and track it like the
</I>&gt;<i> Nielsen&#8217;s TV ratings. There was so much to be done, I wanted people to think
</I>&gt;<i> hard about what the priorities should be &#8212; there was just no way he could do
</I>&gt;<i> everything at once!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I put the first site up in two weeks, and people from all over the world
</I>&gt;<i> started contacting me about bringing it to their country. I&#8217;ve been working
</I>&gt;<i> non-stop since then, and am about 5-6 weeks away from beta on NationBuilder,
</I>&gt;<i> a web service that will let anyone set up their own site just like White
</I>&gt;<i> House 2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can look at White House 2 and easily see how this could be used for
</I>&gt;<i> governments of all kinds, but I believe it can also be used to bring
</I>&gt;<i> democracy to business. Successful businesses of the future need to involve
</I>&gt;<i> all the stakeholders, whether they are employees, management, shareholders,
</I>&gt;<i> or customers. They need to establish the right incentives, and have tools
</I>&gt;<i> that work better when hundreds of thousands of people are involved, not
</I>&gt;<i> worse. Oh, and it has to be fun, or no one will care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At Brave New Films, we pretty much turned the documentary world upside down
</I>&gt;<i> doing a first generation version of this. We built our own audience, and
</I>&gt;<i> then involved them as much as we could in making and distributing the films.
</I>&gt;<i> They hosted tens of thousands of screenings, shot footage, took photos of
</I>&gt;<i> abandoned Wal-Marts, put up half the funding for our last documentary
</I>&gt;<i> ($260k), and even suggested the name of the company itself. But the only
</I>&gt;<i> reason we were able to do as much as we did, is because I could code
</I>&gt;<i> anything we might dream up. There just aren&#8217;t many tools designed for
</I>&gt;<i> companies to operate like this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> NationBuilder will be a general purpose operating system to run democracies
</I>&gt;<i> online, and we&#8217;ll use the software itself to run the company. It&#8217;s kind of a
</I>&gt;<i> far out idea, and I don&#8217;t have all the answers on how it should work yet,
</I>&gt;<i> but I&#8217;m having a ton of fun figuring it out. This blog will track the
</I>&gt;<i> evolution of the platform, and show how people can use NationBuilder to,
</I>&gt;<i> well, make the future.
