<PRE>&gt;<i>From a coder perspective, they are built using different technologies, so
</I>it's not really possible to integrate them in any way that would be really
useful.

The DVCS stuff is really cool, but I think it's a solution to a problem that
doesn't exist yet.  It *will* exist at some point, sharing policies and
information across governments, but the harder part is just getting people
to care at all in governing themselves.  And DVCS just gets in the way of
that right now because it's a rather complicated concept for lay people to
grasp.  It sounds like Fabian is simplifying this, which is great.

On the scoring.  It will actually be pretty simple to integrate alternative
scoring systems into the WH2 codebase and let governments pick which one
they want to use.   I'm focused now on just getting the beta up so other
people can set up their own governments (I should have this ready in about
5-6 weeks).  And then we can go from there based on feedback and what
everyone wants.

&gt;<i> Interesting that you chimed in here, Jim, as I was about to reiterate my

</I>&gt;<i> Metascore. As not-really-a-programmer, I don't know if this is realistic,
</I>&gt;<i> but I wanted to get the opinions of you, Manuel/Fabe (et al), and Pietro on
</I>&gt;<i> the possibility of using your code with Pietro's scoring algorithm and
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel's DVCS deployment idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Each represents a real strength: WH2 is very well developed (not just that
</I>&gt;<i> it is far along, but it is also very well done overall), Pietro's scoring
</I>&gt;<i> system is itself very well thought out and highly innovative, and the
</I>&gt;<i> existing Metascore's DVCS model is both ingenious and seemingly vital to a
</I>&gt;<i> system which wants to be an actual governance mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, as I write this, I now noticed Fabian's update on the progress
</I>&gt;<i> of the existing Metascore prototype. I do not by any means wish to simply
</I>&gt;<i> throw away that development, but I continue to wonder (hope) if there might
</I>&gt;<i> be a way to integrate some of the cool programming Jim has done with WH2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If not... no big. I very much like what I just heard from Fabian, and I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with Jim that this project has been a good meeting point for this

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing which continues to distinguish this project is its focus on
</I>&gt;<i> providing actual governance instead of simply informing the opinions of our

</I>&gt;<i> understandable that we would be lagging behind the earlier generations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been doing!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something usable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to emerge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It&#180;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really happen yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come between us!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our name!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With fondest regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas Hahn
