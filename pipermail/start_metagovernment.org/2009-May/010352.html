<PRE>For those who have reason to care about such things, it seems to me the best
way to ensure that one gets credit for one's thoughts is to be the
(verifiably) first to document them best (most cogently) on the Web in
records having sufficient degrees of the four attributes outlined in ISO
15489 - integrity, authenticity, usability, and reliability.

 

Expecting others to remember to assign credit every time they repeat a
thought places unrealistic expectations upon human memory, as well as undue
burden upon discourse.  <A HREF="http://ambur.net/memorysins.pdf">http://ambur.net/memorysins.pdf</A>  As they say,
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and we can pretty well be
assured that we have succeeded in conveying our thoughts when everyone
thinks it was *their* idea.  The difficulty occurs when we want to have it
both ways, i.e., to &quot;protect&quot; our &quot;intellectual property&quot; (e.g., by keeping
it secret) while at the same time desiring to obtain &quot;credit&quot; (if not also
be paid) for it.

 

For votes that truly matter, the ballots should have the attributes of a
record and those records should be stored in a record-keeping system apart
from the database in which the votes are tallied, under the control of a
separate &quot;authority&quot; whose own integrity is subject to verification.  (If
the ballots are stored in XML format, recounts can be automated in order to
audit the data in the database.)  

 

The requirement for &quot;integrity&quot; applies not only to the data but also to its
presentation, i.e., exactly how it appeared to the voter.  If that seems
unreasonable, consider the use case where the color of &quot;fine print&quot; in a
contract is the same as the background, thus making it invisible to the
parties to the agreement.  Or in the case of ballots, checking the box next
to the name of one's preferred candidate actually registers a vote for
another one.  Relevant standards include PDF, XFDL, and XPS.  (The former is
a binary format while the latter two are human- as well as machine-readable
XML.)

 

BTW, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has been a leader in the
use of XML.  However, we still have a long way to go to make it as easy as
it should be to determine who actually did contribute the most to the
advancement of new ideas.  History is as much about marketing and promotion
as it is about reality as it actually occurred, and the primary reason
litigation is so costly is the difficulty of &quot;discovery&quot; (which is a cost of
poor quality in record-keeping).

Yes, I think that's the least we all can do... give credit where credit is
due :-)

being an academic, I also don't want to patent my ideas. But as it is
important in the academic world I do look for recognition, so I don't
want my ideas to be &quot;stolen&quot; but to be copied with citation.
 
Cheers,

Ditto for me.  I want people to &quot;steal&quot; my ideas.  I hope the whole world
does. :)

Hello all,
 
I was recently in discussions off list in which the topic of
intellectual property came up.  None of the projects active in this
list was involved.  As many of you know, inventions are eligible for
patenting in North America for up to one year after initial
disclosure.  I think that most of you already know from previous posts
that I do not believe it is possible to enforce patents or other
monopoly strategies on the core voting facilities.  So what follows is
just a formality.
 
In the current thread &quot;Votorola, DemocracyLab, White House 2, etc.&quot;, I
am disclosing ideas related to open voting networks.  Please note that
these are my own, original ideas, and that I have NO intention of
patenting any of them as inventions.  Note also that I am disclosing
them in the hope, as expressed in that thread, that other projects
will find them useful, and that we may freely share the use of them.
 
Yours faithfully,
--
