Hi Kris,

Thanks for summarizing the technical points!  Speaking for myself, I
was losing sight of what we're supposed to be discussing.  Your
summary reminds me - we're supposed to be answering Thomas's original
post:

Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too.  Please don&#180;t let
</I>&gt;<i> competition come between us!  Let&#180;s work together with them! And if
</I>&gt;<i> necessary, let&#180;s happily give away our name!  Let&#180;s earn some
</I>&gt;<i> synthesis score!  ;-) I strongly feel, that we should not miss this
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity.
</I>
And again, in his 2nd post:
&gt;<i> Now somehow my focus has shifted to the beautiful energy behind all
</I>&gt;<i> of our projects. And I can see, that this energy is the very same in
</I>&gt;<i> all of us.  And I just can&#180;t chase away the picture of all of us
</I>&gt;<i> working together. Just imagine how fast we could get really far!
</I>
So maybe if we take Kris's summary points, and we view them against
what Thomas is asking for?  Something like this:

  1. 'Stakeholder involvement' rather than anyone's (outsider's)
     involvement.

     The problem here, I guess, is that the projects are split on
     whether or not to enforce this?
     
     But there's a technical solution to that, right?  The user can
     filter out the votes at a higher level according to the criterion
     of stakeholder involvement - or not filter them.  So we can have
     it both ways.

  2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.

     Ed is warning us that this could slow up the deployment, or
     restrict its reach.  But again, there's maybe a technical
     solution: what if the authentication facility has an on/off
     switch?  Or better yet, what if it's got varying authentication
     levels, some that impose a lighter admin/user burden?  Then we
     (admins) can just dial up whatever level we like, or turn it off
     completely.

     Also, there's different ideas on how to design this.  But maybe
     that's no problem either.  We can be open to multiple solutions
     (see 4).

  3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.

     (I guess we all want this, if we can have it.  In that case, 2 is
      part of the solution.)

  4. Delegating for proxy voting.

     The problem here is that some of us like the idea of delegation -
     depending on how its done - and some of us do not.  So this
     divides us, and divides the projects.

     But we figure there's a technical solution here too: If we can
     agree on open standards, then we can have multiple voting
     networks side-by-side, eh?  We'd try out all the different ideas,
     and see what works best.  And see what the voters like.

So those are some technical meta-solutions (if I can call them that!)
to the problems of inter-project cooperation.  Maybe there's questions
about how these solutions work?

If not, then I'm feeling aimless and lost - I'm just a technical guy.
What's the next step in answering Thomas?

Best,
