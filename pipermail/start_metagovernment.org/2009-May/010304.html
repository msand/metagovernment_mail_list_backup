(Extending an open playing field for the projects and users.  The
 users can range freely across it &quot;grazing&quot; on the various services in
 order to accomplish their tasks - making a proposal, discussing it,
 voting, making sense of the results - instead of being restricted to
 the confines of a single site or project.)

I don't know what you guys will think of this, I'll just suggest it.
What if you (as the user) can do things like this: (?)

  1. You make a proposal on White House 2.  Your proposal is now
     visible on other project sites.  Users of DemocracyLab, Vilfredo,
     and Metagovernment can see it, too.

  2. A user on DemocracyLab casts a vote for your proposal, that same
     vote counts on White House 2.  Users everywhere share the same
     vote pool and see the same results.

  3. Out in the larger Web, where your proposal is the topic of a blog
     post or a discussion thread, it is accompanied by the latest poll
     results, and also a 'Vote' button.  (So the open network reaches
     out to users wherever they happen to be.)

  4. Anyone may post an alternative proposal anywhere on the Web, and
     put a 'Vote' button beside it.

  5. Anyone may propose a bridge (synthetic or compromise) proposal,
     and pitch it to the voters of two competing proposals.  Votes may
     then shift toward the bridge, or not.  (The voting mechanism is
     especially designed to facilitate this, without forcing it.)

  6. Votes are authenticated and results are independently verified.
     If a consensus emerges, it will be a consensus of real people
     (not virtual), living in real, physical communities.

Some of this is already coded.  The communication interfaces haven't
been designed yet - not unless somebody else (other than us) is
working on it.
