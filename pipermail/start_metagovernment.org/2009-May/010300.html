<PRE>OK, my bad for banging together a hasty e-mail before thinking it  
through... and apologies for using the word API where it probably  
doesn't apply.

What I am trying to speak to is not Metascore, but the cross-project  
communication objective discussed in a recent thread. Given the  
plethora of various policy-making projects underway, it is very likely  
that we will see a diverse practical reality, where different  
communities use different softwares for similar applications. In  
anticipation of that likelihood, it seems reasonable for these various  
projects to give some thought to this scenario with an eye toward how  
their apps can play nice with each other in the larger environment.

While in many ways our approaches, philosophies, programming  
languages, interfaces, etc. all vary radically, there are still some  
commonalities that can be identified. Some things which every project  
has in common are:
- Presentation of laws or policies (which have certain intrinsic  
components)
- Users / citizens / community-members
- Expression of approval or disapproval of policies by users
- Discussions by users about policies

What I am asking for is for all of our projects to start looking for  
how some of these common factors can be identified and perhaps  
normalized.
