<PRE>&gt;<i> So, up today a network of trust is the only feasible solution to the online
</I>&gt;<i> identity problem?
</I>
Ideally yes, realistically I'm not so sure. There are defiantly some
usability concerns there, but maybe those can be resolved. If I look
at it pessimistically, I would say there isn't much chance that your
average Joe will take the time to understand the fundamentals of a
network of trust. The question is if he needs to or if a superficial
understanding is enough.

If we want to go the route with smartcards, you could distribute two
to each person, one for the private and one for the public key.
Actually you could just as well do it with a usb sticks at this point
and you wouldn't have to set up all the card readers. For this to
work, you would have to educate people about how to handle their keys
and why it makes sense to sign each others public keys when they're
sure of the other persons identity.

All of this assumes a certain level of infrastructure and education of
course, which may be a bit far fetched even for an industrialised
country, let alone the whole of India. I would call into question the
need for every person in that country to have an ID and base the
solution on the groups that actually need it. Possibly for those
groups that need identification, a network of trust is viable.


Caveat: With all technological solutions there is the tendency for
people to become over reliant on the machines doing the verification.
If the machine says the person is a terrorist, some security guards
will turn off of the last 10% of their brain and just go ahead with
arresting the person. If you land on some government list for
participating in a demonstration (maybe against mandatory government
identification?), it may be hard to get off it and traveling will
become a pain.

&gt;<i> Maybe fingerprints are secure enough, and easy enough.
</I>
The opposite is equally true, since those that want to circumvent the
system will put the most energy into it. A supposedly good enough
solution is entirely insufficient for certain use cases. You have to
implement a practically unbreakable system. It doesn't matter if your
system is 99.99% correct in identifying people, because those last
0.01% are still 1 in 10000 people and a security guard who has to
check 50000 a day, trusting the machine while he munches his samich
will never notice the one person that slips through. And he will slip
through, because he is exactly the person willing to invest the energy
to circumvent the system. At this point all you have is security
theatre.

Again focus on the problem domain. In our case, we want to ensure that
people gaming the system become statistically insignificant. I think
the worst case us would be gathering addresses and sending out one
time security tokens. I still think a network of trust may work
though, even if it isn't based on something like PGP.

In the case of securing flights I would say proper solution is to
focus on checking baggage for explosives, search people for weapons,
leave out the verification and maybe arm the flight attendants.
