<PRE>&gt;<i> This is incorrect, as Owen has pointed out.  Although Thomas's elderly
</I>&gt;<i> lady is no expert on climatalogy, she is very knowledgeable on what
</I>&gt;<i> she cares about.  She is probably also capable of asking questions and
</I>&gt;<i> making decisions based on the answers.  For example: suppose she lends
</I>&gt;<i> her vote to a neighbour, someone more knowledgeable than her about
</I>&gt;<i> climate change.  Later, she is in discussion with some of the other
</I>&gt;<i> voters, a small group of them, all voting for the same delegate.  A
</I>&gt;<i> question occurs to her:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  My people are originally from a low lying country, and I have family
</I>&gt;<i>  there.  Is our policy the best for them?  Or is there a better one?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> She then asks this question of the delegate.  Depending on how he
</I>&gt;<i> answers (or not), she considers whether to shift her vote to a
</I>&gt;<i> different delegate, and perhaps to a different policy.
</I>
What you describe here, is the process of informing herself. At this
point she may as well make the decision herself, which as precisely my
argument.

&gt;<i> Manuel was assuming that she was too ignorant to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> decision, and that only the experts -
</I>
Not true, through questions she has contributed to the discussion and
was able to develop an informed opinion. My argument was against
delegation based on peoples personal qualities and vague positions, as
we are forced to do in most &quot;modern&quot; democracies.
