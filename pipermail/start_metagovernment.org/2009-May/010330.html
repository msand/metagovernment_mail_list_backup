<PRE>Communities which are not geographically based already have a means of  
inclusion-control if they find one necessary (i.e., professional  
societies, paid membership clubs, etc.). So I would guess that the  
main issue of stakeholdership is concerning geographic organizations  
(i.e., governments). If we do end up with some sort of verifiable user  
identification, such systems usually have a geographic component, such  
as the user's address.

So if we want to tie issues to geography we could do a simple 3-point  
algorithm, where point 1 is the geographic center of the issue; point  
2 is the radius of equal affection (ie, anyone within that radius has  
an equal stake), and the third measure is one of how quickly interest  
diminishes as one increases in distance from the radius. That way  
stakeholdership is internal to the issue instead of being a factor of  
each user; which sounds like a programmatic nightmare. This isn't  
perfect (e.g., rivers flow in one general direction, not outward in  
all directions), but it may be a simple start.

However, I am not certain that user authentication is necessary...  
that was the point behind the fifth basic principle to enable the  
sixth basic principle (both called into dispute):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles#Disputed_principles">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles#Disputed_principles</A>

Pietro and Manuel can speak more intelligently about this than me...  
they had been devising a simple method of internal cross-checking to  
prevent the impact of sock-puppets gaming the system. If users  
authenticate or score each other, then we can look at the circle of  
influence of any user to determine their authenticity. If a group of  
users all have strong ties to each other but no ties external to that  
circle, it can be assumed all those users are one person's realm of  
control.

The benefits of such a system are primarily that it allows for much  
easier, more widespread, and less expensive adoption. Instead of  
having to impose some sort of authentication authority (who is in  
charge of that, by the way?), we instead have a software-based  
solution which is run by pure mathematics and programming. It also  
makes the whole thing more organic. We are trying to impose our old- 
school views of stakeholdership on a new system, when we have an  
opportunity to let the new system redefine how stakeholdership is  
measured and determined... in a much more open, organic manner.
