<PRE>Thanks Owen, I'll get back to your comments in the other thread
(Votorola, DemocracyLab, White House 2, etc.) if it continues.  I
think that it and StratML have the same purpose (hopefully it's not
too ambitious), and maybe StratML can help us at some point.
Meantime, I have a question.

Pardon me, but I find that too abstract.  You want to inform me of the
benefits of encoding my plans and so forth in StratML, but the
information doesn't come across.  Maybe it's just me (and maybe you
missed my earlier question) but what I suggest is that you convey the
information - the benefits of StratML - in a more concrete way.  For
example:

  I wish to publish a document so that other people can read it.  It
  occurs to me that I might encode it in a standard Web format, such
  as the HTML schema.  This requires extra effort, but I'm instantly
  rewarded with a payback.  I can view the result in a Web browser,
  and I know that other people can view it too.

Does StratML provide such an immediate, concrete benefit?  If not, can
you think of how it might?
