<PRE>I like this distinction. I believe that making this distinction clear in the
user experience could illustrate the different levels on which a user may
interact with the decision making process:

Level One: Issues - A short form that simply allows users to identify a
topic of concern. There is no voting on individual Issues. Instead, Members
respond to Issues through Comments or Proposals.

Level Two: Comments - A medium form that allows users to Comment on Issues,
Proposals, and Resolutions. Users may like or dislike specific Comments, but
this has no effect on the vote count.

Level Three: Proposals - A long form, separated by Paragraphs, that is
connected to Issues. Members may vote for or against Proposals, and submit
new Proposals of their own.

Level Four: Paragraphs - Individual Paragraphs form a Proposal. When a
Proposal is open for Debate, the Community is able to like or dislike
specific Paragraphs, or to add their own. Members may not vote on an Open
Proposal until it is Finalized.

Level Five: Resolutions (Currently: Articles) - Proposals agreed upon or
completed by the Community. Members may rate their level of satisfaction, as
well as identify a new Issue with a Resolution.

These levels allow the users to interact at any level of the voting process
-- from simply Tweeting an issue @metascore, to Debating the specifics of a
Proposal -- without punishing or rewarding any form of participation.
