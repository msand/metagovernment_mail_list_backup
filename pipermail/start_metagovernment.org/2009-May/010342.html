I mean the end user, who is viewing the results.

(In truth, this is technically difficult.  At first, we can do it only
 in a limited way, on preset filter criteria.  But my feeling is, this
 will be enough to accomodate the core needs of all the projects.
 Later, it will get more flexible, and users will be able to &quot;dial up&quot;
 their own filter criteria, effectively calling up a recount.)

&gt;<i> In any event, the idea of stakeholdership does not have to be strictly 
</I>&gt;<i> enforced across the board. All we need is some common standard that can 
</I>&gt;<i> place the user geographically, such as a postal code, perhaps?
</I>
I guess that's the most important bit of info.  It's part of the
voter's registration too - what you see when you look at the voter's
entry in the register.  And it's visible for all to see.  So it's easy
for anyone to use the geo-data as a criterion when filtering the
votes, during a count - or not to use it.

But maybe we can allow voters to attach *any* information to their
registrations, ad hoc?  So maybe some agency gets the idea, in future,
that only people who graduated from a certain school (this is a dumb
example) should be able to vote?  No problem.  Those who cared enough
to be counted by this agency would enter their alma mater into a
'school' field, and attach that field to their registrations.  The
agency would filter on that field.  (Everybody else would just ignore
 it.)

Something like that, anyway - it shouldn't be a problem.

&gt;&gt;<i>  2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Ed is warning us that this could slow up the deployment, or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     restrict its reach.  But again, there's maybe a technical
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     solution: what if the authentication facility has an on/off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     switch?  Or better yet, what if it's got varying authentication
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     levels, some that impose a lighter admin/user burden?  Then we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (admins) can just dial up whatever level we like, or turn it off
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     completely.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     Also, there's different ideas on how to design this.  But maybe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     that's no problem either.  We can be open to multiple solutions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (see 4).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The question here, from the Metagovernment point of view, is: who gets to 
</I>&gt;<i> be the admin? The Metascore team's solution is to work toward a DVCS model 
</I>&gt;<i> where there is no singular admin in charge of a community, but it still 
</I>&gt;<i> seems like there is some basic software administration going on (or am I 
</I>&gt;<i> just not understanding it correctly?), and I still see problems with having 
</I>&gt;<i> a privileged user, as that opens a clear avenue for corruption.
</I>
(A lot will be clearer when we answer Thomas's questions.  He is
 asking about core architecture.)

Just to say what it does first, this multi-level authentication
facility: It labels each voter with an authentication score, from 0
(don't know from Adam) upward, with increasing levels of certainty
that the person really is who they claim to be.

In terms of who decides what authentication level to impose - this is
maybe easier than I was thinking - maybe it is just the end user.  I'm
thinking that an authentication level can be just one more criterion,
on the count filter.  (&quot;I don't trust these results, and they're
awfully close!  Please jack up the authentication level by one
notch.&quot;)

The job of the admin (registrar) would be to ensure that the
facilities for authentication were made available to the voters, and
then let the voters choose their own level - whatever they felt they
needed.  (Don't really care, just play-voting?  Then zero is OK.  Want
to be included in the most pernickity of counts?  Then put in some
extra effort and get yourself authenticated to level 4 or 5.)

&gt;<i> But as to the question of identity, it seems like the best solution is an 
</I>&gt;<i> external one. That should make standardization much easier. My vote here, 
</I>&gt;<i> however, would be to ensure that it is not a commercial one; again for fear 
</I>&gt;<i> of undue influence.
</I>
(If I put on my architect's cap, just for a minute, I have to be
 neutral.  My own design doesn't matter.  *Any* solution that someone
 has the fire-under-the-butt to code, we have to accomodate it,
 because we want an open architecture.)

&gt;&gt;<i>  3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     (I guess we all want this, if we can have it.  In that case, 2 is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      part of the solution.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, as Pietro notes, Metascore and Vilfredo may not have this 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement, as they have internal maths to correct for multiple 
</I>&gt;<i> identities.
</I>
(Those voting engines enforce req. #3 by statistical means or
 something - not by authentication - OK.  All approaches are allowed.

 The only thing is - the thing we hope to agree to - is that we share
 common standards so clients can pick and choose among the different
 engines, without becoming locked in - as Owen said, and Thomas
 underlined - we keep it an open field, for all to play in fairly.)

&gt;<i> But the question of votes-per-user should be entirely internal to any 
</I>&gt;<i> particular solution and not require a cross-platform standard.
</I>
Agreed - that would be best.

(Ideally everything is internal - all components of the open network
 are black boxes.  They expose interfaces only where other components
 depend on them for something.  Those interfaces are best standardized
 where possible.  That's really all there is to it.

 The standards are purely technical.  The coders sort them out amongst
 themselves, because they're the ones who gotta live with the
 consequences.  It shouldn't affect anything at an organizational
 level - just the fact that it's now an open field.)

Sorry, this is a lot of info all at once - for me too.  (Some parts of
 Votorola are being turned inside out by this, and others will have to
 be scrapped.)
