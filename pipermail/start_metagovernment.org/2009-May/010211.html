<PRE>Dear all
(and in this case, in particular dear Ed and dear Jim)

I'll try to answer all.

First of all I would like at this point to invite everybody to try out
the Vilfredo prototype.

I didn't do it before because I was somehow scared that it might
damage the FP7 project. I had a chat yesterday with Richard Walker, a
friend of mine whose job is preparing FP7 applications. Yes he does
this one call after the other. And he explained to me that no there is
practically no risk. On the other hand the link has already gone out,
and since we are all discussing the ins and out of this method and
that method, I feel we cannot have a proper conversation if it is not
informed. So I would like to invite all the people on this list who
have not yet tried out the prototype to do it now. I make a special
mention on this to Jim who helped us with a few emails while we were
writing the FP7. You can find the prototype at
<A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/">http://pareto.ironfire.org/</A>

Now back to your question:

</I>&gt;<i> the possibility of using your code with Pietro's scoring algorithm and
</I>&gt;<i> Manuel's DVCS deployment idea.
</I>&gt;<i> Each represents a real strength: WH2 is very well developed (not just that

</I>&gt;<i> system is itself very well thought out and highly innovative, and the
</I>&gt;<i> existing Metascore's DVCS model is both ingenious and seemingly vital to a
</I>&gt;<i> system which wants to be an actual governance mechanism.
</I>

Let's leave aside DVCS for a moment.
Which is a level of complication that a single online community rarely needs.


I have been wondering if WH2 could be integrated with the pareto
algorithm for a long time. The answer is: not easily. The way the
pareto front works is theough questions, proposals, endorsements, and
generations. It requires an interactive experience from the comunity
that goes through many inputs (sometimes through many days, but it can
easily be done in 1 hour, if everybody is online at the same time).

How you pose the question is fundamental. If you are speaking about
abortion, and you ask:

-what shall we do to the assassins that kill their own babies when
they are still in the womb against the law of the only true Lord,
Jesus Christ.

or you are asking:

-what shall we do to the fanatics that keep on deciding for us about
our body by forcing us to accept unwanted pregnancies, only to satisfy
their sense of guilt to an unexistant god.

you can see how they are both adressing a related issue (although they
are not the same question), but the point of view, is &quot;somehow&quot;
different ;-). So whoever starts the question has an insane amunt of
power. We have seen this already in those days in the prototype. A few
questions had quite a strong spin.

So if you are inserting Al Pareto (Algorithm Pareto, brother of Al
Capone :) ) inside WH2, you are essentially going to first of all
decide who asks what question. Then you have to decide the topic (is
this health? religion? public order?). All those are going to be top
down decisions, that some people will not agree with. Now there are
perfectly fine bottom up ways to go around both of them. FOr the topic
issue, the tags will be the solution (we shall explore this in the
FP7). For the question, the way to go over it is to  ask a
metaquestion.

Example:

-Our community is split on people who want abortion to be legal, and
people who do not want it to be legal. What question would better help
in finding a proposal that heals this fracture?

Then you find a question on which everybody agrees (this is much
easier than solving the problem, I bet the number of generations here
necessary to find an agreement might be only few.

Sometimes finding a good metaquestion is as difficult as finding a
good question. Which is why I have used it only one time. Generally
you use a meta question when a community has already decided they want
to ask a question, but they an't really make their mind on how to
formulate it. Why am I saying all this? Because WH2, with the kind of
people that is attracting, will have some serious problems in how
questions get spinned. To the point that it might make sense for Jim
to make some top down decisions, and ask the question himself. Or ask
the metaquestions.

Then there is the whole issue of the proposals, and the endorsments.
In short you really would have to remake the whole engine of WH2. So I
am not sure if I were to suggest it. I think WH2 is fine as it is for
now.

The other issue is why Vilfredo was done as it is. The idea was not
just to make a website that works, but also to make it with the least
number of assumptions. It is spartane in its very nature. A bit like
delicious in the first years. This because we want to show that it is
really Al PAreto that is making Vilfredo do its magic, and not
something else. We do envision for Al Pareto a future in which it
would be used as an engine in other projects. Like having a plugin for
Drupal, and an application for Facebook. So yes, eventually Al Pareto
could be used inside other systems. But the systems need to permit it.
Either by running external applications, or by being designed in a way
that fits Al Pareto.

You see, part of the program is that being so different it just does
not fit many of the assumption that we usually make. For example that
the number of people endorsing something has any importance. And it is
very easy to break by inserting unneeded limits, like permitting to a
person to endorse only x proposals.

So my proposal is:
while we are in this phase,
with me writing the VgtA paper,
waiting for the FP7 decisions,
why don't you try the website out, maybe asking also there the open
question you would like to have answered. And trying to use it as a
group.

&gt;<i> Of course, as I write this, I now noticed Fabian's update on the progress of
</I>&gt;<i> the existing Metascore prototype. I do not by any means wish to simply throw
</I>&gt;<i> away that development, but I continue to wonder (hope) if there might be a
</I>&gt;<i> way to integrate some of the cool programming Jim has done with WH2.
</I>&gt;<i> If not... no big. I very much like what I just heard from Fabian, and I
</I>&gt;<i> agree with Jim that this project has been a good meeting point for this
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;tribe&quot; of open source governance folks.
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing which continues to distinguish this project is its focus on
</I>&gt;<i> providing actual governance instead of simply informing the opinions of our
</I>&gt;<i> betters... I mean, our representatives. That sets us apart as being the
</I>&gt;<i> third generation in the development of eDemocracy systems, so it it is
</I>&gt;<i> understandable that we would be lagging behind the earlier generations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been doing!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something usable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to emerge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It&#180;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> excited and glad. But &#160;the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really happen yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come between us!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our name!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score! &#160; ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.
