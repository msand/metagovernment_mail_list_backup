PS - My answer below wasn't clear.  Just to underline, admin of
authentication services is separate from and has no effect on admin of
the content systems (DVCS, Wiki, Google Docs), or the voting sustems
(Metascore, Votorola, Vilfredo, etc.).

So you can have distributed ownership/editing of the documents.
(That's actually how Votorola does it, too.) - M
