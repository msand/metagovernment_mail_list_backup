Hello Thomas,

We would have to agree to a standard interface between the voting
engine and the other site facilities.  A site administrator could then
unplug one engine (say Votorola), and plug another in (Rule2Gether-2).

So the voting engine would be coded as a component.  This has
advantages for the projects.  It becomes easier to share the
technology among them.  They don't have to code their own voting
facilities, they just drop in a standard engine (of their choice) and
code around it.

Lately I'm thinking there may be another approach.  It has some
advantages for the voters.  I'll post about it in the other thread
(Votorola etc).  It fits with what Ed and Pietro are suggesting.

Soon,
