I very much agree. The name Metascore was developed months after  
Metagovernment. It took me about a minute to come up with, as I was  
just trying to &quot;get the job done&quot; at that point and didn't put much  
thought into it. In fact, I put so little thought into it that I  
apparently hadn't even done a web search for it, else I would have  
noticed the Metascore algorithm currently used (and copyrighted) by  
Metacritic:
<A HREF="http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml">http://www.metacritic.com/about/scoring.shtml</A>
(Though as noted before, I suspect that the copyright is not an issue.)

Instead of discussing a new name for it on this list, would it be  
possible to do it through the prototype? That is, if you will have the  
new version deployed soon, could we just take the conversation there  
in the form of people proposing new names? This would be a great test  
of a multi-proposal event, where there is not a simple yes/no  
question, but rather a nuanced question of which idea among many  
possible alternatives is the best.
