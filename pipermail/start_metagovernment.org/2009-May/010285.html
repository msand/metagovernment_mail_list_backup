<PRE>The W3C eGov Interest Group's note has been published.  I posted a temporary
link at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/index.asp#new">http://xml.gov/index.asp#new</A> and a more permanent one at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp">http://xml.gov/documents/completed.asp</A>   

 

Passages of interest to AIIM's StratML Committee include:

 

. agencies have not rendered their mission, goal, and objective statements
in readily shareable format. Thus, it is more difficult than necessary not
only to create cross-agency mashups of the data contained in agency
strategic plans themselves but also to identify related objectives that
offer strategic opportunities for well-coordinated sharing of data
supporting those objectives.

 

. OMB Circular A-119 [US-OMB119
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-egov-improving-20090512/#US-OMB119">http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-egov-improving-20090512/#US-OMB119</A>&gt; ]
directs agencies to use voluntary consensus standards in lieu of
government-unique standards . except where inconsistent with law or
otherwise impractical. [StratML will be a voluntary consensus standard.]

 

The following passage is relevant to FIRM:

 

Archiving Challenges

If public policy is being developed in distributed collaborative ways, what
are the public records and archival implications? How can the development of
policy created through participative Web based tools be captured for
posterity? The existing mechanisms for archiving &quot;records of decisions&quot; are
poorly suited for the capture of distributed and fragmented information
created on the Web.

 

BTW, if you haven't already heard about it, you may also wish to check out
the Open Government and Innovation conference call for participation at
<A HREF="http://www.opengovinnovations.com/">http://www.opengovinnovations.com/</A>   Its purposes are closely related to
those of the ET.gov site and process. <A HREF="http://et.gov">http://et.gov</A>

Subject: The Issue Document is Published

 

All,

 

I wanted to take the opportunity to alert you to the fact that the first
year issue paper is now published. The location information and the
announcement from the W3 website is below.

 

I can't express enough how much I have appreciated your hard work, comments,
dedication, and focus to making this document a reality. Please take a
moment to take a pat on the back and have a thought on a job well done.

 

We are in a time of great change and one that is finally welcoming the
promise of electronic government, openness and transparency, open government
data, and citizen involvement along with the complementary technologies and
open web standards that can make all desired a reality.

 

We are playing a very important role in the present and setting the stage
for our impact in the future of electronic delivery of services,
information, and data to those that desire it while aiding in the knowledge,
understanding, and access of government by constituents around the World.

 

I am looking forward to year 2 of the group and formulating the work plan
and agenda. I am equally excited and engaged by the potential for
achievement and impact of this group to aiding governments in realizing the
promises of electronic government. Onward we go!!!!

 

 

GREAT WORK!!!! THANK YOU TO ALL.

 

Cheers,

 Kevin

Improving Access to Government through Better Use of the Web Note Published

2009-05-12: The eGovernment &lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/2007/eGov/IG/">http://www.w3.org/2007/eGov/IG/</A>&gt;  Interest
Group has published a Group Note of Improving Access
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-egov-improving-20090512/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/NOTE-egov-improving-20090512/</A>&gt;  to Government
through Better Use of the Web. This document is an attempt to describe, but
not yet solve, the variety of issues and challenges faced by governments in
their efforts to apply 21st century capabilities to eGovernment initiatives.
It provides examples of existing, applicable open Web standards. Where
government needs in the development of eGovernment services are not
currently met by existing standards, those gaps are noted. Learn more about
