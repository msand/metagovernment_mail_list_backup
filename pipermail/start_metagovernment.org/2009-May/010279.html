As I was catching up on this thread (have been completely off the  
internet for a few days), I was thinking of an analogy which sums this  
up fairly well:

A singular computing platform (e.g., Windows) stifles innovation and  
experimentation. Even though the world repeatedly has pushed toward a  
single, Windows-based platform, we continue to break away from it well  
before it takes over because the innovative spirit has to find an  
avenue of expression.

On the other hand, a singular network (i.e., the internet) is a very  
good thing. It allows for standardization and provides a platform for  
amazing innovations (e.g., Web 2.0). Back when everyone had a  
separate, internal network with no real outside communications, none  
of the current web innovations were even imaginable.

So at this early stage, it is only reasonable that we have many  
competing projects, but it certainly would help if we had some common  
ground to allow for cross-fertilization. There are areas of our  
various projects that are too different to find a common platform, but  
there are some things (the idea and perhaps the format of a law/ 
policy, for example) that could be standardized into a common format  
of some kind... aren't there?

P.S. The one thing we already have in common is this list. (And for  
the most part, I believe almost every group generally agrees with the  
first two basic principles of the Metagovernment project, though  
certainly not all would agree with allowing *everyone* to participate  
in *any* decision without any limitation.) I continue to invite people  
from other groups to join this list, and would encourage others to do  
so as well. If nothing else, the mere fact that we discuss in this  
open format is certainly a good thing.
