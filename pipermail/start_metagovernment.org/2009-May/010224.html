<PRE>Michael, I took a look at your &quot;work itinerary&quot; at
<A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola-tasks.html">http://zelea.com/project/votorola-tasks.html</A> and, yes, from my perspective,
it would be good if it were documented as a set of goals and objectives in
StratML format.  

I'm not sure I could infer the core elements of a strategic plan (mission,
vision, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders) from the information
you have provided.  However, if you'd like to draft such a plan yourself,
you could use either the PDF fillable or Xopus form at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Forms">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Forms</A> Or you could send the information to
me in plain text and I will be glad to create the StratML document for you
and perhaps post it at <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#Other</A> 

Thanks for asking.

Owen

Thomas, I wish I could respond properly to your plea.  I'm a
competitor through and through, but I'm always ready to admit that
cooperation is a good strategy.  Sometimes I even think it's the
prize.

At the same time, I'd urge anyone who's bored with watching the
contest (paint dries faster than software is coded) to do something
about it.  I agree with your overall approach - if you can't decide
which of the dozen or so projects is the most worthy of helping, then
do something in between them.  Who knows?  You might bring together
the winning team.

I thought you were running uservoice, Jim.  Will you be modifying the
code for this beta, or repackaging a distro of it?  Is there a doc
that outlines your work priorities, planned features, and so forth?

PS, My own work priorities are here:

(Owen, is this something we should be encoding in StratML?)
