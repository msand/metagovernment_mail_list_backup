<PRE>Dear Fabian,

It saddens me to read such type of criticism on this list.
As the person who started the whole FP7 thread back in december 2008
(<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-December/001031.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2008-December/001031.html</A>)
I felt I couldn't be quiet without clarifying some of the &quot;problems&quot; you
raised :

&gt;<i> [...]What troubles me is the fact that some of us are willing to

</I>&gt;<i> February a thread was started where it was mentioned that the FP7
</I>&gt;<i> proposal cannot be published beforehand.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001225.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001225.html</A>
</I>You should start from the beginning... I have subscribed to this list
last year, because I found many of metagovernment goals compatible with
the work that the Telematics Freedom is doing, and thought that this
could be a good place to find people interesting in *joining efforts* to
build something that can really change the world. Check my first emails
in the archive and see for yourself.

Later, there was a discussion on whether or not to make metagovernment a
formal organization, and I sent this message:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001124.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001124.html</A>
In the meantime this list was discussing the best organizational method
(and in the end no decision was made to become a formal institution and
bid under the FP7) I kept doing *my work*, and me and Pietro (who was
already interested via the University of Coimbra) continued to pursue
the tight EU bid deadlines.

Now the FP7 rules, the decision of not making the project public outside
the project partners list until the bid results are published and
everything else concerning the FP7 project *is not* by any chance part
of metagovernment or endorsed by it. Again, as the person who decided to
invite people on this list to freely participate in the EU project, I
reaffirm my desire of collaborating with metagovernment because I still
see much of the goals are the same, and things can be well integrated if
the projects goes through (but even if it doesn't, since the TFF will
continue to work on it, in collaboration with Pietro and others who have
the same goals).

&gt;<i> At the time I voiced my concern but it seems that this has not changed
</I>&gt;<i> much. Work for FP7 has continued without full transparency to the public.
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=19">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=19</A>
</I>I first clearly stated (in the message linked above) how we were working
to build the FP7 proposal, I spent time inviting and talking to people
to conciliate different needs and objectives. I just can't accept that
someone judge this process a lacking of transparency, because this is
not true. I am not sure here if you are trying to say that you hadn't
the chance to be part of the FP7 project (you had) or if you are just
making confusion thinking the FP7 project is by any means metagovernment
(which is not).

Now, to end up with this, I would ask to remove any FP7 reference in
metagovernment's wiki if this brings problems to the &quot;principle of
openness&quot; you are referring to. After all, there was no formal
involvement of metagovernment as an institution (even tough we really
wish to work with the community within the scope of PF7 to come up with
something that many others can use) and I am not here to force anyone to
do so.

&gt;<i> I would like to ask some questions.
</I>&gt;<i> - Why do we need money for anything other then servers?
</I>&gt;<i> - Are the Basic Principles only for decoration?
</I>If you are referring to the FP7 that the telematics freedom is
promoting, in the first place we plan to pay salaries and pay for much
research work to release something innovative and good for everyone in
the FLOSS world. As for the principles, those apply for metagovernment
(which again is not the FP7) so I have nothing to do with it.

That said, Ed got pretty much the idea in his reply. I just felt I
needed to strengthen my position here, to the benefit of the work we are
bringing forward (which is - and will be - open source, check our
website if you think we are anything but promoters of FLOSS) and respect
to the partners that decided to join the project and spent already a lot
of time in project planning and analysis (thanks Pietro and others not
on this list).

I am really sorry and apologize if this was not crystal clear for you
since the beginning.
cheers,
Giovani
