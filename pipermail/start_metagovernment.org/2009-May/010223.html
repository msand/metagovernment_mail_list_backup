<PRE>WH2 isn't running uservoice, it's always been a custom ruby on rails app.
The feedback forum is running uservoice: <A HREF="http://feedback.whitehouse2.org/,">http://feedback.whitehouse2.org/,</A>
but that's just for people's suggestions for the site itself.

re: your questions on wh2

I'm pursuing the Wordpress model.  There will be a downloadable version that
folks can install themselves, and then there will be a hosted version that
any one can sign up for and customize, similar to ning.com.  They will be
the same code base (I hope), multi-lingual, and open source.

The requirements to install the software are a bit more complex than
Wordpress (it needs memcached installed, search software, etc.), and I don't
want to spend time trying to help people get it installed right now, so I'm
putting all my efforts into getting the hosted version into beta in about
5-6 weeks.

Pricing of the hosted version will be unique (not advertising) and in
keeping with the concepts embodied in the platform.  I'm keeping it a secret
at the moment in hopes I can get some buzz out of it when I announce.

The priorities for the platform will be managed by the platform itself
starting in the next couple weeks, but right now, it's just that uservoice
forum.
