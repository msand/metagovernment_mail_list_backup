My question here would be... how are proposals associated with issues?  
The term &quot;issue&quot; is a rather vague concept, and as far as I know,  
different projects handle it differently (if they have even tackled it  
yet). I think DemocracyLab uses a formal taxonomy of pre-defined  
issues. I think the Metascore team is considering using a folksonomy  
to have issues interrelate by organic user tagging. How can such  
things be made compatible? The concept of proposals speaking to issues  
is a very central one to every project, and probably should be  
scrutinized at length.

At least for the Metagovernment project, decisions aren't up to one  
person. In this particular case, there is no distinction between  
technical and administrative decisions. If the Metascore team--or  
anyone else--can figure out interoperability, then it will happen. I  
do not think anyone in the project is opposed to the idea, so it's  
mostly just a matter of figuring out how to make it happen.

As far as I am concerned, the Metagovernment project is truly meta, in  
that it is an umbrella group for these other organizations: as  
evidenced by this discussion in particular. What you (anyone) decide  
is what this project does, since there is no barrier to membership and  
no levels of control.
