<PRE>No argument, Ed.  We don't live in a perfect world, and as Donald Norman has
pointed out, in everyday life precise behavior is seldom required for
acceptable results.  However, to the degree that people are being paid (and
particularly that others are *forced* to pay) for behavior, I don't think it
is too much to expect that it should be associated with an objective that
has been clearly documented and shared with stakeholders.

Stephen Shapiro has suggested that some people would be better off having
fewer, if any explicit goals.  However, I tend to agree with Steve
Pavalina's review of Shapiro's thesis:
<A HREF="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/01/goal-free-living/">http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/01/goal-free-living/</A> (Most people
would be better off if they had not necessarily more goals but goals that
are clearer, better documented, and against which they are measuring
performance.)

On the other hand, I can certainly understand why many people prefer not to
have many, if any goals.  While they may not achieve much success, at least
they will never have to face the degrees to which they have failed.

I think the standard you set may be too high for citizen governance  
(as you basically point out). Any individual interacts with hundreds  
or maybe even thousands of governance mechanisms every year, and it  
does not seem reasonable for each individual to formulate a  
comprehensive personal performance plan for each such mechanism. Some  
interactions are transient or minor, and can't be expected to get a  
major commitment from each member... but they still should allow for  
input from each member.

It would be really nice in theory, but I cannot see every individual  
formulating detailed plans for their condominium, park authority, food  
inspection program, professional society, road maintenance program,  
social club, electric utility, medical professional oversight  
organization, office football pool, etc. It would be more reasonable  
to expect individuals to choose their level of involvement  
dynamically, as their interest (and therefore perhaps their influence)  
waxes and wanes for any particular mechanism.
