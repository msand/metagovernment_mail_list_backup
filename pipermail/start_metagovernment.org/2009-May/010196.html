<PRE>Interesting that you chimed in here, Jim, as I was about to reiterate  
my feeling that WhiteHouse2.org seems like a good possible codebase  
for Metascore. As not-really-a-programmer, I don't know if this is  
realistic, but I wanted to get the opinions of you, Manuel/Fabe (et  
al), and Pietro on the possibility of using your code with Pietro's  
scoring algorithm and Manuel's DVCS deployment idea.

Each represents a real strength: WH2 is very well developed (not just  
that it is far along, but it is also very well done overall), Pietro's  
scoring system is itself very well thought out and highly innovative,  
and the existing Metascore's DVCS model is both ingenious and  
seemingly vital to a system which wants to be an actual governance  
mechanism.

Of course, as I write this, I now noticed Fabian's update on the  
progress of the existing Metascore prototype. I do not by any means  
wish to simply throw away that development, but I continue to wonder  
(hope) if there might be a way to integrate some of the cool  
programming Jim has done with WH2.

If not... no big. I very much like what I just heard from Fabian, and  
I agree with Jim that this project has been a good meeting point for  
this &quot;tribe&quot; of open source governance folks.

The other thing which continues to distinguish this project is its  
focus on providing actual governance instead of simply informing the  
opinions of our betters... I mean, our representatives. That sets us  
apart as being the third generation in the development of eDemocracy  
systems, so it it is understandable that we would be lagging behind  
the earlier generations.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been  
</I>&gt;<i> doing!
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;<i> I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of
</I>&gt;<i> humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt,
</I>&gt;<i> that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something  
</I>&gt;<i> usable
</I>&gt;<i> to emerge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It 
</I>&gt;<i> &#180;s
</I>&gt;<i> about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White
</I>&gt;<i> House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very
</I>&gt;<i> excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really  
</I>&gt;<i> happen yet.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And
</I>&gt;<i> out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion
</I>&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;<i> After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition
</I>&gt;<i> come between us!
</I>&gt;<i> Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give  
</I>&gt;<i> away
</I>&gt;<i> our name!
</I>&gt;<i> Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With fondest regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas Hahn
