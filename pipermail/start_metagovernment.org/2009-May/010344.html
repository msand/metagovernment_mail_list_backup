<PRE>(just on the run, here's quick answers)

Thomas von der Elbe wrote:
&gt;<i> I&#180;m no technical guy. Do I see this right, that the automatic exchange of 
</I>&gt;<i> new proposals between the projects is easy to handle?
</I>
One approach:

  a. Proposals have Web URLs, regardless of project.

     (this is already true)

  b. A Votorola voter can vote for anything at all (proposal or
     anything) regardless of its location.  This is because all votes
     are formally cast for people (candidates), and candidates are
     associated (formally or informally) with proposals (etc.)

     (this is already true)

  c. When a voter (V) votes for a proposal (P) in the context of a
     Votorola issue (I), and another voter (W) votes for another
     proposal (Q) in the context of the same issue, then both P and Q
     are thereby made alternative proposals of I.

     Thus P and Q are effectively &quot;exchanged&quot; or shared among the
     projects.

     (this is new disclosure)

The fact of a vote for any object (whatever on earth it is) ties that
object to the issue, and associates it with all the other objects that
are voted for under that issue.  Votes may then freely shift among
these alternatives, even though the alternative objects (texts for
example) are physically located on separate project sites, that have
no other connection with each other.

&gt;<i> And that there is now only the problem left, of exchanging the data about 
</I>&gt;<i> the votes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And that each vote would need to be exchanged with data regarding the 
</I>&gt;<i> voter, the authentication mechanism that he used, and whether or not he 
</I>&gt;<i> voted directly or via delegation?
</I>
The crucial thing is the individual vote itself (the computed results
are easy to share) so I answer to that.

Simplest, most flexible solution is maybe a redirect a la OpenID.  So
no votes are exchanged at all:

  d. On client site - Voter sees &quot;Here is Joe's proposal, please
     vote for it!&quot;

     Voter presses 'Vote' button.

     HTTP redirect to voting site, of the open voting network.

  e. On voting site - Voter sees &quot;Do you really want to vote for Joe -
     Yes or No?&quot;

     Voter presses 'Yes'.  The vote is locally recorded.

     HTTP redirect back to client site.

     (Step 2 may also involve authentication, if this was not done
      recently. This involves input of voter's ID, if the client did
      not specify it, and actual authentication, e.g. by redirect to
      the OpenID provider.)

  f. Back on client site - Voter carries on browsing ...

The vote is thus entered directly into the voting site itself.  There
it is counted, and the results published for clients.

Votes might also be shared between sites or networks, to create a
super-pool.  This assumes that translation of vote form is possible,
from engine to engine (not guaranteed).  But this is not essential -
we don't need this to get off the ground.

&gt;<i> And the user himself could then have statistically displayed all this data 
</I>&gt;<i> about every proposal and its votes. And additionally he could filter these 
</I>&gt;<i> votes in every way he likes, e.g. how many votes are from Germany, how many 
</I>&gt;<i> are cast directly, how many are cast with this or that authentication 
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism?
</I>
(yes, but not necessarily full filter capability at first - as
 described in other post, to Ed)

Sorry for the quick answers.  Please ask if it's not clear, or I
missed anything.
