<PRE>Successful open source projects tend to be led by a person or two who does
all the coding to get the initial version to a place where it is actually
useful to other people.  Then when other people are looking to solve a
problem, they see a project that is sort of close to what they want to do,
so they start tweaking the code a bit and get involved.  That's how the
project grows.   People coding in their free time for no money don't like
being told what to do, they do it because they want to make it work they
want they want it to work!  Sometimes lots of people get involved, and then
there are disagreements on the future direction, so they fork it and spin
off a slightly different version, etc..

The metagovernment software (or metascore) doesn't solve a problem for
anyone, YET.  What metagovernment *is* solving though, is it's getting a
bunch of people and projects together who are interested in this concept of
open source governance and getting a dialog going.  That's not a failure at
all, that's a success!  The nature of this project is it's led by someone
who brings people together, not someone who codes.

That's my general philosophy on this, and explains a bit of how I'm
proceeding with White House 2.  I'm trying to get it to a point where it's
useful to other people, and then I assume people will have their own ideas
of what to do with it, and can choose to get involved or not.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been doing!
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;<i> I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of
</I>&gt;<i> humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I felt,
</I>&gt;<i> that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something usable
</I>&gt;<i> to emerge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us. It&#180;s
</I>&gt;<i> about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White
</I>&gt;<i> House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very
</I>&gt;<i> excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really happen yet.
</I>&gt;<i> I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And
</I>&gt;<i> out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion
</I>&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;<i> After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition
</I>&gt;<i> come between us!
</I>&gt;<i> Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give away
</I>&gt;<i> our name!
</I>&gt;<i> Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With fondest regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas Hahn
</I>&gt;<i>
