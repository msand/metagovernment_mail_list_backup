<PRE>Christopher, I share your personal distaste for elitism.  

 

Moreover, aside from our personal views, James Surowiecki has argued
persuasively that it is not &#147;smarts&#148; but, rather, diversity and independence
that are important to good decision-making in many instances.   Indeed,
communication among the participants may either diminish the quality of the
decision or make it more radical than it might otherwise have been.

It is interesting and encouraging to me that Surowiecki is keynoting Mark
Logic&#146;s user conference:  <A HREF="http://www.marklogic.com/UserConference2009/">http://www.marklogic.com/UserConference2009/</A>
Mark Logic&#146;s StratML search service prototype is available at

BTW, Matias, with respect to really &#147;knowing&#148; someone and thus trusting
them, I hope Metascore does not institutionalize, much less reinforce the
Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE).
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</A>   (Surowiecki
asserts that expertise is &#147;spectacularly narrow.&#148;)

 

I&#146;m a believer in President Reagan&#146;s famous admonition &#150; &#147;Trust but verify&#148;.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_Verify">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_Verify</A>   (Verification requires
records, and a good place to start is with records documenting the
intentions of those who seek our trust, i.e., their goals and objectives 

in a format that is readily sharable and subject to indexing, referencing,
and analysis.)

There's something in the subtext of this conversation that makes me
uncomfortable (or maybe I'm reading more into it):

The idea that people must be trusted with their vote, or educated in order
to vote intelligently, seems to smack of elitism. Who are you to decide if
someone is trustworthy or well enough educated?

This conversation, and your example Ed, have changed the way I think about
vote delegation. Now I don't like it. Anyway, to enrich this discussion I
would like to speak in its favor: Without it you can't empower someone you
really know and trust. People who really aren't interested in get involved
will desire to be represented in some cases, not to participate but to feel
like they do.
