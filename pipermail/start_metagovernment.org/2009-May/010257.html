<PRE>Michael, specifying presentation of the data (how it appears) is not among
the prospective purposes of the emerging StratML standard:
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A> (The standards document
that AIIM will be publishing will explicitly state as much.)  However, one
of the benefits of XML is that it can easily be transformed to appear as
desired in different formats, mediums, and devices.  See, for example, the
various renditions of former President Bush's management agenda at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#StratPlans</A> or, more specifically:

	<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/PMA.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/PMA.xml</A> - plain XML text

	<A HREF="http://xopus.com/files/stratml/examples/stratml/document.xml">http://xopus.com/files/stratml/examples/stratml/document.xml</A> -
read-only rendition by Xopus

	
<A HREF="http://xopus.com/files/demo/xopus/xopus.html#http%3A//xopus.com/files/stratm">http://xopus.com/files/demo/xopus/xopus.html#http%3A//xopus.com/files/stratm</A>
l/examples/stratml/start-xopus.html - 	editable using Xopus' Web-based
forms software (Feel free to try it out.)

	<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMA.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMA.xml</A> - Ken Holman's rendition
including the &lt;OtherInformation&gt; element
	<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMAwithoutotherinfo.xml</A> - Ken's
rendition without &lt;OtherInformation&gt;
	<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMA.pdf">http://xml.gov/stratml/crane/PMA.pdf</A> - Ken's rendition in PDF for
double-sided printing

See also the various renditions of StratML files in the prototypes at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#SearchServices</A> 

Please note that all of these renditions were automatically generated from
the same plain text StratML file.  So, yes, I do believe that StratML
provides &quot;immediate&quot; benefits (even though the standard itself is still
being developed and all of these renditions and services are prototypes).

However, I would also suggest that a balance between near- and longer-term
objectives is needed.  Focusing exclusively on one or the other is likely to
lead to less than optimal results.

Subject: [Start] Concrete benefits of StratML

Thanks Owen, I'll get back to your comments in the other thread
(Votorola, DemocracyLab, White House 2, etc.) if it continues.  I
think that it and StratML have the same purpose (hopefully it's not
too ambitious), and maybe StratML can help us at some point.
Meantime, I have a question.

Pardon me, but I find that too abstract.  You want to inform me of the
benefits of encoding my plans and so forth in StratML, but the
information doesn't come across.  Maybe it's just me (and maybe you
missed my earlier question) but what I suggest is that you convey the
information - the benefits of StratML - in a more concrete way.  For
example:

  I wish to publish a document so that other people can read it.  It
  occurs to me that I might encode it in a standard Web format, such
  as the HTML schema.  This requires extra effort, but I'm instantly
  rewarded with a payback.  I can view the result in a Web browser,
  and I know that other people can view it too.

Does StratML provide such an immediate, concrete benefit?  If not, can
you think of how it might?
