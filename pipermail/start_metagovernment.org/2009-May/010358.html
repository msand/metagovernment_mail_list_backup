<PRE>My suggestion would be to ignore the problem of context for now.
In Vilfredo (the paper is under review, btw) we speak about questions
and answer.
There are at least 2 levels above:
issues,
and context.

An issue might be abortion:
the context might be healthcare.

But as you can see what dontext does an issue belong is as much a
political issue than the actual answer.
If abortion is healthcare and not social services, or criminal law,
the position of people can be different, as well as who votes.

A second problem is that the way in which a question is risen gives a
huge bust in the kind of answer (proposals) it receives.
This is even more true in the other system where proposals (answers)
are defined only one time.

So you can have different questions about an issue.
&quot;under which conditions is a women allowed to abort&quot;
&quot;who can chose is a woman whould have an abortion&quot;
&quot;should a woman who is under danger of dying, abort to rise her
probability of living&quot;
&quot;Until what month can therapeutic abortion be carried out&quot;
and so on.

And you can have a metaquestion, that asks, how shall we enquire this issue.
&quot;how shall we enquire abortion&quot;
&quot;how shall we enquire globalwarming/climate change&quot;
&quot;how shall we enquire taxes&quot;

The answer to that is the question that should be asked.


Then you ask that question, and if everything went well you either
found the answer to the issue, or 42.

Now the issues are then organised in contexts. This can be done top
down or bottom up. I have explained before how to do it bottom up. I
shall not repeat it here. My take is that we do not need to do it at
all until we have at least 100 issue. At that point the best would be
to do it with a folksonomy.

Regards,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> Imagine a city government. There may be a proposal to keep the speed limit

</I>&gt;<i> another proposal to limit traffic speeds only in residential areas, and make
</I>&gt;<i> commercial-area speeds vary on a case-by-case basis. And there may be
</I>&gt;<i> another proposal in the city's parent county to not limit any speed below
</I>&gt;<i> 30mph/50kph.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In Metascore, these proposals may be related to each other through both
</I>&gt;<i> user-assigned tags and synthesis scores. But how might they be related to
</I>&gt;<i> each other within the larger context of an open marketplace of voting
</I>&gt;<i> systems? What if one township in the city is using Votorola and another is
</I>&gt;<i> using Metascore, while the county is using DemocracyLab? How can people see
</I>&gt;<i> that these proposals affect each other?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is not as much of a technical question as a standards-design question.
</I>&gt;<i> We could try to impose a defined set of possible issues (eg: traffic,
</I>&gt;<i> police, environment), but that seems limiting and inflexible... and there
</I>&gt;<i> subject to all kinds of failures. How can there be an open, cross-platform
</I>&gt;<i> system which interrelates different proposals to each other across different
</I>&gt;<i> systems?
