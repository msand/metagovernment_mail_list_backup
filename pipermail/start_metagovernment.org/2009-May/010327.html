<PRE>Hi all,

Going through everyone's views, i conclude, the following are the main
subjects of the discussions here - please correct me, if i am wrong:

1. 'Stakeholder involvement' rather than anyone's (outsider's) involvement.

2. Unique identity of the stakeholder / voter.

3. Permitting only single vote of each stakeholder on each subject.

4. Delegating for proxy voting.


The following are my views on the above:

1. It is difficult to segregate someone as a stakeholder and another as a
non-stakeholder; may be a classification of directly impacted, indirectly
impacted and not impacted, may help. But such declaration must come from the
individual and cannot be subject to audit, lest a superior authority for
review is brought it, which may belie the purpose.

A weightage factor can be introduced for the 3 categories - directly
impacted, indirectly impacted and not impacted.

2. Biometric Smart Card (BSC) can be used for unique identity.

3. BSC would limit to a single vote for each, even online.

4. Delegating for proxy voting may help in some genuine cases; but could
subvert the process of stakeholder direct involvement.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> that's right.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is not really the cost here. Is the trust. If Verisign or
</I>&gt;<i> any other &quot;proprietary&quot; company does the &quot;certification&quot;, how to avoid
</I>&gt;<i> corruption and all other problems inherent of dealing with private orgs?
</I>&gt;<i> Our user-verifiable telematics project aims to create a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;community-managed certifying authority&quot;, that will ensure openness
</I>&gt;<i> and  transparency in this process. We are now writing a new EU grant
</I>&gt;<i> about this, and the Free Software Foundation Europe has given their go
</I>&gt;<i> to join as a partner (although they don't want to commit to write the
</I>&gt;<i> project). The deadline is June 2, I am not sure we will make it this
</I>&gt;<i> time because we are in the beginning, but we'll try.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> gs
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Another approach is to have the voters cross-authenticate each other,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using their own trust network.  Here's one implementation (half
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; coded):

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I guess other people will have ideas, too.  No problem, because if we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can agree on basic standards, then we don't have to design it all up
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; front.  We can afford to be open to alternatives and to experimenting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with them, side by side.
