<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Maybe fingerprints are secure enough, and easy enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The opposite is equally true, since those that want to circumvent the
</I>&gt;<i> system will put the most energy into it. A supposedly good enough
</I>&gt;<i> solution is entirely insufficient for certain use cases. You have to
</I>&gt;<i> implement a practically unbreakable system. It doesn't matter if your
</I>&gt;<i> system is 99.99% correct in identifying people, because those last
</I>&gt;<i> 0.01% are still 1 in 10000 people and a security guard who has to
</I>&gt;<i> check 50000 a day, trusting the machine while he munches his samich
</I>&gt;<i> will never notice the one person that slips through. And he will slip
</I>&gt;<i> through, because he is exactly the person willing to invest the energy
</I>&gt;<i> to circumvent the system. At this point all you have is security
</I>&gt;<i> theatre.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again focus on the problem domain. In our case, we want to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> people gaming the system become statistically insignificant. I think
</I>&gt;<i> the worst case us would be gathering addresses and sending out one
</I>&gt;<i> time security tokens. I still think a network of trust may work
</I>&gt;<i> though, even if it isn't based on something like PGP.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of securing flights I would say proper solution is to
</I>&gt;<i> focus on checking baggage for explosives, search people for weapons,
</I>&gt;<i> leave out the verification and maybe arm the flight attendants.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>

But what damage can a single person do?we are not speaking of
terrorists who can put a bomb but of voters. Having a person vote
twice is not really going to affect the democracy that much.

Said that I still think that the best are systems where you interact
with your opinions and not with your votes. And if the opinions come
from 100 sources or one source should not modify the computer results.

Vilfredo for president! ;-)
P.S. I am acually still developing the maths behind it. The paper has
been submitted, we are now waiting for the results.
