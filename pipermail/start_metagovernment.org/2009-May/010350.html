<PRE>Social network requirements seem to have some paralels to a network of
trust. If enough people verify that you are who you say you are, you can be
reasonablly sure about the persons identity, which can be represented with a
confidence level.

In order for this to work, the confidence level of the person verifying will
have to be inherited by the person being verified. If the small world
theorem is correct, it shouldn't be hard for a real person to be verified by
at least a few other people, giveing each real person a high level of
confidence.

Clustering by verifications may allow to find people who are trying to game
the system, since fake identities should only be verified by few conspireing
people. I'm not sure about this though, sounds like a research topic.

Hello,
actually I am not that technical about user identification.
I think Manuel is more the tech guy on this.

What jumps to my eyes is that OpenId is good to permit to a user to
prove that he is the same person, if the user decides that this is
important. It is not good to permit to the system to make sure that
two votes are cast by two different users. In other words, since every
person can have as many openid as he has gmail accounts (for example)
then each user can vote as many times as he pleases. So in this regard
openid does not seem to do the trick. You might need a centralised
system that makes sure you only have one account. How to do so? Later
on this.
On the other hand openid can be used to let you answer things. Imagine
you present a proposal in system X. Someone asks something in system
Y. You then answer in system Y, and want to clarify that the answer is
coming from the same person that wrote the proposal in system X. Ok,
Open Id can handle this easily.

Regarding the centralised system, it seem to me that a facebook system
is the best we can aim for. In facebook what really identifies a
person is not his name but his list of friends. So it is not that easy
to create a fake identity. Especially if you clarify that each person
to vote must (insert here some social requirements, have x friends,
with which he passes x messages...). The problem with this is that
there are few people who are really asocial, and to avoid the spammers
we are compromising their right to vote. Anyone has a better idea?
Also the next problem is that facebook is proprietary.

Then of course there is the issue that some system do not need user
identification, but this is another ball game. Many system do need it,
so we better prepare for that.

Just my 2 cents.
