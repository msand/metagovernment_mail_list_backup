<PRE>
Sorry if the tone of my email wasn't very kind...
I just wanted to make clear that we are dealing with different creatures
here (metagovernment, fp7 and the pareto prototype), so we avoid
confusion...

As for the proposal, it is not true I was the only one responsible for
making it... The proposal exists only because there were partners
engaged in investing time to discuss it and write it. We could never do
it alone. So, yes, the key here is to join efforts for common goals,
even when we work for different final products. Hope we can still
collaborate.
cheers,
gs

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You should start from the beginning... I have subscribed to this list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> last year, because I found many of metagovernment goals compatible with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the work that the Telematics Freedom is doing, and thought that this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be a good place to find people interesting in *joining efforts* to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build something that can really change the world. Check my first emails
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the archive and see for yourself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Later, there was a discussion on whether or not to make metagovernment a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> formal organization, and I sent this message:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001124.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-February/001124.html</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In the meantime this list was discussing the best organizational method
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (and in the end no decision was made to become a formal institution and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bid under the FP7) I kept doing *my work*, and me and Pietro (who was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already interested via the University of Coimbra) continued to pursue
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the tight EU bid deadlines.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now the FP7 rules, the decision of not making the project public outside
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the project partners list until the bid results are published and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> everything else concerning the FP7 project *is not* by any chance part
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of metagovernment or endorsed by it. Again, as the person who decided to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> invite people on this list to freely participate in the EU project, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> reaffirm my desire of collaborating with metagovernment because I still
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> see much of the goals are the same, and things can be well integrated if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the projects goes through (but even if it doesn't, since the TFF will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> continue to work on it, in collaboration with Pietro and others who have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the same goals).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> At the time I voiced my concern but it seems that this has not changed
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> much. Work for FP7 has continued without full transparency to the public.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=19">http://pareto.ironfire.org/viewquestion.php?q=19</A>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I first clearly stated (in the message linked above) how we were working
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to build the FP7 proposal, I spent time inviting and talking to people
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to conciliate different needs and objectives. I just can't accept that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> someone judge this process a lacking of transparency, because this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not true. I am not sure here if you are trying to say that you hadn't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the chance to be part of the FP7 project (you had) or if you are just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> making confusion thinking the FP7 project is by any means metagovernment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which is not).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now, to end up with this, I would ask to remove any FP7 reference in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> metagovernment's wiki if this brings problems to the &quot;principle of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> openness&quot; you are referring to. After all, there was no formal
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> involvement of metagovernment as an institution (even tough we really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> wish to work with the community within the scope of PF7 to come up with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something that many others can use) and I am not here to force anyone to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> do so.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to ask some questions.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Why do we need money for anything other then servers?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - Are the Basic Principles only for decoration?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If you are referring to the FP7 that the telematics freedom is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> promoting, in the first place we plan to pay salaries and pay for much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> research work to release something innovative and good for everyone in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the FLOSS world. As for the principles, those apply for metagovernment
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (which again is not the FP7) so I have nothing to do with it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That said, Ed got pretty much the idea in his reply. I just felt I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needed to strengthen my position here, to the benefit of the work we are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bringing forward (which is - and will be - open source, check our
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website if you think we are anything but promoters of FLOSS) and respect
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to the partners that decided to join the project and spent already a lot
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of time in project planning and analysis (thanks Pietro and others not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on this list).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am really sorry and apologize if this was not crystal clear for you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since the beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Giovani
