<PRE>The problem of getting people to care about their own self-governance  
is a chicken-and-egg problem. The way governance is done now makes  
most people so depressed about getting involved; and those who do get  
involved still can't change the way governance works. I think we're on  
to a good solution by offering software to tiny communities and  
letting people see that they can self-govern in non-governmental  
situations. From there, awareness should bloom.

As I understand it, DVCS offers several crucial advantages for a open  
governance system. It not only solves most of the tricky security  
issues, but also mirrors the mesh-of-communities model we have been  
developing: making for a dynamic/organic inter-community structure.  
However, I do agree that the DVCS model can be confusing to the  
uninitiated. From what I understand from Fabe's earlier e-mail, they  
are working directly to overcome that confusion. I'm looking forward  
to seeing it deployed...

</I>&gt;<i> Interesting that you chimed in here, Jim, as I was about to

</I>&gt;<i> this is realistic, but I wanted to get the opinions of you, Manuel/ 
</I>&gt;<i> Fabe (et al), and Pietro on the possibility of using your code with  
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's scoring algorithm and Manuel's DVCS deployment idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Each represents a real strength: WH2 is very well developed (not  
</I>&gt;<i> just that it is far along, but it is also very well done overall),  
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro's scoring system is itself very well thought out and highly  
</I>&gt;<i> innovative, and the existing Metascore's DVCS model is both  
</I>&gt;<i> ingenious and seemingly vital to a system which wants to be an  
</I>&gt;<i> actual governance mechanism.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, as I write this, I now noticed Fabian's update on the  
</I>&gt;<i> progress of the existing Metascore prototype. I do not by any means  
</I>&gt;<i> wish to simply throw away that development, but I continue to wonder  
</I>&gt;<i> (hope) if there might be a way to integrate some of the cool  
</I>&gt;<i> programming Jim has done with WH2.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If not... no big. I very much like what I just heard from Fabian,  
</I>&gt;<i> and I agree with Jim that this project has been a good meeting point  
</I>&gt;<i> for this &quot;tribe&quot; of open source governance folks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing which continues to distinguish this project is its  
</I>&gt;<i> focus on providing actual governance instead of simply informing the  
</I>&gt;<i> opinions of our betters... I mean, our representatives. That sets us  
</I>&gt;<i> apart as being the third generation in the development of eDemocracy  
</I>&gt;<i> systems, so it it is understandable that we would be lagging behind  
</I>&gt;<i> the earlier generations.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello to all of you supporters of Metagovernment!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would like to introduce myself.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m Thomas from Germany and an active reader of this list since its
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beginning.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First of all I want to thank you for the great work you have been  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> doing!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thank you very much!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am very grateful to have found people sharing the vision of all of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> humanity speaking with one voice.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Since I&#180;m a M.A. Philosophy, Sociology and Political Sciences, I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> felt,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I could not do much more then impatiently wait for something  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> usable
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to emerge.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But now there is something I find rather sad concerning all of us.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It&#180;s
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about our relationship to projects like Votorola, DemocracyLab, White
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> House 2, etc. When they first introduced themselves to us, I was very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> excited and glad. But  the expected synergy just didn&#180;t really  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> happen yet.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I&#180;m painfully missing a deep analysis of their projects among us. And
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> out of that a valuing of their work and a well-intentioned discussion
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After their introduction this would be our turn.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These people share the same vision too. Please don&#180;t let competition
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> come between us!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s work together with them! And if necessary, let&#180;s happily give  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> away
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> our name!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Let&#180;s earn some synthesis score!   ;-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I strongly feel, that we should not miss this opportunity.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With fondest regards,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thomas Hahn
