<PRE>Matias, I checked out your reference below and this assertion in particular
caught my attention: &quot;Metascore should come integrated with another service
that individuals give daily use ...&quot;

To the degree that organizations truly believe in the concept of &quot;strategic
alignment,&quot; the &quot;service&quot; you are referencing is the organization's
performance management system, which should stem from its strategic plan.  

Each member of the organization should have a personal performance plan that
is directly linked to the organization's plan, and each record that he or
she creates should be linked to the personal objective(s) it supports.  (All
records created by anyone in the organization should be maintained in the
organization's records management system, which should conform to the
applicable standards for such systems, e.g. DoD Std. 5015.2.)

The problem is, I suspect, that no one really wants to be held accountable
so it is only human nature not to want our organizations to be that well
managed (efficient and effective).  It is also more comfortable for us as
human beings to continue to deceive ourselves by thinking that we
understand, agree, and are supporting the same objectives when in fact those
objectives are far from clear (and measurable) and, thus, subject to any
interpretation that any of us may wish to apply.  

What our group does or does not do will be a good, real world test of
whether we are ready, willing, and able to change such dynamics or whether
we are just toying with more of the same, under a different name.

Owen

Agree. DVCS is great, but I also consider it premature; check: <A HREF="http://">http://</A>
