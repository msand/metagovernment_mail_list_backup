<PRE>I checked <A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/FP7.xml">http://xml.gov/stratml/FP7.xml</A> to refresh my memory as to what FP7
is.  This is the first I recall hearing of Telematics Freedom.  When time
permits, I will see if a StratML document can be inferred from the
information provided at <A HREF="http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en">http://www.telematicsfreedom.org/en</A>  A query of the
site on the term &quot;strategic plan&quot; turns up no hits.

I see no problem referencing either or both of them on the Metagovernment
site -- provided that the linkages between their goals and objectives and
Metagovernment's goals and objectives are clear.  

It also seems to me that Metagovernment's own goals, objectives, and
stakeholders should be more clearly specified:

&gt;<i> Sorry if the tone of my email wasn't very kind...
</I>&gt;<i> I just wanted to make clear that we are dealing with different creatures
</I>here (metagovernment, fp7 and the pareto prototype), so we avoid
confusion...
No need to be sorry my original post was intended to be somewhat provocative
;)

&gt;<i> You should start from the beginning... I have subscribed to this list
</I>&gt;<i> last year, because I found many of metagovernment goals compatible with
</I>&gt;<i> the work that the Telematics Freedom is doing, and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i> could be a good place to find people interesting in *joining efforts* to
</I>&gt;<i> build something that can really change the world. Check my first emails
</I>&gt;<i> in the archive and see for yourself.
</I>I also think our goals are very much the same and we should collaborate
as much as possible. I just think that working on FP7 is one thing not
compatible with our basic principles. Even if is not a direct effort by
Metagoverment we are indirectly involved. Since transparency is very
important to me this is an issue.

On Tue, May 5, 2009 at 4:34 PM, Giovani Spagnolo
&gt;<i> Now, to end up with this, I would ask to remove any FP7 reference in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment's wiki if this brings problems to the &quot;principle of
</I>&gt;<i> openness&quot; you are referring to.
</I>This may be the best thing to do. But I will not remove it myself yet as
most of the active Metascore people have not expressed their opinion
on the issue and I would like to know what they think before doing so.
