I don't develop it not because I don't care but because I am not an  
accomplished programmer and others in the project are. I do not  
believe that a slap-dash bunch of hacked-together code would be  
suitable for the project. If I had, I would have done so two years  
ago. Instead, the project has far, far more advanced code we can use:  
Prototype A is more sophisticated than anything I could code this  
year, even if I had 40 hours a week to work on it. Likewise the FP7  
code and Whitehouse2 are both far beyond my capabilities. Not to  
mention DemocracyLab.

I don't see the benefit of pouring weeks of my extremely limited time  
into another codebase which would be substantially inferior to the  
ones we have available in the project. If you see the benefit, then  
you should do it. That's the point behind adhocracy. The whole point  
of this project is to allow for the community to act for itself, not  
for one person to push things down other peoples' throats.

Yes, there certainly can  and perhaps should be leaders in an open  
governance system, but not *one* leader. If all leadership falls into  
my hands alone, then we are indistinguishable from any other old- 
school, authority-based governance model. No, I will not lead alone.  
If you want leadership in how the code is deployed, then it is up to  
you to make it happen. Or better yet... contribute to the rich  
codebases we already have under development. Manuel's gang could  
really benefit from your help. Interface aside, their running code is  
really cool... and given Fabian's e-mail of earlier today, it looks  
like it is about to get a heck of a lot better. Isn't that exactly  
what you want?
