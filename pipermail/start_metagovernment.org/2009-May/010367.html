<PRE>Manuel,

Thanks for your thoughts.

We in India find Biometric Smart Card using finger print could be a good and
low cost option for unique identification of 1 billion population, as it can
combine the three aspects of what you have, what you know and what you are.
It may not be the best, I agree. Iris is also in vogue. Do you have any
other good and yet low cost option for a unique identification of a vast
multitude.

Best,

Kris Dev

&gt;<i> I dislike fingerprints, because they can be forged so easily. Indeed you

</I>&gt;<i> I recall the CCC publishing the fingerprints of the German Minister of the
</I>&gt;<i> Interior Wolfgang Sch&#228;uble. He was proposing to make fingerprints mandatory
</I>&gt;<i> in the personal ID that ever German carries with them. At a conference, he
</I>&gt;<i> hadn't taken care of the glass he had been drinking from =). Since then some
</I>&gt;<i> government officials proposing similar ideas either don't drink anything at
</I>&gt;<i> conferences, or even take the glasses they use with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I recall correctly, along with the fingerprints you could buy a kit,
</I>&gt;<i> with which to create prints that can fool practically every reader on the
</I>&gt;<i> market.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remain critical of any solution involving fingerprints, other biometric
</I>&gt;<i> authentication mechanisms and smart cards, which despite the best efforts of
</I>&gt;<i> manufacturers can be forged. I have yet to see someone implement it
</I>&gt;<i> properly, or better said an agency willing to foot the bill for implementing
</I>&gt;<i> it properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An example of this is I think the new German e-passport. A hacker managed
</I>&gt;<i> to forge one, which would authenticate him as Elvis Presley.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please be careful when you propose such technical solutions. They sound
</I>&gt;<i> fancy and sophisticated, but often fall short in the execution, leaving
</I>&gt;<i> gaping holes for abuse.
