<PRE>I agree also people would have a &quot;feel&quot; for the software and might come up
with some great names :)

</I>&gt;<i> I very much agree. The name Metascore was developed months after

</I>&gt;<i> trying to &quot;get the job done&quot; at that point and didn't put much thought into
</I>&gt;<i> it. In fact, I put so little thought into it that I apparently hadn't even

</I>&gt;<i> (Though as noted before, I suspect that the copyright is not an issue.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead of discussing a new name for it on this list, would it be possible
</I>&gt;<i> to do it through the prototype? That is, if you will have the new version
</I>&gt;<i> deployed soon, could we just take the conversation there in the form of
</I>&gt;<i> people proposing new names? This would be a great test of a multi-proposal
</I>&gt;<i> event, where there is not a simple yes/no question, but rather a nuanced
</I>&gt;<i> question of which idea among many possible alternatives is the best.
