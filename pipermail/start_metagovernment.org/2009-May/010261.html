<PRE>Thank you folks, for raising and discussing this questions.  I'll just
offer a few technical corrections, related to cascade delegation.

This is incorrect, as Owen has pointed out.  Although Thomas's elderly
lady is no expert on climatalogy, she is very knowledgeable on what
she cares about.  She is probably also capable of asking questions and
making decisions based on the answers.  For example: suppose she lends
her vote to a neighbour, someone more knowledgeable than her about
climate change.  Later, she is in discussion with some of the other
voters, a small group of them, all voting for the same delegate.  A
question occurs to her:

  My people are originally from a low lying country, and I have family
  there.  Is our policy the best for them?  Or is there a better one?

She then asks this question of the delegate.  Depending on how he
answers (or not), she considers whether to shift her vote to a
different delegate, and perhaps to a different policy.

Manuel was assuming that she was too ignorant to contribute to the
decision, and that only the experts - a self-selected group of them -
ought to be making the decisions.  (I do not think he really feels
that way, but just that he doesn't see an alternative.)

Ed is here speaking of a different kind of delegation, one in which
the vote becomes the property of the delegate, to do with as he
pleases.  Cascade delegation does not work that way.  To begin with,
there is nothing vague about it.  The voter can follow her vote in the
cascade, and see where it ends up.  It ends up at a document.  That
document outlines a specific policy on climate change, and is that
policy that she is voting for - nothing vague.

Nor does she have any dependency on the promises of the delegate.  If
she wants to see a change in the policy, then she goes into the
delegate's copy of the document (on his wiki) and she makes the change
herself.  She then waits, and watches.  Is the change accepted by the
delegate, on his next round of editing?  Does it then cascade further,
from delegate to delegate, toward the end document?  (If not, she will
ask the delegate, &quot;Why?&quot;.  At issue will be her vote.)
