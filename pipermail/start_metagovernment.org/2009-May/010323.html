I think you guys are right, it's crucial.  Like Owen says, we can't
let the voting be gamed.

So we're talking about verification of user ID (authentication).  We
have to tie the ID of an online user (OpenID or email address) to the
identity of a real person (name, residential address, and so forth).
Right?  This would give us an online voter register, similar to the
government's offline register.

&gt;<i> &gt; PGP with officially verified keys, which are passed around as user
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; credentials seems to be the only viable solution to me.
</I>
So a certifying authority (like Verisign) does the authentication?  I
think you're right, they offer that service.  But don't they charge a
fee?  It might be too high.

Another approach is to have the voters cross-authenticate each other,
using their own trust network.  Here's one implementation (half
coded):

I guess other people will have ideas, too.  No problem, because if we
can agree on basic standards, then we don't have to design it all up
front.  We can afford to be open to alternatives and to experimenting
with them, side by side.
