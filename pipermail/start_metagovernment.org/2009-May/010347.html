<PRE>To my knowledge, even OpenID suggests biometric as a form of digital
signature. I feel it is the best to create a unique and fail proof identity;
unless someone disagrees with me and has a better alternative to suggest.

On the internet any number of email IDs can be created and it will not be
difficult for a person to create multiple IDs for self and friends and pass
off as a genuine person. This would belie the purpose.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Pietro and Manuel can speak more intelligently about this than me... they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; had been devising a simple method of internal cross-checking to prevent
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; impact of sock-puppets gaming the system. If users authenticate or score
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each other, then we can look at the circle of influence of any user to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; determine their authenticity. If a group of users all have strong ties to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; each other but no ties external to that circle, it can be assumed all
</I>&gt;<i> those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; users are one person's realm of control.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i> actually I am not that technical about user identification.
</I>&gt;<i> I think Manuel is more the tech guy on this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What jumps to my eyes is that OpenId is good to permit to a user to
</I>&gt;<i> prove that he is the same person, if the user decides that this is
</I>&gt;<i> important. It is not good to permit to the system to make sure that
</I>&gt;<i> two votes are cast by two different users. In other words, since every
</I>&gt;<i> person can have as many openid as he has gmail accounts (for example)
</I>&gt;<i> then each user can vote as many times as he pleases. So in this regard
</I>&gt;<i> openid does not seem to do the trick. You might need a centralised
</I>&gt;<i> system that makes sure you only have one account. How to do so? Later
</I>&gt;<i> on this.
</I>&gt;<i> On the other hand openid can be used to let you answer things. Imagine
</I>&gt;<i> you present a proposal in system X. Someone asks something in system
</I>&gt;<i> Y. You then answer in system Y, and want to clarify that the answer is
</I>&gt;<i> coming from the same person that wrote the proposal in system X. Ok,
</I>&gt;<i> Open Id can handle this easily.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding the centralised system, it seem to me that a facebook system
</I>&gt;<i> is the best we can aim for. In facebook what really identifies a
</I>&gt;<i> person is not his name but his list of friends. So it is not that easy
</I>&gt;<i> to create a fake identity. Especially if you clarify that each person
</I>&gt;<i> to vote must (insert here some social requirements, have x friends,
</I>&gt;<i> with which he passes x messages...). The problem with this is that
</I>&gt;<i> there are few people who are really asocial, and to avoid the spammers
</I>&gt;<i> we are compromising their right to vote. Anyone has a better idea?
</I>&gt;<i> Also the next problem is that facebook is proprietary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then of course there is the issue that some system do not need user
</I>&gt;<i> identification, but this is another ball game. Many system do need it,
</I>&gt;<i> so we better prepare for that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my 2 cents.
