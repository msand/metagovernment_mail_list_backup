(I was playing briefly with Vilfredo.)  I think you suggested earlier
that it might be orthogonal to the basic voting and decision
infrastructure, so that we might use Vilfredo for one purpose (maybe
brainstorming), and the voting engine/network for another purpose
(consensus building)?  In that case, Vilfredo would not have to be
plug compatible as a replacement for the voting infrastructure.  The
two would operate side-by-side.

Or, if you see Vilfredo as a general purpose voting facility, then it
is probably compatible at some level with the other voting engines.
For example, suppose it permits a query of the current vote count for
a proposal.  Then the structure of that query becomes part of the
standard shared by all of the alternative engines.  (In truth, it
might be a grab bag of many standards, with varying levels of
compliance for each.)  Higher facilities that depend on voting can use
the standard to query for the count.  If that is all they need, then
they needn't worry about which engine is underneath, or how it works.

On the other hand, if any higher facility (F) is dependent on
Vilfredo's internals, and if Vilfredo is swapped out in favour of
another engine, then F must be swapped out too.  The ideal is to have
independent components, but thatt's not always be possible.

(I guess the biggest advantage of standard interfaces is they reduce
 risk for the other projects and developers.  The projects are less
 dependent upon each other, and less at risk from each other's
 failure, because the dependencies are factored out into universal
 standards - the risk is spread.  This makes it easier to cooperate.
 Developers etc. can also migrate from project to project more easily,
 because of the shared stardards, and because of the rapport they
 built up by working on them.

 The downside is the cost of developing the standards - the extra
 effort.  But maybe if we're no longer in a winner-takes-all race, we
 can afford to do the job properly.  And maybe others will join us.)
