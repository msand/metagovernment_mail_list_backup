<PRE>Replying to Manuel and Jim,

&gt;<i> &gt;  My people are originally from a low lying country, and I have family
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  there.  Is our policy the best for them?  Or is there a better one?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; She then asks this question of the delegate.  Depending on how he
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; answers (or not), she considers whether to shift her vote to a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different delegate, and perhaps to a different policy.

</I>
Well, I guess that's what she does.  She makes the decision herself.

Remember that she has complete control of her vote at all times.
Otherwise you'll misunderstand how it works.  It might help if you
think of how *power* is delegated.  (Note, this is only an analogy.)
When an executive delegates power to her lieutenants, she does not
surrender that power, she *projects* it.

It is much the same with cascade delegation.  The voters gain
everything by delegating their votes, and they surrender nothing.
What they gain, they gain by putting the delegate to work.  The
delegate is kept busy, like a servant.  He answers when spoken to, and
he runs errands - otherwise he is dismissed.  (Note, this applies to
the end candidate too.)

&gt;<i> &gt; Manuel was assuming that she was too ignorant to contribute to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; decision, and that only the experts -
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not true, through questions she has contributed to the discussion and
</I>&gt;<i> was able to develop an informed opinion. My argument was against
</I>&gt;<i> delegation based on peoples personal qualities and vague positions, as
</I>&gt;<i> we are forced to do in most &quot;modern&quot; democracies.
</I>
OK.  (Just to be clear, we are not speaking of that kind of
delegation.)

&gt;<i> I would even go as far as to say, that the only people who will use
</I>&gt;<i> the delegation function in votorola, are those not comfortable in
</I>&gt;<i> making the decision themselves. Why would you delegate, if you've
</I>&gt;<i> informed yourself to the extent that you choose a candidate only
</I>&gt;<i> because of the choice they themselves will make. At that point you
</I>&gt;<i> could just as well vote directly.
</I>
That would be equivalent to dismissing your servants, and doing all of
the work yourself.  Consider, we are talking about a voting structure
like this:

                        (0)  (0)  (0)
                          \ 1 | 1 /
                           \  |  / 1    (0)   (0)
                  (0)  (0)  \ | /        | 1  /
         (0)        \ 1 |    \|/         |   / 1
           \ 1       \  | 1  (3)         |  /
            \         \ |     |          | /  (0)  (0)
             \         \|     | 4        |/    | 1 /
          1   \        (2)    |         (2)    |  / 1
      (0)-----(2)        \ 3  |          |     | /
                \ 3       \   |          | 3   |/
                 \         \  |          |    (3)-----(0)
                  \         \ |    (0)   |    /     1
       1       2   \         \|      \ 1 |   /
   (0)-----(1)-----(5)       (7)      \  |  / 4
                     \ 6     /         \ | /
                      \     / 8         \|/
                       \   /            (8)
                        \ /                        1 = 10,000 votes
                        (14)


  FIG 1.  Votes flow downward, from delegate to delegate.  Leading
          candidates (bottom) have 140,000 and 80,000 votes.
          <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#figure-1">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/d/theory.xht#figure-1</A>


All of the smart voters are in the tops of the trees.  The trees are
much larger than shown.  Anyone who votes directly for an end
candidate (bottom) is wasting the best of her voting power.  She is
losing:

  * A familar, trusted delegate who values her vote and answers to her
    questions

  * A group of like-minded voters, with whom she can discuss things

  * A wiki (or whatever) to which she can submit contributions to the
    delegate's copy of the Climate Change Policy, for cascading down
    the tree

She throws all of this away, if she votes directly for an end
candidate.  The candidate will be completely unaware of her vote.  He
will be too busy to answer any of her questions, and he will refuse
her requests for access to his wiki.  Her single vote won't give her
any leverage at all, over this candidate.  She'll be almost completely
shut out of the decision process.

I half agree with you.  But I ask you to consider how helpful this
tree structure might be, when it comes to informing people, or when it
comes to people informing themselves.

And consider too: if a sophisticated voting mechanism is not central
to the purpose of your own project, then it might just be a gift, from
one project to another.

Other projects too: imagine you can slip a fancy voting mechanism
under the hood of your own site engine.  Don't like it?  Imagine you
can slip another one, in its place.
