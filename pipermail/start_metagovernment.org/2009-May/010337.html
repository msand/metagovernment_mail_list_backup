<PRE>Hello all,

I was recently in discussions off list in which the topic of
intellectual property came up.  None of the projects active in this
list was involved.  As many of you know, inventions are eligible for
patenting in North America for up to one year after initial
disclosure.  I think that most of you already know from previous posts
that I do not believe it is possible to enforce patents or other
monopoly strategies on the core voting facilities.  So what follows is
just a formality.

In the current thread &quot;Votorola, DemocracyLab, White House 2, etc.&quot;, I
am disclosing ideas related to open voting networks.  Please note that
these are my own, original ideas, and that I have NO intention of
patenting any of them as inventions.  Note also that I am disclosing
them in the hope, as expressed in that thread, that other projects
will find them useful, and that we may freely share the use of them.

Yours faithfully,
--
