(Forgive me, I'm being too analytical.  I'm always taking things
apart, to see how they work.  Maybe that's not the right approach in
this case.)

You are communicating a synthesis of your project: the whole.
Normally I would question you, to factor out the pieces.  But this is
Thomas's thread, and his approach is not analytical.  Like you, Thomas
is proposing a synthesis.  He suggests that we look beyond our own
projects, and also into the future.  I'm inclined to follow his lead.

I don't think we have a choice.  It's a strange kind of technology we
are working on.  If it works at all - if it can really pull people
together into consensus, and bring down governments - then what chance
does a mere project have of holding it, containing it, and
capitalizing on it?

</I>
I feel the same way.  But I'm not sure that Thomas was suggesting a
single project.  In any case, I agree with Owen: the ideal is both
competitive and collaborative.  It's like an ecosystem (credit Mark
Murphy).  We don't have an ecosystem at the moment.  We have separate
projects each playing in its own sandbox, dreaming of its own future.
As long as that continues, hopes will be disappointed.

There's a technical reason why it can't continue, and it could serve
as a kind of answer to Thomas's appeal, if nobody has a better one.
(I'm just not sure how to present it, yet.)
