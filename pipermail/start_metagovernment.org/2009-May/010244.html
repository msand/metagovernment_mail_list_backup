I agree with Manuel. To put it another way... in Metagovernment's  
vision, every policy decision at every level of every kind of  
governance is open to anyone's participation. Therefore, people will  
only participate in issues in which they feel engaged and/or strongly  
affected. In other words, people will self-select to the issues most  
pertinent to them. And further, issues will &quot;self-select&quot; into the  
communities in which they belong.

This seems to me to be open to significant abuse. Once you allow  
others to define what a word means, they can twist it... sometimes 180  
degrees.

I have seen this in local referenda, where I was actually asked to  
vote on a ballot measure which said something like &quot;Do you support  
Bill XXX which would increase funding for transportation and help the  
environment.&quot; What was I actually voting on? Well, that was left up to  
the policy-makers, who, for all I know could be saying that the  
funding should go to subsidize car-makers who produce gas-guzzling  
cars which get minutely better fuel-economy than current models. No  
idea.

In my opinion, to delegate is to abdicate. I see the same issue with  
your depiction of Votorola, where one must rely on someone else's  
promises about vague generalities.
