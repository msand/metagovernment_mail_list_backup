<PRE>Hello Regina,

On Fri, May 8, 2009 at 2:20 PM, Regina St&#246;ber-Yurdakul

</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Fabian and Giovani to remove the FP7 reference in
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernments wiki.
</I>
Can you please explain why? I never spoke with you, so I am not really
sure what your position and knowledge about the whole issue is. I am
not undermining your right to speak, about this issue, but I want to
understand how much do you actually know about it.

&gt;<i> There is no reason to be angry about that.
</I>
:<i>-)
</I>
You probably mean that you do not see any reason to be angry.

Please let me  explain. I joined the fp7 as a research from my
institute, and as a member of this list. I brainstorm on that page
with the list, and discussed with the list what were our proposals.
What were we going to bring to the table. At the fp7 I often explained
that I wanted as much as possible the informations to be trasparent.
This I wanted for various reasons. The idea of taking away the link
seem to me a really bad idea for various reasons:

1) personally I feel it forgets, and disrespects the work that I, and
the other people who have brainstormed this info, did.
(As I feel it disrespect my and other people work, there is indeed a
reason to be angry).
2) it is good for metagovernment. The fact of having permitted
something can help us in future. How? Suppose one of us want to give a
talk. In some cases they might look at where is someone coming from.
The fact that this list produced (or helped to produce) something is a
point in favor. In a moment in which politicians are looking for
people who are involved in eGov, the fact of being a list which has
member that are involved in official EU proposals, is a really good
point.
(as it is a decision that will eventually damage metagovernent, there
is a second reason to be angry, actually worried)
3) OMISSIS (ok, something I can say, and that is that some of what
will be developed can be tested by this list).
4) all the work that will be done will become opensource.
Metagovernment can then use this work.
5) because of 3 and 4, as this work gets developed, to still hold a
connection to the fp7 can give a slight help to the people who are
here to push the work in one direction, or to know a bit more. In
short put it like this, we submitted the proposal. After that Ed asked
me to make a report, and I did it. Why did I do it? I should not have
done it, right? after all I am not supposed to speak about it. Instead
I spoke about it, although in vague terms. I have done this because I
did felt that the work was related, to MG, and it was possible only
because of MG. You might not think of what I said as of any
importance. But you had access to it only because of that link. If
there is no link, on what base should I speak with you guy about a
personal project I am involved in.

So it is logic for  MG to still want to keep the page. Even if it is a
separate project.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up to here I spoke in a somehow objective way. Now I will speak in a
</I>&gt;<i> personal way. I am actually angry (!); I was the person who was in the
</I>&gt;<i> FP7 being the bridge between metagovernment and the FP7. Trying to
</I>&gt;<i> keep a connection between the two groups. A lot of the goals, and the
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions in the FP7 propoals came from this list. The FP7 owns a
</I>&gt;<i> lot to this list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can you please explain, what you mean with &quot;FP7 owns&quot;?
</I>
:<i>) sorry, my english is sometimes funny.
</I>I meant owes

There are many ideas that made it in the fp7 that came from this list.
So the fp7 proposal is somehow in debt to this list. It is not a big
debt, in the sense that no one will come and collect (what?). But it
would be unfair respect to this list to fully forget this link. Also
if this list was not present I would not have met Giovani. Again I owe
 to this list, this.

In short this list made it possible.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  It does it in an indirect way. But it definitly does
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, maybe Giovani would rather have this connection forgotten, so
</I>&gt;<i> next time I ask for some documents to become public, I cannot appeal
</I>&gt;<i> to metagovernment. Fabian might want to have it deleted, so he does
</I>&gt;<i> not feel that he belongs to a dirty list that got his hands
</I>&gt;<i> compromised.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think, this derogatory way is not he way to argue in a community with this
</I>&gt;<i> goals
</I>
You might be right. I definitly owe to Giovani some excuses for trying
to mindread his attitude.
Right now I don't feel truly apologetic respect to Fabian, so I will
not offend him further by laying.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the FP7 is a project that came into being thanks to this list. It
</I>&gt;<i> is a separate project. It cannot be disowed, and it also cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> required to comply to the strict rules that we keep between ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's like a kid. Let it grow, let it be itself, and let it remember
</I>&gt;<i> who his parents are.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The relation between parents and kids are not the relations between the
</I>&gt;<i> members of a community having equal rights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I am not speaking about the relations between member of the community,
but about the relations between different projects, and between groups
and projects. The group metagovernment in connection with the freedom
foundation, permitted the project fp7. As such the fp7 is a child of
those groups (as well as University of Rome).

&gt;<i> FP7 acts not like child but arises with the power of money.
</I>
The idea that it came because of the &quot;power of money&quot; is your own
personal reading of the situation. I fully reject this reading. I work
for the university. I will see very little of that money, and all in
an indirect way (some of the trips I do to study this thing will be
paid). For now I am paying of my own pocket. So far I have worked 2
weeks in Italy, and one week in the UK to write the proposal. No one,
not the FP7, not metagovernment, not the freedom foundation, not the
university of coimbra will pay me back for the money I spent. This
money was spent out of the desire to study those things intensly. But
you know what? I am paid by the university. I do not have to teach. If
I wanted for 5 years I could work on this, and not do anything else.
But this project might permit other people to work on it too.  I feel
your words are somehow misrapresenting the situation. I would much
prefer if you could avoid trying to guess the motivation behind my
actions. Of course, if you can.



So I think/feel I could explain why I felt angry. Maybe we could write
something above the page, to explain how the proposal was submitted.
We are waiting for an answer. In any case the proposal is an
independent entity from metagovernment, that does not follow its
principles (mostly because it is simply impossible to do it while
working with external institutions). Never the less we expect much of
the work from this project to converge back to metagovernment, once
the project has ended.

This would clarify the relation, while keeping true to the past, and
keeping itself open to the possibilities of the future.

Pietro
