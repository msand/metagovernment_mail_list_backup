We're OK on this, I think, as long as the network is rooted: &quot;The
ultimate trust source is the root node, which is the core site
[administrator/registrar].  All trust edges must be traceable to the
root, otherwise they are discounted in the elaborated network.&quot;

  <A HREF="http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust">http://zelea.com/project/votorola/s/manual.xht#Trust</A>

There's no possiblity of self-authenticated islands or loops.  If you
see that a bogus voter has trust, then you can talk to the truster.
You can say, &quot;Pardon me, but I think that voter is bogus.  You see,
there's no house at 22 Shady Lane, and he claims to be living there
with nineteen other voters!&quot;

If the truster pays no attention, then you can talk to the truster's
own trusters.  And so on.  Ultimately, the buck stops with the
neighbourhood registrars, and with the area admin/registrar.  They're
responsible for the integrity of the entire trust network.  They can
pull the plug on any portion of it, at any time.

&gt;<i> 2). Taking the example of my neighbor certifying that I am a real
</I>&gt;<i> person, this makes sense. But she can't certify that I don't also
</I>&gt;<i> have another identity. Say she saw a picture of my other self, she
</I>&gt;<i> may report this but this would simply be the reverse of the
</I>&gt;<i> situation noted above. Rather than have users trust others, users
</I>&gt;<i> would police others, potentially degrading into a scenario where one
</I>&gt;<i> group systematically questions the authorities of users in an
</I>&gt;<i> opposing group.
</I>
If we're talking about residential authentication, then I think this
is also covered.  Each online ID is tied to a physical street address.
It's that tie that's being &quot;trusted&quot;.  So if I want to have 20
identities - gaming the system with sock puppets - then I must find
places for each of them to live, just like real people.  Next I must
get trust for them from the neighbours.  That's going to be tricky.
I'll eventually be caught, because there's too many eyeballs on the
watch, safeguarding the register.

&gt;<i> 2) It's also clear that there is currently *no good solution* to
</I>&gt;<i> this, and different applications of a governance system will require
</I>&gt;<i> different criteria. So I would propose that the authentication
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism be separate from the governance system itself. Set up
</I>&gt;<i> standards like an api, but leave lots of room for this component to
</I>&gt;<i> grow and improve.

+1 (Open it up.)  Technically, we can do it.

We can also do what Owen suggests: Open up the comms between the vote
pools and the count engines.  Or we can go even further and extend the
open architecture to all functions, wherever it makes sense.  (Open up
the whole thing.)
