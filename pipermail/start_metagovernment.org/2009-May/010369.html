<PRE>Interesting about fingerprints.
Still we should consider:
how wide is the gap? I mean if you have a solution which can be hacked
but only by a minority of the population. It might still work due to
the fact that most people don't know or would not bother to hack it.
Is a bit like (sorry) with DRM. They are a pain in the ass, they cost
in image, and they can be walked around. But they succesfully stop a
big chunk of people so many industries still use them.


There is no complete secure system. It is always a matter of degree.
And the more something is secure the more usually are hard to
implement and utilise.
Maybe fingerprints are secure enough, and easy enough.
Something more secure might very well end up being too hard to use.

Just thinking out loud.

Cheers,
Pietro
