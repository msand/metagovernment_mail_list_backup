&gt;<i> I like this in theory, but see a few problems in practice:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) What about a group of people with a vested interest in inflating  
</I>&gt;<i> their votes? They could basically conspire to autheticate each  
</I>&gt;<i> other's multiple identities and thus further their own interests.  
</I>&gt;<i> One can develop software to detect this, but it may become a race  
</I>&gt;<i> situation where the software needs to keep pace with the groups  
</I>&gt;<i> attempts to game the system - kind of like SEO on the net, this may  
</I>&gt;<i> be both a good and a bad thing. With respect to identities, this  
</I>&gt;<i> would be overwhelmingly a bad thing
</I>
I'm not on my computer right now so cant look it up, but either in the  
wiki or the list archives you can find Pietro's and Manuel's solution  
to this. That is programmatically to look at circles of relationships.  
When a group of users all certify each other yet have very few  
external certifications, they can be grouped together to some degree.


&gt;<i> We see examples of this now, like when obama had his town meeting on  
</I>&gt;<i> the net. The campaign to legalize marijuana urged their members to  
</I>&gt;<i> storm the forum and elevate their questions to the forefront. Again,  
</I>&gt;<i> both a good and a bad thing. But if they used their organization to  
</I>&gt;<i> authenticate mutliple identities it would degrade other users'  
</I>&gt;<i> overall trust in the system..
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2). Taking the example of my neighbor certifying that I am a real  
</I>&gt;<i> person, this makes sense. But she can't certify that I don't also  
</I>&gt;<i> have another identity. Say she saw a picture of my other self, she  
</I>&gt;<i> may report this but this would simply be the reverse of the  
</I>&gt;<i> situation noted above. Rather than have users trust others, users  
</I>&gt;<i> would police others, potentially degrading into a scenario where one  
</I>&gt;<i> group systematically questions the authorities of users in an  
</I>&gt;<i> opposing group.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The truth is, in a high-stakes system such as we are envisioning,  
</I>&gt;<i> the value of trustworthy identities cannot be overstated.  
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly during the early stages of growth, before a critical  
</I>&gt;<i> mass of people are involved, one or a few groups of well-organized  
</I>&gt;<i> folks can easily dominate proposals, bringing the potential value of  
</I>&gt;<i> such a system into question before it can get off the ground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few thoughts on what might be viable solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) I liked the way gmail initially limited the number of  
</I>&gt;<i> 'invitations' any user had (initially, it was 5). This made it much  
</I>&gt;<i> less likely that one person would set up multiple email accounts  
</I>&gt;<i> since there were many more people who wanted the accounts than  
</I>&gt;<i> invitations to give. Users could 'earn' more invitations (mechanism  
</I>&gt;<i> unclear - we could institute a method of 'earning') but there was  
</I>&gt;<i> value to each account such that they were less likely to be abused.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) It's also clear that there is currently *no good solution* to  
</I>&gt;<i> this, and different applications of a governance system will require  
</I>&gt;<i> different criteria. So I would propose that the authentication  
</I>&gt;<i> mechanism be separate from the governance system itself. Set up  
</I>&gt;<i> standards like an api, but leave lots of room for this component to  
</I>&gt;<i> grow and improve.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just my two cents --

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The more I think about it, the more sense this makes. After all...  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is other people knowing we are who they think we are. So in essence,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> identity is nothing but a question of trust.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The real issue seems to be about consistency of identity: i.e., &quot;Is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> person before me now the same person I know from before.&quot; Is there  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> verify consistency-of-identity by one's network of trust?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Answering for Votorola's neighbourhood trust network: Ordinary voters
</I>&gt;<i> extend trust only to the people they actually know, at least in
</I>&gt;<i> passing.  So I might knock on my neighbour's door across the street,
</I>&gt;<i> introduce myself and say, &quot;I see you folks are on the voter list.  I'm
</I>&gt;<i> trying to get on too!  I live just over there.  Could you please
</I>&gt;<i> extend your trust to me?  Here's my online ID.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Recognizing me, my neighbour would say, &quot;Of course we will!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Thank you!&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So consistency of identity is provided by people's memory, and
</I>&gt;<i> refreshed by everyday encounters on the street.
