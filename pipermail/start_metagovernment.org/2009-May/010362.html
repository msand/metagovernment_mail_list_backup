<PRE>Hello Thomas,

&gt;<i> In your diagram:  X and Y will also exchange their data, so that there 
</I>&gt;<i> virtually will only be one big vote-pool, right?
</I>
So votes flow from pool X to pool Y, and maybe vice-versa?  It's an
interesting idea.  Makes my head spin too.  Makes me rethink the
internal structure of the voting service (so this gets a little
technical).


    voting clients

  A    B     C    D

    \  |     |  /
     \ |     | /

       X     Y     Z1    Z2  . . .

   voting services
   and vote pools


First off, I think we'll end up with a single dominant voting
service/vote pool.  I don't think the picture above is stable.  I
think that C and D will eventually swing over to X, or A and B will
swing over to Y.  This is because of &quot;network effects&quot; that punish
small networks at the expense of larger ones.

However, there may still be a few specialized voting services left,
alongside the main service.  It's hard to imagine what they might do
(so leave that).  But there will also be a number of experimental
voting services, and these will be important for research etc.  We can
predict that some of them will want to tap into the vote flow of the
main service, in order to prime themselves for realistic experiments
and tests.  So this alone would open the can of worms.

What spills out (I'm thinking) would be the separate functions of the
voting service:

  a) maintain voter register

  b) maintain pool of votes

  c) count votes

If there's to be cross-wise vote flow (or any other interrelations),
it might pressure us to factor out these functions into separate
services.  For example, vote flow will be technically easier if the
two voting services share the same register and voting list.  So
there'd be pressure to factor out (a) into a separate, shared service.

This could be another way, aside from losing its UI, that Votorola
will be torn apart by the open architecture - something I don't look
forward to - and I know the other projects will be affected in a
similar way.  (It's like they say, I guess: No pain, no gain.)
