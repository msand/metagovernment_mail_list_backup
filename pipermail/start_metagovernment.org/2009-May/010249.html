<PRE>This conversation, and your example Ed, have changed the way I think about
vote delegation. Now I don't like it. Anyway, to enrich this discussion I
would like to speak in its favor: Without it you can't empower someone you
really know and trust. People who really aren't interested in get involved
will desire to be represented in some cases, not to participate but to feel
like they do.

</I>&gt;<i> This seems to me to be open to significant abuse. Once you allow others to
</I>&gt;<i> define what a word means, they can twist it... sometimes 180 degrees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have seen this in local referenda, where I was actually asked to vote on
</I>&gt;<i> a ballot measure which said something like &quot;Do you support Bill XXX which
</I>&gt;<i> would increase funding for transportation and help the environment.&quot; What
</I>&gt;<i> was I actually voting on? Well, that was left up to the policy-makers, who,
</I>&gt;<i> for all I know could be saying that the funding should go to subsidize
</I>&gt;<i> car-makers who produce gas-guzzling cars which get minutely better
</I>&gt;<i> fuel-economy than current models. No idea.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my opinion, to delegate is to abdicate. I see the same issue with your
</I>&gt;<i> depiction of Votorola, where one must rely on someone else's promises about
</I>&gt;<i> vague generalities.
