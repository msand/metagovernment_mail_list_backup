<PRE>Dear Matias,
thanks for reading the paper, thanks for taking the time.

I think the critic you point out is a good point, but somehow we have
already started addressing it.

The fact is that often the Pareto Front will reach a consensus too
early. And that is essentially the problem you are speaking about. It
does not matter if the solution has been already presented (and lost)
or not presented at all. The fact is that the process stops before its
due time.

I think what should happen, and eventually it should happen
automatically, is what we have done with the two copyright questions.
The first gave a partial solution. Then the second was reopened. Now
the partial solution was listed among the knowledge the groups has
acquired. And now the question concentrated on the rest.

In your question once everybody have agreed to have a hardcover, they
would open a second question to decide the color.

So this would solve the problem of the color.  It would not solve the
problem of the paprback answer. I mean the paperback answer has been
lost. But maybe it has been lost because no one really needed that. If
someone has voted for that and not for the hadcover, then the hadcover
would not have dominated the paperback. And then people would have
looked for ways to integrate the two.

At this stage it feels the critic sounds like: when we all agree that
something is a solution, the algorithm is unable to spot that there
are other solutions.


Yep ;-).


The way it should all be made authomatic, is that once a question has
reached consensus then it would be send back to the questioner, asking
him if the answer completely answers the question. If he says yes,
then we are over it. If he says no, the system would automatically
open another question with the text of the first question, the text of
the agreed answer, and some extra text (editable) where the person
asks for more clarifications.


The other point you mention is that sometime some good proposals are
lost as were dominated too early. We need to change the UI in a way
that makes the history of a proposal more transparent. And easier to
recover. It is a risky business, because we risk of making the Pareto
Front meaningless if the history is too easy to recover. We will work
on that soon, hopefully.

Regards,
Pietro

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro. After reading your paper (and skipping the video, afraid of
</I>&gt;<i> seeing the &quot;pelvic thrust&quot; as featured in the Rocky Horror Picture
</I>&gt;<i> Show instead of the promised talk) I finished understanding how
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo works. It's all very well explained there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm worried about the situations in which the pareto front drops
</I>&gt;<i> useful proposals. I'll aid myself with an example, the question &quot;Let's
</I>&gt;<i> publish our book about collaborative governance. How it should look?&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Participants: A, B, C. Endorsements between parenthesis.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Hardcover. (ABC)
</I>&gt;<i> * Paperback.
</I>&gt;<i> * Small. (AB)
</I>&gt;<i> * Large. (A)
</I>&gt;<i> * Blue. (C)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hardcover is the only feature that pass. It dominates both
</I>&gt;<i> supplementary (paperback) and complementary proposals (small, blue).
</I>&gt;<i> Could this last be avoided?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Maybe atomizing the thread in subquestions.)
