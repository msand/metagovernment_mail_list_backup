<PRE>Breaking news!
We reached a consensus on the wall of text.
This is the text we all agree on:

*************************************************************
Abstract:
Require abstracts for long articles; calculate a complex score of the
proposal body; give visual feedback of that score; and present
proposals in order of lowest-score first.

Proposal:

1. Proposals longer than 1,000 characters require an abstract.
Abstracts are hard-limited to 500 characters. (These numbers could be
tweaked.)

2. Give visual feedback about the quality of writing of the proposal
body, perhaps in the form of a bar across to top of the input box
which contains a gradation from green to red. As the difficulty score
of the input goes up, the bar fills up (or a slider moves) toward the
red side. Also, the number score is shown. Additionally as the score
goes up, more and more text warnings/FAQs start to appear (using CSS
visibility), advising against length/complexity and giving tips on how
to write more concisely. Metrics for the difficulty score could
include:

    * SMOG score
    * Length of proposal - weighted heavily
    * Number of other proposals by same author on same question (ie, a
power law)
    * Possibly &quot;readability-votes&quot; by other users
    * Possibly others (though note SMOG is pretty inclusive. See source.)

3. Proposals are presented in order of their difficulty score. So the
simpler your writing, the more likely your proposal is to appear at
the top. This eliminates the need to build a karma system right away,
while still providing a strong incentive (but note, it is not mutually
exclusive with a karma system, and one certainly still could be
implemented).

(This proposal is a synthesis of several others.)
*************************************************************


Congratulations to Ed who developed the text.
Please allow us some time to code it.

By the way, as you might have noticed, now when you vote you are given
feedback of your past actions on the same proposal. in this way you
don't need to re-read every proposal you already have read.
We aim to develop this further by integrating it with the phylogenetic
tree of proposals.

Thanks to all those that have participated,
Pietro
