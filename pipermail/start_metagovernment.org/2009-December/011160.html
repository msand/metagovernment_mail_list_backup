<PRE>Hi Ed, yes,
I think this is better
but I still think that it's missing too much from the other projects.

Really they should fill in, and answer the questions for themselves.



I think I can explain Vilfredo well with the usual 23 minutes of a
classical TED talk.
But they do not offer 23 minutes presentations, so shall we split one,
or shall I try to go for a 50 minutes presentation?


Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. I CC to you a mail I sent them asking if there are still
scholarship available. We shall see their answer.

&gt;<i> No need to apologize... that was a quick first draft which I had hoped
</I>&gt;<i> others would improve. I have written a completely different second draft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In writing the new version, I was a bit taken aback at how little I
</I>&gt;<i> understand some of the member projects. (Honestly, that was one of my
</I>&gt;<i> motivations in having project-focus events on the list, so I could better
</I>&gt;<i> represent them all.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Particularly, I have to say I am a bit taken aback by what I wrote about
</I>&gt;<i> Candiwi, since it seems very unrelated to what Manuel had been describing
</I>&gt;<i> Metascore as before beginning coding. I really like Candiwi, but I am a bit
</I>&gt;<i> lost as to how it relates to the older vision of Metascore.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if members of other projects are looking at this, please do look at
</I>&gt;<i> the new version of this proposal and correct what I wrote about you.
