<PRE>Perhaps it would be sufficient to allow people to 'watch' pages that
are particularly important to them, so that they are notified if any
change is proposed (and thus important pages will have higher rates of
participation) ?

I am not sure if there is a good way to ask this as an open question,
something like : 'How to balance rates of participation in Candiwi
with the desire for rate of growth / rate of change?'

or, 'How to avoid potential stalemate scenarios with poor
participation in Candiwi?'

This last question comes across the wrong way; I don't mean to suggest
that this is a likely outcome, or even a certainty. But it is a
theoretical possibility that one could build a candiwi in a community
with an average participation &lt; 10%. What then, could the wiki never
move forward? If these users disappeared (fake email, etc) could it be
frozen in time?

Both are questions and scenarios I was considering when the idea for
'article-level settings' came to mind. It would allow for a community
to lower the threshold of acceptance (to, say, 5%) for most articles,
but retain control over those with major impact on the organization.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If we introduce categorization, for which different voting rules

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than the articles. The logic being, that if you make a spelling

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Likewise substantive changes that many people would like to weigh in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> on, can be in informative articles, not just legislative.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I had an idea like this, but haven't thought it through yet. The idea
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> was to have different levels for a proposal and anybody can escalate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to a higher level. The higher the level, the more stringent the voting
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requirements. The lowest level would then be spelling corrections and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it would require a very limited amount of votes, just to ensure that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the level is appropriate and somebody isn't trying to sneak something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in through a lower level.
