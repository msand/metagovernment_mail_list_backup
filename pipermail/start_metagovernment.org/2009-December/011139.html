<PRE>I agree that Vilfredo should be integrated with the others.
And I think we should set up a specific page in Vilfredo for the
metagovernment decision process. With the understanding that any
question that is produced and discussed over there has legislative
power over the community. We do what comes out. At least we try to see
if it would work. For now we could just have a softer legislative
power where if one member is really pissed off with the way this has
worked out then we can back off but an &quot;institutional crises&quot; is
automatically open where we rediscuss the structure of the
deliberative process.

WOW I start to speak like a politician. I might have catched the
virus. Stay away!!

&gt;<i> I asked the question on Vilfredo &#160;because I think their may not be a
</I>&gt;<i> simple yes/no answer to this question and another better solution
</I>&gt;<i> solution apart from a complete replacement might exist.
</I>

I agree that there are are options, but the way the question is
phrased right now is as an open/closed question.
It would need to be rephrased in an open way. Something like
&quot;In this time... we started those projects with the intent to move the
community on them.
Now some projects are able to support some basic functionalities.
Which projects should we use?
Integrated in what ways?
Or equivalently
How should the decisions project happen?
&quot;

This is just an example. But the phrase need to be written in an open
way. Or people will just not brainstorm. Or you will just a have a
pareto front of &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;.
