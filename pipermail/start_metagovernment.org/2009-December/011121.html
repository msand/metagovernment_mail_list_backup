<PRE>After one night of painful upload, we are finally ready to show the:

Vilfredo Rocky Horror Show!

So far I gave two talks explaining Vilfredo.
I only recorded part of one, and the second had a lt of discussions inside.
But with some edit I could produce a single video that clarifies everything
you wanted to know about Vilfredo, and were afraid to ask.

You can download it at:
<A HREF="ftp://pietrosperoni.it/publications.pietrosperoni.it/VilfredoExplenationMedium.m4v">ftp://pietrosperoni.it/publications.pietrosperoni.it/VilfredoExplenationMedium.m4v</A>

Warning, it is 600 MB.
I also produced a bigger version (for BIGGER screens), but it is 1 GB, and
my connection seem not to be stable enough to upload it. I will try again
from the Uni.

In this video you will not only learn about why we created Vilfredo, but
also something about Voting theory, how does the Pareto Front works, and why
do I think Vilfredo could actually scale.

I am particularly proud of the Pareto Front explanation, as it shows with
small animations and drawings the maths behind the PF. In short this should
really clarify
what is a Pareto front. I know many people have been struggling with this
concept.

The last part is yet unpublished, so I probably should not have added it.
But, you know, I know where you live ;-).

happy download
Pietro
