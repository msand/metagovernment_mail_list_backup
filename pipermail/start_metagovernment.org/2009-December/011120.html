<PRE>Yes, many people have suggested it.

The more I think about it, the less I like it, and here are the problems I
see:
a) suppose the question was going to reach unanimity, now it is
automatically reopened.
Now we know that in theory anyone can reopen a question, but in practice few
people do it (in fact I have seen it only a couple of times, I think).
Do we want this sort of push toward keeping questions open? But this is a
small issue, the following are major ones, instead.

b) The system works on the fact that people are fed back the pareto front,
and then use that to produce the new generation.
Even though they can write whatever they want the fact of presenting them
with only some answers gently moves the system toward an agreement.
On the other hand if you start writing new proposals before the voting has
ended you will do it starting from a different feed back. That is the set of
all the proposals of the previous generation.
This will in general make it harder for the system to reach an agreement.

c) right now there is a very strong beat: compose, vote, compose, vote
and so on.
This proposal would start to blur it.
If we have compose, vote+compose, compose, vote+compose, compose,
vote+compose,
soon people will start to ask why do they have to wait the compose phase at
all.
Can't we just have vote+compose, vote+compose, vote+compose, vote+compose?
Shouldn't that be faster?

Now suppose that we do keep both the vote+compose and the compose, most
people will start to only participate during the vote+compose phase.

After all &quot;why wait? I have already seen what the options were&quot;.

And now all their options on the new round will not be produced reading the
Pareto front,
but by reading the whole set of proposals from the previous generation.
And then threads of thoughts that would have been cut earlier could continue
for much longer.

Essentially this is taking away the power from the pareto front to reach a
consensus by eliminating threads that would not find the support anyway.

Think for example at the wall of text question, and the thread -series of
proposals- about keeping a fixed size.
There were few suggestion along those lines at the beginning. But only me
and Ed wanted them, so the thread died.
If we could have composed the new ideas before looking at the results from
the past generation
we could have immediately started to write proposals that integrated our
hard limit, with some other proposals that were there.
Now the next voting phase will have again those suggestions, and the thread
would keep on.
Yes maybe at the next generation we could have got the message, and stop
proposing things.
Or maybe not. In short that thread would have continued, on and on.

And now suppose instead that we do the next step and even take away the
compose phase.
We now only allow vote+compose, then each compose is not even inspired by
the Pareto front and the Pareto front becomes essentially an information
available on the side.

I am afraid, Matias, that the more I think about this proposal, the less I
see it as being possible.
It might work in small experiments, with few people that have been told how
they should behave.
We all know when to compose during the voting phase, and when not to.
But the system would break down when enough new people participate.

What maybe could be done would be to lend you a small edit page. Something
where you can scribble your notes. Something that can be opened and closed,
and it is the same for all questions. You can then write there your ideas,
and recover them at the next voting phase. But you would still have to
remember it, log in, copy them. In short it would be so much a mess that I
think it is easier to keep it simple and stupid as it is right now.

It is a small problem having to wait, but it could induce massive problems
trying to fix it, if it is even possible. After all the pain you are going
through is linked with the work extracted by Vilfredo in generating the
compromise.
When someone produced a tool that would link to Del.icio.us and let people
just use the tags that everybody else has used for a url, Delicious
programmer disallowed it. Because they needed the users to do that minimum
personal work from the users to have the url well organised. We might be
confronting ourselves with a similar situation.


Cheers,

Pietro

&gt;<i> Hi Pietro: Sometimes when I'm endorsing proposals I have new ideas
</I>&gt;<i> that I would like to write down. I'm wondering if we can have the
</I>&gt;<i> editor always enabled; proposals created during a voting phase don't
</I>&gt;<i> appear in it, but they are kept as edit/deletable for the following
</I>&gt;<i> admission phase.
