<PRE>It's not an academic conference, so there are no papers. In essence,  
the presentation is the document. It seems to me like it is basically  
a showcase of emerging trends in the nebulous concept of &quot;government  
2.0.&quot; If it's like the agenda from 2009, I would guess most of the  
presentations will be about websites which open up government data and/ 
or mash up government data with other things such as Google maps;  
initiatives for local governments to share data with upstream  
governments; governments providing self-service tools to citizens, and  
so forth.

Actually, I just found the 2009 presentation list, which is as I  
described:

Yes, the outline I linked to was the one you saw (Participation Camp).  
Video of it is still online

I love how it starts with everyone leaving the room. :) I was a last- 
minute addition and was going up against a live presentation of  
MixedInk. Oh well. Allegedly there were like 50 or so virtual attendees.

I'm looking forward to watching your video. I have a busy day, but  
hope to get to it tonight or tomorrow night. I heard the beginning and  
I do like how you start out talking about a 40-day voting cycle. It's  
meshes well with my

&gt;<i> Ok Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> I will look at the slides, plus I remember a presentation in video  
</I>&gt;<i> format you gave some time ago in a web centered conference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was this the one? Because I remember you speaking, but I do not  
</I>&gt;<i> remember any slide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, have you seen the presentation I posted today?
</I>&gt;<i> Because that is about the best presentation I have around on Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> That is a 1 hour presentation, and it also include a general  
</I>&gt;<i> critique to the democratic process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if I were to present Vilfredo I would follow a similar  
</I>&gt;<i> pattern taking away things that are already said by you (the  
</I>&gt;<i> critique to the usual democratic process), as well as the repetition  
</I>&gt;<i> (I repeat things a lot, somehow I found out that since people are  
</I>&gt;<i> distracted 90% of the time, if you repeat something 10 times you  
</I>&gt;<i> have a 1/2 probability of catching them at least one time ;-) ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they pay for the trip I have nothing stopping me from going. It  
</I>&gt;<i> would not even be considered days off work, it IS work. If I were to  
</I>&gt;<i> be paid by the uni they would even pay me extra for the stress of  
</I>&gt;<i> having to work far away from my family (i.e. my cat, a chicken and a  
</I>&gt;<i> rooster).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please look at the video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what is that they want? In a normal conference you submit a  
</I>&gt;<i> paper of x pages, formatted according to the standards from y  
</I>&gt;<i> editor, usually in latex or in word (if you want to look amatorial).
</I>&gt;<i> Here I cannot find and specifics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead there is an email address for scholarships. I think I should  
</I>&gt;<i> send them an email asking if I can have my expenses paid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if we present our work we should also present a tentative  
</I>&gt;<i> recepy on how the pieces could join together. Something like
</I>&gt;<i> first a question is presented on Vilfredo to find out the  
</I>&gt;<i> possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> then the resulting aswers are voted using this system,
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short we need to give them a sort of grand plan.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not matter if it is wrong, they know, we know. It is way too  
</I>&gt;<i> early. But it gives to the people a vision to pursue. Something  
</I>&gt;<i> like, this is the direction we are going.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I insist at some point to work on google Wave to prepare the  
</I>&gt;<i> presentation. now it might be too early, but for brainstorming it is  
</I>&gt;<i> really a good tool.
