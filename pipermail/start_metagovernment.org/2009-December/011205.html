<PRE>Ed, as of now, either of those dates would work for me.  Unless a conflict
arises between now and then, I'd probably want to participate in any event.
However, as a matter of general principle, motivation for participation
should depend upon what we hope to accomplish (objectives) rather than
merely meeting for the sake of meeting.

Needless to say, I am particularly interested in the 7th item outlined in
the proposed agenda at <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/3">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/3</A> 

It would be neat if the various tools/applications/services being crafted
under the Metagov umbrella could be used jointly and interoperably to enable
those who plan to participate in our meetings to determine the objectives of
each of them.

Subject: [Start] Proposed IRC meeting

There have been several suggestions on Vilfredo (and elsewhere) about  
holding more regular live meetings for this project to be able to  
maintain some momentum.

The latest instance is here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=18">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=18</A>

Would folks on this list be interested in a meeting soon? Holidays in  
the US and other parts of the world around this time make December a  
bit unrealistic, but I would think mid-January might be workable. I  
would suggest January 16 or 23.

It has been quite some time since a meeting was proposed, but this is  
what was proposed previously:
