Well, I was trying to do it in three sentences, as originally  
specified. But it is important to note that Akim isn't trying to get  
what he &quot;wants.&quot; Issues of vegetarianism and spiciness are not readily  
compromised. (In political terms, translate this to Akim losing his  
property or being killed.)

They have taken their conditions and winnowed down the options to the  
minimum set of items which can satisfy everyone's first choices. If  
they can only afford one item, then they would need to do a second  
round of voting (as Vilfredo allows). Their most rational choice would  
be to try to talk Belinda out of her beef preference, since that is  
not a must-have item. Then hopefully they could settle on a mild  
vegetable dish. Boring though it may be, it allows all three to eat  
with the money they have.

&gt;<i> Perhaps the summary statement can include an explicit strategy for:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) formally nominating specific menu items;
</I>&gt;<i> 2) letting participants announce their preferences;
</I>&gt;<i> 3) tabulating and presenting results, and;
</I>&gt;<i> 4) determining who may nominate and/or vote.
</I>
That is pretty much my understanding of how Vilfredo works. But I  
don't know how to say it very concisely.
