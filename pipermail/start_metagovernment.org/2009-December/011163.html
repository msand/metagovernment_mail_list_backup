<PRE>Hi Pietro,

Thanks for the response. From your responses it seems you do get the
question, though it becomes more clear in the end.

Briefly, you could say I voted strategically rather than honestly.
There were some good ideas but I didn't support most of them on their
own, rather I wanted to support some combinations of solutions.

This has occurred a few times where I would like to vote for two
proposals such that BOTH would be represented, and not for either
alone.

Would the honest and appropriate response then be to vote for neither
(none)? I am not sure this is allowed ..

Perhaps the selection of 'combinations' of proposals -- select
proposals A + B together, not as either/or but only as a selection of
both -- is something that can be done on the UI rather than changing
the algorithm, essentially creating a joint proposal from existing
proposals and submitting it in one step. This would be useful because,
let's say I write proposal A and Ed writes proposal B, I can't see
proposal B until the next round. But, perhaps people who supported
both A and B would then also support A+B automatically ?

However, from your response below I see that perhaps the proposal
where proposals are 'sub-proposals' of a main proposal is more
complicated than it should be. The A+B is essentially what I was
envisioning as the 'sub-proposal', where some could vote for the main
*only*, some for a sub-prop *only*, and others for some combination of
main+sub. But, this may be too complicated for VGTA to handle. And so
the main+sub would, in practice, be equivalent to the proposal where
one has an abstract and an extended section of text and one can
support the whole thing or not at all.

I am cc-ing the list on this email as requested, including the other
below, because this may be a better summary than my long-ish original
message.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am responding to you in email first in order to discuss my decision
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> process. Perhaps the discussion will be useful to you in thinking
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about the software and the algorithms. Also I am not sure what is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> best way for me to propose what I desire and have VGTA handle it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> appropriately, and would like to have your feedback before writing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposals.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ok
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In brief, I don't think this proposal alone is sufficient to handle
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the wall of text problem, though I support it in it's current version.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;this proposal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> which one is this proposal?
</I>&gt;<i> You have been asked to modify I proposal you did _not_ support, so
</I>&gt;<i> that the result would ba a proposal that you would support.
</I>&gt;<i> So I would assume you are refering to that proposal (proposal n.2, the
</I>&gt;<i> one that starts with the abstract, and then the main text).
</I>&gt;<i> But then you say that you support it in its current version.
</I>&gt;<i> Now I am really confused, because you did _not_ support it, so which
</I>&gt;<i> proposal are we talking about.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I were to support it with variation, it would take a rather long
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and not very concise proposal. Which would argue strongly against the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> proposal being itself a solution to the WOT problem posed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you need to write long proposals, I found writing an abstract,
</I>&gt;<i> putting some bullet points, and generally using the html can make them
</I>&gt;<i> quite readable. May I suggest that?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I did not support it precisely so that the resulting pareto front
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would contain multiple proposals;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So you essentially voted strategically. Avoiding to vote for something
</I>&gt;<i> so that that proposal was less strong. Knowing that it would probably
</I>&gt;<i> still win. Ok. We do not know how to handle strategic voting.
</I>&gt;<i> (Strategic voting, in voting theory, is when you vote in a different
</I>&gt;<i> way from what you feel, so that what you really want will come up).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ideally I would have supported a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> combination of two proposals -- this plus the other I supported (which
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stated 'in combination with other proposals') -- only giving support
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> if both were represented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Oh, so you did not support it, because you wanted others proposals to
</I>&gt;<i> be there as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I would suggest is that now you write into a single proposal the
</I>&gt;<i> various proposals you agree with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And you DO NOT vote for the single other proposals. Because you do not
</I>&gt;<i> support each of them... alone.
</I>&gt;<i> This is not anymore strategic voting, this is coherent voting :-).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>This is slightly different desired response
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from what I currently understand VGTA to do, which is to treat
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple supports such that either one or the other would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> acceptable. I instead wanted to support 'BOTH' if and only if both
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> were represented.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I said, this is possible, by -in the writing phase- producing the
</I>&gt;<i> solution you want, and then voting for that. And not for the smaller
</I>&gt;<i> components.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps this illustrates a need for a more nuanced handling of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> multiple proposals; in the case where there are several proposals A, B
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and C half might support A+B while the other half support B+C. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resulting front, if I understand correctly, should perhaps look
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> precisely like this -- A+B and B+C (N=2). Requiring that these two be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> synthesized in a second round.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Representing the above scenario in the current system would require
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I write 7 proposals for selection -- A, B, C, A+B, B+C, A+C,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A+B+C, some of which would be quite long and resulting in much
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> redundant text.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, but as you can see it is possible.
</I>&gt;<i> Now in future we might find ways to have relation between proposals
</I>&gt;<i> (what proposal implies what, what is in common between those
</I>&gt;<i> proposals, and so on).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Until that time I would suggest that you do exactly that.
</I>&gt;<i> Or more precisely, this is what some of us, me and Matias, for
</I>&gt;<i> example, have been doing.
</I>&gt;<i> But you do not need to write all the 7 proposals (although I tend to do it).
</I>&gt;<i> You are just responsible for the ones you like.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So if we just have in generation 1
</I>&gt;<i> proposals A, B, C
</I>&gt;<i> then in generation 2 you could add proposal A+B
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of what was in the pareto front of generation 1.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Remember that nothing stops you from recovering material from the
</I>&gt;<i> previous generations.
</I>&gt;<i> They are all available in the history of the question (there is a link
</I>&gt;<i> to that in the bottom of the question page)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Would you prefer that I write all combinations of proposals that are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mutually compatible?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just the one that you want yourself. But the cut and paste becomes
</I>&gt;<i> quite useful :) .
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or, is there a way for the VGTA mechanism to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handle this type of problem more intelligently?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately not. The problem is intertwined with the general problem
</I>&gt;<i> in AI, where we simply are quite unable to make a compuer understand
</I>&gt;<i> natural speach. If we had solved that problem, then Vilfredo would not
</I>&gt;<i> be a human based genetic algorithm , but a &quot;computer&quot; based genetic
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What we can do, from the UI point of view, is giving you buttons to
</I>&gt;<i> automatically copy in the edit box the text from the various past
</I>&gt;<i> proposals. But you still need to do the extra job to make sure it all
</I>&gt;<i> makes sense together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Very much looking forward to your response, thanks much.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope I answered. I am sorry Vilfredo can't do much more. But really
</I>&gt;<i> the problems we are facing are unsolved problems froma theorethical
</I>&gt;<i> point of view.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I think this question would really be helpful for everybody else.
</I>&gt;<i> Can I share it with the list?
