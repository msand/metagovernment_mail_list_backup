That is an intriguing approach. I guess all it requires is creative  
terminology in the license. Can you think of a specific company/OSS  
project that does this well?

There are two model organizations we could use together for this  
approach. I have not researched either one extensively, but they each  
handle one side of the equation with an open approach:

E Text Editor, the open company:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Open_company">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Open_company</A>
is developing a trust metric for paying &quot;employees.&quot; This allows them  
to forego standard employment and instead allow anyone to contribute  
to the project (as with OSS) and *get paid for it.*

MyFootballClub, the web-community-owned sports team:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MyFootballClub">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MyFootballClub</A>
handles the other side of the equation: ownership by a community of  
members. In a sense, MyFootballClub resembles any publicly traded  
corporation; but it differs in that all members have equal say (one  
vote each); voting is more detailed than the basic votes given to  
corporate investors; it is primarily organized through the web; and  
instead of investing, members pay quarterly dues. It is a nice  
starting point for the idea, but such concepts really could benefit  
from a more sophisticated governance structure. That is, they have a  
board of directors instead of a collaborative governance mechanism.

If these two approaches are combined, one can imagine a company where  
anyone can be an &quot;owner&quot; and anyone can be an &quot;employee.&quot; Wow. The  
more I think about this, the more my head spins. A company completely  
defined by the amorphous community of people who feel like  
contributing to it.

I'm cc'ing this to the OK list, where a spin-off of this conversation  
is progressing. See:
