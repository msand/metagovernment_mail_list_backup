<PRE>I think that active projects could be profitable, just like other open
source projects that are. They product is free for the community and
non-free for enterprises. I believe collaborative governance has a lot of
potential regarding these latters too, just we should find the spin-off.

It is easy to view a company conformed by two distinguishable groups:
investors and employees. Investors conform the directory, that throws
guidelines to be accomplished by the employees. How investors organize their
workers to realize those general orders in the most effective way is a
matter of another nature.

Today's accepted way is a vertical structure. But is this the best? Maybe we
can prove that collaborative governance is a far better structure. A
drawback is that decision-making last longer than a boss' decision. In the
other hand employees could resolved their everyday problems organically,
take decisions that effect him/her, understand the organization behaviour
and see orders as fair ones, fell integrated by other means than playing a
football game with co-workers. Unbounded motivation.
