<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Yesterday evening,
when it was late I did something I wanted to do for a long time:
analyse a session of Vilfredo for Key people.

The idea is that the more Vilfredo knows about us, the more is able to
ask specific questions and specific requests..

FOr example if the karma (as suggested in the wall of text) is
implemented, then Vilfredo would know which people are good in writing
proposals, and which proposals are not understood. In this way
Vilfredo could ask someone who is good in writing, and who has
declared that he has understood a proposal (that others didn't), to
rewrite it. This is just an example.

Another more specific is that Vilfredo would look for the Key People.
Who are the key people? The key people are the people whose vote alone
kept some proposal from dominating another. Those are people who could
change the pareto front simply by changing one vote (supporting
something, that before they endorsed, not the other way round :-D ).

And then asking those people to rewrite the proposal they did not
support, in a way that they would support it. So I made the analysis
(by hand, uff) for the last generation of the wall of text.

Let us call the proposals with numbers:
proposal 1:  An abstract is needed only if the proposal is longer than
the abstract LIMIT....
proposal 2: Abstract: There should be an abstract of the proposal in
pure text. For longer proposal (or that need html)
proposal 3: A person submitting a proposal might want to organize a
single proposal into sub-proposals:
proposal 4: Forcing people to write a certain way is the wrong approach,

And here are the key people:
-Ford on 2
-jb555 on 2
-Ed Pastore on 4

If Ford writes a new version of 2 (let's call it 2bis) such that each
person that supported 2 also supported 2bis,
but also ford were to support 2bis then 2bis would dominate 1 and
dominate 2, shrinking the pareto front of one.

If jb555 writes a new version of 2 (let's call it 2bis) such that each
person that supported 2 also supported 2bis,
but also jb555 were to support 2bis then 2bis would dominate 3 and
dominate 2, shrinking the pareto front of one.

and finally
If Ed Pastore writes a new version of 4 (let's call it 4bis) such that
each person that supported 4 also supported 4bis,
but also Ed were to support 4bis then 4bis would dominate 3 and
dominate 4, shrinking the pareto front of one.

In the material included you will notice how each other combination
requires more people.
For example for 2 to dominate 4 both mbarkhau and  jb555 need to
support the new version.
So we are here trying give little suggestions that might help in
shrinking the pareto front.
Maybe by the time the 2bis and the 4bis are being written some of the
people who did not support the previous version would feel to support
the new one.
Making it possible to continue this process in the next generation.

So I will now send 3 mails (CC to the mailing list).
Each mail should represent an invitation from Vilfredo to specific
people to modify a specific proposal (if possible)

-Ford on 2 =&gt; 2 dominates 1. Thus Ford what would be necessary for you
to support 2
-jb555 on 2=&gt; 2 dominates 3. Thus jb55 what would be necessary for you
to support 1
-Ed Pastore on 4=&gt; 4 dominates 3. Thus Ed, what would be necessary for
you to support 4.


As this idea of those invited proposals is new, I am eager to receive comments.


Thanks,
Pietro


P.S. What follows is the whole analysis. You do not need to read this,
but is presented as reference. All the information presented here is
public and available from the site Vilfredo.org (or can be calculated
from the info present there)


First the proposals and who endorsed them:
1
An abstract is needed only if the proposal is longer than the abstract LIMIT.
Ed Pastore chrisanderson giovani Ford

2
Abstract:
There should be an abstract of the proposal in pure text. For longer
proposal (or that need html) another field is offered, with no length
limit
battocchia vilfredo Ed Pastore chrisanderson giovani

3
A person submitting a proposal might want to organize a single
proposal into sub-proposals:
battocchia Ed Pastore jb555

4
Forcing people to write a certain way is the wrong approach, but good
writing should be encouraged as much as possible. There are three
(maybe more) approaches to doing this:
mbarkhau battocchia chrisanderson giovani jb555


Then each person what did they endorse:

people:
mbarkhau              4
battocchia            2 3 4
chrisanderson         2 4
giovani               1 2 4
jb555                 3 4
Ed Pastore            1 2 3
Ford                  1
vilfredo              2


A repetition in breif of who endorsed each proposal

endorsing:
1 Ed Pastore chrisanderson giovani Ford
2 battocchia vilfredo Ed Pastore chrisanderson giovani
3 battocchia Ed Pastore jb555
4 mbarkhau battocchia chrisanderson giovani jb555

And who was missing from endorsing each proposal:

missing:
1 vilfredo jb555 chrisanderson battocchia mbarkhau
2 Ford mbarkhau jb555
3 Ford vilfredo giovani chrisanderson mbarkhau
4 Ford vilfredo Ed Pastore

And now who are the people missing for each proposal to diminate each other.

Key People:
 (vilfredo chrisanderson battocchia) on 1=&gt;1 dominates 2
 (jb555 battocchia) on 1=&gt;1 dominates 3
 (jb555  battocchia mbarkhau) on 1=&gt;1 dominates 4

-Ford on 2 =&gt; 2 dominates 1.
-jb555 on 2=&gt; 2 dominates 3.
 (mbarkhau jb555) on 2=&gt; 2 dominates 4

 (Ford giovani) on 3 =&gt; 3 dominates 1
 (vilfredo giovani chrisanderson) on 3 =&gt; 3 dominates 2
 (giovani chrisanderson mbarkhau) on 3 =&gt; 3 dominates 4

 (Ford Ed Pastore) on 4=&gt; 4 dominates 1
 (vilfredo Ed Pastore) on 4=&gt;4 dominates 2
-Ed Pastore on 4=&gt; 4 dominates 3.
