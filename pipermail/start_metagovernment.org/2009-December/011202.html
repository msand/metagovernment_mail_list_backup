Those were the first questions I asked, when I heard the idea. :-)
Voting methods are so different, we can't possibly have a common
format for votes.  (Developers cringe at the thought.)  That means we
can't share a common pool of votes.  The upshot is that everything's
fenced off by voting method, and there's less scope for free ranging:

The interesting thing about the mirroring idea is, it doesn't depend
on common formats and pooling.  Instead, each original vote keeps its
native form.  It stays on the engine where it was originally cast,
while the other engines copy it and translate it (best effort) to
their own local formats.  Here's two examples of translation
algorithms (Adhocracy to Votorola, and IRV to single transitive):

Interpreting the votable objects across engines (like you say) will
sometimes be tricky.  I guess it will usually require pointers/links
or other kinds of mapping (maybe via GUID, as suggested off list).
The details will depend on the design of the two engines (source and
destination).  But as long as there's data transparency on the source
side, the coders on the destination side should be able to hack
together something that works, even if it's not perfect.  (We
shouldn't need to agree on any big standards up front.  That's the
important thing.)
