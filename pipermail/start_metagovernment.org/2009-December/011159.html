Dear Ford,
in the discussion
How should we handle the &quot;wall of text&quot; problem?
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>

you seem to be in &#160;a key position to produce a really helpful new proposal.

You did not support the proposal n.1298, which starts with:
There should be an abstract of the proposal in pure text. For longer
proposal (or that need html) another field is offered, with no length
limit. Only the abstract is directly visible, the rest appears using
ajax. Proposals are listed according to the karma of the writer, and
in case of people having the same karma according to the SMOG measure.
The SMOG measure is also always shown next to a proposal.

COmplete proposal available here:
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1298">http://vilfredo.org/viewproposal.php?p=1298</A>

Yet if you were to support it, the pareto front would shrink of one element.

How would you rephrase that proposal in a way that would permit you to
support it?
Possibly in a way that would still let the people who supported it
before still support it.

Could you please write such new version in the question page.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>

If you think this is not possible, it would be really helpful if you
could write instead a comment
(Starting with a line saying just COMMENT, in bold)
explaining why you think the above proposal is not just unacceptable,
but unacceptable in any possible variation.


Thank you,
the Vilfredo team
