<PRE>Ok, I read in depth their pages.

It looks like what they are asking is what is usually referred to as an
extended abstract. That is, a piece of text from half a page to 1 and a half
pages summarising what you are going to speak about.

I started making a mindmap of the talk (especially the vilfredo part).

You can get it online at

<A HREF="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/gov20expo/talkplan.mm">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2754299/gov20expo/talkplan.mm</A>
You will need freemind to view it.

(I by the way, really support both freemind as a mindmap tool, and dropbox
as a way to share files)


As I was reading the papers a few things came to me.
The first is that we really should do our best to answer their questions,
and the questions are

   - What will attendees learn?
   - What curtains have been lifted?
   - How can attendees use this?

Also in presenting the projects we need not so much to speak about them, but
show how each project is really bringing something new. And what is new. Why
is it needed. And what have we learned in this. How can other follow our
footsteps. We  are not going there to sell metagovernment.

Let me answer those questions according to the Vilfredo Project.

The aim of the Vilfredo Project was not to make a coll website, but to give
an example of a different form of decision making;
traditional decision making in democratic societies is rooted in Voting
theory (add 5 minutes of crash course on voting theory).
All of voting theory is based on the idea of answering a closed question by
counting how many people support the various options.
And then there are various ways of voting and of counting.
Vilfredo rejects the assumtpion that we already know what are the options
and instead proposes a search algorithm that uses human beings to look for
the possible alternatives.
The two things we are doing that are new are:
a) using a -human- genetic algorithm to find the possible alternatives
(instead of simply having the people in charge decide them)
b) Comparing the sets of people voting for the various solutions, and taking
the pareto front of the solutions thus generating a set that represents all
the users
(instead of simply summing up the votes)

We can do (b) because we don't have a fixed number of solutions that must
pass from one generation to the other.

The results that we found where:
 a)   people agree more on important things: we tend to agree on values
while we tend to disagree on the  weight we give to the values
 b)   there ARE solutions out there; most question reach an answer fairly
soon (in less than 20 generations, often 5 to 7)
 c) the solutions are usually more complex

problems we did find was that people get bored quickly

while problems we did not find: most people would have predicted that
ignorance of the participants was going to be a problem, but in fact we
never found that to be a big problem. AT the worse some solutions had to
spell out why they were presented, and why other solutions were not really
viable. But the fact is that the solutions from the experts will never be
destroyed by the solution from the non expert because the expert will not
vote for them, and then both will make it to the pareto front.


This is in essence what I should say for Vilfredo.

And in all this the URL of the website or the examples are not even needed.
This is what I mean when I say that we should not go there to sell our
project.

Now, can we have those questions:
-what is that they are doing that is new
-how was it done before
-lessons learned
-problems that they have found
-expected problems that they did not find.
answered for the other projects as well?

&gt;<i> It's not an academic conference, so there are no papers. In essence, the
</I>&gt;<i> presentation is the document. It seems to me like it is basically a showcase
</I>&gt;<i> of emerging trends in the nebulous concept of &quot;government 2.0.&quot; If it's like
</I>&gt;<i> the agenda from 2009, I would guess most of the presentations will be about
</I>&gt;<i> websites which open up government data and/or mash up government data with
</I>&gt;<i> other things such as Google maps; initiatives for local governments to share
</I>&gt;<i> data with upstream governments; governments providing self-service tools to
</I>&gt;<i> citizens, and so forth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Actually, I just found the 2009 presentation list, which is as I described:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009/public/schedule/proceedings">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2009/public/schedule/proceedings</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, the outline I linked to was the one you saw (Participation Camp).
</I>&gt;<i> Video of it is still online
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Conferences">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Conferences</A> (under June 09)
</I>&gt;<i> I love how it starts with everyone leaving the room. :) I was a last-minute
</I>&gt;<i> addition and was going up against a live presentation of MixedInk. Oh well.
</I>&gt;<i> Allegedly there were like 50 or so virtual attendees.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm looking forward to watching your video. I have a busy day, but hope to
</I>&gt;<i> get to it tonight or tomorrow night. I heard the beginning and I do like how
</I>&gt;<i> you start out talking about a 40-day voting cycle. It's meshes well with my

</I>&gt;<i> Ok Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> I will look at the slides, plus I remember a presentation in video format
</I>&gt;<i> you gave some time ago in a web centered conference.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Was this the one? Because I remember you speaking, but I do not remember
</I>&gt;<i> any slide.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, have you seen the presentation I posted today?
</I>&gt;<i> Because that is about the best presentation I have around on Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i> That is a 1 hour presentation, and it also include a general critique to
</I>&gt;<i> the democratic process.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think if I were to present Vilfredo I would follow a similar pattern
</I>&gt;<i> taking away things that are already said by you (the critique to the usual
</I>&gt;<i> democratic process), as well as the repetition (I repeat things a lot,
</I>&gt;<i> somehow I found out that since people are distracted 90% of the time, if you
</I>&gt;<i> repeat something 10 times you have a 1/2 probability of catching them at
</I>&gt;<i> least one time ;-) ).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If they pay for the trip I have nothing stopping me from going. It would
</I>&gt;<i> not even be considered days off work, it IS work. If I were to be paid by
</I>&gt;<i> the uni they would even pay me extra for the stress of having to work far
</I>&gt;<i> away from my family (i.e. my cat, a chicken and a rooster).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please look at the video.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, what is that they want? In a normal conference you submit a paper of
</I>&gt;<i> x pages, formatted according to the standards from y editor, usually in
</I>&gt;<i> latex or in word (if you want to look amatorial).
</I>&gt;<i> Here I cannot find and specifics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instead there is an email address for scholarships. I think I should send
</I>&gt;<i> them an email asking if I can have my expenses paid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, if we present our work we should also present a tentative recepy on
</I>&gt;<i> how the pieces could join together. Something like
</I>&gt;<i> first a question is presented on Vilfredo to find out the possibilities
</I>&gt;<i> then the resulting aswers are voted using this system,
</I>&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In short we need to give them a sort of grand plan.
</I>&gt;<i> It does not matter if it is wrong, they know, we know. It is way too early.
</I>&gt;<i> But it gives to the people a vision to pursue. Something like, this is the
</I>&gt;<i> direction we are going.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pietro
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. I insist at some point to work on google Wave to prepare the
</I>&gt;<i> presentation. now it might be too early, but for brainstorming it is really
</I>&gt;<i> a good tool.
