<PRE>Craig, no, you are not wrong about the lack of &quot;buzz&quot; on StratML at this
point.  However, AIIM will soon announce approval of StratML Part 1 as an
ANSI/AIIM standard, which should create at least a small amount of attention
-- particularly if others join in issuing cross-marketing statements.  

Moreover, OMB Circular A-119 directs U.S. federal agencies to participate in
the development and use of voluntary consensus standards (e.g., StratML) and
the E-FOIA amendments required agencies to make reasonable efforts to
maintain records in any format they are likely to be requested (e.g.,
XML/StratML).

Thus, if agencies fail to make their strategic plans available in StratML
format of their own volition, it would be reasonable to think those who
believe in the purposes outlined at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes">http://xml.gov/stratml/index.htm#DefinitionPurposes</A> may at some point submit
FOIA requests for them to do so.

Circular A-119 is available at
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/rewrite/circulars/a119/a119.html">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/rewrite/circulars/a119/a119.html</A> and the
E-FOIA amendments are in bold text at
<A HREF="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm">http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_updates/Vol_XVII_4/page2.htm</A> 

It would be nice to think that good government might also make for good
business.  Talking may be all we can do about the weather (at least in the
short run).  However, it is within our power to *do* more about government
than simply &quot;voting&quot; ... if we have the will to do so.

Which is precisely why I built the first component of the Indaba system 
as a tool that can support video contests, Oscar and EMMY awards, 
American Idol voting, and so on... anything with multi-candidate 
options. It seemed like a good strategy for getting attention so that I 
could find help in taking things to the next level. It hasn't worked 
yet, but there's always hope.

I presume the system I'm developing could potentially prove useful to 
the stratXML users who are concerned with settling on definitions of 
vision, mission, and values -- and even choosing a name -- since there 
are often multiple candidates floated in a vision/mission-defining 
process. But it's not clear to me that there's enough of a user base yet 
in that community that can prompt a big enough buzz that could in turn 
lead to support and funding. Am I wrong about that?
