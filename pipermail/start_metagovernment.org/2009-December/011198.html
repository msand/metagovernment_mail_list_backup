<PRE>Please everybody,
vote on the wall of text question.
<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>

For the new members, please vote as well.
If you can read the history of the question (linked at the end of the
page), it would be appreciated.
The reason you could not see the question before was because it was in
a separate area of Vilfredo.
Vilfredo has separate areas (called rooms), and each user can generate
one of those rooms one they ask a question.
The area where this question was asked is called Vilfredo:

<A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestions.php?room=Vilfredo</A>

Eventually we want to move all the questions concerning how to manage
and develop Vilfredo in this room.

On another note, just to let you know that those days I have been very
busy asking for a grant to develop this tool further.
One of the last point of the grant will be expand the tool to produce
something that can help a middle community to self govern.

The grant should fund 3 master laureates. Which could then use the
work to make their PhD (if they so want, but it is not a requirement).
The three laureate should be one in IT (to code and research the
technical side), one in sociology or political science (to plan it and
study how could be integrated in society), and finally someone from
psychology (to make quantitative tests about it, and get some
objective results on how does it work).

Of course IF we win the grant the people in this community will be
among the first to know about it.
So please keep your fingers crossed for the next months.

Cheers,
Pietro

P.S. remember the question:
