<PRE>2009/12/8 Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> A few things of note:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. The Gov20 Expo proposal is due later today. I will submit it as is...
</I>&gt;<i> unless there is further input?
</I>
Please go forward. Now it is me, who  have no time to add anything.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. A Vilfredo question about increasing participation resulted in a
</I>&gt;<i> tentative consensus (of four voters) that we should hold biweekly IRC
</I>&gt;<i> meetings. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=18">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=18</A>
</I>
if biweekly means once every 14 days I am up to it.

If it means 2 times a week, then it is too much.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Please consider Fabe's proposal about changing the Metagovernment site's
</I>&gt;<i> wiki to Candiwi:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-December/002348.html">http://metagovernment.org/pipermail/start_metagovernment.org/2009-December/002348.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Is that a &quot;how should we&quot;?

&gt;<i> 4. The Walls of Text question on Vilfredo is open for voting again. It' is
</I>&gt;<i> progressing very nicely. Have a look:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo">http://vilfredo.org/viewquestion.php?q=67&amp;room=Vilfredo</A>
</I>
It is progressing nicely.

I am also thinking that 3 days as minimum, and 10 days as maximum is a
good time. Everybody seem to have enough time to vote, and think
things over.

ALso the fact that the question is not accessible to the new users
seem to make sure that the community is really aprticipating as a
unit. Which means that once we have discussed something we don't go
through it again.


I am starting to suspect that one of the element that is insuring
success is not just to have people who are interested, but also not to
have new people coming in half way?

Do you agree?

In case, how could that be coded without making Vilfredo become some
sort of dictatorial place.


Cheers,
Pietro
