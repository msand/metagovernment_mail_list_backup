<PRE>2009/12/3 Ed Pastore &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">epastore at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> What you're talking about is good for the presentation, but too lengthy for
</I>&gt;<i> the proposal:
</I>

Ed, I split your question into two distinct questions:

&gt;<i> Do you think the current proposal adequately answers their questions?
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; What will attendees learn?
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; What curtains have been lifted?
</I>&gt;<i> &#8226; How can attendees use this?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>
</I>
Not really, sorry.

We present a revolutionary idea. That is nice.

And in this there is something to be learned, of course. And even
curtain lifted.

But it is a bit too superficial. We need to give them more meat.
Imagine if I gave the talk about Vilfredo and only said:
&quot;hey, you know what, instead of counting the votes we should really
compare the sets&quot;
its not enough.

Now there are plenty of ideas that are embedded in our work. But we
need to do the work to bring this out.

You see, an idea is one lesson. But most of the lessons are received
when you have an idea, and you try to implement it,
and it does not work, or it works in ways unexpected. This is the
difference between a paper with results and a plan for actions.

But at the metagovernment stage we don't even have one plan for
action. We have a vision. A grand VISION, but still sketchy. And then
we have 6 plans for actions. Each at various levels of accomplishment.
(With Jim at the top, and then the others). Now each should do the
homework and tell us at least what they are trying to accomplish, and
what they have learned. Just one thing. And then we can put them
together.

&gt;<i> Do you think the current proposal adequately summarizes what you would like
</I>&gt;<i> to talk about?
</I>
I remain unconvinced, sorry.
Look at this:

&quot;Attendees of this presentation will learn what new technologies are
being developed, how they propose to overcome traditional problems of
mass-governance, and what obstacles still remain. &quot;

Now among their documents at some points it expressedly said:
&gt;<i>Tell us what you are actually going to talk about. Don&#8217;t just set up the question, tell us (briefly) what the answers are. We&#8217;d like to know where you&#8217;re going with talk, and what conclusions you&#8217;ve drawn.
</I>from: <A HREF="http://blog.web2expo.com/2008/04/how-to-write-a-successful-speaking-proposal/">http://blog.web2expo.com/2008/04/how-to-write-a-successful-speaking-proposal/</A>
linked from: <A HREF="http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/cfp/82">http://www.gov2expo.com/gov2expo2010/public/cfp/82</A>

Somehow you are telling what we will tell, but not the actual meat.
This is just a neat package. But is there something inside apart from
a grand vision.

Sorry if I am blunt Ed, but we both have little time, and I see this
as the person what will receive and decide wether to pass it on or
not.

Apart for a nice vision, and some vague ideas, do we have something to
tell them?

Regards,
Pietro
