<PRE>Interesting,
I never thought about it in this way.

So, how could I use Vilfredo for sport?
Should I start a room called &quot;football&quot; and ask: who will win the next world
championship?

It sounds like an open question, but is is actually closed, with about 200
options.

And some people will only vote for their own nation so they will all reach
the Pareto front.
If we were a bit more objective it would boil down to the usual 10 (8
european + argentina and brasil). :-P

But then the point remains that the question is closed. No compromise are
possible.

Maybe I should ask a different question.
I am really not fond or expert of sports. I don't even know what questions
to ask!

In any case, Craig, if you have an open question that you need to boil down
to a multiple options let me know.
We might try to work out an interface where people first work in Vilfredo to
find what are the options and then work on Indaba to finally define.
One thing that Vilfredo will need to have are Limited Generations Questions:
Questions that only run for n generations. In this way you do not risk that
the question remains open when you need a pareto front as an answer. After
all the original point of the Pareto front was to just be calculated one
time and find the available options. The idea to embed it into an GA is
modern (and not even mine, but comes from Jordan Pollack)
