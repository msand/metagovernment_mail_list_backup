<PRE>What you're talking about is good for the presentation, but too  
lengthy for the proposal:

Do you think the current proposal adequately summarizes what you would  
like to talk about and adequately answers their questions?
	&#8226; What will attendees learn?
	&#8226; What curtains have been lifted?
	&#8226; How can attendees use this?

<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>

P.S. I am in the midst of moving now and am not going to have much  
time to work on this at all before the December 8 proposal deadline.

P.P.S. Anyone else interested in collaborating on this?

</I>&gt;<i> It looks like what they are asking is what is usually referred to as

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> You will need freemind to view it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I by the way, really support both freemind as a mindmap tool, and  
</I>&gt;<i> dropbox as a way to share files)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I was reading the papers a few things came to me.
</I>&gt;<i> The first is that we really should do our best to answer their  
</I>&gt;<i> questions,
</I>&gt;<i> and the questions are
</I>&gt;<i> What will attendees learn?
</I>&gt;<i> What curtains have been lifted?
</I>&gt;<i> How can attendees use this?
</I>&gt;<i> Also in presenting the projects we need not so much to speak about  
</I>&gt;<i> them, but show how each project is really bringing something new.  
</I>&gt;<i> And what is new. Why is it needed. And what have we learned in this.  
</I>&gt;<i> How can other follow our footsteps. We  are not going there to sell  
</I>&gt;<i> metagovernment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let me answer those questions according to the Vilfredo Project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The aim of the Vilfredo Project was not to make a coll website, but  
</I>&gt;<i> to give an example of a different form of decision making;
</I>&gt;<i> traditional decision making in democratic societies is rooted in  
</I>&gt;<i> Voting theory (add 5 minutes of crash course on voting theory).
</I>&gt;<i> All of voting theory is based on the idea of answering a closed  
</I>&gt;<i> question by counting how many people support the various options.
</I>&gt;<i> And then there are various ways of voting and of counting.
</I>&gt;<i> Vilfredo rejects the assumtpion that we already know what are the  
</I>&gt;<i> options and instead proposes a search algorithm that uses human  
</I>&gt;<i> beings to look for the possible alternatives.
</I>&gt;<i> The two things we are doing that are new are:
</I>&gt;<i> a) using a -human- genetic algorithm to find the possible alternatives
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of simply having the people in charge decide them)
</I>&gt;<i> b) Comparing the sets of people voting for the various solutions,  
</I>&gt;<i> and taking the pareto front of the solutions thus generating a set  
</I>&gt;<i> that represents all the users
</I>&gt;<i> (instead of simply summing up the votes)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We can do (b) because we don't have a fixed number of solutions that  
</I>&gt;<i> must pass from one generation to the other.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The results that we found where:
</I>&gt;<i>  a)   people agree more on important things: we tend to agree on  
</I>&gt;<i> values while we tend to disagree on the  weight we give to the values
</I>&gt;<i>  b)   there ARE solutions out there; most question reach an answer  
</I>&gt;<i> fairly soon (in less than 20 generations, often 5 to 7)
</I>&gt;<i>  c) the solutions are usually more complex
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> problems we did find was that people get bored quickly
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> while problems we did not find: most people would have predicted  
</I>&gt;<i> that ignorance of the participants was going to be a problem, but in  
</I>&gt;<i> fact we never found that to be a big problem. AT the worse some  
</I>&gt;<i> solutions had to spell out why they were presented, and why other  
</I>&gt;<i> solutions were not really viable. But the fact is that the solutions  
</I>&gt;<i> from the experts will never be destroyed by the solution from the  
</I>&gt;<i> non expert because the expert will not vote for them, and then both  
</I>&gt;<i> will make it to the pareto front.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is in essence what I should say for Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And in all this the URL of the website or the examples are not even  
</I>&gt;<i> needed. This is what I mean when I say that we should not go there  
</I>&gt;<i> to sell our project.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now, can we have those questions:
</I>&gt;<i> -what is that they are doing that is new
</I>&gt;<i> -how was it done before
</I>&gt;<i> -lessons learned
</I>&gt;<i> -problems that they have found
</I>&gt;<i> -expected problems that they did not find.
</I>&gt;<i> answered for the other projects as well?

</I>&gt;<i> It's not an academic conference, so there are no papers. In essence,  
</I>&gt;<i> the presentation is the document. It seems to me like it is  
</I>&gt;<i> basically a showcase of emerging trends in the nebulous concept of  
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;government 2.0.&quot; If it's like the agenda from 2009, I would guess  
</I>&gt;<i> most of the presentations will be about websites which open up

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok Ed,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will look at the slides, plus I remember a presentation in video

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Was this the one? Because I remember you speaking, but I do not

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, have you seen the presentation I posted today?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because that is about the best presentation I have around on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Vilfredo.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is a 1 hour presentation, and it also include a general  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critique to the democratic process.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think if I were to present Vilfredo I would follow a similar  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pattern taking away things that are already said by you (the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> critique to the usual democratic process), as well as the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repetition (I repeat things a lot, somehow I found out that since  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> people are distracted 90% of the time, if you repeat something 10  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times you have a 1/2 probability of catching them at least one  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> time ;-) ).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If they pay for the trip I have nothing stopping me from going. It  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would not even be considered days off work, it IS work. If I were  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to be paid by the uni they would even pay me extra for the stress  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of having to work far away from my family (i.e. my cat, a chicken  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and a rooster).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Please look at the video.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, what is that they want? In a normal conference you submit a  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> paper of x pages, formatted according to the standards from y  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> editor, usually in latex or in word (if you want to look amatorial).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Here I cannot find and specifics.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Instead there is an email address for scholarships. I think I  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should send them an email asking if I can have my expenses paid.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also, if we present our work we should also present a tentative  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> recepy on how the pieces could join together. Something like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first a question is presented on Vilfredo to find out the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> possibilities
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> then the resulting aswers are voted using this system,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and so on.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In short we need to give them a sort of grand plan.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It does not matter if it is wrong, they know, we know. It is way

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is really a good tool.
