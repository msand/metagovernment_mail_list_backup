<PRE>No need to apologize... that was a quick first draft which I had hoped  
others would improve. I have written a completely different second  
draft.

In writing the new version, I was a bit taken aback at how little I  
understand some of the member projects. (Honestly, that was one of my  
motivations in having project-focus events on the list, so I could  
better represent them all.)

Particularly, I have to say I am a bit taken aback by what I wrote  
about Candiwi, since it seems very unrelated to what Manuel had been  
describing Metascore as before beginning coding. I really like  
Candiwi, but I am a bit lost as to how it relates to the older vision  
of Metascore.

Also, if members of other projects are looking at this, please do look  
at the new version of this proposal and correct what I wrote about you.

Thanks.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What you're talking about is good for the presentation, but too  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lengthy for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the proposal:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed, I split your question into two distinct questions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think the current proposal adequately answers their questions?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8226; What will attendees learn?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8226; What curtains have been lifted?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#8226; How can attendees use this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Presentation/gov20expo</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not really, sorry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We present a revolutionary idea. That is nice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And in this there is something to be learned, of course. And even
</I>&gt;<i> curtain lifted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But it is a bit too superficial. We need to give them more meat.
</I>&gt;<i> Imagine if I gave the talk about Vilfredo and only said:
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;hey, you know what, instead of counting the votes we should really
</I>&gt;<i> compare the sets&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> its not enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now there are plenty of ideas that are embedded in our work. But we
</I>&gt;<i> need to do the work to bring this out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You see, an idea is one lesson. But most of the lessons are received
</I>&gt;<i> when you have an idea, and you try to implement it,
</I>&gt;<i> and it does not work, or it works in ways unexpected. This is the
</I>&gt;<i> difference between a paper with results and a plan for actions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But at the metagovernment stage we don't even have one plan for
</I>&gt;<i> action. We have a vision. A grand VISION, but still sketchy. And then
</I>&gt;<i> we have 6 plans for actions. Each at various levels of accomplishment.
</I>&gt;<i> (With Jim at the top, and then the others). Now each should do the
</I>&gt;<i> homework and tell us at least what they are trying to accomplish, and
</I>&gt;<i> what they have learned. Just one thing. And then we can put them
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Do you think the current proposal adequately summarizes what you  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would like
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to talk about?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remain unconvinced, sorry.
</I>&gt;<i> Look at this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Attendees of this presentation will learn what new technologies are
</I>&gt;<i> being developed, how they propose to overcome traditional problems of
</I>&gt;<i> mass-governance, and what obstacles still remain. &quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now among their documents at some points it expressedly said:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tell us what you are actually going to talk about. Don&#8217;t just set  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> up the question, tell us (briefly) what the answers are. We&#8217;d like  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to know where you&#8217;re going with talk, and what conclusions you&#8217;ve  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drawn.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Somehow you are telling what we will tell, but not the actual meat.
</I>&gt;<i> This is just a neat package. But is there something inside apart from
</I>&gt;<i> a grand vision.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry if I am blunt Ed, but we both have little time, and I see this
</I>&gt;<i> as the person what will receive and decide wether to pass it on or
</I>&gt;<i> not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart for a nice vision, and some vague ideas, do we have something to
</I>&gt;<i> tell them?
