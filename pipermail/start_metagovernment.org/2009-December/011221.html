</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That said, I think your pooled structure may sidestep this issue...? If an

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good point. In setting up the structure, the governance of the actual
relationship with the projects would be delegated to the OK Pooled Fund
Management Group. Hence, the investors, specifically, would not have direct
influence. That said, they would want to know that the management group is
engaged in a way that their investments are `protected`, in some sense.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would think that their thinking would have to be that they can invest in
</I>&gt;<i> something they agree with and hope to get a return based on the model of
</I>&gt;<i> that project/s... or they can not invest. And that that would be the extent
</I>&gt;<i> of the control they could expect to have.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> P.S. As for your conclusion that rejecting money would inhibit a project's
</I>&gt;<i> influence, I don't think that's necessarily true. Projects such as Apache,
</I>&gt;<i> Firefox, Wikipedia, and Debian are predominantly volunteer efforts, yet they
</I>&gt;<i> are certainly world-changing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This is very true. The exception to the rule that money is a driver for
projects is the open source model that you are citing. I still maintain that
this is the exception to the rule and that, on balance, it`s easier to drive
a project if you have some money!
