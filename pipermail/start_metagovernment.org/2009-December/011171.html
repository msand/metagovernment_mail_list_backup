<PRE>Dear Jacki,
thanks for your email.

I will try to answer you inline:

2009/12/4 Jacki Buros &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">jburos at gmail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> Hi Pietro,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the response. From your responses it seems you do get the
</I>&gt;<i> question, though it becomes more clear in the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Briefly, you could say I voted strategically rather than honestly.
</I>&gt;<i> There were some good ideas but I didn't support most of them on their
</I>&gt;<i> own, rather I wanted to support some combinations of solutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has occurred a few times where I would like to vote for two
</I>&gt;<i> proposals such that BOTH would be represented, and not for either
</I>&gt;<i> alone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would the honest and appropriate response then be to vote for neither
</I>&gt;<i> (none)? I am not sure this is allowed ..
</I>
Sure you can, but since you wrote some proposals yourself, you should
at least vote for yours. Do you not agree with yourself? ;-).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps the selection of 'combinations' of proposals -- select
</I>&gt;<i> proposals A + B together, not as either/or but only as a selection of
</I>&gt;<i> both -- is something that can be done on the UI rather than changing
</I>&gt;<i> the algorithm, essentially creating a joint proposal from existing
</I>&gt;<i> proposals and submitting it in one step. This would be useful because,
</I>&gt;<i> let's say I write proposal A and Ed writes proposal B, I can't see
</I>&gt;<i> proposal B until the next round. But, perhaps people who supported
</I>&gt;<i> both A and B would then also support A+B automatically ?
</I>
The idea to be able to vote for some combinations, and only for those
is very interesting.
Unfortunately doing this would mean that a person should be allowed to
write ALL the combinations he approves.
In short the voting would take the form of
(A and B and C) or (A and C) or (A and B).
There is a general form of it in Set logic where you write a set as a
set of union of intersections. And every parenthesis inside should
either contain a set or its negation: A or notA ). Essentially we
would be reproducing that.
&gt;<i>From a math point of view that is no big deal. What IS a big deal is
</I>how do you explain that to pntil yoeople.

You could let people at least make one set of intersections (example:
A and B). But honestly it would be really asking for trouble. I can
see people sending emails, asking why they voted for A and B, but the
system did not consider that they supported A (by itself).

It is much easier to spread the problem through the generations and
generate a system where you just tick the ones of the combination that
you approve. Then you create a new proposal out of that combination.
And then that proposal becomes a separate element, and goes up for
voting for everybody else. After all what are the probability that if
we do not do in this way people will be writing the same combinations
of proposals.

So doing in the other way (as you suggest) would also generate a huge
amount of extra elements in the pareto front simply because the other
people did not concider those particular combinations. Nor can I, from
my authority, force them to. After all if you vote for A and you vote
for B, this DOES NOT mean that you suppor &quot;A and B&quot;.

So, yes. I hope this answers your questions by placing it in its
mathematical framework. ANd the short answer is:
please do produce by yourself the combinations you intend to vote in
the next voting phase.

We will soon roll out a way for those to be produced more easily, but
you still will need to produce them in the composition phase.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, from your response below I see that perhaps the proposal
</I>&gt;<i> where proposals are 'sub-proposals' of a main proposal is more
</I>&gt;<i> complicated than it should be. The A+B is essentially what I was
</I>&gt;<i> envisioning as the 'sub-proposal', where some could vote for the main
</I>&gt;<i> *only*, some for a sub-prop *only*, and others for some combination of
</I>&gt;<i> main+sub. But, this may be too complicated for VGTA to handle.
</I>
Indeed :-)


Best Regards,
Pietro
