It's all one-way, so far.  I think Thomas has just started speaking
with other projects.

&gt;<i> I would be particularly interested in seeing mappings to Candiwi (which as

</I>&gt;<i> (which seems to be a great add-on to almost any system).
</I>
Most likely we can mirror Candiwi&lt;-&gt;Votorola and Vilfredo&lt;-&gt;Votorola.
Do they export their votes?  Or can we scrape them?  It helps if the
votes have timestamps.

&gt;<i> I noticed that on the Votorola list you noted that you don't have user 
</I>&gt;<i> mappings yet. Would that problem be sidestepped in integrating two projects 
</I>&gt;<i> which both use OpenID (ie, Votorola and Candiwi)?
</I>
I think so.  If OpenID was mandatory on both engines, then we wouldn't
need a common register to do the mirroring, per se.  But Votorola's
primary ID is email address not OpenID.  OpenID is just an optional
login method for us.  So we'd still need a common register for the ID
translation.

But I think we need a common register, anyway.  We need it to compile
lists of eligible voters.  Because even if everyone is eligible, we
still need to know who &quot;everyone&quot; is.  The technical requirement is a
*tight* registration list - one that's free of sock puppets.
(Interestingly if you have a *universal* tight list, then you can use
it to tighten up a loose list, and also to do combinations.  So two
clubs could join in a common vote, for example. ^[1] )

There may be a way to hack together a universal tight list.  The
upshot would be that all users could (in principle) free-range across
all engines.  I'll post the details separately.  There's a technical
problem, but I think we can solve it.
