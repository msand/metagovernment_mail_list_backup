<PRE>Ok Ed,
I will look at the slides, plus I remember a presentation in video format
you gave some time ago in a web centered conference.

Was this the one? Because I remember you speaking, but I do not remember any
slide.

Also, have you seen the presentation I posted today?
Because that is about the best presentation I have around on Vilfredo.
That is a 1 hour presentation, and it also include a general critique to the
democratic process.

I think if I were to present Vilfredo I would follow a similar pattern
taking away things that are already said by you (the critique to the usual
democratic process), as well as the repetition (I repeat things a lot,
somehow I found out that since people are distracted 90% of the time, if you
repeat something 10 times you have a 1/2 probability of catching them at
least one time ;-) ).

If they pay for the trip I have nothing stopping me from going. It would not
even be considered days off work, it IS work. If I were to be paid by the
uni they would even pay me extra for the stress of having to work far away
from my family (i.e. my cat, a chicken and a rooster).

Please look at the video.

Also, what is that they want? In a normal conference you submit a paper of x
pages, formatted according to the standards from y editor, usually in latex
or in word (if you want to look amatorial).
Here I cannot find and specifics.

Instead there is an email address for scholarships. I think I should send
them an email asking if I can have my expenses paid.

Also, if we present our work we should also present a tentative recepy on
how the pieces could join together. Something like
first a question is presented on Vilfredo to find out the possibilities
then the resulting aswers are voted using this system,
and so on.

In short we need to give them a sort of grand plan.
It does not matter if it is wrong, they know, we know. It is way too early.
But it gives to the people a vision to pursue. Something like, this is the
direction we are going.

Pietro


P.S. I insist at some point to work on google Wave to prepare the
presentation. now it might be too early, but for brainstorming it is really
a good tool.
