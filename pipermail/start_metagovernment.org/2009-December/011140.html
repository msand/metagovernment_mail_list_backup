<PRE>&gt;<i> Wouldn't Votorola be a better tool for a yes/no question like this?

I think we should all really read a bit of voting theory. And I am not
preaching. I too should!
Matias pointed me to a wonderful text on Voting theory and
Mathematics. Right now I can't get it, but maybe Matias you could find
it back and share it with the community at large.
I would really suggest, at the very least, that we all read this page:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system</A>

as you noticed there are various ways to set up voting, and we should
all be familiar with them before trying to decide which one to use.
In this Giovani's foundation was quite precise. Its tools included
tools to set up Condorcet voting and many others. Really impressive.

In any case may I suggest that if we integrate Vilfredo with another
system, and we follow up a decision in Vilfredo with a voting in
another system to chose among the Pareto front alternatives we
produced, we use something more refined that simply winner-takes-all
or relative/simple majority voting, which gives so many problems.

The Vilfredo system, since it ends with either full agreement, or a
Pareto front, would work very well with a single winner, ranking
method as any Condorcet method.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method</A>

Where after the community has selected a serious of alternative
solutions, and we are unable to reach a agreement on them, then we
move into a voting phase, where each ranks the various alternatives,
and we get the Condorcet winner as the result of the process.

Now, I don't know if Votorola has implemented any single winner,
multiple voting (ranked) system. In particular a Condorcet voting. But
may I suggest that if we Vilfredo integrates with them, they do?
