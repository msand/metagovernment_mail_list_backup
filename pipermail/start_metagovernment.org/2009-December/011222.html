<PRE>Hello everybody,
I have been reading those posts.

Speaking from the Vilfredo point of view, the project was able to get
much better in the last months because I have a friend, a programmer,
who was in the particular situation that he had a lot of free time,
and could devoid it to the project. While not being able to take a job
right now for personal, family, reasons. As you can imagine those
situations are quiet unique, and will probably not be present in
future. Of course if we could pay for the work of our programmers
(even part time) this would make a huge difference.

On the other hand right now the work is also being carried out thanks
to government money. I am doing research over this, in part, with my
university time. I just asked for a grant to study the topic further.
I am also not allowed to be employed by anyone else while on my
university contract.

As my research is part of a university research, the focus is
academic. We prove that things are true, mathematically. If we want to
show that a website is helping online discussion we need to employ a
psychologist that runs some tests over a group of people. This is
quite different from how the topic would be done if we were an
enterprise.

As a university I am expected to create open source code. To have a
prototype that shows the idea. Not to employ my time in smoothing off
the program too much.

In all cases the program would not bring any money back. Not 10%,
nothing. This is the nature of university research. Nice solid
academic work that can be used as a foundation for anything. But no
monetary return. Of course if your investors would be interested in
funding some of this project it would be welcome. But would they be
happy with it?

It was mentioned that this money should help in developing a series of
different websites, interacting. This is something that could work
well for Vilfredo too. We have reached the conclusion already in
Vilfredo that there should be some API that let a different website
start an open question, receive the answers. All automatically. I
don't see this as being developed very soon from the University. But
maybe it could be the aim of this extra work.

Of course we would have to look into the details of how could it be
done legally.

Cheers,
Pietro
