<PRE>I have heard form several people now that different rules for
different articles are desirable but am still not convinced that this
is a good idea for several reasons.

I think this has more to do with needless bureaucracy then a useful feature.
The difference between an important article and another is purely
semantic this cannot be solved programaticaly, which means that users
must individually define different rule sets and where they apply.
Creating a simple interface for this where a user can easily define
rules and understand which rules apply is next to impossible. It is
hard enough for newcomers to understand the parallel work flow as it
is.

I think we should reconsider:
a) Is their really a problem that needs this.
b) What is the problem and is their a better solution.


2009/12/4 Manuel Barkhau &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">mbarkhau at googlemail.com</A>&gt;:
&gt;<i> If we introduce categorization, for which different voting rules
</I>&gt;<i> apply, I would suggest that it be on the level of the proposals rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the articles. The logic being, that if you make a spelling
</I>&gt;<i> correction, it doesn't matter in what kind of article it is made.
</I>&gt;<i> Likewise substantive changes that many people would like to weigh in
</I>&gt;<i> on, can be in informative articles, not just legislative.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had an idea like this, but haven't thought it through yet. The idea
</I>&gt;<i> was to have different levels for a proposal and anybody can escalate
</I>&gt;<i> to a higher level. The higher the level, the more stringent the voting
</I>&gt;<i> requirements. The lowest level would then be spelling corrections and
</I>&gt;<i> it would require a very limited amount of votes, just to ensure that
</I>&gt;<i> the level is appropriate and somebody isn't trying to sneak something
</I>&gt;<i> in through a lower level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ciao
