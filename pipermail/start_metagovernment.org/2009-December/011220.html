This is one of the issues Metagovernment is working through in  
considering this proposition. Our principles are clearly stated
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Mission_and_vision</A>
and basically are diametrically opposed to anyone having privileged  
interest in governance (including our own governance). So most if not  
all of our member projects would be fundamentally opposed to allowing  
investors to have a special say in how they do things.

That said, I think your pooled structure may sidestep this issue...?  
If an investor's money is going through the filter of first the pooled  
fund and then the coordinating group before getting to the end- 
project, then would investors really have any expectation of influence?

I would think that their thinking would have to be that they can  
invest in something they agree with and hope to get a return based on  
the model of that project/s... or they can not invest. And that that  
would be the extent of the control they could expect to have.

P.S. As for your conclusion that rejecting money would inhibit a  
project's influence, I don't think that's necessarily true. Projects  
such as Apache, Firefox, Wikipedia, and Debian are predominantly  
volunteer efforts, yet they are certainly world-changing.
