Then, if you're intending to provide an example of how the system works 
in a virtuous way, that probably isn't a good one, especially if the 
assumption is that the three friends intend to split the cost of the 
meal equally. Presume the meals cost the same. Each person pays a third, 
but Akim gets half of what of what's brought to the table and the other 
two get a quarter.

Moreover, Pareto optimization can be very sensible in reference to 
distribution of things like lifeline and emergency services (health, 
communications access, public education, security, etc.), but I don't 
see how it scales to handle debates that pivot on belief systems.

What about an Akim who, for moral reasons that he believes will 
determine his chance for an afterlife, insists on living in a society 
that prohibits gay marriage?

My point is that politics is about managed competition. Getting voting 
systems right is a tough enough challenge in the first place. Allowing 
people to game things by stating their own utility functions opens a 
very complicated can of worms.

&gt;<i> They have taken their conditions and winnowed down the options to the 
</I>&gt;<i> minimum set of items which can satisfy everyone's first choices. If they 
</I>&gt;<i> can only afford one item, then they would need to do a second round of 
</I>&gt;<i> voting (as Vilfredo allows). Their most rational choice would be to try 
</I>&gt;<i> to talk Belinda out of her beef preference, since that is not a 
</I>&gt;<i> must-have item. Then hopefully they could settle on a mild vegetable 
</I>&gt;<i> dish. Boring though it may be, it allows all three to eat with the money 
</I>&gt;<i> they have.
</I>
The inevitable question, then, is how to structure things so that people 
can discover the happy option around which they can build a consensus. 
That's why the system I've been developing (Indaba currently includes 
WeVote on Facebook and ChoiceRanker.com) is premised on the notion of 
&quot;coalescent bubbling.&quot;

Finally, I guess I was wrong to presume your system uses a Condorcet 
method, since you spoke about a second round of voting.
