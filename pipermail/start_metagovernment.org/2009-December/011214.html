For my 2 cents, I have another proposal.  I don't know if this is
counter or complementary to OpenKollab's.  It comes out of private
discussions held earlier this month:

  1.  Demonstrate an open architecture with:
        a) Input of two or more cooperating projects; and
        b) Output of interoperable tools.
      This is a few weeks work.

  2.  On the basis of that demonstration, apply for funding.

  3.  . . . continue working together on the common parts.

I think this is a better approach than front-loading the process with
money, then hoping for good work to come of it.  In my own experience,
it usually doesn't happen that way.  (Based on their own comments, I
think Ed and Owen may agree on this point.)
