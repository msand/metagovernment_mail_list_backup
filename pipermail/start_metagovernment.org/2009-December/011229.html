<PRE>The proposal below is similar to the original (top of thread) except
that it:

  * Gives non-tech people a major role in the effort;

  * Opens up free-range voting to all users, instead of just a
    short-list of project members; and

  * Takes a week longer (roughly) to hack together.

There's an unsolved technical problem, in two parts:

 A. How to effectively set an *immutable* semantic property (value =
    numeric trust level) on each user page of the register-wiki (see
    2d).

 B. How to do (A) from the register-server, given that the admin of
    the server only has &quot;sysop&quot; privileges as a user of the remote
    wiki, and no other means of access?

It might still work without (A,B), but it wouldn't be nearly as nice.
The computed trust levels wouldn't be visible in the register-wiki.
You'd have to go to a separate server to see them.  You wouldn't be
able to use them in conditional template expressions, e.g. to prevent
untrusted residents from appearing in the street pages, and so forth.

(There could be other problems, too.  Please critique, if you have
 time.)


<A HREF="http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Rapid_prototyping">http://t.zelea.com/wiki/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/Opening_an_architecture#Rapid_prototyping</A>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rapid prototyping might be used to hack together an open
 architecture, prior to a full design effort.  This is a description
 of the prototyping method.  In summary:

 (1) users set up a federation of semantic register-wikis;
 (2) separate register-servers compile the registration lists and post
     them to the Web as flat files;
 (3) voting engines read the registration lists and compile their
     voter lists;
 (4) vote data of each engine are likewise posted as flat files; and
 (5) other engines read the vote data and image the votes.

 These hacks should suffice to implement the use cases of &quot;register
 once, vote_anywhere&quot; and &quot;free-range voting&quot; in as little as 4
 weeks. ^[1][2]

METHOD
------

 1. Set up a federation of register-wikis.  Steps (1 and 2) are a
    temporary hack for a *chainable* set of mutually *tight*
    residential registers. ^[3]

    a) Users set up a semantic register-wiki for each city or region
       that wishes to participate.  They may use a free host like
       referata.com.  The registers must be geographically disjoint
       (non-overlapping) in jurisdiction.

       Each street is given a separate page in the wiki, and each
       block a separate page section.  Intersections are linked to
       cross-street pages, so users may easily &quot;turn corners&quot; as they
       navigate through the neighbourhood.  Blocks contain buildings,
       and buildings contain residents.  Each resident is linked to a
       user page.

    b) On each user page, the user enters *registration properties*.
       A template is provided for this.  The registration properties
       include:

          i. Primary residential address
         ii. Personal identifiers (Email address, OpenID, and
             engine-specific usernames) for each type of voting engine
             that is participating in the prototype

    c) On each user page, the user may extend *trust edges* to other
       users.  She may also extend *doubt signals*.  Templates are
       provided for these. ^[4][5]

 2. Code the compilation of the *registration lists*.  Each
    register-wiki (1) is associated with a separate register-server
    (2).  For each wiki/server pair: ^[3]

    a) Copy the registration and trust data from the register-wiki
       (1).  The data is exported in RDF, from a query page.

    b) Trace out the trust network and compute the trust level of each
       user.  Compile a registration list including the user
       properties (above), plus the authorative property of:

        iii. Trust level

    c) Post the registration list to the Web.

    d) Write the trust levels back to the register-wiki as immutable
       semantic properties.  Local queries may reference them and show
       them to users, but users may not alter them.  (How to do this
       is an unsolved problem.)

    e) Recompile the registration list periodically, as needed.

 3. Code the *voter list* compilation for each engine.  This is a
    temporary hack for the list compiler. ^[3]

    a) Copy the registration lists from the register-servers (2).

    b) Chain the registration lists together and translate them to the
       engine's native voter-eligiblity format.  The result is
       effectively a voter list for that engine.  Its content will be
       equivalent to that of the other engines' lists.

    c) Recompile the voter list periodically, as needed.

 4. Code the export of *original votes* from each *source engine*.
    This is a temporary hack for the &quot;vote monitoring&quot; interface.  For
    each votable issue: ^[6]

    a) Create a new poll (aka. &quot;issue&quot;).

    b) Export all of the poll's original votes to a text file (vote
       list).  For each original vote in the list, record the
       particulars that define it.  The exact format will depend on
       the engine's voting method, but just as an example:

          i. Subject identifier (voter)
         ii. Object identifier (delegate or proposal)
        iii. Timestamp ^[7]

    c) Post the vote list to the Web at a URL that encodes the
       particular issue.  Ideally the issue is enocoded as a
       pre-agreed universal identifier.  If not, clients may
       cross-translate issues via a semantic wiki table, which serves
       as a temporary hack for a *classification engine*. ^[8]

    d) Re-export the vote list periodically, as needed.

 5. Code the *pull mirroring* on each *destination engine*.  This is a
    temporary hack for an autocaster.  For each source engine (4):
    ^[6]

    a) Copy the vote list from the source engine.

    b) Translate each original vote to an image vote in the
       destination engine's native format.

    c) Re-pull the vote list periodically, as needed.

 The shared voter registrations (1,2,3) will enable users to wander
 from engine to engine, without restriction.  The vote mirroring (4,5)
 will effectively pool their votes across all engines.  Thus
 free-range voting may be implemented as an extended-alpha prototype.
 Users may use the prototype to vote up system rules, plans, policies
 and designs - and to elect administrators, registrars and other
 officials - even while the system is being developed and deployed.
