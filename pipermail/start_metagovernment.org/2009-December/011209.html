<PRE>I recently spoke with Suresh Fernando of OpenKollab about a funding  
mechanism they are beginning to develop. It is still in the initial  
seed stage, but if it does mature, the member projects of  
Metagovernment potentially could, collectively, be eligible.

In brief, he is working on creating a pooled fund where socially  
conscious investors can contribute to the pool, and the pool  
distributes funds out to projects. In particular, they are looking for  
communities of related projects (such as the Metagov active projects),  
which are geared toward the &quot;greater good,&quot; and which are open,  
collaborative projects.

Additionally, however, they would like to show some sort of potential  
for financial return on their investment at some point. That was  
something I told Suresh I was not sure our groups might qualify for.

I know Jim has talked about some sort of profit mechanism for  
NationBuilder, but I haven't seen what that might be. And more to the  
point, I am not sure if most of our projects are really interested in  
generating cash flow, as it may overly complicate or even work against  
the objectives of the projects.

I do know that many projects could benefit tremendously from even a  
micro-loan which would allow a few developers to spend a significant  
block of time dedicated solely to development, without the distraction  
of needing an external income. (Heck, I could use a Metagov income so  
I could work on admin/coordination/promotion full time, but so far  
that doesn't seem possible or consistent with our principles.)

So I figured the best course of action would be to turn the discussion  
over to the group and see what you folks think; particularly the  
developers of active projects (but also everyone else, of course).

When thinking of this question, don't think simply of how one project  
could be financially sustainable, but rather how our entire community  
could do so together. That is what would be of interest to OK... and  
regardless it would be fantastic if we could develop that synergy.

Suresh is a member of this list, so should be able to see our  
conversation directly, should you have follow-up questions. To see the  
overview presentation on the OpenKollab pooled fund, see:

(Pay particular attention to slide 17, which is where our group  
becomes particularly interesting in our current form and in our  
efforts toward Standardization.)

See also: <A HREF="http://mudball.net/openkollab/pooled-fund-2/">http://mudball.net/openkollab/pooled-fund-2/</A> for a brief  
presentation on the fund.

What do you think?
