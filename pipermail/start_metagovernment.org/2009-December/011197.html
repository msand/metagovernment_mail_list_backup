<PRE>This was sent to Craig only yesterday evening.

Sorry about that.

Hi Craig,
welcome to the list (haven't seen you before).

The Pareto Front and the Pareto Frontier are the same thing. Some
people call it in one way, some in the other.
So if you know what a Pareto Frontier is, you are set. Except you
still need to understand how to apply this to voting.
Essentially we are considering each citizen as a different dimension.
We define a solution A as dominating a solution B if everybody likes A
as well as B. And at least one person prefers A to B.

If people are only allowed to express their preferences in a 0/1 way
(yes/no). Also called Approval voting. Then the domination solution is
even easier.
A solution A dominates a solution B, if the set of the people that
like B also like A, and at least one person likes A but not B.

In other words the set of people who like B is a subset of the set of
people that like A,
In other words the set of people who like A is a supraset of the set
of people that like B.
In other words, one is contained in the other, strictly. The container
one is dominating the contained one.

Once we have found what solutions dominate what others, we eliminate
all the solutions that are dominated by something. What remains is the
Pareto Front(ier)

In the video the explenation of the algorithm is between minute 14.30
and minute 25.

That's 10 minutes. Not &#160;a lot.
And the Pareto Front is explained half way,

Matias said he understood the Pareto front reading the paper.
<A HREF="http://publications.pietrosperoni.it/SA2009ecal.pdf">http://publications.pietrosperoni.it/SA2009ecal.pdf</A>
That will probably take you more than 10 minutes, but might be more
clarifying in the long run.

Although I am a big fan of Condorcet voting, I don't think it is
relevant in this case.

Although you can apply the Pareto Front to a system where you rank all
the solutions. The Condorcet result and the pareto front would not be
the same. FOr once because the Condorcet result is one, and the pareto
front is a set of solutions.
But it would be interesting to present them side by side. But, as I
said, you would have to change the algorithm, and require people to
rank all the solutions, instead of just approving a set of them.

Cheers,
Pietro
