<PRE>Hi Ed,

I really like what you've put together here. It feels strong and direct....but not critical or pushy.

One line that I think needs work: 

&quot;We are not interested in asking our politicians to change things for us. We are not interested in violence. Rather, we are creating a new system which can peacefully and gradually put the people in control of our own lives.&quot;  

The &quot;We are not interested in violence.&quot; jumped out at me as being incongruent with the tone of the rest of it....like why would anyone think you would be interested in violence? In other words, I don't think it's necessary to say that. 

Also, I think &quot;put the people in control of our own lives.&quot; should read &quot;put the people in control of their own lives.&quot;.

I apologize for not being more active in recent months. I'm very busy these days with a project of my own. I love what you all are doing and hope to be back at some point soon.

Take care,
Steve

</I>&gt;<i> Now what we need is ideas for the video images that would accompany it. That sounds a bit tough to me. Much of the script is abstract and difficult to visualize. But at the same time, that's what makes video such an effective mechanism. If we can come up with good images, then the words really strike home.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is not a strong point for me. Please chime in if you have any suggestions, even random ideas, as to how we might be able to set this script to pictures. (If necessary, the script can adapt to better fit the pics, of course.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If it helps, think of each sentence, or even each phrase as an image... and then tell us what that image is. :)
