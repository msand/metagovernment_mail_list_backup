<PRE>Yes, that's part of the reason that the &quot;violence&quot; reference is in there. Also, when I talk about the project with people, some immediately jump to the conclusion that we're advocating some sort of revolution. I think there needs to be something in there to indicate that we're focused on peaceful, consensual change.

Concerning refinements to the text overall: I think those will work out when we try to compile it into a video. The wording sounds somewhat formal and stilted to me. I think as we say it aloud and associate it with images, it will evolve.

Which brings me back to that question; can folks please help come up with the images that would go along with this script?

What might be the best would be if we had an animation which depicted the ideas from the first-person perspective of a character. But failing that, it could be a sequence of images. Or... whatever ideas any of you might have...?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi Ed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I really like what you've put together here. It feels strong and direct....but not critical or pushy.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; One line that I think needs work: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;We are not interested in asking our politicians to change things for us. We are not interested in violence. Rather, we are creating a new system which can peacefully and gradually put the people in control of our own lives.&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The &quot;We are not interested in violence.&quot; jumped out at me as being incongruent with the tone of the rest of it....like why would anyone think you would be interested in violence? In other words, I don't think it's necessary to say that. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I think &quot;put the people in control of our own lives.&quot; should read &quot;put the people in control of their own lives.&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I apologize for not being more active in recent months. I'm very busy these days with a project of my own. I love what you all are doing and hope to be back at some point soon.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Take care,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The movie project stalled, but as far as I can tell it is ready to proceed. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have the words for a short movie about he need for a change in our democratic systems:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Now what we need is ideas for the video images that would accompany it. That sounds a bit tough to me. Much of the script is abstract and difficult to visualize. But at the same time, that's what makes video such an effective mechanism. If we can come up with good images, then the words really strike home.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This is not a strong point for me. Please chime in if you have any suggestions, even random ideas, as to how we might be able to set this script to pictures. (If necessary, the script can adapt to better fit the pics, of course.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If it helps, think of each sentence, or even each phrase as an image... and then tell us what that image is. :)
