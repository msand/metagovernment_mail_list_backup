We work on separate parts mostly, and talk about the areas of overlap.
Potentially interesting talk goes to the mailing list.  Most of the
rest goes to IRC.  If things are quiet, then we make a point of saying
&quot;hello&quot; on Thursdays at least, just to prevent blocks or mis-
understandings (something we picked up from the FGA/OWS folks).  We
also Skype of course, as needed.

That's all ad hoc.  I'm out of my depth here because I have no
practical skills in this area (people management and stuff).  But I
agree that social interactions are the big attractor, in theory.
