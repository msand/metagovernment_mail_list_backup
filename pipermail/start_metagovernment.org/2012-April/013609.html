Some of them expose themselves right in the spam. Most of these are SEO-spam, where they are trying to build links to sites in order to get higher search engine ranking (a practice which often has the opposite effect, since the search engine managers understand this practice and try to work against it... yet people still do it anyway).

For example this page:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABookm12345&amp;timestamp=20111215110727">http://metagovernment.org/w/index.php5?title=Special:Undelete&amp;target=User%3ABookm12345&amp;timestamp=20111215110727</A>
(link only available to sysop wiki users, sorry)
links to this website link-building-serviceMUNGED.info/ (munged, since I certainly don't want to link to them.

That is a link builder! They are the people actually running this particular batch of spams. What to do? They have a contact page, with their phone numbers. But what can I do?

All I have thought of so far is changing the terms of use to the site, but I haven't figured it out entirely. Something that makes contributors liable to pay (who?) US$100,000 if they post links to sites which are not directly relevant to the realm of democracy, governance, and related software development? But even if I do that, the only way to enforce it would be to hire a lawyer and go after them. Do you think it's worth it?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $wgGroupPermissions['autoconfirmed']['skipcaptcha'] = true; //different from default

</I>&gt;<i> I was wrong about this.  Autoconfirmation has nothing to do with email

</I>&gt;<i> after account creation.  So I have this in my config:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  $wgGroupPermissions['user'         ]['skipcaptcha'] = true;
</I>&gt;<i>  $wgGroupPermissions['autoconfirmed']['skipcaptcha'] = false; # that would be everyone, new users are currently autoconfirmed immediately
</I>
I've made this change.

&gt;&gt;<i> As for the auto-message, the intention was to have it appear to them
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> right as they signed up, so they would know that just signing up and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> leaving wouldn't really do them any good. I've had people tell me
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> they &quot;signed up&quot; with us, only to find that all they did was create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a wiki account. Hopefully those making this mistake will be notified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> by the new user message that they need to do more.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that.  The account creation message links to the welcome
</I>&gt;<i> message in the user's talk page, which is therefore automatically
</I>&gt;<i> created.  There's an option to hide the creation from the change log:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:NewUserMessage#Bot_in_Recent_Changes">http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension_talk:NewUserMessage#Bot_in_Recent_Changes</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But still, it seems an overkill to create all those pages.  What about
</I>&gt;<i> putting the welcome message directly in the account creation message?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Welcomecreation">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Welcomecreation</A>
</I>
Well, yes, that seems much easier. Not sure why that didn't occur to me in the first place. I removed the New User Message, and edited:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Welcomecreation">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/MediaWiki:Welcomecreation</A>
