<PRE>I don't know how much publicity the Tea Party movement has received  
outside of the U.S., but I wanted to bring them to the attention of  
this group as a potential test case.
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Party_movement</A>

They are a pretty strange group, and they are often mischaracterized  
as ultra-conservative. It does seem that a majority of their members  
reflect traditional conservative American values, but at their core  
they do not appear to have a left/right ideology. Instead, their core  
unifying factor is their deep discontent with politicians and out-of- 
control bureaucratic government.

They are particularly interesting not only because of those  
fundamentally democratic values, but also because they have been very  
resistant to formal leadership and to co-option by formal political  
party institutions. The U.S. Republican party has tried repeatedly to  
co-opt them, but has met with very mixed success. In some cases the  
Tea Party has outright rebuffed the Republicans.

In any event... I was mulling over the idea of presenting them with a  
way to organize themselves without having to rely on either  
politicians or individual leaders. They seem like a great test case  
for us except in that they are so large that they may be too big for  
our current capacities.

Opinions?


P.S. As an aside, I have noted that press coverage of the Tea Party is  
rather unreliable. They keep doing polls of &quot;the movement,&quot; but I  
wouldn't trust those poll results at all. If you look at the  
methodology of the polls, they ask people if they agree with the  
movement, yet it is clear that many people aren't really sure what the  
movement is. So the results they get are more about the attitude  
toward the press' representation of the movement than the values it of  
the movement itself.
