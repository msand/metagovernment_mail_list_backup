Neither do I.  I wonder if it has anything to do with bottled water?

Votorola is already owned by the public.  Thomas and I control none of
its assets.  Oddly, the same cannot be said of the pollwiki/streetwiki
that sits at the heart of the commons.  I own both the servers and the
domain name (such as it is).  So I can reword your Q as: &quot;How would
supersession be implemented with a standing poll, then, on the
pollwiki for the pollwiki?&quot;

In fact, that's what we're doing here in p/owdo.  But earlier you
wrote:

&gt;<i> If the stakeholder caretakers want to hold on and control the
</I>&gt;<i> domain/traffic/resources then a list of what their duties are, and
</I>&gt;<i> how they accept feedback before the public 'taking control' would
</I>&gt;<i> ease the transition.  In effect, then, you would have an
</I>&gt;<i> 'organization'.
</I>
I agree it would create an organization.  In what sense would it ease
the transition to public ownership?

If we push the organization (maybe not your intent, but that of
others) then I fear it won't ever happen.  If we front-load the effort
with a bunch of administrative crap that's totally useless at this
point, then we'll end up in a state of constipated topor, unable to
move forward.  Frankly, I could use a little funding myself.  (If I
keep this up, I'll soon be on poor relief.)  But the fastest way to
organize and get funded, I believe, is to do the real work.  All that
good and wonderful stuff that the organization is supposed to be
doing, off in some distant, hazy future, we can do it today.  Then we
can start to think about getting paid for it, if that's what we need.
(In the cold light of morning, I ask myself, &quot;Is anyone going to pay
me, up front, to work on my dreams?&quot;)
