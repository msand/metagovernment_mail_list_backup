<PRE>Mat&#237;as, I strongly agree with this statement in your proposed invitation
letter:  &quot;... we think it is desirable to begin to define an 'open source
governance standard', in order to exchange user data between all of our
projects.&quot;

However, even more than a standard for the exchange of *user data*, I
believe it would be useful to establish or, better yet, simply use an
existing open standard for the referencing of &quot;issues&quot; upon which votes are
to be cast and/or comments to be made.  (I also believe that the
productivity of the dialogue (exchange of information) can be enhanced by
expressing issues, questions, or proposals instead as goals and objectives
against which progress can be measured, but that is ancillary to the point I
am trying to make here.)

I submit that the &lt;stratml:Identifier&gt; element [1], as set forth in the
ANSI/AIIM 21:2009, is such a standard by which
issues/questions/proposals/goals/objectives can openly be referenced
anywhere on the Web. 

For example, if any group wanted to vote or comment on any of the goal or
objective statements in the U.S. federal agency open gov plans [2], they
could explicitly identify (and link to) each of those statements based upon
its &lt;stratml:Identifier&gt;.

See, for example, Objective 1.b: Open Formats [3] and/or Objective 1.f: Open
Government Input and Feedback [4] in the Open Gov Directive itself. [5]  

Objective 1.f is closely related to Metagov's mission, and whereas Metagov
has been a &quot;hammer in search of a nail,&quot; the agency open gov contacts are a
ready-made constituency (stakeholder group) who *claim* to be actively
seeking input and feedback.

Why don't we take them at their word and start using Metagov tools to give
it to them in an open format, leveraging the StratML standard?  Doing so
could help to establish a productive precedent for collaborative governance,
open democracy or whatever else anyone may choose to call it (regardless of
how they choose to identify themselves).

Comments and vote tallies could be submitted semi- or fully automatically
using the mailto links for the agency open gov contacts listed at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#AgencyOpenGovPlans">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#AgencyOpenGovPlans</A>   

I suspect that those who are working individually on their own Metagov
applications may not truly wish to collaborate on a standard.  If so, that's
pretty ironic, given Metagov's mission, but perhaps not surprising since
we're all better at telling others what they should do rather than doing it
ourselves.

1
It seems to me that &quot;collaborative governance&quot; should be re-branded to &quot;open
democracy&quot;:
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2988">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2988</A>

2
We should also borrow democracy.org domain:
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2710">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2710</A>

3
Using this letter, for example:
<A HREF="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2732">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.politics.activism.metagovernment/2732</A>

4
Then create a mailing list there, like:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">hub at democracy.org</A>

5
Redesign <A HREF="http://democracy.org/,">http://democracy.org/,</A> something really simple (just to start).

6
Rewrite the actual invitation letter (according to point 2's linked mail):
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Invitation">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/Invitation</A>

7
Invite every project in related project's list:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/related">http://metagovernment.org/related</A>

(We could hold a meeting, and while chatting a little, send the mails.)
----------

What this plan is trying to accomplish:

The creation of a meeting point... the hub of the projects that want
to embetter democracy (by technological means). (Let's avoid to call
it consortium or umbrella.) To do this well it's a necessary condition
(and a measurable aspect) that the majority of invited projects join
the mailing list.

Why democracy.org and not metagovernment.org? I sustain that an
appreciable quantity of projects shows apathy when the name of the hub
isn't sufficiently general.
