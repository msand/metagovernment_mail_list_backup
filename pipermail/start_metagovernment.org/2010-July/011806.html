At some point, they'll say &quot;show me&quot;.  We'll want something concrete
to back us up.  All we have by way of an attractive demo, at this
stage, is our footprint in discussion media.  Even there, it's not the
tooling that's attractive (not at all), but the discussion itself.

&gt;<i> This leads me to ask about the lateral scalability of the free range
</I>&gt;<i> voting project. Sorry if this is already clearly spelled out, but it
</I>&gt;<i> can't hurt to ask it here anyway. If we wanted to provide the
</I>&gt;<i> organizing principle for one collective such as the tea party, would
</I>&gt;<i> that be a stand-alone instance, or would it more appropriately be a
</I>&gt;<i> subset of the larger frvp instance?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would strongly lean toward the former, at least in this
</I>&gt;<i> case... the tea party does have some very radical influences, and it
</I>&gt;<i> is also very large. If we tried to absorb it, our &quot;success&quot; would
</I>&gt;<i> result in our being obscured into a completely insignificant branch
</I>&gt;<i> of this decidedly American movement.

We're not quite ready to support *physical* stand-alones.  What we
have are logical stand-alones: <A HREF="http://havoc.zelea.com/w/Category:Area">http://havoc.zelea.com/w/Category:Area</A>

  An area is like a seedling pollwiki/streetwiki, and the present wiki
  is like a nursery for them.  As each area grows/matures, it's
  eventually supposed to separate and become an independent wiki,
  complete with its own associated pollservers, trustserver,
  etc. (Meanwhile, our technical supports for that are supposed to
  mature, because they're not ready, yet.)
