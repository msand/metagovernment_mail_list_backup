<PRE>
I added the amendment clause, Thomas, and I can't see anything else
that's missing (nothing major).  It looks like we'll reach agreement.
(Hey, it works! ;-)

<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3674&amp;a=3683">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3674&amp;a=3683</A>

Maybe we can maintain G/p/owdo as a generic template, without specific
domain name(s) and caretakers.  Then we can make a copy for each
particular contract, and fill in the details.  (Amendments to
particular contracts will require consensus of the caretakers, but
there's only a few of them, so they shouldn't need polling tools.)

We still need to decide on the domain name.  The straw poll was
indecisive.  How do we choose?  (If we're administering services like
the pollwiki and so forth under it, then I'd recommend keeping it as
short as possible.  We'll be embedding URLs in various discussion
media, and some of them have length limitations.  Other than that, I
don't wish to state a preference. ;-)

&gt;<i> &gt; So it's supposed to work like this: I announce intent to veto.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The veto is then pending for 30 days (a kind of cooling off
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; period) during which I can choose to *withdraw* it.  If I do not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; withdraw it, then (after 30 days) it comes into effect.  At that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; point, I lose the option of withdrawing it.

Yes, after 30 days.  Then it's too late.

Or the question is, how long should everyone wait for the vetoer to
make up his mind, before moving on?  The shorter the period of
suspense (with plans on hold, etc.) the better.
