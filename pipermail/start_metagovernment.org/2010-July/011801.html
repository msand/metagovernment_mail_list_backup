What if all caretakers would like to have the old contract back and they 
did finally also convince the one guy who vetoed? With your version 
everybody is forced into shutting down the whole thing.

&gt;<i>   
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ... I guess we have to explain to folks that if they succeed in
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> building a 999-vote consensus, then it's perfectly safe. Their
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> consensus cannot be modified (or vetoed) by the caretakers, only
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> the use of the *domain name*. People can easily find another
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> domain name, and carry on with that.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's good! So I added diff 2:

</I>&gt;<i> OK, I agree we need an explanation of that.  I expanded it and made it
</I>&gt;<i> a footnote.  (I'm thinking it may help if the less formal
</I>&gt;<i> explanation/commentary is kept separate from the normative legal
</I>&gt;<i> stuff.)  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3657">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3657</A>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Yes, I patched it in. Thanks!

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Leaving that aside (barring the possibility of a conspiracy), then
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> it's always better to have an amended contract that *keeps* the domain
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> name alive, rather than a vetoed contract that kills it. So the main
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> problem becomes preventing the caretakers from being forced into a
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> veto situation that nobody wants, simply because they can't modify the
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> contract.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What cases can you imagine, where the contract would need modification?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>  a) Some section of the contract turns out to be confusing, and to
</I>&gt;<i>     have different possible meanings.  Accusations are made that the
</I>&gt;<i>     caretakers are non-compliant.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The caretakers should be able to reword the contract to clarify
</I>&gt;<i>     their intent and avoid future confusion.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  b) The caretakers wish to add an additional domain name to the
</I>&gt;<i>     contract, rather than create a separate contract for it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  c) One of the caretakers wishes to add an additional caretaker to the
</I>&gt;<i>     contract, and the others agree to the addition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  d) One of the caretakers becomes ill, and wishes to add a clause
</I>&gt;<i>     concerning incapacity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  e) One of the domain names turns out to be illegal for some reason,
</I>&gt;<i>     and it needs to be written out of the contract.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There must be hundreds of others.  If we add a modification clause, it
</I>&gt;<i> can cover all of them.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>
Ok, you are right.

Thomas
