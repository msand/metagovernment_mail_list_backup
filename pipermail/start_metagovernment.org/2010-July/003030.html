<PRE>  *Proposal:* To use a header like this one. + *4* - *1* = *3*  *5
days*left to vote.
---------------

FOIL is forum + mail. Here I present some ideas of what it could be a
mixture of both systems, beginning with a short analysis of the advantages
and disadvantages of each one. A constructive combination of both surely
will be a perfect tool for group-work through the Internet. Google Groups is
a precursor to FOIL, which combines list and forum in a carefree and basic
way.

The biggest criticism that a forum receives is that it is necessary to visit
it frequently to participate, a task that is usually forgotten by the
participants, making the forum a difficult environment to launch: problem
that mailing lists do not have. Moreover, the archive of the lists are
almost non-navigable waters, in the sense of how difficult it is to read and
find information on them: problem somewhat solved in a forum.

The main idea behind FOIL is that the list's archive is organized as a forum
and also can be used as such. The messages produced in the forum go to the
list and viceversa. The user would opt for the medium of its choice.

The application may set as a Google Groups clone, the clone will be free
software. Although the intention is to go a little further. For example, the
tool could provide resources for voting, that a group may use to make
decisions more easily. Even communities that use mailing lists/forums for a
recreational end need to vote sometimes. FOIL must be able to interpret
certain instructions embedded in messages, like the Debian voting style,
retain the count of them and report its value in the header.

Messages sent to FOIL must be intelligently processed server side, so, the
cornerstone of the application may be the modern Lamson Project. Client side
in turn, must relay on a mail client capable of interpreting HTML.

The header simply keeps track of the +1, 0 and -1 that appear in the
conversation... FOIL uses the email address to verify the voter's identity,
so it will not be able to vote more than once (but if someone changes
his/her vote, this is updated). Everything is automatic.

The header is purely informational, it could carry fields such as:

      Title.
      Author.
      Abstract (if the proposal exceeds a certain length of
words/characters).
      Proposal.
      Votes (Favor, neutral and against).
      Number of votes cast.
      Sum of the votes.
      Start Date.
      Final day.
      Time Left.

The proposal title should be separated from the email subject, so we can
have more than one proposal for discussion, plus a single proposal can
appear through several conversations simultaneously. The forum would have
more potential for interaction, clicking on the header one is headed there.

Disclaimer: The header shown here is a non-functional prototype.
