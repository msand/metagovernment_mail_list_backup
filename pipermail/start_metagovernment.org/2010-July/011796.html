It's kinda fun.  You know if we fix the usability issues, then it
might become viral.  We can go into any discussion forum, and infect
it.

&gt;<i> &gt; ... we still need to say how the contract can be modified.

That's true, it looks fishy.  And the veto also looks fishy, at first
glance.  I guess we have to explain to folks that if they succeed in
building a 999-vote consensus, then it's perfectly safe.  Their
consensus cannot be modified (or vetoed) by the caretakers, only the
use of the *domain name*.  People can easily find another domain name,
and carry on with that.

Maybe the caretakers all become corrupted by power, and &quot;steal&quot; the
name away from the public?  To prevent that, we probably need 3 or 4
caretakers.  Then the likelihood of a conspiracy is close to zero.
Who wants to be hated by the general public?

Leaving that aside (barring the possibility of a conspiracy), then
it's always better to have an amended contract that *keeps* the domain
name alive, rather than a vetoed contract that kills it.  So the main
problem becomes preventing the caretakers from being forced into a
veto situation that nobody wants, simply because they can't modify the
contract.

Does that make sense?  Or am I missing something?  (It's getting late
here.)  In the meantime, here's another change to limit the likelihood
of a unwanted veto.  This one provides a &quot;cooling off&quot; period.  It
also specifies how the costs of veto are shared by all the caretakers:
