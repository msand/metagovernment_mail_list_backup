Here's that section:

  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/owdo#Veto">http://u.zelea.com/w/User:Mike-ZeleaCom/G/p/owdo#Veto</A>

  If the veto remains pending for 30 full days, then it ceases to be
  pending and comes into effect.  Once a veto has come into effect, it
  may not be withdrawn.

So it's supposed to work like this: I announce intent to veto.  The
veto is then pending for 30 days (a kind of cooling off period) during
which I can choose to *withdraw* it.  If I do not withdraw it, then
(after 30 days) it comes into effect.  At that point, I lose the
option of withdrawing it.

The benefit is that the others (caretakers, voters, etc) will know
with a certainty that the veto now applies.  So they can safely invest
their time/money/effort in making alternative arrangements.  I can't
throw a wrench into their plans by saying, six months later, &quot;I
changed my mind.&quot;

&gt;<i> &gt; ... I guess we have to explain to folks that if they succeed in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; building a 999-vote consensus, then it's perfectly safe. Their
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consensus cannot be modified (or vetoed) by the caretakers, only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the use of the *domain name*. People can easily find another
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; domain name, and carry on with that.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> That's good! So I added diff 2: 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481</A>
</I>
OK, I agree we need an explanation of that.  I expanded it and made it
a footnote.  (I'm thinking it may help if the less formal
explanation/commentary is kept separate from the normative legal
stuff.)  <A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3657">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3657</A>
What do you think?

&gt;<i> &gt; Leaving that aside (barring the possibility of a conspiracy), then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it's always better to have an amended contract that *keeps* the domain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; name alive, rather than a vetoed contract that kills it. So the main
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem becomes preventing the caretakers from being forced into a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; veto situation that nobody wants, simply because they can't modify the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; contract.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What cases can you imagine, where the contract would need modification?
</I> 
 a) Some section of the contract turns out to be confusing, and to
    have different possible meanings.  Accusations are made that the
    caretakers are non-compliant.

    The caretakers should be able to reword the contract to clarify
    their intent and avoid future confusion.

 b) The caretakers wish to add an additional domain name to the
    contract, rather than create a separate contract for it.

 c) One of the caretakers wishes to add an additional caretaker to the
    contract, and the others agree to the addition.

 d) One of the caretakers becomes ill, and wishes to add a clause
    concerning incapacity.

 e) One of the domain names turns out to be illegal for some reason,
    and it needs to be written out of the contract.

There must be hundreds of others.  If we add a modification clause, it
can cover all of them.
