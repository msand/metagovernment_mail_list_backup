<PRE>Along these lines, a few months ago I offered We-Vote as a venue for 
ranking the choices for the &quot;Contract From America...&quot; one of the 
better-funded projects that popped up to appeal to &quot;Tea Party&quot; folks.

We-Vote was ideally suited to serve the multi-option selection phase of 
the Contract project. You can see the ballot I put together at 
<A HREF="http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/?eid=277">http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/?eid=277</A> .

Also, though the &quot;Contract&quot; clearly emanated from pro-Republican 
partisans (not my peer group), a handful of the options struck me as 
fairly reasonable.  I thought it would be a good idea to test whether a 
broad-based consensus could emerge around some of their propositions by 
hosting a straw poll in a more neutral venue. The ballot I created also 
provided lots of links back to the official site.

Nevertheless, my announcement of the We-Vote ballot was removed from 
their Facebook page. And my ability to do any further posting there was 
blocked. So, my conclusion is that astro-turfing has won out so far. The 
original Tea Party folks may indeed have had some valuable ideas at 
their core. But the movement's independence is now only a facade. Under 
these circumstances, I don't expect the intellectually honest ones among 
them will be able to articulate their ideas in ways that can achieve 
broad appeal. Certainly not as long as the partisan powers-that-be in 
the GOP work so effectively to subsume their movement and control their 
message.
