I admit I haven't looked very hard, but my first guess is no, not  
formally. We might find discussions among various &quot;tea partiers&quot; on  
many discussion forums, but no centralized discussion.

In a sense, that's the point. Many of them are wonderfully distrustful  
of organized groups trying to be their &quot;official&quot; voice. That  
Wikipedia article describes several such groups which have gained some  
traction, but which also meet significant resistance. The movement is  
smart enough to know that many of these organizing influences are  
attempts at cooption.

So, yes, this does mean that the very thing which appeals about them  
is also an obstacle. But it seems reasonable that we are just the sort  
of non-influential organizing force they may be seeking. If we come  
offering them (and even &quot;them&quot; is a nebulous term) a system where  
nobody is in charge and yet everybody is in charge... where a  
threshold of 1000 people puts the very domain in communal hands, it  
may be extremely appealing to them.

My impression is that the approach would be to splatter a coordinated  
message across numerous minor forums and look for traction.

This leads me to ask about the lateral scalability of the free range  
voting project. Sorry if this is already clearly spelled out, but it  
can't hurt to ask it here anyway. If we wanted to provide the  
organizing principle for one collective such as the tea party, would  
that be a stand-alone instance, or would it more appropriately be a  
subset of the larger frvp instance?

I would strongly lean toward the former, at least in this case... the  
tea party does have some very radical influences, and it is also very  
large. If we tried to absorb it, our &quot;success&quot; would result in our  
being obscured into a completely insignificant branch of this  
decidedly American movement.
