<PRE>The Contract From America is now available in StratML format at
<A HREF="http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#TCFA">http://xml.gov/stratml/drybridge/index.htm#TCFA</A> 

Time Magazine (July 26, 2010, p. 15) quotes Senator Bob Bennett as saying
the Tea Party has &quot;no strategy&quot; and is making &quot;mischief&quot; that could cost the
GOP seats this fall.

While some Tea Partiers may argue the Contract is such a strategy, it falls
far short of being one that can effectively be implemented.  The Partiers
may cheer the defeat of politicians like Bennett but Florida may prove his
point in November, to the detriment of their cause.

It is also interesting to note that only three of the top ten objectives
included in the &quot;Contract&quot; obtained the support of two-thirds or more of
those who had the opportunity to vote on them (which did not include me).
The 10th objective barely achieved a majority (53.38%).

As one who strongly supports the principles (values) of the movement, it is
sad to me to see that it lacks a coherent plan to make a real difference by
engaging folks like me more effectively in support of our own objectives --
as opposed to those dictated to us by others (e.g. the political parties)
and arbitrarily incorporated in documents like the Contract From America,
without meaningful input from those who would be affected by it.  

However, that is a reality I am committed to helping change.  Hopefully, the
StratML standard and supporting services (e.g., those being developed by
subscribers to the Metagov listserv) can make meaningful contributions
toward that end.

Along these lines, a few months ago I offered We-Vote as a venue for 
ranking the choices for the &quot;Contract From America...&quot; one of the 
better-funded projects that popped up to appeal to &quot;Tea Party&quot; folks.

We-Vote was ideally suited to serve the multi-option selection phase of 
the Contract project. You can see the ballot I put together at 
<A HREF="http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/?eid=277">http://apps.facebook.com/we-vote/?eid=277</A> .

Also, though the &quot;Contract&quot; clearly emanated from pro-Republican 
partisans (not my peer group), a handful of the options struck me as 
fairly reasonable.  I thought it would be a good idea to test whether a 
broad-based consensus could emerge around some of their propositions by 
hosting a straw poll in a more neutral venue. The ballot I created also 
provided lots of links back to the official site.

Nevertheless, my announcement of the We-Vote ballot was removed from 
their Facebook page. And my ability to do any further posting there was 
blocked. So, my conclusion is that astro-turfing has won out so far. The 
original Tea Party folks may indeed have had some valuable ideas at 
their core. But the movement's independence is now only a facade. Under 
these circumstances, I don't expect the intellectually honest ones among 
them will be able to articulate their ideas in ways that can achieve 
broad appeal. Certainly not as long as the partisan powers-that-be in 
the GOP work so effectively to subsume their movement and control their 
message.
