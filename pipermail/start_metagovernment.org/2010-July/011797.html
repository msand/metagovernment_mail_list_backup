<PRE>Ok, Mike, I merged your suggestion into my position. But I dont see the 
benefit of this one sentence in diff 1: 
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481</A>

That's good! So I added diff 2: 
<A HREF="http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481">http://u.zelea.com:8080/v/w/Diff?b=3647&amp;a=3481</A>

&gt;<i> Maybe the caretakers all become corrupted by power, and &quot;steal&quot; the
</I>&gt;<i> name away from the public? To prevent that, we probably need 3 or 4
</I>&gt;<i> caretakers. Then the likelihood of a conspiracy is close to zero.
</I>&gt;<i> Who wants to be hated by the general public?
</I>
Hm, could be true ...

&gt;<i> Leaving that aside (barring the possibility of a conspiracy), then
</I>&gt;<i> it's always better to have an amended contract that *keeps* the domain
</I>&gt;<i> name alive, rather than a vetoed contract that kills it. So the main
</I>&gt;<i> problem becomes preventing the caretakers from being forced into a
</I>&gt;<i> veto situation that nobody wants, simply because they can't modify the
</I>&gt;<i> contract.
</I>
What cases can you imagine, where the contract would need modification?
