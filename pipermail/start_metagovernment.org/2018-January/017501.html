I look forward to seeing your categorization of my points.

I'm game. There's a similar forum at <A HREF="http://www.matchism.org/forum,">http://www.matchism.org/forum,</A>
but it seems your forum went dormant around the same time as I started
working in this area. If you're really interested in public access it
might be better to use the matchism forum instead of www.fullmoon.nu
because matchism.org works with http instead of requiring using https
without a certificate (something most people won't do because of all
the scary warnings browsers bring up before you can get to your
forum).

Although as I said I'm actually more comfortable working via email and
believe it works fine for discussions of this type.

&gt;<i> Will try to deal with it in the next couple of weeks but I'm actually at a

</I>
I can certainly relate to that: Since none of us are getting paid for
this and there isn't even any possibility of a big payoff at the end
(other than maybe the opportunity to become a martyr for the cause ;-)
it's a miracle that any of us make any progress at all. I would
recommend, however, using us as a &quot;sanity check&quot; on your plans before
going all-in on them. Sure you might get some troll-type criticism
that will just be a noisy waste of time to deal with. But it might
also save you from making huge blunders that you're simply blind to
because you're too close to the problem (like, creating a system
that's designed to merely restrict the government rather than to fix
what's actually broken in it).
  Regards,
    Scott

&gt;<i> Apologies.
