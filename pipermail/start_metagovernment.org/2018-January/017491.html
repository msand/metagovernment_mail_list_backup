<PRE>Thanks for the kind words.

I see you are burrowing deep into the rabbit hole.

&gt;<i> I really think you should &quot;stick your oar in&quot; here more often.
</I>
It's a bandwidth issue. I only have the one oar!

More seriously, the &quot;real democracy&quot; movement is basically healthy and 
up and running. Nothing, yet, like a consensus on what to do about 
getting it sorted but at least there is a considerable amount of 
activity in the field. It is also rare that I disagree with the main 
thrust of what I see being said and done in the group.

In contrast, the global level of activism or even comprehension about 
the extent and dangers of government surveillance against its own 
citizens is abysmal. We are living in a state of what I describe as 
Panopticon Plus which outperforms Bentham's wildest fantasies. It is a 
totalitarian wet dream and WTP have allowed it to happen without much 
more than the occasional whimper. People generally have no idea how 
serious a threat this poses to civilisation.

For example, it probably hasn't occurred to most members of this group
a) that every word ever posted by this group is now safely stored in 
archives held both by NSA and GCHQ
b) it's extremely unlikely that even they are aware of this. Yet. 
Because we haven't come up on their radar and, for the most part, they 
don't actually know what date they have captured.
c) if and when anything we do starts to make waves and thus bring 
ourselves to their attention, they'll go looking in their archives and 
discover the full history of the MG group.
d) they'll then churn all the material, particularly names and email 
addresses through their network matrix builders and construct the matrix 
which shows how we're all connected to the rest of the world. They'll 
trawl through all the messages we've ever sent (not just to each other 
but to ALL our contacts) in non encrypted channels, check our 
publications and public utterances and build complete profiles and 
activist pyramids to identify key players
e) then, if the waves we're making worry them in any way, for example 
because we're fuelling a growing movement in the USA to rewrite the 
constitution in ways they wouldn't approve, they'll go looking for the 
dirt (buried in the related data) they can use to undermine, blackmail 
or discredit those key players or ideas as appropriate

They started building that system, seriously, following 9-11. It isn't 
yet complete but it is up and running and we do occasionally see its 
ugly tentacles reaching out to grab its victims. China has a similar 
system, which is actually more honest - they openly tell their citizens 
that they're being watched for signs of subversion - but probably less 
powerful (it requires about 3 million human spies actively trawling 
their networks; NSA/GCHQ have fully automated their &quot;passive&quot; 
surveillance and are building fairly effective AI systems to search and 
correlate) Russia, Israel and sundry European countries are pursuing the 
same goals but aren't yet in the same league.

I'm in the Ed Snowden camp. For me the priority is to expose what's 
going on, but more importantly, I go one step further, to try to get 
people to realise that there ARE measures we can take to prevent the 
global Panopticon being used against us. Essentially it boils down to - 
first - using the same technology to watch the watchers and to store the 
data on immutable databases with trusted auditors having unfettered 
access.

And here's where we reconnect to Democracy. To begin with, the Auditors 
and Juries they'll need to report to are a fundamental democratic tool 
for the oversight of material where there is a legitimate need to 
preserve confidentiality. And that's something we could demand and 
create today. Ditto the laws required to mandate the use of the &quot;Trusted 
Surveillance&quot; protocols I advocate which would &quot;watch the watchers&quot; and 
provide the audit trails for the auditors and juries to examine.

But I'll leave you to ponder two examples of how democracy can (and, in 
my my view, must) control the technology more directly. I've actually 
touched on the first in the &quot;Ethical ID&quot; paper you're reading so you may 
already have encountered it. In short, Trusted Surveillance will only 
deserve that name if it acquires the Trust it needs. It will be trusted 
by all parties because they will (eventually) understand that
a) no one can cheat it
b) no one can extract data from it without the informed consent of the 
owner EXCEPT in circumstances defined, monitored and implemented by 
democratic means.

And here's the first example of how that democracy would manifest. I 
describe, in the Ethical ID paper, the possibility that Trusted 
Surveillance will permit us to prove the negative (eg that we were not 
at the scene of the crime) without revealing who we are or where we 
were. That would enable massive anonymous sweeps of the population to 
expose the handful of people who are unable or unwilling to prove that 
negative. It is an inherently democratic mechanism. Nobody could force 
you to comply. So it cannot work without a massive consensus that the 
question needs to be asked and answered in the first place.

You can imagine, for example, that if we learn that a rape/murder has 
taken place at a given location within a given time window, that once 
the horrific details were public and the police asked the community to 
take part in the &quot;voluntary exclusion&quot; exercise, there would be massive 
support and the vast majority of the population would comply, leaving 
exposed the handful who didn't. Amongst whom are likely to be the 
perpetrator and perhaps collaborators, as well as one or two innocent 
parties who happened to be close by but are not involved. The Policing 
task is now fairly trivial. In contrast, imagine that the Police had put 
out a similar request for those involved in the anti-trump protest which 
took place on inauguration day and for which they have tried to 
prosecute over 100 protestors (using, incidentally, some of the archive 
surveillance techniques outlined above) (and, fortunately, failing, so 
far, to get juries to cooperate). In that situation, the vast majority 
would simply refuse to participate, leaving the &quot;perpetrators&quot; safely 
hidden among the herd.

The second example of democratic control is the use of massively 
distributed escrow keys (I mention this in the History of Digital 
Telepathy). Heres the short version.

We're all (under Trusted Surveillance) monitoring our own lives 
digitally, in ways which cannot be subverted. This - for example - 
provides an instant cure for all sorts of abuse, from Police violence, 
through to sexual harrassment. You've got the evidence you need to 
convict the bastards. And you and only you can choose to release it. BUT 
that can also be abused. For example the same recordings could become 
Revenge Porn. Solution, joint keys and neither of you can view the 
material without reconstructing the key in a consensual fashion. BUT 
that too can be abused. If it began as consensual, so you've shared 
keys, then it turns nasty, the rapist can block your revelation by 
refusing to share his key. So now you need what I call the Jury key.

This is a key broken into 10,000 pieces and widely distributed amongst 
random key holding citizens who are all using the Trusted Surveillance 
system. If any 8000 of that 10000 all collaborate, they can reassemble 
the Jury Key. And the way the data is locked is such that any 2 of the 3 
keys can unlock it. i.e. the two consenting parties who originally 
locked it can unlock it at any time. But if a serious allegation like 
rape comes up and the other party refuses to co-operate, the potential 
victim can put out an appeal for democratic unlocking. Unless of course, 
they've died as a result of the attack, in which case, there's a much 
clearer case for democratic re-assembly of the Jury key. In either case, 
no one knows who is holding bits of the key. So no one can be coerced 
into sharing. The question has to be put to the population at large. If 
enough people are motivated to unlock the key, they'll go searching for 
the relevant matches in their key store and submit any matches to the 
&quot;pool&quot;. If 80% of the key holders agree, the key will eventually emerge 
from the statistical fog.

I could ramble on for days. But you get the gist. I am deeply committed 
to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the 
technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who 
control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my 
view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a 
rational democratic debating process.

I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side of 
the struggle, please step forward...

Harry

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the more appropriate question is &quot;how could we use technology to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My point is that I strongly believe that the laws, power structures 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and vested interests in society are so heavily weighted in favour of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the elites and against WTP, that we need a much more strategic 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> approach to the problem than is represented, for example, by the long 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standing efforts of a group like this. And this is not, in any way to 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> denigrate all the effort and thought that has gone into MG; I'm sure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it will pay off in the end.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But, personally I feel my own efforts are better spent on attacking 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the power structure more directly, with the long term ambition of 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opening the door to real democracy along the lines we're struggling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with here.
