Only up to a point, and I'd argue that point is not more than a few
multiples of the email limit and still several orders of magnitude
smaller than would would be required to have even a locality-wide
debate on an issue where more than a few percent of the population
participates. And if you don't have at least a majority of the people
directly involved in making the decision, you've just reproduced
oligarchy (&quot;government by the active participants&quot;), not implemented
democracy.

Fortunately, little debate is actually required to make good
decisions. In fact if you have qualified and talented social engineers
writing the proposals, no debate at all should be required. Instead
the vastly simpler pro/con list (as implemented in proxyfor.me) will
be sufficient to ensure a good decisions since The People are merely
doing quality control at that point, not arguing about the details of
a proposal. To my mind the latter, and what you seem to be proposing,
is just &quot;design by committee&quot; which any engineer can tell you reliably
produces poor quality products.

Agreed, and it's not just authoritarians who will balk at one group
like this having control over the outcome out of proportion to their
numbers. With the exception of a small minority of social dominators
(the main leadership component of SDAPs) we *all* have an innate sense
of fairness that requires a much more egalitarian distribution of
input into the process.

&gt;<i> One of the painful conclusions I have reached is that, unless you actually
</I>&gt;<i> want fisticuffs and a shooting war, you have to find ways to make your

</I>&gt;<i> It's so much easier. (That's a contributing motive to my Trusted

</I>
Not just that, I believed we're actually instinctively programmed to
turn to authoritarian rule when decisions (and progress) don't get
made, especially when the group is under some sort of economic stress.
Which is of course why I find the consensus-oriented systems Ed and
others are insisting on so objectionable: They virtually *ensure*
authoritarian decisionmaking because *no* decision gets made
otherwise.

But you don't have to get everyone to agree, only to have a majority
not raise objections, a vastly lower hurdle. If people truly believe
that the decision reflects The Will of The People (which of course
applies to essentially zero of the decisions made by misrepresentative
democracy), they will follow the law with minimal coercion even if it
wasn't the one they preferred. But we're much less likely to follow an
authoritarian leader, especially if we didn't vote for that, which is
why coercion becomes so much more common (and necessary) when power is
all top-down.
