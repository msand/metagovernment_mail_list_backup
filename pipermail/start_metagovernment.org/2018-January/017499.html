At least from what I'm reading, that's not exactly his argument. I
found his claims amazingly reminiscent of the recent Damore/Google
kerfuffle last year (12 years later), albeit that's about the
composition of the engineering population rather than the
decisionmaking population:

It's of course also the general position taken by Wade in &quot;A
Troublesome Inheritance&quot; a 2014 book that SJWs and PC pressure has
caused the &quot;scientific community&quot; to denounce even though few of them
have even read it and none of them have made any convincing case that
any of it is fundamentally incorrect (all the negative reviews I've
read of it focus on obscure technicalities, attempting to discredit
the overwhelming evidence that his main conclusions are correct by
pointing out a little bit of fuzz on his characterizations of the raw
data):

The way I interpret it he's not exactly arguing against democracy or
even direct democracy, but only that different people are going to
have different roles in the system (which, BTW, is exactly what
proxyfor.me is designed to facilitate). You, on the other hand, seem
to be arguing the opposite (that it's *not* reasonable to make these
kinds of distinctions) without offering any proof that this is
necessary, desirable, or even achievable. IMHO differential
participation rates are inevitable and so no system that doesn't
account for this is even viable. Unfortunately this includes every
single system prior to proxyfor.me that I'm aware of with the possible
exception of the very earliest human decisionmaking system: Voting
with your feet or conspiring to eliminate a problematic individual in
your band, a system that worked for us for hundreds of thousands of
years prior to the development of agriculture (or more specifically,
the invention of money that can be used to purchase surplus goods).

&gt;<i> because, since about a year after that forum post, I've had the opportunity
</I>&gt;<i> to start building the system which might make the beginnings of the Trusted
</I>&gt;<i> Surveillance system possible and I am utterly focussed on getting the logic
</I>&gt;<i> and every resulting definition, algorithm, protocol etc completely
</I>&gt;<i> consistent with my starting principles. It is an extremely ambitious project
</I>&gt;<i> and, candidly, I don't think I've got what it takes to complete it.
</I>
And not to rain on your parade, but I'd say you're holding the wrong
end of the stick: All this paranoia about surveillance just tells me
that you're apparently looking at &quot;the government&quot; as an us vs. them
kind of thing, a perspective that's not only fundamentally backwards
but also all but guarantees that anything you come up with will be
unimplementable (why would the oligarchs give up any of their power if
you've already resigned yourself to the fact that they have the
power?). Worse, you've also squandered (or even misapplied) what
little intellectual and political capital you may have to bring to
bear on the issue making it even *more* difficult for anyone with an
actual solution to the problems of public policy decisionmaking to
succeed. IMHO widespread surveillance, even to the point of *complete*
surveillance, should be considered a good thing because it can be used
to solve so many problems with almost no downsides *provided* that The
People are the ones actually making the decisions as to how that data
is used (and by whom). Arguing against it is just arguing from a
position of fear and weakness: If you don't trust the government, your
problem is with the structure of government, not with the tools
they're using.
