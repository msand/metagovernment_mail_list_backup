Rare for me to let a post go unanswered for a week, but I was
otherwise occupied last week. Please forgive my ginormous snips as I
hit the high points...

&gt;<i> Slashdot is notorious for its dystopian view of technology, despite, or,
</I>&gt;<i> they might argue, because of their heightened familiarity with it, so it
</I>&gt;<i> didn't surprise me that they would be so negative in response to the
</I>&gt;<i> question put.
</I>
Besides the possibility that they &quot;know enough to be afraid&quot; a related
issue is the personality psychology of engineers and other technical
types: They tend to be highly authoritarian with a unusually large
predilection for prejudice and violence. For example they are vastly
over-represented among the ranks of Jihadis:
<A HREF="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29836/1/Why_are_there_so_many_Engineers_among_Islamic_radicals_%28publisher%29.pdf">http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/29836/1/Why_are_there_so_many_Engineers_among_Islamic_radicals_%28publisher%29.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> I would be too, but for different reasons, which most of us on this group
</I>&gt;<i> would probably support. I'm not interested in computers or anything else
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;improving elections&quot;. Elections are nothing to do with democracy; they are
</I>&gt;<i> designed, primarily to prevent it.
</I>
To the extend that by &quot;elections&quot; you mean selection of
representatives for the legislative branch, I agree. Elections for
executive branch positions are much less problematic, I think,
although still a suboptimal way to do it.

&gt;<i> And I've been banging on for some years about the most important thing we
</I>&gt;<i> can do with technology which will give us a chance of introducing democracy
</I>&gt;<i> but I don't thinkg I've ever mentioned it in this group. In short, the idea
</I>&gt;<i> is to use technology to limit the damage governments are capable of.
</I>
Sorry, I think you went off into the weeds here: If you think you need
to limit the tools and techniques the government uses I submit that
you've already failed because you've made one of two fundamental
errors:
1) You believe that it's reasonable (or perhaps inevitable) that the
government implements something other than &quot;The Will of The People&quot;.
2) You believe in some sort of &quot;inalienable rights&quot; independent of
those the rest of us are wiling to grant you (the libertarian
position).

Laboring under either of these misconceptions simply renders any of
your proposals non-viable because even if you succeed in achieving any
short-term goal it will be at best a bandaid covering up a cancerous
mole. The only solution to bad government is to replace it with good
government. *That* is what we should be working on, not merely
applying patches to a vessel that we know will eventually sink us all
unless it's replaced. While we might argue about what &quot;good
government&quot; is, I think most of us here would agree that some sort of
more egalitarian system must be designed/built/implemented. Whether or
not that will result in &quot;good government&quot; or not is an empirical
question, but since we've never tried it before it's at the very least
an experiment worth doing. Unfortunately working on anything else is
not just a distraction, it's actually counterproductive because it
serves to legitimize the existing system and make people substantially
less willing to abandon it even when something better comes along
(&quot;Maybe if we just patch this one biggest leak we can make it across
the river one more time before we all drown!&quot;).
  Regards,
    Scott
