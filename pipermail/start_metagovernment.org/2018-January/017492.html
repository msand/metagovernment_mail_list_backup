&gt;<i> More seriously, the &quot;real democracy&quot; movement is basically healthy and up and running. Nothing, yet, like a consensus on what to do about getting it sorted but at least there is a considerable amount of activity in the field. It is also rare that I disagree with the main thrust of what I see being said and done in the group.
</I>
If you have any further thoughts on &quot;what to do about getting it sorted&#8221;, I for one would be interested in hearing your suggestions. Most of what I&#8217;ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated and I&#8217;m wondering what your current thinking is regarding leveraging a &quot;real democracy&quot;.

&gt;<i> In contrast, the global level of activism or even comprehension about the extent and dangers of government surveillance against its own citizens is abysmal. We are living in a state of what I describe as Panopticon Plus which outperforms Bentham's wildest fantasies. It is a totalitarian wet dream and WTP have allowed it to happen without much more than the occasional whimper. People generally have no idea how serious a threat this poses to civilisation.
</I>
Agreed. My own research suggests that it&#8217;s even more sinister than what you describe. I&#8217;m quite sure the *powers that be* are actively engaged in the use of very effective mind-control mechanisms. (Perhaps a conversation for another day.) The take away is that the threat is serious enough, and that it&#8217;s up to WTP to respond effectively, or we risk losing freedoms on a scale that is perhaps unimaginable.

&gt;<i> For example, it probably hasn't occurred to most members of this group
</I>&gt;<i> a) that every word ever posted by this group is now safely stored in archives held both by NSA and GCHQ
</I>&gt;<i> b) it's extremely unlikely that even they are aware of this. Yet. Because we haven't come up on their radar and, for the most part, they don't actually know what date they have captured.
</I>&gt;<i> c) if and when anything we do starts to make waves and thus bring ourselves to their attention, they'll go looking in their archives and discover the full history of the MG group.
</I>
Given what you&#8217;ve written elsewhere, I&#8217;m guessing your presence here just about guarantees this.  :)

&gt;<i> d) they'll then churn all the material, particularly names and email addresses through their network matrix builders and construct the matrix which shows how we're all connected to the rest of the world. They'll trawl through all the messages we've ever sent (not just to each other but to ALL our contacts) in non encrypted channels, check our publications and public utterances and build complete profiles and activist pyramids to identify key players
</I>&gt;<i> e) then, if the waves we're making worry them in any way, for example because we're fuelling a growing movement in the USA to rewrite the constitution in ways they wouldn't approve, they'll go looking for the dirt (buried in the related data) they can use to undermine, blackmail or discredit those key players or ideas as appropriate
</I>
No doubt some scenarios bent towards engendering the successful inauguration of &quot;real democracy&quot; into our current *ecosystems of corruption* will bring the men in black suburbans to knocking on our doors. I don&#8217;t currently lose sleep over this because I think our overall lack of success has kept us securely in the &quot;benign threat&quot; file. Though I hope we can change this soon. 

&gt;<i> They started building that system, seriously, following 9-11. It isn't yet complete but it is up and running and we do occasionally see its ugly tentacles reaching out to grab its victims. China has a similar system, which is actually more honest - they openly tell their citizens that they're being watched for signs of subversion - but probably less powerful (it requires about 3 million human spies actively trawling their networks; NSA/GCHQ have fully automated their &quot;passive&quot; surveillance and are building fairly effective AI systems to search and correlate) Russia, Israel and sundry European countries are pursuing the same goals but aren't yet in the same league.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in the Ed Snowden camp. For me the priority is to expose what's going on, but more importantly, I go one step further, to try to get people to realise that there ARE measures we can take to prevent the global Panopticon being used against us. Essentially it boils down to - first - using the same technology to watch the watchers and to store the data on immutable databases with trusted auditors having unfettered access.
</I>
Yes. My own fantasy is to summon *Big Sister* in order to keep an eye on *Big Brother*. Perhaps the precursor of this could be seen this past weekend wearing a hundred thousand pink hats. One must remain imaginative and hopeful&#8230;no?

&gt;<i> And here's where we reconnect to Democracy. To begin with, the Auditors and Juries they'll need to report to are a fundamental democratic tool for the oversight of material where there is a legitimate need to preserve confidentiality. And that's something we could demand and create today. Ditto the laws required to mandate the use of the &quot;Trusted Surveillance&quot; protocols I advocate which would &quot;watch the watchers&quot; and provide the audit trails for the auditors and juries to examine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But I'll leave you to ponder two examples of how democracy can (and, in my my view, must) control the technology more directly. I've actually touched on the first in the &quot;Ethical ID&quot; paper you're reading so you may already have encountered it. In short, Trusted Surveillance will only deserve that name if it acquires the Trust it needs. It will be trusted by all parties because they will (eventually) understand that
</I>&gt;<i> a) no one can cheat it
</I>&gt;<i> b) no one can extract data from it without the informed consent of the owner EXCEPT in circumstances defined, monitored and implemented by democratic means.
</I>
I&#8217;m still reading your &quot;Ethical ID&#8221; paper. I&#8217;m a bit slow on the uptake when encountering new ideas such as this&#8230;and it&#8217;s rather long (that&#8217;s not a criticism). I think you adequately covered the basic idea though in your other paper that describes a fictional prelude to the potential future success this digital technology may realize. 

Related to this I found myself wondering if maybe Elon read your paper prior to coming up with his suggestion for a ubiquitous counter to the AI threat through the development of a neural lace. That would be quite a feather in your hat, heh. If not, you could just resort to the adage that &quot;great minds think alike&quot;. :)

<A HREF="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs">https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs</A>

&gt;<i> And here's the first example of how that democracy would manifest.
</I>
(Big snip)

&gt;<i> I could ramble on for days. But you get the gist.
</I>
Yes. While the technological details are currently beyond my ability to fully comprehend, I do though get the gist. I&#8217;m impressed and heartened by both by the depth of your proposal as well as the clarity with which you present it.

&gt;<i> I am deeply committed to the Democratic cause and doing my best to integrate it into the technology we need to defend ourselves against the authoritarians who control most of the human race. And achieving that protection is, in my view, currently a greater priority than figuring out how to implement a rational democratic debating process.
</I>
As you may have gathered from my previous contributions here, my own instinct has been to design and develop a global *platform for proposal* whereby projects such as the one you are proposing to could be presented, discussed, accepted, and potentially supported. Though I&#8217;ve been working on this for many years, with as much passion as I imagine you have in conjured in mustering you own, I am not tied to the details of how a *real democracy* might come about. 

I am encouraged by the variety of individual efforts emerging here and there and find myself wanting to bind them together into some cohesive and collaborative organism. The world is in such great flux these days I find myself wondering if maybe all it would take is for &quot;a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens&#8221; to turn things around. Such widespread *Chaos equals Opportunity* right? 

Personally, I&#8217;m continually looking for individual trim tabs or leverage points. That said, I am convinced that unless we do this *together*, we&#8217;re simply blowing into a wind of ideas that will never find a (collective) soil in which to fully root and grow. 

&gt;<i> I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side of the struggle, please step forward&#8230;
</I>
I&#8217;m in, (albeit with some ideas of my own). Please carry on&#8230;..  

As together we choose,

Steve
