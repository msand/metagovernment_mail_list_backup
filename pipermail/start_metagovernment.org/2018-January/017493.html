<PRE>&gt;<i> If you have any further thoughts on &quot;what to do about getting it
</I>&gt;<i> sorted&#8221;, I for one would be interested in hearing your suggestions.
</I>&gt;<i> Most of what I&#8217;ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated
</I>&gt;<i> and I&#8217;m wondering what your current thinking is regarding leveraging
</I>&gt;<i> a &quot;real democracy&quot;.
</I>

you might regret asking that. I was challenged by &quot;The Prof&quot; in 2007, 
over my support for Democracy. He made a cogent argument against 
democracy based on the notion that we're not sufficiently &quot;equal&quot; 
(chiefly in a cognitive sense) to allow democracy to work. In reply I 
laid out the most detailed case for and defense of Democracy I've so far 
attempted. In particular I took the arguments for Meritocracy head on. 
And, in the process published my first attempt at a democratic debating 
algorithm and outlining how the web is obvious platform for the 
democratic debate (your &quot;Platform for Proposal&quot;). There is even in a 
link back to &quot;Metascore&quot; in there somewhere, which shows how long I've 
been lurking on this group.

Its a forum discussion on my own website and I've &quot;self certified&quot; the 
entire forum (its a partial obstacle to automated state snooping) so as 
you enter you'll be confronted with the terrifying warning that you are 
entering the dangerous territory of an unvalidated certificate. If 
you're prepared to take your life in your own hands, and risk trusting 
me, then add the site as a &quot;Security Exception&quot; and proceed. But don't 
expect to surface for a few hours. And get someone to check, from time 
to time, that you haven't fallen over backwards frothing at the mouth...

This will take you to the Prof's case. My reply follows immediately.
<A HREF="https://www.fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=170&amp;p=868#p868">https://www.fullmoon.nu/forum2013-import/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=170&amp;p=868#p868</A>

I did argue, in the early days of this group, that we should have set up 
a forum of our own, not just in which to conduct our discussions 
somewhat more scalably than this, but also as a testbed for debating 
algorithms like my own or any alternatives which may exist or are 
provoked by it.

I'd have to say I am disappointed that after all these years, we still 
haven't managed that much.

&gt;&gt;<i> c) if and when anything we do starts to make waves and thus bring
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ourselves to their attention, they'll go looking in their archives
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and discover the full history of the MG group.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Given what you&#8217;ve written elsewhere, I&#8217;m guessing your presence
</I>&gt;<i> here just about guarantees this.  :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>that's no joke. I was &quot;identified&quot; by MI6, as an &quot;anarchist - but one we 
can do business with&quot; back in the early 80s (a close relative was 
&quot;Positively Vetted&quot; for the role he was about to take up at GCHQ) so I'm 
under no illusion that I'm at least on a list somewhere, but 
(regrettably?) I'm equally sure they don't (yet) see me as a threat. It 
is fascinating to speculate what effect discussions like these will have 
on the junior spooks who may one day read these comments and ask 
themselves what the fuck kind of system they're working for that thinks 
this kind of prurience is justifiable.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. My own fantasy is to summon *Big Sister* in order to keep an eye
</I>&gt;<i> on *Big Brother*. Perhaps the precursor of this could be seen this
</I>&gt;<i> past weekend wearing a hundred thousand pink hats. One must remain
</I>&gt;<i> imaginative and hopeful&#8230;no?
</I>
funny you should say that, before I settled on &quot;Trusted Surveillance&quot; I 
was rooting around for more &quot;comforting&quot; titles for my proposed system. 
I was close to choosing &quot;Little Sister&quot; (even less threatening than Big 
Sister). But then I decided that I had to take that challenge head on as 
well. My wife bluntly pointed out that a name like &quot;Trusted 
Surveillance&quot; instantly attracted distrust. I agree. But that's how it 
should be. Anyone proposing the kind of surveillance shield I'm 
proposing should be obliged to prove every claim, in order to earn 
whatever trust it requires and if we're not prepared to describe and 
defend every relevant choice, then nobody should be stupid enough to 
trust it.

That, in a sense, is a clue to why
&gt;<i> Most of what I&#8217;ve read so far on your blog site is somewhat dated
</I>
because, since about a year after that forum post, I've had the 
opportunity to start building the system which might make the beginnings 
of the Trusted Surveillance system possible and I am utterly focussed on 
getting the logic and every resulting definition, algorithm, protocol 
etc completely consistent with my starting principles. It is an 
extremely ambitious project and, candidly, I don't think I've got what 
it takes to complete it. My hope is that I can at least get it started 
to the extent that others will be able to jump on board and keep it 
going. One of the consequences of this level of focus is the near 
destruction of all my other creative effort. Like I said before. It's a 
bandwidth problem.

&gt;<i> Related to this I found myself wondering if maybe Elon read your paper
</I>&gt;<i> prior to coming up with his suggestion for a ubiquitous counter to the
</I>&gt;<i> AI threat through the development of a neural lace. That would be
</I>&gt;<i> quite a feather in your hat, heh. If not, you _could_ just resort to
</I>&gt;<i> the adage that &quot;great minds think alike&quot;. :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs">https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs</A>
</I>
ah, I can't claim credit for that. The cyborg notion is not far short of 
a century old! (I think I've even heard arguments that Frankenstein's 
monster was the first example of the meme, but I don't think it 
qualified) I was certainly reading multiple sci fi stories containing 
cyborgs or similar concepts back in the 60s.


&gt;<i> I am encouraged by the variety of individual efforts emerging here and
</I>&gt;<i> there and find myself wanting to bind them together into some cohesive
</I>&gt;<i> and collaborative organism. The world is in such great flux these days
</I>&gt;<i> I find myself wondering if maybe all it would take is for &quot;a small
</I>&gt;<i> group of thoughtful, committed citizens&#8221; to turn things around. Such
</I>&gt;<i> widespread *Chaos equals Opportunity* right?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I oscillate between deep despair and cautious optimism. A phenomenon 
like the election of Trump is an extremely powerful argument against 
democracy and in support of the views put forward by &quot;The Prof&quot;. But I 
prefer to see it as the necessary shock that it will take to wake a 
critical mass of intelligent Americans (who I would estimate at about 
25% of their population) to the need for revolutionary change in the 
direction of real Democracy.. And if a group like ours could get its own 
act together, we might even be able to build the model they need, in 
time for them to come along and adopt it...


&gt;<i> Personally, I&#8217;m continually looking for individual trim tabs or
</I>&gt;<i> leverage points. That said, I am convinced that unless we do this
</I>&gt;<i> *together*, we&#8217;re simply blowing into a wind of ideas that will
</I>&gt;<i> never find a (collective) soil in which to fully root and grow.
</I>
yup, the eternal Anarchist problem. There's never another one to hold up 
the other end of the banner...
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I need all the help I can get. So if anyone wishes to join my side
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the struggle, please step forward&#8230;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I&#8217;m in, (albeit with some ideas of my own). Please carry on&#8230;..
</I>
good to hear.
