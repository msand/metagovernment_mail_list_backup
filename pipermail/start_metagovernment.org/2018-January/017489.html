<PRE>Rare for me to stick my oar in these days but this one grabbed my 
attention.

Slashdot is notorious for its dystopian view of technology, despite, or, 
they might argue, because of their heightened familiarity with it, so it 
didn't surprise me that they would be so negative in response to the 
question put.

I would be too, but for different reasons, which most of us on this 
group would probably support. I'm not interested in computers or 
anything else &quot;improving elections&quot;. Elections are nothing to do with 
democracy; they are designed, primarily to prevent it.

So the more appropriate question is &quot;how could we use technology to 
introduce democracy?&quot;  (I reject the word &quot;improve&quot; - it implies we've 
already got something worthy of being called &quot;democracy&quot; which is 
available for improvement)

And I've been banging on for some years about the most important thing 
we can do with technology which will give us a chance of introducing 
democracy but I don't thinkg I've ever mentioned it in this group. In 
short, the idea is to use technology to limit the damage governments are 
capable of.

It's been my principle focus for 20 years or so. With a lot of luck, 
this year, I might be able to announce the first live version of the 
project I've been working since about the turn of the century designed 
to achieve a number of things, the most important of which is the cure 
for what I call &quot;Accountability Theatre&quot;

<A HREF="https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/accountability-theatre/">https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/accountability-theatre/</A>

but if you fancy a bit of fantasising about where the technology might  
eventually take us my fictional &quot;history of digital telepathy&quot; might 
entertain you.

My point is that I strongly believe that the laws, power structures and 
vested interests in society are so heavily weighted in favour of the 
elites and against WTP, that we need a much more strategic approach to 
the problem than is represented, for example, by the long standing 
efforts of a group like this. And this is not, in any way to denigrate 
all the effort and thought that has gone into MG; I'm sure it will pay 
off in the end.

But, personally I feel my own efforts are better spent on attacking the 
power structure more directly, with the long term ambition of opening 
the door to real democracy along the lines we're struggling with here.

Ciao

Harry
