<PRE>Hi Harry, 
I really enjoyed reading both of the papers you linked to below - though particularly the one on the *History of Digital Telepathy*. I&#8217;m currently reading another piece you wrote on *Ethical Identity Evaluation*. Very interesting. I really think you should &quot;stick your oar in&quot; here more often.

&gt;<i> Rare for me to stick my oar in these days but this one grabbed my attention.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Slashdot is notorious for its dystopian view of technology, despite, or, they might argue, because of their heightened familiarity with it, so it didn't surprise me that they would be so negative in response to the question put.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would be too, but for different reasons, which most of us on this group would probably support. I'm not interested in computers or anything else &quot;improving elections&quot;. Elections are nothing to do with democracy; they are designed, primarily to prevent it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the more appropriate question is &quot;how could we use technology to introduce democracy?&quot;  (I reject the word &quot;improve&quot; - it implies we've already got something worthy of being called &quot;democracy&quot; which is available for improvement)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> And I've been banging on for some years about the most important thing we can do with technology which will give us a chance of introducing democracy but I don't thinkg I've ever mentioned it in this group. In short, the idea is to use technology to limit the damage governments are capable of.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's been my principle focus for 20 years or so. With a lot of luck, this year, I might be able to announce the first live version of the project I've been working since about the turn of the century designed to achieve a number of things, the most important of which is the cure for what I call &quot;Accountability Theatre&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> but if you fancy a bit of fantasising about where the technology might  eventually take us my fictional &quot;history of digital telepathy&quot; might entertain you.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/the-history-of-digital-telepathy-2/">https://harrystottle.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/the-history-of-digital-telepathy-2/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> My point is that I strongly believe that the laws, power structures and vested interests in society are so heavily weighted in favour of the elites and against WTP, that we need a much more strategic approach to the problem than is represented, for example, by the long standing efforts of a group like this. And this is not, in any way to denigrate all the effort and thought that has gone into MG; I'm sure it will pay off in the end.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But, personally I feel my own efforts are better spent on attacking the power structure more directly, with the long term ambition of opening the door to real democracy along the lines we're struggling with here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ciao
