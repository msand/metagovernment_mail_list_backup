<PRE>Hi Steve,

about that Meta-mind. Sorry, I know that you do not define it, but it
sounds like that if everybody is in the decision making process that it is
the best process. Well, it may be true when the best contribution of some
individuals is that they learn something from the process. Because they may
be biased, e.g. vulgar material thinking bias. They only way forward may be
learning.

Sure more people know more, but in my opinion it is worth testing how many
and what kind of people you need for decision-making that produces best
outcomes, before you ask everybody to participate.

Kind regars

&gt;<i> Hi Scott (and others),
</I>&gt;<i> My apologies for dropping the previous thread. I was away from my computer
</I>&gt;<i> for several weeks visiting family. I&#8217;d like to continue the conversation,
</I>&gt;<i> but rather than picking up the circular and protracted debate about the
</I>&gt;<i> pros and cons of* dictators vs. politburos * ;) I like to suggest that we
</I>&gt;<i> just move on. I believe there&#8217;s a larger conversation needing our
</I>&gt;<i> attention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I *would* though like to reference one comment you made in your last
</I>&gt;<i> reply to the 'Multiple Proxies&#8217; thread, Scott. There&#8217;s a passage from a
</I>&gt;<i> book I was reading while I was away that I feel correlates with it quite
</I>&gt;<i> elegantly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [First my comment&#8230;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...if the a majority of the electorate felt that a single
</I>&gt;<i> figurehead/executive was a better way to do business, then that would
</I>&gt;<i> become
</I>&gt;<i> the new Executive Structure. I just wouldn&#8217;t want to front load it with
</I>&gt;<i> that
</I>&gt;<i> because of the reasons stated above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, of course people would have to vote to approve the new system,
</I>&gt;<i> but wouldn't it be better if we *designed* it right in the first place
</I>&gt;<i> to reduce the number of these on-the-fly redesigns?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From:* Founding Brothers* by Joseph J. Ellis
</I>&gt;<i> Vintage Books 2002
</I>&gt;<i> p. 216
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;As Adams remembered it&#8230;.'all great critical questions about men and
</I>&gt;<i> measures from 1774 to 1778' we&#8217;re desperately contested and highly
</I>&gt;<i> problematic occasions, usually decided by one vote of a single state, and
</I>&gt;<i> that vote was often decided by a single individual. Nothing was clear,
</I>&gt;<i> inevitable, or even comprehensible to the soldiers in the field at Saratoga
</I>&gt;<i> or the statesman in the corridors at Philadelphia: 'It was patched and
</I>&gt;<i> piebald policy then, as it is now, ever was, ever will be, world without
</I>&gt;<i> end.' The real drama of the American Revolution, which was perfectly in
</I>&gt;<i> accord with Adam&#8217;s memory, as well as with the turbulent conditions of his
</I>&gt;<i> own soul, was its inherent messiness. This meant recovering the exciting
</I>&gt;<i> but terrifying sense that all the major players had at the time&#8212;namely,
</I>&gt;<i> that they were making it up as they went along, improvising on the edge of
</I>&gt;<i> catastrophe.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [More about this at the end of my email.]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I think we all know now, the &quot;catastrophe&#8221; these *Brothers* were facing
</I>&gt;<i> was multifold and ultimately came down to 'life or death' decisions for
</I>&gt;<i> many of them individually as well as for their emerging Country. But the
</I>&gt;<i> circumstances they faced were, by any reasonable measure, an order of
</I>&gt;<i> magnitude less complex and dire than those we are currently facing as a
</I>&gt;<i> planetary species.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In my mind, the confluence of tragedies we are soon to encounter on a
</I>&gt;<i> colossal scale is an emerging crisis that can *only* be met by the
</I>&gt;<i> massive synergistic intelligence of a collective global mind. I think it is
</I>&gt;<i> our best and only survival option. It should be clear to any semi-conscious
</I>&gt;<i> human that the structures we now rely on are not up to the task. For me
</I>&gt;<i> personally, the preponderant question is: &quot;How does a Meta-mind emerge?&quot; Of
</I>&gt;<i> course no one can really say, but I think attempting to design a
</I>&gt;<i> Meta-governance system to replace what&#8217;s collapsing before our eyes is a
</I>&gt;<i> fine place to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> --------------------------------------------------
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I *really* like the essential components of proxy4.me. I think it&#8217;s
</I>&gt;<i> crucial that we achieve a comprehensive quorum if we are going to empower a
</I>&gt;<i> truly comprehensive global democracy. And it seems to me that proxy4.me
</I>&gt;<i> is a near perfect fit for this objective...if it works as intended. That
</I>&gt;<i> said, I think it&#8217;s just one piece of a larger puzzle that will be needed
</I>&gt;<i> for constructing a thriving and effective global platform. Listed below I
</I>&gt;<i> believe is an inventory of a the baseline components that will be crucial,
</I>&gt;<i> from the get go, for the creation of a self-organizing global body.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1 - I think we can all agree a crowdsourced *proposal driven platform* is
</I>&gt;<i> key. One that is available to anyone willing to participate according to
</I>&gt;<i> the rules and norms of the larger Organization. A Network for a global
</I>&gt;<i> tribe that can generate and support the proposals and projects of a new
</I>&gt;<i> paradigm&#8230;perhaps even an entirely new species.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2 - Perhaps we can also agree that proposals will need to be vetted in
</I>&gt;<i> order to reduce the number of those which are poorly developed and/or that
</I>&gt;<i> don&#8217;t fit the Mandate of the Organization at large.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3 - Because *we the people* will ultimately generate an enormous number of
</I>&gt;<i> proposals at a global level (perhaps dozens or more daily), a sizable staff
</I>&gt;<i> will be necessary to process them in a timely manner.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4 - This staff will need to be managed by some Executive Oversight
</I>&gt;<i> Structure. [To be run by either a Dictator, or a Politburo. ;]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5 - The overall Platform will need to be developed and maintained as well
</I>&gt;<i> by even more staff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6 - I think it will be necessary to set up a customized crypto-economy
</I>&gt;<i> with a Foundation to support proposals and the financial needs of the
</I>&gt;<i> Organization at large. Many proposals will need significant resources to
</I>&gt;<i> get them off the ground. And some will no doubt provide significant income
</I>&gt;<i> for the Foundation once their projects become viable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7 - A Voting Platform will be necessary to determine which proposals are
</I>&gt;<i> adopted and funded.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8 - An ever-evolving crowdsourced Mandate will need to be drafted in order
</I>&gt;<i> to reflect the Vision of the Organization as well as to determine it's
</I>&gt;<i> Priority.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 9 - And, as I see it, a blockchain Database will need to be set up to
</I>&gt;<i> track the undertakings and operation of the Organization.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 10 - A huge forum for Discourse will be necessary to debate the proposals
</I>&gt;<i> that have been vetted prior to a vote.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 11 - A Magistrate of sorts will be necessary to maintain order on the
</I>&gt;<i> Intranet Platform of the Network.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 12 - And finally, a Template for submitting proposals according to the
</I>&gt;<i> Policy of the Organization will be extremely useful in saving time and
</I>&gt;<i> effort both for those creating the proposals, as well as for those who are
</I>&gt;<i> vetting them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously there are many more details to be fleshed out, but that is, I
</I>&gt;<i> believe, a comprehensive summary of the fundamental elements necessary to
</I>&gt;<i> get this project off the ground.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for your thoughtful response,
</I>&gt;<i> Steve
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One final word in reference to the &quot;on-the-fly-redesign&#8221; comment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I first encountered what might be called the substratum of these ideas
</I>&gt;<i> back in the early eighties. My own personal journey through the decades
</I>&gt;<i> since has precipitated many practical and theoretical iterations emerging
</I>&gt;<i> from this basic substructure of ideas. But one of the values that has run
</I>&gt;<i> through them all is a conviction that the Process and Structure must be
</I>&gt;<i> crowdsourced and flexible enough to be continually self-organizing. I&#8217;m not
</I>&gt;<i> sure if this qualifies as an &quot;on-the-fly-redesign,&#8221; but either way, I&#8217;ll
</I>&gt;<i> take it with your &quot;design it right in the first place&quot; comment as a
</I>&gt;<i> misguided suggestion rather than an admonition. :) I think it&#8217;s critical
</I>&gt;<i> that we remain open, flexible, and collaborative as we &quot;improvise on the
</I>&gt;<i> edge of catastrophe&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
