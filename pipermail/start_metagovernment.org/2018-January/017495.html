I&#8217;m working up to it. You make it sound like there might be some monsters down there.  

&gt;<i> I did argue, in the early days of this group, that we should have set up a forum of our own, not just in which to conduct our discussions somewhat more scalably than this, but also as a testbed for debating algorithms like my own or any alternatives which may exist or are provoked by it.
</I>
In the meantime, can you paddle on about this? &#8230;.&quot;more scalably&quot; - &quot;testbed for debating algorithms&#8221;? 


&gt;<i> funny you should say that, before I settled on &quot;Trusted Surveillance&quot; I was rooting around for more &quot;comforting&quot; titles for my proposed system. I was close to choosing &quot;Little Sister&quot; (even less threatening than Big Sister). But then I decided that I had to take that challenge head on as well. My wife bluntly pointed out that a name like &quot;Trusted Surveillance&quot; instantly attracted distrust. I agree. But that's how it should be. Anyone proposing the kind of surveillance shield I'm proposing should be obliged to prove every claim, in order to earn whatever trust it requires and if we're not prepared to describe and defend every relevant choice, then nobody should be stupid enough to trust it.

I&#8217;m imagining a Big Native African *Rosie the Riveter* type who&#8217;s really pissed about how we&#8217;re ripping her entire planet to shreds. Cause that&#8217;s kinda what&#8217;s happening. 

I'm thinking *Me Too* is just getting going. There&#8217;s so much to unpack in that multi-millennial tragedy. 

And who wants the means to *provide the evidence and prove the lie* more than women who&#8217;ve experienced abuse. Well, I suppose there are a lot of men as well, but when you do the numbers.

I can see the meme now - &quot;Big Sister&quot; has the *tools* to keep fucking Big Brother in fucking line...and she fucking knows how to fucking use them.   Think first-adopters.

Think flamingo pink hair over deep black shiny skin with a Gaia tattoo, studs, implants, and other hardware including an antenna poking out of her skull next to her M.I.B. Ray Bans. Her scowl would frighten Ali. And keep the monkey wrench resting on her bulging bicep for all of the Neanderthals out there who will never get it otherwise.  

Big Sista be watchin&#8217; YOU!


&gt;<i> I oscillate between deep despair and cautious optimism. A phenomenon like the election of Trump is an extremely powerful argument against democracy and in support of the views put forward by &quot;The Prof&quot;. But I prefer to see it as the necessary shock that it will take to wake a critical mass of intelligent Americans (who I would estimate at about 25% of their population) to the need for revolutionary change in the direction of real Democracy.. And if a group like ours could get its own act together, we might even be able to build the model they need, in time for them to come along and adopt it&#8230;
</I>

Ditto&#8230;ditto&#8230;ditto.  I&#8217;m much inspired by the link Michal recommended. Much to think about there for a group like this&#8230;.imo.
