Agreed. I haven't really defined what the filtering mechanism for
getting a proposal into the main queue should look like, but in
proxyfor.me inappropriate filtering is the only real means for the
executive branch to get up to any policy mischief (e.g., there is
basically no provision for &quot;executive orders&quot; other than the normal
regulatory stuff). I still believe that getting a proposal through
some sort of an &quot;initiative&quot; process on FB/reddit/etc. should be
sufficient. If the Manager rejects it anyway, they'd be obligated to
provide a rejection letter, and if that provides an obviously
inappropriate reason it would be sufficient cause to get people riled
up enough to vote to remove the  the manager (or maybe just the queue
manager). And as I've already suggested &quot;remove the manager&quot; should be
a permanent proposal in the queue and that the replacement manager
should be pre-identified (e.g, for the Globality Manager, the highest
rated (by some objective criteria) Locality Manager would
automatically be promoted. For Localities I guess you'd have to use a
lower-level board: Here in Boulder for example it'd probably be the
highest rated member of the Planning Board, which perhaps not
coincidentally is where many of the City Council candidates already
come from).

&gt;<i> Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me, not the number 4.
</I>
Yeah, proxy4.me is being used by some German sysadmin for his testing
purposes. At some point I was going make an offer to buy it from him,
but was planning to wait until confusion became an issue. I guess it
already has ;-)
  Regards,
    Scott
