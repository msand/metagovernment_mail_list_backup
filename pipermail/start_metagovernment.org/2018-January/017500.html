<PRE>Scott, greetings,

some good and meaty, and some bizarre arguments you have in your 
response(s)
Probably take me a week to respond and right now I don't have that week 
available.

I'll also probably repost the whole thing onto my forum, a) because its 
a much better writing/quoting environment and b) because the whole 
argument - which looks like it could get quite interesting - will be 
more publicly available.

Will try to deal with it in the next couple of weeks but I'm actually at 
a crunch time for own development plans so they must take priority.

Apologies.

Harry

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unfortunately that's exactly the kind of image which will fuel the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> authoritarian (and racist in this case) mysogynist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed, and it's not just authoritarians who will balk at one group
</I>&gt;<i> like this having control over the outcome out of proportion to their
</I>&gt;<i> numbers. With the exception of a small minority of social dominators
</I>&gt;<i> (the main leadership component of SDAPs) we *all* have an innate sense
</I>&gt;<i> of fairness that requires a much more egalitarian distribution of
</I>&gt;<i> input into the process.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> One of the painful conclusions I have reached is that, unless you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want fisticuffs and a shooting war, you have to find ways to make your
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> opponents agree with you, not just bully or intimidate them (even if 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with images) into submission. The problem is that the coercive 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> strategy
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> favoured by the authoritarians is much more effective, which is why, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> often in human history, liberation movements have turned into 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tyrannies.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's so much easier. (That's a contributing motive to my Trusted
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Surveillance efforts - make the coercion permanently visible)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not just that, I believed we're actually instinctively programmed to
</I>&gt;<i> turn to authoritarian rule when decisions (and progress) don't get
</I>&gt;<i> made, especially when the group is under some sort of economic stress.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is of course why I find the consensus-oriented systems Ed and
</I>&gt;<i> others are insisting on so objectionable: They virtually *ensure*
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian decisionmaking because *no* decision gets made
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But you don't have to get everyone to agree, only to have a majority
</I>&gt;<i> not raise objections, a vastly lower hurdle. If people truly believe
</I>&gt;<i> that the decision reflects The Will of The People (which of course
</I>&gt;<i> applies to essentially zero of the decisions made by misrepresentative
</I>&gt;<i> democracy), they will follow the law with minimal coercion even if it
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't the one they preferred. But we're much less likely to follow an
</I>&gt;<i> authoritarian leader, especially if we didn't vote for that, which is
</I>&gt;<i> why coercion becomes so much more common (and necessary) when power is
</I>&gt;<i> all top-down.
