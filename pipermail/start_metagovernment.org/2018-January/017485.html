&gt;<i> Agreed. I haven't really defined what the filtering mechanism for

</I>
I think it could largely be a boilerplate *application* tailored to the type or category of proposal being submitted. Tutorials could be available to assist in making the application process more understandable. And as I said earlier, I think that ultimately AI could be utilized. My sense is that one would want to make the process as simple and painless as possible so that more people would be inclined to use the platform. And the boilerplate aspect would assist in the *vetting* as well by making proposals more uniform. Initially I think, maybe just a simple form with a tutorial listing the basics.

&gt;<i> but in
</I>&gt;<i> proxyfor.me &lt;<A HREF="http://proxyfor.me/">http://proxyfor.me/</A>&gt; inappropriate filtering is the only real means for the
</I>&gt;<i> executive branch to get up to any policy mischief (e.g., there is
</I>&gt;<i> basically no provision for &quot;executive orders&quot; other than the normal
</I>&gt;<i> regulatory stuff).
</I>
Agreed.

&gt;<i> I still believe that getting a proposal through
</I>&gt;<i> some sort of an &quot;initiative&quot; process on FB/reddit/etc. should be
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient.
</I>
This is the biggest hurdle in my mind. How do you legitimize something like proxyfor.me except through widespread usage. It needs to be tested before it will be accepted by the mainstream. Chicken and egg. What kind of proposal could be run on Social Media that would have enough *value outcome* to attract the necessary population, not only to validate it, but to encourage it&#8217;s further usage? 

&gt;<i> If the Manager rejects it anyway, they'd be obligated to
</I>&gt;<i> provide a rejection letter, and if that provides an obviously
</I>&gt;<i> inappropriate reason it would be sufficient cause to get people riled
</I>&gt;<i> up enough to vote to remove the  the manager (or maybe just the queue
</I>&gt;<i> manager). And as I've already suggested &quot;remove the manager&quot; should be
</I>&gt;<i> a permanent proposal in the queue and that the replacement manager
</I>&gt;<i> should be pre-identified
</I>
I imagine this would cause a managers average cortisol levels to rise substantially.

&gt;&gt;<i> Also, the link to Scott's site is www.proxyfor.me &lt;<A HREF="http://www.proxyfor.me/">http://www.proxyfor.me/</A>&gt;, not the number 4.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yeah, proxy4.me &lt;<A HREF="http://proxy4.me/">http://proxy4.me/</A>&gt; is being used by some German sysadmin for his testing
</I>&gt;<i> purposes. At some point I was going make an offer to buy it from him,
</I>&gt;<i> but was planning to wait until confusion became an issue. I guess it
</I>&gt;<i> already has ;-)
</I>
Glad I could help out with that.  :)

&gt;<i>  Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>    Scott
