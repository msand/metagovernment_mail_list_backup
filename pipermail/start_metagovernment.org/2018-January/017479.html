If they break their mandate then they are able to be replaced by a vote. This 'Executive Oversight' needs to be extremely limited in its power for me to consider this a reasonable idea. As I perceive your system now I think they can do to much damage in the short term, enough to disrupt everything and potentially cause chaos.

I appreciate your feedback Patrick. I'm probably missing something here. (I really mean that.) It&#8217;s difficult for me to comprehend how an organization of that scale would tick without some umbrella of management. But I&#8217;m considering your suggestion&#8230;.&quot;a clearly defined mandate [such that staff would] require no managing,&#8221; that to me would be ideal. 

I think one of the most inspiring examples of this is valvesoftware.com. They have a completely horizontal organizational structure. Their desks are literally on wheels and each employee gets to park themselves wherever they want, and work on what ever inspires them. I&#8217;m not a gamer, but I believe Valve is one of the premier companies of it&#8217;s kind on the planet. Apparently they're very successful. As I understand it, the only managers are ad hoc Projects Organizers who are completely self-selecting. Maybe their model is something to emulate. Whatever we wind up implementing, I agree with you and Scott that being able to vote managers out overnight is key.

Also, as we speed up the curve towards the *Singularity*, no doubt AI will be saddled with more of the tasks and duties associated with managing our general human infrastructure. If we can write algorithms to manage various aspects of oversight for the Organization, I&#8217;m all for it. 

The real question that continues to bewilder me is, &#8220;How do we get this show on the road?&#8221; My guess is that a fair number of those souls with an interest in Meta-governance have at some point found their way to this list. If that&#8217;s so, what&#8217;s keeping us from a more active collaboration. Are we waiting for permission from the goddess of law and legislation...or is there some other group that&#8217;s movin' and groovin' with this? I don&#8217;t mean to be flippant but, what&#8217;s the hold up? I mean really. I just came from a trip to California where I have family in both Santa Rosa and Ventura and I can attest to you that Rome has already begun to burn. 

It seems to me that our apparent inability to organize a governance mechanism for a sovereign global people is the only thing that is keeping us from a reasonable response to the tragedies that lie before us. 

I&#8217;m puzzled to find the missing link? What will it take? 

What would a first step look like?
