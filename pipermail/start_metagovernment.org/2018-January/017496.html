the monsters of complexity. We dived deep in that one...

</I>
email debate isn't scalable. Forum debates scale quite well.

they are also the obvious platform for formal democratic debates and we 
could use our own debates to test out the various algorithms which we'll 
need to develop to make the system work.

unfortunately that's exactly the kind of image which will fuel the 
authoritarian (and racist in this case) mysogynist.

One of the painful conclusions I have reached is that, unless you 
actually want fisticuffs and a shooting war, you have to find ways to 
make your opponents agree with you, not just bully or intimidate them 
(even if just with images) into submission. The problem is that the 
coercive strategy favoured by the authoritarians is much more effective, 
which is why, so often in human history, liberation movements have 
turned into tyrannies. It's so much easier. (That's a contributing 
motive to my Trusted Surveillance efforts - make the coercion 
permanently visible)
