<PRE>for example, if we want to take donations, we may also need to process forms
so that the people donating can receive tax reimbusement. if we agree that
this is useful, we will need to find an accountant to handle this. we can
make decisions like this with or without a determined 'leader' -- we just
need to agree on how to implement a decision framework using the tools at
our disposal.
