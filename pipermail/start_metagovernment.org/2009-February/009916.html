<PRE>There is no irony, Manuel.  I am fully aware that I could get involved.  
However, what MetaScore and MetaGovernment needs is not my 2 or 3 hours 
a week.  It needs 2 or 3 hours a week from hundreds of people.  And 
bringing in those hundreds of people requires strong leadership and a 
focused vision.

And, despite what you may believe, MetaGovernment certainly is a 
top-down project.  What you are confusing is what we have, and what we 
aspire to.  We want to be a bottom-up project, and we are creating 
MetaScore to allow that to happen.  But we don't have MetaScore, so we 
cannot be bottom-up.  We are only fooling ourselves if we think otherwise.

You're quite right that the success of the project depends on the 
engagement of the mailing list lurkers.  But it is unreasonable, unwise, 
demonstrably useless (historically), and otherwise unintelligent to 
assume that a bunch of lurkers will accomplish something without strong 
leadership.

But I'll reply more to Ed in a moment.

Kind regards,
Robert

</I>&gt;<i> Concerning metascore I would certainly like to be more active, but like most
</I>&gt;<i> I have other things going on, especially with exams coming up. You mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> a few areas where non programmers could be more active and I agree. We
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't wait on metascore before we start promoting our ideas. A formal
</I>&gt;<i> organization is probably a good idea, since other organizations would take us
</I>&gt;<i> more seriously. Having some software to show would also help but we
</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't let it stop us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again for everybody lurking on the list. If you think as strong about
</I>&gt;<i> the project
</I>&gt;<i> as Robert, take a moment to consider how you could contribute and how you
</I>&gt;<i> could find the time to make that contribution. The success of metagovernment
</I>&gt;<i> depends on you, and your engagement.
