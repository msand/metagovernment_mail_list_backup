&gt;<i> &quot;But we're not following history here, we're writing our own.&quot;

</I>&gt;<i> No.  Do you honestly believe we're the first group to ever think we were
</I>&gt;<i> writing our own history?  Unbelievable.  The pages of history are littered
</I>&gt;<i> with the spectacular failures of people who thought the basic rules wouldn't
</I>&gt;<i> apply to them.
</I>
Within reason. The &quot;basic rule&quot; being disputed is the concept of a
human champion vs an idea as the champion.

That &quot;basic rule&quot; may well be universal. I cannot think of an example
where it does not apply. The nearest is the example of Open Source
software, but even then we still have the heroic Stallmans and
Torvalds', fighting against the evil Gates'.

But if we are successful then we are writing our own history. There is
no need to be meek or falsely modest about it. The goal is that
significant.


&gt;<i> We are no different from any other group.  We have an idea.
</I>&gt;<i> We want to see it through.  Unfortunately, our idea is that we, someday,
</I>&gt;<i> won't need a leader.  But we sure as hell still need one now.
</I>
Well look, we appear to be firmly entrenched on opposite sides of the
philosophical debate about whether one should abandon ones ideals in
order to reach them - so I doubt we'll get anywhere discussing that.

But what you haven't answered, is why we &quot;sure as hell&quot; need a leader
if we'll have a working end-user version of Metascore within a few
months?


&gt;<i> &quot;It is entirely possible the goals of Metagovernment won't be achieved
</I>&gt;<i> during the lifetime of anyone on this list.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not good enough.  And a complete cop-out.  Take some responsibility!  Show
</I>&gt;<i> some passion!  Don't saddle future generations with our inability to make
</I>&gt;<i> something happen now.  We're already off-loading the environment onto our
</I>&gt;<i> children, let's at least try and make sure they have good government.
</I>
Of course we shall try, there is no cop-out. There is the pessimistic
possibility I outlined - if it takes that long to do it right, then so
be it I say. I know your stance.


&gt;<i> &quot;Although we can hope to do better, we know the problems we address are
</I>&gt;<i> often caused by the abysmal prevalence of short-mid term thinking.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> True.  But &quot;long-term thinking&quot; is not the same as &quot;long-term dreaming&quot;, and
</I>&gt;<i> MetaGovernment's 'long-term' is the dreaming, not the thinking kind.
</I>&gt;<i> Long-term thinking tells me that if we don't get off our asses now, we're
</I>&gt;<i> not going to accomplish anything, now or ever.  Your long-term thinking
</I>&gt;<i> sounds like not having anything happen is fine.
</I>
Long term thinking tells me that ideals, and a good story, can matter
more than most short-term gains.

A sense of urgency is a great thing, making sure you're going in the
right direction is a better thing.


&gt;<i> &quot;So let's do this right, or not at all.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You're making my brain hurt.  I defy you to point to any other project, in
</I>&gt;<i> any other area of human experience, where a great and significant change was
</I>&gt;<i> brought about by leaderless, directionless 'lurkers'.
</I>
Well first up, you're conflating the leaderless structure, with
directionless lurkers. I'll share your outrage if, when we have a
Metascore ready for testing and usage, most of us lurkers don't
actually participate.

My feeling, and of course I represent no one but myself, is that many
lurkers are interested in using and testing Metascore once it is
ready.


&gt;<i> Thank you, Richard, for summing up so effectively why we need to wake up.
</I>&gt;<i> We are deluding ourselves.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Where is your passion, people?  Wake up!
</I>
I don't see the reason for concern, much less this panic. How am I
delusional? (attach an additional piece of paper if required for your
answer)


&gt;<i> It still comes down to you, Ed.  You're our leader, no matter what you think
</I>&gt;<i> about the issue.  Lead us!
</I>
Ed is already doing the perfect job of leading, by example, by not leading us.

Richard
