<PRE>&gt;<i> I think you might be surprised at how we rally around, were you to step

</I>
I don't particularly disagree with anything Robert says - historically
he is correct. Causes thoughout history have had leaders and champions
and legends. Everyone likes a good story.

But we're not following history here, we're writing our own. Our
champion will not be Ed, it will be the very Idea of achieving
consensus and results without appointing a leadership structure.

Take that away and what do we have? Empty words indeed.

Take that away when the situation looks grim, and the precedent is set
to overturn the ideal whenever dark clouds appear. Like those today
who sacrifice basic liberties on the promise of security.

And for what? If we're possibly going to have an end-user-usable
version of Metascore by May, then what is the rush? It is entirely
possible the goals of Metagovernment won't be achieved during the
lifetime of anyone on this list. Although we can hope to do better, we
know the problems we address are often caused by the abysmal
prevalence of short-mid term thinking.

Anyone hoping to be around to bask in the glory of being part of
Metagovernment may be disappointed. But I don't think that's why most
of us are here. Mostly lurking.

So let's do this right, or not at all.

Richard
