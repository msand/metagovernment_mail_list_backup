This was the core motivation behind starting the Metagovernment  
project: IMHO, any system of democracy is inherently compromised if it  
has anything to do with a profit motive.

Google (or Microsoft, Yahoo, MySpace, etc.) can overshadow us at any  
time by vastly outspending us, but they cannot achieve the high-ground  
of a non-profit, open source, completely transparent, completely  
inclusive project. I don't care if it's Metagovernment or any other  
project that wins out... only that it conforms roughly to  
Metagovernment's basic principles.

At this upcoming TransparencyCamp, I've convened a roundtable of  
several online democracy projects... and there will also be, hopefully  
in the audience, reps from many of the big players in the field (three  
from Google, three from Microsoft, and Tim O'Reilly, to name a few). I  
hope that our rag-tag group can get across to the bigwigs that they  
are welcome to support our groups financially, but they should keep  
away from trying to make a profit off this idea. No idea if that will  
work, but FWIW, Wikipedia has been successful at keeping both the high  
ground and the lead.
