My heart's with you, but my head begs to differ.  My feeling is that
any kind of commercial rents on a core institution of democracy would
be morally wrong.  Here I agree.

On the other hand, looking out from the core into the periphery - of
what Murphy calls an &quot;ecosystem&quot; - my thinking is that commercial
involvement (including profit) would make it a whole lot healthier.

These are just my 2 cents.  (And I have no commercial ties here, no
patent claims, etc.)

And looking ahead, none of this is going to be for *us* to decide.  If
it's going to be an open ecosystem - if that's the probable outcome -
there's no way to exclude business firms and entrepreneurs from
participating in it, with an eye to profit.  Else it's not really
open.

&gt;<i> Google (or Microsoft, Yahoo, MySpace, etc.) can overshadow us at any time

</I>
Will any single project win out?  I'm beginning to think it's not that
kind of race.  Maybe it's a more cooperative, live-and-let-live
affair.  I credit Murphy's silence, as much as his words ...

&gt;<i> At this upcoming TransparencyCamp, I've convened a roundtable of several 
</I>&gt;<i> online democracy projects... and there will also be, hopefully in the 
</I>&gt;<i> audience, reps from many of the big players in the field (three from 
</I>&gt;<i> Google, three from Microsoft, and Tim O'Reilly, to name a few). I hope that 
</I>&gt;<i> our rag-tag group can get across to the bigwigs that they are welcome to 
</I>&gt;<i> support our groups financially, but they should keep away from trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> make a profit off this idea. No idea if that will work, but FWIW, Wikipedia 
</I>&gt;<i> has been successful at keeping both the high ground and the lead.
</I>
... because transparency may be the key, after all.  TransparencyCamp
is mostly about the government opening up its databases and
interfaces, right?  Well, maybe we ought to start thinking about
opening our own.  It's not just the software that has to be free and
open, it's the data too.

I'm thinking that JoeVotes could exist, today.  We could start
defining the standards for an open ecosystem - call it what you will -
in which the various tools and facilities could interoperate, side by
side, with equal access rights.  Isn't that really the brass ring?  If
we reach for it, what could stop us?
