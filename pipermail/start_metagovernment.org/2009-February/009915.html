<PRE>Here are some thoughts on all this:
If we need an organization to get the money from the eu
So be it.
But I refuse that we need an organization to
Be taken seriously by other organization.
If this is the case we have already lost

Ed is a natural leader also because he refused the position

But also because he has time and is committed
And we are human beings, which at the end of the day means primates.
We have gone a long way but we tend to naturally follow people we feel  
we can trust.
To be able to estabilish a different modus operandi will take time.
And software.

But it might be interesting to make ed disappear when we go public.
If he takes only a position of voter in metascore, and the community  
answers question directly.

Thinks the revolutionary idea of a journalist submitting the questions  
for the interview and we all decide the answer together! They have no  
human being to grasp too but they have actions.
I like the idea of paying a programmer. A payed programmer who is  
doing open source code
For a bunch of philosophers. This could be revolutionary.

Many of us contribute in different ways.

I sent a mail today to Giovani about my position at the uni.
We are investigating the factual possibility to set up a eu project.

I also know a person whos job is to write those grants application.

He might help but he will want to be paid. Like the previous coder.
It probably would be more efficient to pay a coder directly.

I am on the iPhone, but I have no better connection right now.
Sorry for any mistake

&gt;<i> I agree with a lot of what you say, Robert, and I appreciate the  
</I>&gt;<i> sentiment. But in some senses what you are asking is that we put the  
</I>&gt;<i> cart before the horse.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I now agree with Manuel and Pietro that we need working code  
</I>&gt;<i> *before* we try to take other parts of the project much further.  
</I>&gt;<i> After all, whenever anyone asks one of the many different questions  
</I>&gt;<i> I get frequently asked, my answer always has to be: &quot;well, we need  
</I>&gt;<i> to release the code into the wild and see what people do with it.&quot;  
</I>&gt;<i> That after all, is our development strategy: not to replace the  
</I>&gt;<i> government of the United States, but rather to make a beta of  
</I>&gt;<i> governance software for a chess club. That approach has a much, much  
</I>&gt;<i> better chance of replacing the United States (and every other)  
</I>&gt;<i> government than a direct approach. If you investigate how some of  
</I>&gt;<i> the Related Projects are doing, the ones that target national  
</I>&gt;<i> governments, you will find that they aren't making much progress.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Same sort of reasoning goes for working with other organizations or  
</I>&gt;<i> getting funding. If they bother to answer at all (and I can't get  
</I>&gt;<i> people like Tim O'Reilly to even acknowledge me), their first  
</I>&gt;<i> question is about what the code looks like. Without a running copy  
</I>&gt;<i> of Metascore, we are all talk and no action. Even if we had an  
</I>&gt;<i> article published in the New York Times, we still wouldn't have  
</I>&gt;<i> anything to show for it... just more people talking. What we need is  
</I>&gt;<i> something concrete. So if you can code, I beg you to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for leadership, I do not accept the notion that I am the project  
</I>&gt;<i> leader. It would be counter to the idea of open source governance  
</I>&gt;<i> for me to have even the slightest bit of authority within the  
</I>&gt;<i> project. I do however, work quite a bit to promote the project, and  
</I>&gt;<i> again, can't get very far without having something concrete to show  
</I>&gt;<i> people. I also repeatedly ask this group to please contribute more,  
</I>&gt;<i> particularly in coding:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Is anyone familiar with the television show Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that they need to change.  The time has come for us to change.  We

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ed?  I'm calling you out.  Like it or not, you're our leader.  But  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there has been no leadership.  Doesn't MetaGovernment make you  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sweat at night?  Don't you lie there and think about the good we

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to increase the standard of living of the world, bring peace and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> justice to humanity, until you're vibrating?  Doesn't it make you  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tremble to think about what MetaGovernment could do when you read  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about all the wars and rebellions and atrocities that could be  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stopped if people would only talk to each other?  Doesn't it make  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you seethe when corporations abuse the third world because their  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> governments are corrupt?  Doesn't it make you stare at the ceiling  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unable to sleep because you're so filled with rage that we haven't  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> got a better way?  Don't you press back against the panic that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> closes in when you read about governments clamping down on the free  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exchange of information?  Doesn't the hope that MetaGovernment will  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> succeed allow you to finally go to sleep?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then fucking show it!  We need you to lead us.  We look to you,  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ed.  Make it happen.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Has anyone on this mailing list who is not a coder ever done  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anything to advance the purposes of MetaGovernment?  Has anyone on  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> this mailing list ever bothered to compile a list of things that  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> non-coders can do, and then assigned people to do these things?   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Why not?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And there is lots we could do.  I think the most important thing is  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to hire a part-time administrator.  It's surprising what an  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> administrator can accomplish.  They could book speaking  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> engagements, interviews, garner publicity, triage communication.   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We could hire a coder to work full time on MetaScore.  How would we  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pay for this?  I don't know, but have we tried government grants?   
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Subscriptions?  Philanthropists?  NGOs?  We could write  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> presentations, start projects, raise awareness.  We have no idea  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what could happen, because we haven't tried any of it.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm a coder.  I develop full-time in Django and Python and CSS and  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HTML and Javascript.  But I'm not getting involved.  I don't have  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time for another pie-in-the-sky dream that some guy told me  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about on Slashdot one day.  Been there.  Done that.  Oh, I'd love  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to help.  I really would.  MetaGovernment gives me hope for the  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future, hope that we can get ourselves straightened out before it's  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too late.  But it's a joke right now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It's time to wake up.
