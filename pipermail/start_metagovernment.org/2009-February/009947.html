<PRE>Hello Everybody,
sorry if I hve been unable to participate lately. Mostly I am on line
through the iphone, and the iphone right now cannot post to the mailing
list. I should fix that.

I am working at Coimbra University, and Giovani suggested that we make
together a proposal for the EU. Basically they are making tool that can be
re-used. I would be interested to do it, but I would especially be
interested to do it in the sense of working for something that would be
useful for the EU, for metagovernment, for metascore and for Giovani's
project.

So, in a sense, being the link between the two projects. What do we, as
metagovernment need? What would you suggest that I develop? It must be
something that has some research inside. What about the tag engine, has that
being developed? How far are we?

Regards,
Pietro

</I>&gt;<i> proposals reach the established threshold (by default 50%+1 supporters) it
</I>&gt;<i> is automatically moved to the agenda of the next &quot;council&quot; meeting (labels
</I>&gt;<i> can be changed to suit other labeling needs) to be &quot;officially&quot; discussed.

</I>&gt;<i> issued for that kind of software. But we will apply most of the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality thought for it to the proposed app and, as it will be open
</I>&gt;<i> source, it can be reused later or adapted. We are using PHP/Drupal/Jquery
</I>&gt;<i> now. If you have a feature roadmap and would like to, I think we could add
</I>&gt;<i> some features thought for metascore in the project proposal.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Again, my proposal is to join efforts for common goals. We both have floss
</I>&gt;<i> projects, both with pretty much the same mission and vision. We could only
</I>&gt;<i> benefit by having a shared architecture, design and (partially) feature
</I>&gt;<i> roadmaps. And I mean, not only us and metascore, but also the other projects
</I>&gt;<i> represented here in this list... ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  In the demo, I was somewhat confused by the fact that a proposal has to be a

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The separation is to allow people to prepare and edit their articles,
</I>&gt;<i> before they put them up as a proposal. The article itself is any piece
</I>&gt;<i> of content in the repository. That was the broadest term we could
</I>&gt;<i> think of without just saying file. Depending on the community you
</I>&gt;<i> might want to change it to &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Bill&quot;, &quot;Article&quot;, &quot;Resolution&quot; or
</I>&gt;<i> something else.
