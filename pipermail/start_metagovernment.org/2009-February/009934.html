I am going to take advantage of my proximity to Washington DC  
(America's hub for non-profits) and tap some of the support  
organizations here to ask their opinions on the feasibility of forming  
a stateless, multinational, web-only, or otherwise cross-national  
organization. If something really good comes along, I'll report back  
here shortly; at the worst, I will prepare a report for the 2/21  
meeting and we can decide what to do then.

Shulze method is very intriguing, but I am not sure how it would apply  
to making assignments to members. From what I can tell, it is a way of  
selecting a winner from a pool of candidates. If we're talking about  
making assignments, it isn't as much a question of picking a winner as  
finding a willing volunteer.

But I do agree that we need to list tasks and assign them to  
individuals. That is in the proposed agenda for the meeting:
