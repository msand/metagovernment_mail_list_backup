<PRE>Hi, I have seen the demo and tried out the prototype. It's really a
pretty good start. I see some overlaps with the work we have done on
www.rule2gether.com , in the sense that r2g users can also create their
proposals (and set a deadline in days between a pre-defined range of
min-max days allowed), other users can support it and comment pro/con,
and if the proposals reach the established threshold (by default 50%+1
supporters) it is automatically moved to the agenda of the next
&quot;council&quot; meeting (labels can be changed to suit other labeling needs)
to be &quot;officially&quot; discussed.

agenda items and proposals dashboard page

We have also implemented some ajax to sort the list of proposals and
make navigation easy when the number of proposals grow:

On dashboard:
ajax sorting on dashboard

On Proposals page:
Ajax sorting by popularity or supporters

We were contacted by the university of rome last week, and we are now in
a phase of preparing the project to submit to the Eu grant (deadline:
april 1st). The project outcome can't be our own software because the
call wasn't issued for that kind of software. But we will apply most of
the functionality thought for it to the proposed app and, as it will be
open source, it can be reused later or adapted. We are using
PHP/Drupal/Jquery now. If you have a feature roadmap and would like to,
I think we could add some features thought for metascore in the project
proposal.

Again, my proposal is to join efforts for common goals. We both have
floss projects, both with pretty much the same mission and vision. We
could only benefit by having a shared architecture, design and
(partially) feature roadmaps. And I mean, not only us and metascore, but
also the other projects represented here in this list... ;-)

cheers,
giovani spagnolo
