In its philosophy and constitution, Metagovernment fundamentally is an  
open ecosystem. The vision of Metagovernment as it has developed is a  
broad mesh of self-defining communities. Governments don't have to be  
restricted to geography, nor to be monolithic. An example I used  
earlier of a cascading series of governments. Imagine a metropolitan  
area government, a park authority of the parks in that metro area, the  
administration of one park, the set of rules governing the tennis  
courts at that park, the rules of a tennis tournament held on those  
courts, and the organizational structure of a team competing in that  
tournament. Each of those is a community with a distinct but  
interrelated governance mechanism.

It is not required that each of those communities use the same  
software, but it is the intention of Metascore to provide a framework  
that each of them could use as their governing principle. In any  
event, it certainly would be helpful if each community used at least  
the same API, and it would be enormously helpful for user identities  
to be portable from one community to another. By starting in those  
smallest of communities (e.g., the tennis team and the tennis  
tournament), it is our intention to scale upward in a way that does  
become a standard... in a completely open way.

The prototype of Metascore that Manuel and team are building is just  
that; a prototype. The final product could be something else entirely.  
The important parts are the basic principles and the lessons learned  
as we develop.
