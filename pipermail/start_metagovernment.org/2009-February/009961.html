That is very much in line with our principle of &quot;geographic  
distinctness within a global community.&quot;
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Basic_principles</A>

The principle fell into dispute not on its own merits but because it  
is based on the idea of user-scoring, which itself is in dispute.

</I>&gt;<i> complement to representative democracy, not necessarily a flat-out
</I>&gt;<i> replacement).
</I>
And that's why we grab for the brass ring and try to dispense with the  
decision makers. I don't see any reason why it should be up to a  
handful of &quot;special&quot; individuals to determine... well, anything.

Although there are notable individual exceptions from time to time,  
the very reliable rule is that &quot;power corrupts.&quot; I think that the best  
way to remove the possibility of corruption is not to make many minor- 
repairs and safeguards to try to counter-balance the natural tendency  
to corruption, but rather to simply, cleanly eliminate any possibility  
of corruption.
