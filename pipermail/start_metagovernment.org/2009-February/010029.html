<PRE>Welcome Gerold,

&gt;<i> I am from Austria and started a page presenting my ideas at 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.opentution.org">http://www.opentution.org</A> which has the same goal as metagovernment. The idea 
</I>&gt;<i> for the platform came after the european constitution got rejected by the 
</I>&gt;<i> french and dutch people four years ago which started a lot of discussion about 
</I>&gt;<i> it. The main complaint at that time was that the constituion was developed 
</I>&gt;<i> with the people excluded. With that I realised that there is actually no 
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to take part in a development process for laws and thought that 
</I>&gt;<i> maybe the use of open source technics in this area could solve that problem.
</I>
You allow competing drafts - variants of a single proposal.  So there
will initially be dissensus.  Are there any mechanisms to afford
(enable and promote) a consensus, on a single draft?

How do you guard against the &quot;bias&quot;, as Tim here decribes it, &quot;towards
those relatively few entries [variants] that manage to gain an early
lead in net votes&quot;?

  <A HREF="http://groups.dowire.org/groups/consult/messages/topic/2IbPilDgy4CLnyMHbSjPLB">http://groups.dowire.org/groups/consult/messages/topic/2IbPilDgy4CLnyMHbSjPLB</A>

In other words, how can a newly introduced idea - a better variant -
climb to the top of the heap?

&gt;<i> My goal now is to implement such a system for austrian politics in the way 
</I>&gt;<i> that people first make proposals independently of the government and then if 
</I>&gt;<i> the proposals are good enough and accepted by a broad band of people from the 
</I>&gt;<i> platform the document will be sent to the government. My hope is that 
</I>&gt;<i> governments accept the proposals because of the good quality this kind of 
</I>&gt;<i> system will produce. Reason comes from the good quality of Wikipedia.
</I>
Votes are maybe the best measure of quality.  If a proposal has a
stable consensus - stable, mind - then politicians are going to pay
attention.

Can you point to design/theory docs, if any are posted?

Best,
--
