That's two of us, and counting...

I'm thinking it may turn out to mesh with your own priorities.  I read
your minutes.  At the top of the agenda was (a) a formal structure for
your project, and (b) concerns about technical progress.

(a) You want a formal structure, because you want donors etc. to take
the project seriously.  The mesh here is that a standards framework is
a kind of formal structure, and so are its products.  Being party to
them, and especially helping to develop them, will impress outsiders
looking at the project for the first time, and wondering whether to
take it seriously.

(b) With respect to progress: At first, open standards will not speed
development.  Rather, to the extent we engage with them, they'll
actually slow down the code production.  But each project can choose
its own comfort level.  And code production is a pretty poor yardstick
of progress, anyway.  Maybe only 2% of all code will survive the final
cut (especially if unrestrained competition is the rule).

So standards can be an initial brake on coding.  But they're actually
a better investment.  They create a longer-lived technology that
extends like a safety net beneath the code.  Both the standards and
the working relationships that go into developing them are long term
investments that are likely to outlive any single project.  That's not
an argument that would appeal to a VC, who is probably uninterested in
financing a portion of the commons.  But it will appeal to a
non-profit foundation.  It will also appeal to open-source developers
and other talented contributors.

If anyone else is interested in seeding this, here's a stab at the
prerequisites.  This is to develop an open framework for proposing and
tracking standards (it might be a first, even the IETF wasn't *this*
radically open):

  1. Technical XML and RDF.  This is for the design of the distributed
     compliance records (distributed among the projects).  Also for
     specifying the Wiki requirements, and the format of the master
     lists (projects and standards).

  2. Technical scripting of the query engine.  The engine will
     assemble the compliance records, and run the queries.

  3. Management.  A project manager to help smooth out the bumps, and
     bring in resources.  We'll need a couple of pages on a neutral
     Wiki, for the master lists.  We may also need a bit of a
     promotion lift.

    (The plan may change.  It hasn't yet been researched.  And other
     ideas may be proposed...)

An alpha would take roughly 2 man-weeks of effort.  I can do (1) or
(2), and bring in Votorola.  We need at least one other project that
has running code.  Who else can commit?
