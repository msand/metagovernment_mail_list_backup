So they are moral principles?  Of course... if they were instead
principles of practical success, then it would be the &quot;killer app&quot;
that validated *them*.  (Moral principles are independent of practical
success.  We hope the reverse is not also true, but we fear that it
may be.)

Of course, we needn't actually wait for a &quot;killer app&quot; to arise before
we evaluate it.  The evaluation is an urgent one, because the
application would necessarily transform society.  So we ought to be
proactive about it.

It turns out, however, that moral principles alone are insufficient
for a forward look.  We must also evaluate principles of practical
success.  To understand why, see here, where we lay out the principles
of success for a particular class of &quot;killer app&quot;:

  <A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024194.html">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024194.html</A>

  IT(a) - authenticates voters as real people (no robots);
  IT(c) - affords a consensus that neither suppresses dissent,
          nor is unnecessarily fragmented by it;
  IT(p) - allows voters to openly propose the issue and options,
          not just to vote on them;
  IT(r) - restricts votes to those affected by the issue, such as
          local residents;
  IT(s) - enforces a single vote per person (no sock puppets).

We then ask these questions, in priority order:

  (1) Are these principles sufficient for a &quot;killer app&quot;?  Is the
      practice likely to transform society?

  (2) What are the expected consequences of the transformation?  What
      good?  What evil?

Obviously, (2) is the moral question.  At first we tried to answer it
point blank, but the attempt was premature.  We kept getting confused
between practical and moral questions, and falling back to the former:

  <A HREF="http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024158.html">http://lists.electorama.com/pipermail/election-methods-electorama.com/2009-February/024158.html</A>

So we backtracked to (1), and went on to offer a &quot;proof&quot; that
IT(a,c,p,r,s) is a probable recipe for success.  That proof is still
being argued, but already it's given us a better idea of the shape of
transformation that we can expect in society - the shape of a
&quot;killing&quot;, in the Kubrikian sense - and what its benefits/dangers
might be.

What do you think of this approach to practical/moral evaluation?  Do
you see how it relates to your own principles?

&gt;<i> I will say this: it is my fervent hope that the &quot;killer app&quot; will be
</I>&gt;<i> less of an implementation and more of a set of standards backed by
</I>&gt;<i> implementations (plural)...
</I>
I'm also keen on the &quot;ecosystem&quot; concept.  If there's some way you can
share your designs, thoughts, etc., I'd like to put them to practical
use.  It's no fun, being an ecosystem of one. :)

&gt;<i> &gt; If not, then what is the practical obstacle, do you think?  Why has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the &quot;killer app&quot; not been coded?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps it exists but hasn't reached critical mass yet to get on
</I>&gt;<i> anyone's radar. Perhaps the folk who might implement it were focused in
</I>&gt;<i> recent years on other applications (e.g., stuff for the US Presidential
</I>&gt;<i> election). Perhaps they're all off building those flying cars we all
</I>&gt;<i> have been waiting for. ;-)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In other words, I can cook up a bunch of theories for why it doesn't yet
</I>&gt;<i> exist, and those theories would all be merely wild guesses.
</I>
Or you might have an answer.  The answer for one class of application
is IT(c).  IT(c) has always been a show stopper.
