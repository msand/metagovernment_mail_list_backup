<PRE>This group has expanded significantly since our beginning (63 list  
members) and it seems it would be useful to hold another meeting where  
we can work through some issues and start accelerating some aspects of  
the project.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/2">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/2</A>

I propose February 21 at 16:00 GMT (see page for time translation).  
Feel free to comment here or on that page's Talk page if you think it  
should be a different date and/or if you really want to attend but  
can't make it on that date.

If you don't have an active role in the project, and even if you do  
not want to be active, you are still encouraged to &quot;attend&quot; the  
meeting. If nothing else, you can get a better sense of the people in  
the project, and perhaps you can introduce yourself. Also, as far as I  
know, nobody in this project has met anyone else in the project (with  
the obvious exception of Manuel and Fabian), so by lurking you may  
find that another member lives near you and then you may wish to meet  
with them.

I would also like to specifically encourage the members of other  
projects to attend. If you all attend (and if we also invite members  
of yet other projects) we could use the second half of the meeting as  
a global coordination project among our various groups to get some  
real momentum behind this movement. Alternately, we could arrange a  
separate meeting for this coordination process.
