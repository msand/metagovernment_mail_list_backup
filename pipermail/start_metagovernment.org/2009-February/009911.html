<PRE>Another option, though not one that would be particularly helpful for the
FP7 proposal process, would be to piggy-back on the existing 501(c
&lt;<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c</A>)#501.28c.29.283.29&gt; )(3) organization
DemocracyLab has established.  Our mission has evolved from building the
software we've envisioned (ready for tire kicking any day now) to being a
laboratory for experimentation with different forms of e-democracy.
 
The advantage would be not having to go through the moderate hassle and
expense of establishing a new organization.
 
The drawback would be trusting a bunch of strangers in Portland Oregon who
serve on the board of directors to promote Metagovernment's interests.
 
I doubt this is an alternative this group will find desirable, but I thought
I'd mention it.  If there is interest in pursuing this idea I would need to
bring it up at DemocracyLab's next board meeting in a couple of weeks.
 
Best of luck,
Mark

Well, I don't know... this is just an idea, let me know what do you
think....
To bid under FP7, the partners need to form a formal consortium before
presenting the proposal. That might be a good reason to transform
metagovernment in a formal org. Of course, as long as the goals converge
(create a base floss framework and api's on top of which others can build
web2/3 e-democracy, consensus building, decision-making apps, etc)...

We are currently working like this: partners initially interested in
participating sign a letter of intent, then join a discussion list to
present their goals, role and expected outcomes from the project. We write
the project together. Approve it and at the same time sign the formal
consortium. The consortium must be formed by any EU
public/private/non-profit organizations (at least 4 different EU countries
to have a chance).

Grants range from 100k-1MM euros, depending on size of partners and project
scope.
Again, using metagovernment as the consortium is just an idea, in fact I
just hadn't the time to think about any possibile consequences... feedback
is welcome.

While Manuel and think a formal organisation is of great value, we would
prefer to make those decisions with metascore itself. Although the current
build is far from perfect we are close to usable version. We are also
planning to do another coding sprint around about mid april.
 
As long as there is consensus on the mailing list, we could make the
decision on the mailing list/wiki, but using metascore would have an added
symbolic bonus.

Again at this point we'd like to call out to any developers, to participate.
Especially the user interface could use some work. If you're a
html/css/javascript pro we could certainly use your expertise. We've also
made some effort recently to make sure the install process is easier,
(as long as your running a ubuntu/debian-unstable box). If you don't
have that kind of setup, you'll probably best be served with something
like virtualbox.

Agree. This is something that will cost a lot of money and a lot of combined
efforts.
 
If money is a concern, then perhaps it is time to revisit the question of
creating a formal organization. I have noticed that foundations and other
funding entities are not willing to take us very seriously, because from
their point of view it is difficult to even imagine supporting a
chaotic-seeming adhocracy with no mailing address and no single point of
contact.
 
I have outlined the relevant questions and issues here:

so please have a look, then contribute to that page and/or comment in reply
