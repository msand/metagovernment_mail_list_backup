 From what I can tell, we meet all of these standards rather  
readily... at least in theory. However, this system is structured  
around the maintaining of authorities and simple votes, so in that  
sense we transcend it.

The one point with which I have an issue is his third: Standing; e.g.,  
requiring residency in order to vote on an issue of local importance.

While I think geographic standing is a weighting factor, I do not  
think it is at all good to exclude people because they do not meet a  
geographic requirement. As I have mentioned before, locality is often  
a false indication of interest/standing. For example, everyone  
downstream of a city has an interest in the water-diverting industries  
of that city. Or everyone in the world may have an interest in a  
country's decision which affects the survival of an endangered species.

I think it is much more honest (and easy!) to simply say that anyone  
who wants to participate in an issue has a standing in it. Otherwise,  
why would they want to participate?
