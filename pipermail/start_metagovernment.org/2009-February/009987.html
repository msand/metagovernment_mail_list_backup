If we leave it up to entrenched decision-makers to decide what they  
will listen to, then it is possible for there to be an entrenched  
monopoly. They can choose MicrosoftVotes because it gives them the  
most flexibility to do what they want to get away with in our  
government. And they can choose to ignore any input from other  
mechanisms.

In this regard, Metagovernment is certainly distinguished by its  
intent to supersede decision-makers by making them obsolete.  
Theoretically, other tools could start out as advisory and then grow  
into full governance mechanisms, but MG is working from the very  
outset on the idea that individuals should not have the power of  
decision-making for the community. This means our initial approached  
all of our architecture is built around bringing consensus out of  
conflict in such a manner that end decisions can be reached by the  
crowd.

</I>
Again, that fairly-well describes this organization. Everything this  
project does is publicly archived; anyone may join; most everyone uses  
their real name. There is nothing hidden and no one excluded. Sounds  
pretty transparent.

But I do agree that it would be great to have a larger API where other  
views can interoperate. This project certainly has the right name (ie,  
&quot;meta&quot;) to enable that. If you want some server space or something to  
work on it, I'm sure we can help.

I am busy today and honestly haven't had time to read through your  
entire explanation. But FWIW, from this group session at Transparency  
camp, I hope to get a meta-organization of electronic democracy groups  
going, at least as a separate list server if not more.
