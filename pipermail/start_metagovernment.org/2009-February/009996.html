<PRE>Hey Ed,

I'm in the #metascore channel in IRC, and I'm the only one there.&#160; I must have done something wrong...

Subject:&#160;[Start] Second Meeting: February 21
Reply-To:&#160;Metagovernment Startup Committee &lt;<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/mailman/listinfo/start_metagovernment.org">start at metagovernment.org</A>&gt;

This group has expanded significantly since our beginning (63 list members) and it seems it would be useful to hold another meeting where we can work through some issues and start accelerating some aspects of the project.
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/2">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Startup/Meetings/2</A>

I propose February 21 at 16:00 GMT (see page for time translation). Feel free to comment here or on that page's Talk page if you think it should be a different date and/or if you really want to attend but can't make it on that date.

If you don't have an active role in the project, and even if you do not want to be active, you are still encouraged to &quot;attend&quot; the meeting. If nothing else, you can get a better sense of the people in the project, and perhaps you can introduce yourself. Also, as far as I know, nobody in this project has met anyone else in the project (with the obvious exception of Manuel and Fabian), so by lurking you may find that another member lives near you and then you may wish to meet with them.

I would also like to specifically encourage the members of other projects to attend. If you all attend (and if we also invite members of yet other projects) we could use the second half of the meeting as a global coordination project among our various groups to get some real momentum behind this movement. Alternately, we could arrange a separate meeting for this coordination process.
