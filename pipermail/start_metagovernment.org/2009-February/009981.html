The following is a substantial excerpt from an email I sent last year to
a prominent technologist -- I think he's attending TransparencyCamp.
It's stream-of-consciousness, heavy on the tech, and not exactly
well-edited. But, since I don't have time right now to answer some of
your other questions (though I hope too...sometime...), I figured this
would help explain a bit.

And since the acronym didn't completely catch on, POSH is Plain Ol'
Semantic HTML (see the work of Chris Messina).

=====================

If we want an independent, verifiable, public mechanism for people to
vote and comment on the topics of the day and get those compiled results
to decision-makers, our best model is the blogosphere, by which I mean a
loose confederation of sites and services, operating on agreed-upon
standards.

This is a system of issues (&quot;When should our troops leave Iraq?&quot;) an
positions taken by citizens on those issues.

John Q. Citizen can raise an issue by posting a Web page marked up in a
POSH format, providing the title and description of the issue, the
community to which it applies (San Francisco, or San Mateo County, or
CA, or USA, or such-and-so school board, etc.), the choices voters can
choose from, and how those choices are scored (multiple choice,
allocate-100-points-among-them-budget-style, etc.). Of course, that Web
page is probably built by a blog-style editor (online or off), or a
widget, or a F8/OpenSocial app, or whatever. And, the system could
support pure XML or JSON as well.

Also in the issue is embedded John's OpenID (unless he's posting it
anonymously) and a service provider URL, the latter indicating where one
can go to find the results of the voting. This could be integrated with
the tools that were used to create the issue (e.g., WordPress) or be
something independent (e.g., Disqus).

The issue is put out in a feed, and cross-posted to blogs, publicized
via banners and widgets, fed to search engines, and all the typical Web
promotion stuff. This gets the issue into the hands of other interested
citizens, particularly those citizens of the community referenced in the
issue. Anybody can cast their vote on the issue, again by publishing a
POSH-enhanced Web page. The vote is at minimum their vote (given the
choices and scoring system) and their OpenID (unless anonymous), with
hooks for adding more material for them to defend their position if they
choose (e.g., link to blog posting, links to references of studies or
analyses)

Then, with a trackback/ping type of mechanism, the issue's service
provider is notified of the new/changed position, which adds it to the
roster of results and adds the score to the running tally, This in turn
can update widgets, banners, etc. showing the current issue status.

Results can be filtered by standing, so there's one tally for all
respondents, a tally for the non-anonymous subset, a tally for those
whose OpenIDs are verified as being members of the community of
relevance for the issue, etc. The latter subset, of course, is the one
of key importance for any politician or other authority figure, since
they'll primarily care what the people who elected them think.

In the end, it's a standard for encoding issues and positions, plus the
Web service APIs for the trackbacks, plus the encoding of results, and a
few other things. That spec won't be short, but it won't be too tough to
implement -- it's all REST-ish simple Web services, simple encoding
conventions, and OpenID. It's not like it needs a new wire protocol or
encryption scheme or anything. And I can probably be talked out of the
OpenID requirement if there's some other scheme for truly globally
unique user IDs.

Everything after that is a matter of an ecosystem of firms and
non-profits providing services around that standard:

-- tools to raise issues and take positions, with the latter in
particular being multi-modal (Internet, SMS, IVR, wandering canvasser
with an Internet tablet, etc.)
-- tools to keep the authorities associated with the community informed
of public opinion by whatever means they're comfortable with (Web, fax,
snail mail, etc.)
-- services to help promote issues to gain more positions
-- tools to help rate issues and positions, to help people filter out
trolls and the like
-- tools to help smaller municipalities interested in this stuff
integrate it into their own Web presence, to the extent they have one
-- and so forth

The information model (issues, positions, communities, and citizens)
should work for any size community. By keeping everything public and
CC-licensed, with open source reference implementations and the like,
there should be no real limit to the ecosystem that could emerge, just
like the ecosystem of blog-related firms.

The open standards also help reduce the odds of any one firm dominating
the &quot;market&quot;, and even if one does, it'll make it harder to cook the
books and claim the public thinks X when it really thinks Y, since the
results can be validated. Similarly, it's rather difficult for any
government to shut it down -- they can ignore it, but the citizens may
eventually get pissed at that and choose to elect folk who promise to
pay attention.

It avoids the one-sided-ness of petitions, the lack of standing from Web
polls, and the lack of countability of opinions posted in blogs or sent
by email. And, it doesn't require government permission, though
government interest (and, therefore, promotion) would certainly be useful.
