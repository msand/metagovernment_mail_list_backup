</I>Agree. This is something that will cost a lot of money and a lot of
combined efforts.

&gt;<i> What is your opinion about the prototype so far?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>I couldn't figure out exactly how to &quot;register&quot; to use it and where to
go to interact... Is there a &quot;quick startup guide&quot; somewhere ?

&gt;<i> Have you started writing the proposal to EU FP7. I'm not sure what the
</I>&gt;<i> process there is, but I would like to start contributing, if we can
</I>&gt;<i> agree on the goals.
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>Unfortunately we are still looking for more partners before writing the
plan. To bid here in EU (or, aham... to have any chance of winning the
bid...) you need at least 4 partners (formal institutions and or
companies) from different EU countries. So far we are 2 in Italy and one
in Germany. Seems that a few people in this area is willing to &quot;join&quot;
efforts to build something in common. While the &quot;goal&quot; might be the
same, seems to me that people is inflexible about the &quot;means&quot; to get
there. Such a pity because in my opinion the Free Software lacks the
base platform on the top of which one can then build customized
e-democracy, consensus building and decision-making web applications.
I appreciate your interest, we can absolutely work together to discuss
the scope of the proposal. Is this list the best place?
