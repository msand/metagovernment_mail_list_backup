While Manuel and think a formal organisation is of great value, we would
prefer to make those decisions with metascore itself. Although the current
build is far from perfect we are close to usable version. We are also
planning to do another coding sprint around about mid april.

As long as there is consensus on the mailing list, we could make the
decision on the mailing list/wiki, but using metascore would have an added
symbolic bonus.

Again at this point we'd like to call out to any developers, to participate.
Especially the user interface could use some work. If you're a
html/css/javascript pro we could certainly use your expertise. We've also
made some effort recently to make sure the install process is easier,
(as long as your running a ubuntu/debian-unstable box). If you don't
have that kind of setup, you'll probably best be served with something
like virtualbox.
