<PRE>Early on, this project made a distinction between leaders and  
authorities. So I suppose there is nothing other than my full schedule  
stopping me (or anyone else!) from taking on leadership functions as  
long as there is no singular authority behind them.

That said, I don't know if I am really an appropriate leader nor if  
anyone else here is looking for any sort of leadership. Nonetheless,  
there is one simple thing I can do right away, which I have been  
considering anyway. That is to propose a second meeting where we can  
hammer out this and other issues. So... see next e-mail.

In informal English, this terminology has rather negative  
implications. :)

But yes, I agree that even if I take a more prominent role now, I (or  
any individual) should not be held forth as the project's figurehead.  
I was happy to speak on our behalf in Prague, and would love to  
continue giving such lectures, as long as it is understood that I am  
at most a spokesperson/advocate.
