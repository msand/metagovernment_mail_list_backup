Since it relates directly to work done in metagovernment
I repost it here for clarity and transparency.




Dear all,
Few days ago we had a chat meeting with the metagovernment group
(members? gang?).
I presented my affiliation to this project and offered to be the
interface with them, since I was de facto bringing on ideas that were
being developed with them. There was some interest and we agreed that
I would have started writing up some ideas on the metagovernment wiki.
This page should sum up the metagovernent position, and (more
relevantly to this discussion) present ideas that can be used in our
proposal. The page is work in progress, still since some of you are
writing up some ideas, I invite you all to read them here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7</A>

The inter-community distributed idea was something that was presented
in this very list. A similar idea was also presented in
metagovernment, as having various versions of the whole community
being present. I am personally not an expert on the topic and I only
list it there to differentiate respect to the -Intercommunity-
distribution system. That is the software technology that would define
the comunications between different instances of the software, used by
different communities.
I think the two problems (intercommunity comunication and
intracommunity comunication) are ultimately linked. At the most
granular level we are dealing with a set of objects, each object is an

&quot;action&quot; that a user does in a community

And the possible actions will be like: (1) presenting a proposal, &#160;(2)
voting for a proposal, (3) tagging a proposal, (4) commenting a
proposal.

We then have to handle how does the information (proposals, votes,
tags and comments) spread inside a community, and between communities.

Please also note the work on Tags, and the &quot;Developing the theory of a
sophisticated scoring system&quot; which was suggested by one of our
members Matias Battocchia.

Please let me know what you think of all this, and how can we move forward.
I shall stay in Rome on the first week of March.

Regards,
Pietro
