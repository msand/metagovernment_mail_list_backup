<PRE>I agree with a lot of what you say, Robert, and I appreciate the  
sentiment. But in some senses what you are asking is that we put the  
cart before the horse.

I now agree with Manuel and Pietro that we need working code *before*  
we try to take other parts of the project much further. After all,  
whenever anyone asks one of the many different questions I get  
frequently asked, my answer always has to be: &quot;well, we need to  
release the code into the wild and see what people do with it.&quot; That  
after all, is our development strategy: not to replace the government  
of the United States, but rather to make a beta of governance software  
for a chess club. That approach has a much, much better chance of  
replacing the United States (and every other) government than a direct  
approach. If you investigate how some of the Related Projects are  
doing, the ones that target national governments, you will find that  
they aren't making much progress.

Same sort of reasoning goes for working with other organizations or  
getting funding. If they bother to answer at all (and I can't get  
people like Tim O'Reilly to even acknowledge me), their first question  
is about what the code looks like. Without a running copy of  
Metascore, we are all talk and no action. Even if we had an article  
published in the New York Times, we still wouldn't have anything to  
show for it... just more people talking. What we need is something  
concrete. So if you can code, I beg you to help.

As for leadership, I do not accept the notion that I am the project  
leader. It would be counter to the idea of open source governance for  
me to have even the slightest bit of authority within the project. I  
do however, work quite a bit to promote the project, and again, can't  
get very far without having something concrete to show people. I also  
repeatedly ask this group to please contribute more, particularly in  
coding:

Seeing as we are an all-volunteer, open source adhocracy, there is  
only so much I can do to get people to participate. This page is a  
standing call for assistance:
<A HREF="http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate">http://www.metagovernment.org/wiki/Participate</A>
and I urge everyone in the project to please do at least one thing in  
that list. Most particularly, helping with any aspect of the code  
development.

&gt;<i> Dear MetaGovernment,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have a feeling MetaGovernment could be the most important thing I  
</I>&gt;<i> am ever involved with, and I believe many others on this list feel  
</I>&gt;<i> the same.  It is because of this great sense of importance that the  
</I>&gt;<i> lack of progress makes me frustrated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is anyone familiar with the television show Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen  
</I>&gt;<i> Nightmares?  In each episode he attempts to rejuvenate a different  
</I>&gt;<i> struggling restaurant.  And every time, the beginning of the  
</I>&gt;<i> solution is for the owner/chef to swallow their pride and agree that  
</I>&gt;<i> they need to change.  The time has come for us to change.  We write  
</I>&gt;<i> long, glorious emails about democracy and government, but no one  
</I>&gt;<i> does anything.  We're bragging about our lasagna, but none of us  
</I>&gt;<i> knows how to cook, and we're not sure where the kitchen is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ed?  I'm calling you out.  Like it or not, you're our leader.  But  
</I>&gt;<i> there has been no leadership.  Doesn't MetaGovernment make you sweat  
</I>&gt;<i> at night?  Don't you lie there and think about the good we could  
</I>&gt;<i> accomplish, how we could bring happiness to so many people, to  
</I>&gt;<i> increase the standard of living of the world, bring peace and  
</I>&gt;<i> justice to humanity, until you're vibrating?  Doesn't it make you  
</I>&gt;<i> tremble to think about what MetaGovernment could do when you read  
</I>&gt;<i> about all the wars and rebellions and atrocities that could be  
</I>&gt;<i> stopped if people would only talk to each other?  Doesn't it make  
</I>&gt;<i> you seethe when corporations abuse the third world because their  
</I>&gt;<i> governments are corrupt?  Doesn't it make you stare at the ceiling  
</I>&gt;<i> unable to sleep because you're so filled with rage that we haven't  
</I>&gt;<i> got a better way?  Don't you press back against the panic that  
</I>&gt;<i> closes in when you read about governments clamping down on the free  
</I>&gt;<i> exchange of information?  Doesn't the hope that MetaGovernment will  
</I>&gt;<i> succeed allow you to finally go to sleep?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then fucking show it!  We need you to lead us.  We look to you, Ed.   
</I>&gt;<i> Make it happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Has anyone on this mailing list who is not a coder ever done  
</I>&gt;<i> anything to advance the purposes of MetaGovernment?  Has anyone on  
</I>&gt;<i> this mailing list ever bothered to compile a list of things that non- 
</I>&gt;<i> coders can do, and then assigned people to do these things?  Why not?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And there is lots we could do.  I think the most important thing is  
</I>&gt;<i> to hire a part-time administrator.  It's surprising what an  
</I>&gt;<i> administrator can accomplish.  They could book speaking engagements,  
</I>&gt;<i> interviews, garner publicity, triage communication.  We could hire a  
</I>&gt;<i> coder to work full time on MetaScore.  How would we pay for this?  I  
</I>&gt;<i> don't know, but have we tried government grants?  Subscriptions?   
</I>&gt;<i> Philanthropists?  NGOs?  We could write presentations, start  
</I>&gt;<i> projects, raise awareness.  We have no idea what could happen,  
</I>&gt;<i> because we haven't tried any of it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a coder.  I develop full-time in Django and Python and CSS and  
</I>&gt;<i> HTML and Javascript.  But I'm not getting involved.  I don't have  
</I>&gt;<i> the time for another pie-in-the-sky dream that some guy told me  
</I>&gt;<i> about on Slashdot one day.  Been there.  Done that.  Oh, I'd love to  
</I>&gt;<i> help.  I really would.  MetaGovernment gives me hope for the future,  
</I>&gt;<i> hope that we can get ourselves straightened out before it's too  
</I>&gt;<i> late.  But it's a joke right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's time to wake up.
