<PRE>Well, I don't know... this is just an idea, let me know what do you
think....
To bid under FP7, the partners need to form a formal consortium before
presenting the proposal. That might be a good reason to transform
metagovernment in a formal org. Of course, as long as the goals converge
(create a base floss framework and api's on top of which others can
build web2/3 e-democracy, consensus building, decision-making apps, etc)...

We are currently working like this: partners initially interested in
participating sign a letter of intent, then join a discussion list to
present their goals, role and expected outcomes from the project. We
write the project together. Approve it and at the same time sign the
formal consortium. The consortium must be formed by any EU
public/private/non-profit organizations (at least 4 different EU
countries to have a chance).

Grants range from 100k-1MM euros, depending on size of partners and
project scope.
Again, using metagovernment as the consortium is just an idea, in fact I
just hadn't the time to think about any possibile consequences...
feedback is welcome.
