<PRE>As we agreed during the chat,
I started writing a wiki page on the FP7.
It is here:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7</A>

At the moment the situation is that I shall collaborate with Giovani
at the FP7 proposal. Since I work for Coimbra University, I will be
bringing another nation (we need 4) to the project. We are planning to
do most of the work on the first week of March. At that time I will be
in Rome, since most of the partners will be there. Somehow I shall
represent metagovernment, and we are trying to
a) produce material that can also be used by metagovernment+
b) since we are not patenting our ideas, but we are interested in
their widest disemination we shall also work in trying to get some of
the MG ideas across, as well as making research to round them off.

YOU ARE ALL invited to go to the wiki and help on that page. In fact
it woul dbe nice if every person could do it, just do something.

In the next days the ideas will get even more clear. The way a EU
project works is that there is a number of partners and a number of
workpackages (WP). In general no WP pertain to a single partner, but
there should be a lot of cross polination. It is common that a WP will
be mostly done by one or two partners with the others helping in in
some ways. SO what we should do now is to brainstorm ideas for what
can the packages produced here in portugal be. It have to be something
that I am confortable with, as I will have to be responsible about it
and supervise the work. But up to now I am confortable with all the
work that have been proposed over here.

ALso there might be the possibility that some other members of MG might join.
What happened to Christoph, for example? That would also be very good.


Looking forward for your input on the FP 7 proposal.
DO it now:
<A HREF="http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7">http://metagovernment.org/wiki/FP7</A>


Cheers,
Pietro

P.S: as those things go, we should try to have as much material as
possible prepared before I go to italy. When that happens, and I work
side by side with the others it will probably practically be
unfeasible to use too much the wiki. So please if you have some input
to give do it now.  I DO want to have everybody's input :-)
